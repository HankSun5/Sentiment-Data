Ethereum Could Be In Danger Of Falling Under Ascending Channel Support In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about where Ethereum could head next based on a pattern forming in its 12-hour price chart. The pattern in question is an Ascending Parallel Channel from TA, which, as its name implies, involves two parallel trendlines that are sloped upwards. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovers To $2,800 As Exchange Outflows Near $1 Billion When the asset is inside this channel, it goes through consolidation towards a net upside. The higher tops in its price trace the upper line of the pattern, while the higher lows draw the lower level. Like other TA patterns, the former line is assumed to act as a source of resistance in the near future and the latter as a point of support. Breaks out of either of these boundaries can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. The Ascending Parallel Channel isn’t the only parallel channel in TA. When parallel consolidation happens towards the downside instead, the formation is known as a Descending Parallel Channel. Neither of these are the most commonly observed type, though, as that title is held by the basic Parallel Channel, which has its trendlines parallel to the time-axis (that is, they have zero slope). Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Ascending Channel that the 12-hour price of Ethereum has been trading inside for the last few years: From the graph, it’s apparent that the Ethereum half-day price saw a very brief retest of the Ascending Channel’s lower level recently. The coin found support then, but its value is still floating quite close to the line, meaning that another retest could potentially happen soon. The level is currently situated at $2,500. During the last few years, this line has continuously held for the cryptocurrency, so it’s possible that it may do so again in the near future. “If Ethereum $ETH holds above $2,500, it could rebound toward $4,000 or even $6,000,” notes Martinez. The former target is around halfway through the channel from the current mark, while the latter corresponds to the upper level. The last time that ETH topped out was near the former line. Related Reading: Chainlink Witnesses Highest Whale Activity Since 2023, Price Reversal Coming? “However, if $2,500 fails as support, the next target shifts to $1,700!” warns the analyst. From the current price of the coin, a crash to this target would mean a decrease of more than 39%. It now remains to be seen whether Ethereum will retest the lower level of the Ascending Channel again in the coming days or not. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $2,800, down more than 6% over the last seven days.

In a new announcement, Binance says it will be adding support for Berachain ( BERA ), an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-identical layer-1 blockchain that uses a proof-of-liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism. “Binance is excited to announce that Berachain will be added to Binance Simple Earn, ‘Buy Crypto,’ Binance Convert, Binance Margin, Binance Auto-Invest, and Binance Futures.” A PoL consensus mechanism rewards validators for providing liquidity to a blockchain’s ecosystem rather than a traditional proof-of-stake (PoS) system, which incentivizes staking tokens. As stated on Berachain’s official webpage, “Proof-of-Liquidity radically changes the way L1 economics are structured, prioritizing users and applications over validator rewards at baseline. Network incentives go towards enriching ecosystem liquidity, contributing to efficient trading, price stability, securing the chain, and increasing the network/user growth. PoL strongly align the incentives of network participants (validators, protocols, users) and contributes to the overall long-term health of the chain.” News of the addition sent BERA flying, as the digital asset went from a February 5th low of $7.85 to a peak of $14.83 a day later, a gain of 89%. BERA has since retraced and is trading for $9.22 at time of writing.

That agency, part of the Indian Finance Ministry, had ordered Bybit’s website to be blocked in the country and imposed a fine after finding in January that the exchange violated anti-money laundering rules. The FIU-IND fined Bybit 92.7 rupees (around $1.1 million) on January 31, saying the exchange engaged in “persistent and continuous” violations of the 2005 Prevention of Money Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules. As a Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider (VDASP), the exchange had reporting obligations, but it had expanded its services in India without registering the new offerings with the FIU-IND. Bybit’s suspension is part of a larger crackdown Bybit suspended all services to Indian users except withdrawals on Jan. 12, citing new and continuing regulatory issues. The suspension even applied to Bybit payment cards in India. The exchange said the suspension would be temporary. The exchange announced its payment of the fine and FIU-IND registration on Feb. 6. It noted that it had applied to the agency to become a registered VDASP in India in June 2024. The FIU-IND cracked down on foreign crypto exchanges in December 2023, alleging they did not observe the agency’s regulations. The exchanges affected included Binance, which was shut out of the country until June, when it paid a $2.2 million fine to the FIU-IND. India’s approach to crypto is evolving The Indian government has shown little enthusiasm for cryptocurrency, imposing strict regulations on the industry and high taxes on profits from digital assets. Part of exchange’s reporting obligations involve taxation. Crypto exchanges themselves are liable to taxation as well. In December, the Finance Ministry declared that domestic and foreign crypto exchanges owe an aggregate 8.24 billion rupees in back taxes. Binance owed the lion’s share of back taxes. A rift within the government came to light in May, when the Securities and Exchange Board of India recommended that government agencies regulate crypto. That position contrasts with the central bank view that retail crypto is a macroeconomic risk. In a February interview with Reuters, Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth said India was reconsidering its stance on cryptocurrency in light of world trends. In any case, India led the world in cryptocurrency adoption in 2023 and 2024, according to the annual Chainalysis survey.

But not all cryptos are created equal. Some projects are proving to be standout picks, combining cutting-edge technology, massive adoption potential, and real-world use cases that could drive rapid growth. Three cryptos currently leading the pack? Qubetics ($TICS) , Astra (ASTR), and Celestia (TIA). Astra (ASTR) is making waves by integrating AI with blockchain, ensuring enhanced automation, compliance, and efficiency in decentralized finance. Celestia (TIA) is tackling blockchain scalability issues with its modular architecture, allowing developers to build high-performance applications on a flexible, independent execution layer. But if you’re looking for the best crypto to join for short-term profits this month, Qubetics ($TICS) takes the crown. With its revolutionary QubeQode IDE, it’s reshaping how developers create smart contracts and interact with blockchain networks. Let’s take a deep dive into why these three cryptos are catching investors’ eyes right now. Qubetics: The Game-Changer in Smart Contract Development For years, blockchain development has been complicated, time-consuming, and expensive. Smart contract coding required deep technical expertise, and interoperability between blockchains was a nightmare. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a project designed to streamline blockchain development through its QubeQode IDE. QubeQode IDE is an intuitive, AI-powered development environment that allows businesses and developers to write, test, and deploy smart contracts seamlessly. Instead of spending weeks or months coding, this tool allows developers to build blockchain applications with greater speed and efficiency, regardless of the network they want to use. For example, a financial platform looking to create cross-chain lending services can do so without struggling with different programming languages or complex integrations. Similarly, gaming platforms can build decentralized economies across multiple blockchains with ease, all thanks to QubeQode IDE’s compatibility and automation. With over 461 million tokens already sold, and more than 18,600 holders participating in the presale, Qubetics is proving to be a massive success before even hitting the open market. The current presale price of $0.0667 per $TICS token is set to increase by 10% in the 21st stage at the weekend, making now the ideal time to get involved. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem that’s removing barriers to blockchain development and adoption. For those looking for short-term profits and long-term growth, Qubetics stands at the top. Astra: AI-Powered Compliance & Automation Blockchain meets artificial intelligence with Astra (ASTR), a crypto that’s making waves for its ability to enhance DeFi automation, compliance, and security. The project is bringing AI-powered automation into finance, security, and risk management, ensuring that blockchain applications can operate more efficiently and comply with global regulations. One of Astra’s biggest breakthroughs is its KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) automation system. Regulatory compliance has been a major headache for blockchain companies, but Astra is solving this by using AI to automate identity verification and fraud detection, making transactions more secure and trustworthy. Picture a decentralized exchange that wants to comply with global regulations without burdening its users with long verification processes. Astra’s system automates these checks in real-time, keeping platforms both secure and user-friendly. With regulatory pressure mounting on the crypto industry, Astra’s ability to streamline compliance while maintaining decentralization makes it a must-watch project. Whether you’re looking at short-term gains or long-term adoption, Astra is proving itself as one of the best cryptos to join for short-term profits this month. Celestia: A Modular Blockchain Built for Scalability Scalability has been a major issue for blockchain networks. As more projects demand high-speed, low-cost transactions, older blockchains struggle to keep up. This is where Celestia (TIA) comes in—its modular blockchain architecture separates consensus from execution, allowing developers to build high-performance applications with maximum flexibility. Traditional blockchains like Ethereum handle everything on a single layer, making them slower and more expensive as traffic increases. Celestia fixes this by letting developers run their own execution environments, meaning they can process transactions and smart contracts without congestion from other applications. For example, a logistics company using blockchain for supply chain tracking can create a dedicated execution layer that processes thousands of transactions per second, independent of other applications. This ensures fast, scalable, and cost-effective blockchain adoption. With Celestia gaining traction as one of the most efficient and scalable blockchain solutions, it’s no surprise that investors are eyeing it for short-term profits and long-term innovation. Whether it’s used for DeFi, NFTs, or enterprise applications, Celestia is proving itself as one of the best cryptos to join for short-term profits this month. Conclusion Finding the best cryptos to join for short-term profits this month requires looking beyond hype and focusing on real-world applications, adoption potential, and innovation. Among the top contenders, Qubetics, Astra, and Celestia offer massive opportunities for both short-term traders and long-term investors. Qubetics ($TICS) is changing blockchain development with QubeQode IDE, simplifying smart contract creation and expanding cross-chain capabilities. Astra (ASTR) is leading AI-driven blockchain automation, ensuring fast, secure, and compliant decentralized transactions. Celestia (TIA) is revolutionizing blockchain scalability, offering a modular solution for high-performance applications. For those seeking short-term gains with long-term potential, Qubetics is the standout pick. Its strong presale numbers, cutting-edge technology, and growing ecosystem make it a must-watch crypto in February 2025.

Analyst Eye Potential 306X Surge,https://coingape.com/will-dogecoin-price-rally-to-20-analyst-eye-potential-306x-surge/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) price has gained attention following recent price analyses indicating a potential surge. Analysts suggest that if DOGE maintains a critical support level, it could see a significant rally. The cryptocurrency has shown resilience, remaining within an ascending channel, which could indicate further upward movement. Could Dogecoin Price Hit $20 in the Next Bull Run? Analyst Javon Marks has shared insights on Dogecoin price, suggesting that its historical market cycles indicate the potential for a substantial rally. Marks referenced previous cycles where DOGE experienced exponential growth, with a 90X increase in 2017 and a surge exceeding 306X in 2021. He noted that each bullish phase outperformed the previous one, supporting the possibility of an even larger price jump in the next cycle. His analysis projects that if DOGE follows the same pattern, it could experience another massive rally, surpassing its previous all-time high. Marks highlighted that DOGE demonstrated a repeating trend of accumulation and breakout phases. He suggested that if this trend holds, DOGE could achieve a crypto rally exceeding 306X, pushing its price beyond $20. Source: X More so, Marks’ analysis points to the possibility of continued expansion, with the cryptocurrency following its previous performance trajectory. Similarly, a recent CoinGape report highlighted the crypto rally, emphasizing Dogecoin price movements aligning with past market cycles. If the top meme coin price structure follows the 2017 trend, the DOGE price could be on track for a new all-time high. However, breaking through the key resistance level at $0.30 remains crucial for sustained upward momentum. DOGE Must Hold Above $0.19 to Sustain Momentum Analyst Ali Martinez provided a separate technical perspective on Dogecoin price, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a key support level. According to his analysis, DOGE must remain above $0.19 to retain its bullish setup. If this level holds, the meme coin could see a crypto rally targeting a potential rise toward $10. Martinez’s chart illustrates an ascending price channel, showing that DOGE has historically followed a structured upward trend. He identified multiple resistance and support zones, suggesting that the asset could continue its upward momentum. His analysis indicates that breaking below $0.19 could weaken the bullish outlook, while sustained price action above this level may drive further gains. Source: X Top Meme Coin Price Action Both analysts present scenarios where Dogecoin price could see notable gains. Marks’ projection points to the possibility of the meme coin surpassing $20 if it follows its historical market cycles. Meanwhile, Martinez’s technical analysis suggests that maintaining a key support level could lead to a parabolic rise toward $10. However, despite the bullish projections, Dogecoin (DOGE) price has experienced a 14% decline in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.002134. Market data shows that the meme coin trading volume surged by 64.53% to $6.37 million, indicating heightened activity. On the positive, DOGE whales have been buying aggressively, accumulating 750 million tokens amid the recent price drop to $0.2. This large-scale accumulation suggests strong investor confidence and a potential rebound in Dogecoin price. The post Will Dogecoin Price Rally To $20?

Pectra upgrade to enhance wallet functionality, staking limits, and network efficiency. Fusaka upgrade plans include encrypted mempools and improved transaction tracking tools. Ethereum appears ready for a major move, with analysts watching closely for a breakout above $4,000—a key level for further gains. Ali Martinez predicts that if Ethereum breaks through resistance, it might climb to $7,400, $10,000, or even $14,000. The price currently hovers around $2,705.34 , reflecting a 2.36% drop in the last 24 hours. Support is found at $1,850, while resistance at $4,000 stands as a major barrier.

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1.5 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1.5 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN.

The regulatory agency acknowledged the proposal in a Thursday filing, inviting public comments within 21 days of its publication in the Federal Register. BlackRock’s Proposal for Bitcoin ETF In-Kind Redemptions According to an X post by ETF Store President Nate Geraci, the US SEC is evaluating whether to approve in-kind redemptions for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF which recently expanded to Europe . The Nasdaq submitted an amended 19b-4 filing on behalf of BlackRock, requesting this change for the iShares Bitcoin Trust. The SEC had previously required cash redemptions for Bitcoin ETFs when it approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Under the current model, when an investor redeems shares, the issuer sells Bitcoin and distributes cash to the investor. BlackRock’s proposal would instead allow authorized participants (APs) to receive Bitcoin directly rather than cash. Potential Benefits of In-Kind Redemptions If approved, in-kind redemptions could provide advantages for institutional investors by reducing transaction costs and improving market liquidity. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that this change would not apply to retail investors, as only APs—typically large financial institutions—would be allowed to redeem shares in Bitcoin. Shifting from cash-based redemptions to in-kind transactions could also help avoid forced Bitcoin sales, which might reduce downward price pressure on the asset. This process would make Bitcoin ETFs function more like traditional commodity ETFs, such as those for gold. Regulatory Shift in Bitcoin ETF Policies The SEC’s decision to consider in-kind redemptions marks a shift from its earlier position. When the agency initially approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, it favored a cash model due to concerns about market manipulation and volatility. However, with growing institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs, the regulatory stance appears to be evolving. BlackRock’s request comes amid broader changes in the crypto investment landscape. In August 2023, Grayscale Investments won a lawsuit against the SEC, forcing the regulator to review its rejection of Grayscale’s attempt to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF. This legal victory contributed to the eventual approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Meanwhile, amid the cooling off of the crypto regulations, the CBOE BZX Exchange has also filed 19b-4 applications for XRP ETFs with the SEC on behalf of Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and WisdomTree.

The firms demand the immediate removal of tokens that misuse their names, logos, and intellectual property. Burwick Law Accuses Pump.Fun of Ignoring IP Violations In a statement released on social networking platform X, Burwick Law asserts that Pump.Fun has the technical ability to remove these tokens but has opted not to act despite the potential risks to the public. The law firms argue that Pump.Fun has allowed third parties to create these tokens to “intimidate” their clients and undermine ongoing legal actions. Unfortunately, hundreds of memecoins that mimic or mock Burwick and Wolf Popper remain active on the platform, raising concerns about Pump.Fun’s commitment to addressing intellectual property violations. Pump.Fun Faces Legal Heat Over Alleged Deceptive Practices It worth noting that the cease-and-desist letter follows a proposed class-action lawsuit filed by Burwick Law and Wolf Popper on January 30. The lawsuit, filed by memecoin investor Diego Aguilar in the Southern District of New York, alleges that Pump.Fun promotes tokens with Ponzi-like characteristics targeting younger, less affluent investors. The plaintiff alleges that he incurred significant losses after investing in three memecoins—FRED, FWOG, and GRIFFAIN—created via Pump.Fun, which he claims were marketed as having the potential for exponential returns. Dogshit2 Token Surges Amid Legal Drama Meanwhile, Dogshit2, one of the memecoins linked to the lawsuit, hit a $23 million market cap on Monday. Recent data from CoinGecko shows that Dogshit2 has seen a massive rise, with its trading volume increasing by over 1000 percent in the past 24 hours, pushing its market capitalization to $8.7 billion—a 242 percent increase. Despite its sudden popularity, Dogshit2 has not been absorbed in the linked lawsuit as it continues to face accusations of being part of a “high-risk pump-and-dump” scheme. Burwick Law has firmly denied any connection to the token to distance itself from further controversy, stating that neither it nor Wolf Popper has launched or endorsed any memecoins. The firm also dismissed claims that a blockchain address linked to Dogshit2 appears in their legal documents, calling such allegations “completely false.” Incidentally, these class actions come just days after Donald Trump’s self-named memecoin, TRUMP, experienced a sharp decline, losing 44% of its value since its peak of $73.43 in January.

Plot Twist: Investing Now Could Yield Massive Returns,https://thecoinrise.com/best-presale-crypto-projects-to-consider-now-plot-twist-investing-now-could-yield-massive-returns/,"Crypto presales are often a straightforward and lucrative investment route. You invest early at a low price and, if the project is successful, you could end up with an asset significantly more valuable than your initial payment. Historical data confirms this: numerous projects, like Ethereum during its early days, sold tokens at prices much lower than their later worth. However, not every presale is the same, and understanding a project’s vision and functionality is crucial for identifying true opportunities from potential flops. Here we present the top four ICOs currently on the market. While they all look promising, only one could be your ticket to substantial financial gains. Keep reading to discover which is the best crypto presale to consider now! 1. Web3Bay: Most Demanded Web3 Crypto! Ever hoped that online shopping could empower users instead of big companies? Web3Bay (3BAY) is turning this idea into reality. Moving away from traditional e-commerce giants, Web3Bay leverages blockchain technology for a decentralized marketplace that offers safer and more beneficial transactions. At the heart of Web3Bay’s approach are smart contracts—automated agreements that promote total fairness and remove the necessity for intermediaries. This eliminates hidden fees, privacy worries, and central control. Unique to Web3Bay is its community governance system, where 3BAY token holders can propose and vote on important decisions, directing the platform’s trajectory. The excitement around Web3Bay’s presale is noticeable, with over $1 million raised and more than 280 million tokens distributed. With the current price at $0.004562625 in Stage 4 and an expected launch price of $0.1959, early investors could see a return of approximately 4,200%. Web3Bay’s innovative vision for e-commerce and significant potential for returns makes it the best presale crypto project . 2. Dive into Gains with The Last Dwarfs Think crypto investment is just about holding tokens? The Last Dwarfs (TLD) is here to shake things up by merging gaming with investment opportunities in a thrilling and smart way. $TLD fuels a GameFi world where players can farm, battle, and devise strategies to earn crypto prizes. That is why it’s listed as one of the best presale crypto projects. This platform introduces a gamified launchpad, bringing a strategic twist to early blockchain investments. Players engage in an interactive game environment to unlock access to promising crypto assets, refreshing the typical presale approach. 3. Wall Street Pepe: Memes & Finance Collide While many meme coins thrive on buzz, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is setting a new standard by integrating viral charm with decentralized finance tools. WEPE offers users advanced DeFi trading tools, such as analytics, automated trading strategies, and unique market insights. This represents a savvy evolution in a sector often dismissed as merely speculative. Memecoins that provide actual value—like Shiba Inu with its staking features—tend to persist longer. If WEPE can successfully merge entertainment with utility, it might just be the top presale crypto project to consider now, amidst a sea of fleeting trends. 4. Meme Index: Top Meme Coin For those who are drawn to meme coins but wish to minimize risks, Meme Index (MEMEX) provides an ingenious solution. Rather than gambling on one token, MEMEX functions like an ETF for meme coins, encapsulating the performance of favorites like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin into a single index. This method simplifies enjoying the peaks of meme coin fluctuations without the pressure of selecting the next big winner. It’s an attractive option in a volatile market, where meme tokens can either soar or plummet unpredictably. By investing in MEMEX, enthusiasts can engage with the meme coin market broadly, balancing potential gains and losses. Wrapping Up: Best Presale Crypto Projects to Consider Now In summary, The Last Dwarfs innovates with its gamified investment model, Wall Street Pepe blends meme fun with financial tools, and the Meme Index allows for diversified meme coin investment. Yet, for those seeking practical utility coupled with substantial financial upside, Web3Bay stands out as the best presale crypto project to consider now. With a potential 4,200% ROI by its launch for early 3BAY token buyers, Web3Bay promises not only to redefine e-commerce but also to offer lucrative returns in the process!

Amid this uncertainty, a new powerhouse, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token , is emerging with the potential to deliver an astronomical 20,000% surge in the imminent bull market. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The DeFi Revolution Set To Outshine DOGE WallitIQ (WLTQ) is a groundbreaking DeFi platform that redefines the crypto wallet experience. This unique platform offers a robust and intuitive interface backed by cutting-edge AI-powered behavioral analysis. This technology adapts to user preferences, creating a smoother, more personalized experience that is far superior to traditional wallets. With a revolutionary security infrastructure , the platform provides a unique Push Protocol technology, which offers real-time on-chain notifications to keep users informed of wallet activity, adding an extra layer of transparency and security, unlike any other crypto wallet in the world. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform has also launched a cutting-edge MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App that sets new standards in DeFi utility. By integrating CoinGecko API , users can maximize live market data, real-time sentiment analysis, and advanced biometric security measures. The app delivers a modern and user-friendly experience that allows users to simulate the management of crypto wallets for ETH and USDT, display QR codes for easy payments , and even send tokens to external addresses. The platform’s native token is engineered for explosive growth in the bull market. With competitive staking rewards that allow investors to earn up to 180% APY , the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token not only provides an exceptional passive income opportunity but also removes the need to convert other cryptocurrencies to cover transaction fees. A crypto expert has confidently projected that WallitIQ (WLTQ) could surge by an eye-popping 20,000% in the 2025 bull market, a projection that dwarfs the modest recovery prospects of the Dogecoin price. Imagine the transformative power of this growth: if you invest $1,000 at the current presale price of $0.0420 , a 20,000% surge would turn that into $200,000. Similarly, a $10,000 investment could multiply to $2 million, and a $100,000 stake could yield an astonishing $20 million. These numbers make it abundantly clear why the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is capturing global attention. With its Beta platform close to launching and its CoinMarketCap listing and a SolidProof smart contract audit building confidence in investors, it’s no surprise that the ongoing presale is regarded as a pot of gold ahead of the crypto bull market in 2025. Dogecoin Price Continues To Fade In This New Era The Dogecoin price is facing persistent challenges. The decline in DOGE’s performance has led many seasoned investors to reconsider their strategies. While DOGE might have been a household name during the last bull market, the current Dogecoin price trajectory suggests that DOGE may not be able to withstand the rigorous demands of a new, more advanced bull market in 2025. As the Dogecoin price declines, investors are now looking for altcoins that offer actual utility and innovation, qualities that DOGE lacks. Crypto whales and institutional investors remain pessimistic about Dogecoin price volatility and are shifting their capital away from DOGE. Conclusion: Secure Your Future With WallitIQ (WLTQ) The upcoming bull market in 2025 is poised to reward early adopters, and the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is at the forefront of this revolution. While the Dogecoin price might show signs of recovery, it simply cannot compete with the massive 20,000% surge projected for the AI token. With its innovative technology , unmatched security features, and a presale opportunity that offers a chance to transform a modest investment into millions, this unique token stands as the ultimate altcoin for the next phase of crypto growth. Investors who seize the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale at $0.0420 are not merely buying a token; they are securing a future of financial independence and monumental wealth. Act now before the price skyrockets and the window of opportunity closes. Seize your chance to embrace the future of decentralized finance and quadruple your portfolio in this 2025 bull market.

Solana’s DEX Volume Soars",https://thecoinrise.com/hottest-crypto-updates-eth-price-jumps-traders-flock-to-blockdag-for-unlimited-usdt-rewards-solanas-dex-volume-soars/,"The blockchain world is witnessing exciting developments as platforms vie for prominence. Solana’s DEX volume surge demonstrates increased user activity, while Ethereum’s recent price rise signals growing institutional interest. These trends highlight shifting market dynamics. However, neither addresses blockchain scalability as effectively as BlockDAG . While Ethereum benefits from ETF inflows and Solana gains traction through high-volume trading, BlockDAG is built for efficiency and real-time transactions. Its affiliate program further boosts accessibility, giving users a direct path to benefit from adoption. As attention remains on market leaders, BlockDAG’s approach offers a compelling alternative for sustainable blockchain growth. Boost Your Earnings with BlockDAG’s Affiliate Program BlockDAG’s Affiliate Program offers a rewarding way to generate passive income by introducing new participants. With an instant 5% cashback in USDT (BEP-20) for both the referrer and the purchaser, participants can easily monetize their network. Getting started is simple. Connect your wallet to BlockDAG’s platform, and you’ll receive a unique affiliate link. Share this link with friends, communities, or followers. Every successful purchase made through your link triggers an immediate reward. Unlike many referral programs with delays or complex payout structures, BlockDAG ensures commissions are credited instantly. Another benefit is the dual reward system. When someone buys through your referral, both you and the buyer receive 5% cashback. This makes it an attractive incentive for new participants. The program requires minimal effort—once a qualifying purchase is made, the referral system activates automatically. To enhance user experience, BlockDAG provides a detailed dashboard. This dashboard offers insights into referral activity, earnings, and conversions. There’s no limit on the number of referrals. The more you promote, the greater your potential rewards. The presale has already raised over $192.5 million across 27 batches, selling over 18.3 billion BDAG coins to over 170,000 unique holders globally. The coin is currently priced at $0.0248, reflecting a 2380% surge since batch 1. Miner sales have generated over $6.2 million, with over 15,500 miners sold. Solana’s DEX Volume Surges Solana recently recorded $200 billion in monthly DEX trading volume. This figure surpasses trading on Ethereum and its Layer 2 networks. This remarkable growth was partly fueled by the recent launch of a Trump-themed coin on the Solana blockchain, which spurred significant user activity. Currently, Solana (SOL) is trading at $246, an 18% increase over the past week. Its market capitalization now stands at $120.05 billion, placing it fifth in the cryptocurrency market. In addition to the impressive DEX volume, Grayscale has applied to introduce a Solana ETF on the New York Stock Exchange. This move has generated considerable market interest and is considered a potential catalyst for future price growth. Analysts believe these developments could lead to increased institutional adoption, pushing SOL’s price closer to $300. Technical indicators also suggest a bullish outlook. The recent break of a bullish pennant formation indicates potential for continued upward momentum. If Solana maintains its current trajectory, supported by strong user engagement and institutional interest, reaching $300 in the future seems increasingly likely. What’s Driving Ethereum’s Price Rise? Ethereum’s price rose 7.5% to $3,421 on January 24, 2025. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, gained 2.6% and crossed $105,000, reflecting the overall market recovery. Positive sentiment was also boosted by Trump’s recent executive order supporting digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Significant inflows into ETH-focused ETFs also contributed to the rise. For example, BlackRock’s ETHA fund saw inflows of $287.7 million between January 13 and January 23, signalling growing institutional interest. Technically, Ethereum is trading above key support levels between $3,200 and $3,390, with resistance expected at $3,502 and $4,109. Analysts predict Ethereum could reach $7,000 in the first quarter of 2025, with nearer-term targets of $3,850 and $4,840. The combination of strong market sentiment and increased institutional involvement makes Ethereum’s outlook promising. Final Thoughts As Ethereum’s institutional support strengthens and Solana’s trading activity expands, the focus remains on scalability and real-world utility. While both networks demonstrate strong momentum, they still face challenges in transaction efficiency and accessibility. BlockDAG offers a structure designed for seamless transactions and user-driven rewards. Its affiliate program not only encourages adoption but also strengthens community participation. While traditional blockchain networks address scalability gradually, BlockDAG’s direct approach to efficiency and engagement provides a distinct advantage.

As the presale for FXGuys continues to exceed expectations, reaching over $3.4 million, it's clear that the project has the potential to achieve massive gains. Let’s explore the factors fueling $FXG’s rise! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Cardano’s New Hope: Is the New Initiative Enough to Save ADA? The Cardano Foundation (CF) has launched its Venture Hub pilot program . The initiative aims to provide personalized guidance and technical expertise to Cardano-based projects. Cardano’s educational arm, Cardano Academy, introduced the Venture Hub to refine the Foundation’s support structure. Despite the Foundation’s positive efforts, internal conflicts continue to affect ADA’s outlook. Founder Charles Hoskinson has expressed dissatisfaction with the Foundation’s governance. He criticized the Swiss authorities for appointing board members without user voting rights. Hoskinson described this process as unfavorable to transparency and accountability. While Cardano is working to address these issues, recent price movements show challenges. ADA dropped from $1.13 to $0.92 in January 2025. However, the Venture Hub is driving optimism, with price projections predicting a rise to $2 by the end of 2025. Even with this potential, experts suggest that ADA may face stiff competition from other leading tokens. Among these, $FXG stands out as an emerging top DeFi token. Its unique offerings and strong market presence could see it outperform ADA in the coming months. Grayscale’s Interest Boosts Hedera, But Will HBAR Keep Up as a Top DeFi Token? Hedera Hashgraph’s HBAR token has gained attention, with Grayscale Investments adding it to their “assets under consideration.” This move signals growing institutional interest in Hedera’s enterprise blockchain solutions. Grayscale’s potential investment in HBAR could provide a significant boost to the token’s adoption and market performance. As a leader in crypto asset management, Grayscale’s backing typically results in heightened exposure and confidence in a token. Despite this growing interest, HBAR has faced challenges. The token price dropped from $0.328 to $0.258 in January 2025. Analysts predict a potential recovery to $0.660 by year-end, though investor confidence remains cautious. Institutional investors are eyeing HBAR’s potential, but its place as a top DeFi token faces competition from other projects. Among these is the rising DeFi star $FXG. FXGuys vs. Cardano & Hedera: Which One is the Future of DeFi? Since its debut in Q4 of 2024, FXGuys has emerged as a top DeFi token, offering powerful solutions that outshine rivals like Cardano and Hedera. Experts believe $FXG has the potential to achieve massive gains, particularly when compared to other projects in the crypto space and here's why! One of FXGuys' standout features is its Trade2Earn program. This unique system allows traders to earn $FXG tokens with every trade, regardless of the outcome. By increasing trading activity, $FXG tokens help foster a dynamic and rewarding ecosystem, benefiting both traders and holders alike. This approach increases volume and solidifies the utility of the top DeFi token as it continues to grow in market presence. FXGuys’ staking program delivers up to a 20% APY, making it a tempting option for long-term investors. Designed to keep $FXG tokens active within the ecosystem, it stabilizes prices and benefits loyal holders. Additionally, the no-buy, no-sell tax facilitates smooth and fee-free transactions for every trader. When compared to other projects like Cardano and Hedera, the FX Guys platform stands out in terms of delivering real-world utility.

As FXGuys' presale continues to surpass expectations, having already accumulated over $3.4 million, the project shows significant potential for notable returns. Let's delve into the elements driving $FXG's ascension! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Cardano's Fresh Initiative: Can It Revitalize ADA? The Cardano Foundation (CF) has unveiled its Venture Hub pilot program . This new initiative is designed to offer tailored guidance and technical support to projects based on Cardano. The Cardano Academy, CF's educational division, launched the Venture Hub to enhance the Foundation's support framework. Despite these constructive moves, internal disputes continue to cloud ADA's prospects. Founder Charles Hoskinson has voiced his dissatisfaction with the Foundation's leadership, criticizing Swiss authorities for appointing board members without allowing user voting rights. He labeled this process as lacking in transparency and accountability. Even as Cardano strives to resolve these challenges, recent price trends indicate hurdles. ADA fell from $1.13 to $0.92 in January 2025. Yet, optimism from the Venture Hub could lead to price forecasts suggesting an increase to $2 by the end of 2025. Despite this potential, experts believe ADA may encounter tough competition from other leading tokens, with $FXG emerging as a prominent DeFi contender. Its distinct features and robust market stance might enable it to surpass ADA in the months to come. Grayscale's Interest Lifts Hedera, But Can HBAR Stay at the Top of DeFi? Hedera Hashgraph's HBAR token has caught attention as Grayscale Investments considers adding it to their ""assets under consideration."" This development indicates a rising institutional interest in Hedera's enterprise blockchain solutions. Grayscale's potential investment in HBAR could significantly enhance the token's adoption and market performance. As a prominent player in crypto asset management, Grayscale's support typically boosts a token's visibility and credibility. Despite this growing attention, HBAR has faced obstacles. The token's price decreased from $0.328 to $0.258 in January 2025. Analysts anticipate a possible rebound to $0.660 by year's end, though investor confidence remains tentative. Institutional investors are watching HBAR's potential, yet its position as a leading DeFi token is challenged by other projects, including the promising DeFi newcomer $FXG. FXGuys Against Cardano & Hedera: Who Leads the Future of DeFi? Since launching in the last quarter of 2024, FXGuys has established itself as a leading DeFi token, providing dynamic solutions that outshine competitors like Cardano and Hedera. Experts assert that $FXG is poised for substantial gains, especially when compared to other projects in the crypto sphere, and here's why! A standout feature of FXGuys is its Trade2Earn program. This innovative system rewards traders with $FXG tokens for every trade, regardless of the result. By boosting trading activity, $FXG tokens foster a vibrant and rewarding ecosystem, benefiting both traders and holders. This strategy enhances volume and reinforces the utility of this leading DeFi token as it continues to expand its market presence. FXGuys' staking program offers up to a 20% annual percentage yield (APY), making it an attractive option for long-term investors. It aims to keep $FXG tokens active within the ecosystem, stabilizing prices and benefiting loyal holders. Furthermore, the absence of a buy or sell tax ensures smooth and fee-free transactions for every trader. When stacked against projects like Cardano and Hedera, the FX Guys platform is exceptional in delivering practical utility. While Cardano and Hedera emphasize scalability and enterprise adoption, FXGuys is sharply focused on empowering individual traders with the tools for success. This makes $FXG the premier DeFi token for those aiming to engage in a decentralized ecosystem with a genuine sense of community and support. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG's Presale Reaches $3.4 Million: Anticipate Significant Returns as the Token Launches at $0.10!

The top three cryptos on their radar are Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and FXGuys ($FXG). These top altcoins have historically demonstrated impressive performance, and investors are now confused which coin should they pick for the best gains in 2025. Here, we will cover recent developments around these coins to highlight the best crypto to buy! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Experts Claim Ripple’s XRP Looks Fine Despite a Price Plunge The crypto market is going through a rough patch heading into February 2025, with Bitcoin crashing below $100,000 again and several altcoins following suit. Amid this development, CryptoInsightUK, a well-known commentator, has spotlighted XRP , assuring his followers that they have nothing to worry about. Taking to X on February 2, 2025, CryptoInsightUK noted that many people are panicking due to XRP plummeting, but the asset looks fine. In the last two months of the past year, XRP shot up the charts, breaking through several resistances and settling down very close to its all-time high. The market has become quieter, with the RSI cooling off nicely and the stochastic RSI flooring out. The RSI is slightly below the midpoint at 48.49, having descended from the overbought region at 70 during the upswing. He added that on the four-hour chart, XRP is coming out of the oversold region across the RSI and Stochastic RSI metrics, setting the tone for a potential rebound. If it happens, the anticipated rally could see the Ripple coin surpassing the $3.20 level, which would be a 24% increase in its current price of $2.68 after a 7% weekly loss. Solana Risks Slumping to $211 If SOL Doesn’t Scale a Key Resistance Zone Solana failed to break above its all-time high as the bears took control, with selling pressure climbing. Upside momentum is waning, leaving investors on the sidelines and watching how SOL behaves in the next few days. Carl Runefelt, a technical analyst, shared his two cents on SOL’s outlook and possible outcome in an X post on February 1, 2025. The analyst stated that Solana might retest the $222 resistance level from its current price, provided it breaks out of a daily bearish flag. This retest will likely be followed by a pullback towards $211, where the asset’s fate will be determined. However, if the bulls successfully defend current levels, SOL could push above the next supply zone and begin a price recovery. In this case, Solana could gather enough strength to challenge higher levels moving forward. SOL is currently down 5% this week to $214. FXGuys Prepares For a 100x Rally in 2025: The Best Crypto to Buy? FXGuys is becoming more popular because of the profit potential of its native token, $FXG. With over $3.83 million raised in its presale so far, $FXG is one of the most adopted DeFi projects today. But there’s more to it than meets the eye. Specifically, the FXGuys proprietary trading platform allows users to access several asset classes, from stocks to cryptocurrencies and commodities, and provides capital to trade these assets. This funding initiative is a part of its trader development programs geared toward helping traders achieve their financial goals. After passing a challenge phase set up by the firm, traders can access up to $500,000 in trading capital, with a chance to keep 80% of the profits made. To incentivize users of the prop trading firm, the FX Guys platform is introducing the Trade2Earn initiative. This initiative will allow traders to receive $FXG tokens for every trade they execute. So, when they buy or sell on the platform, $FXG is deposited into their wallets as a reward. Rather than holding the $FXG token and waiting for its price to increase before making a profit, holders can stake their token and earn up to a 20% APY. This can serve as an additional source of income for FXGuys users. $FXG has many use cases, making it a valuable asset with a bright future. Its presale performance mirrors that of some established altcoins, and experts predict it can rise 100x after its exchange debut. But the main question is, is it the best crypto to buy now? >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG Ranks as the Best Crypto to Invest in Among Top Altcoins Compared to XRP and SOL, $FXG is a relatively new crypto coin with a long way to go. If it were to reach the levels of these top altcoins, investors would realize more than a 100x return on their investment. $FXG currently sells for $0.05 in Stage 3 of its public presale. With its launch price set at $0.10, Stage 3 investors can secure 100% gains upon its exchange listing. Experts also believe that the token price will pump 100x right after its exchange debut. Based on its post-launch projection, $FXG would be the best crypto to buy after XRP and SOL. So, don’t hesitate to buy $FXG tokens now!

40013887,https://coingape.com/?p=237564,1738886801,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Gemini Exchange Mulling IPO Public Listing Route This Year: Report,https://coingape.com/gemini-exchange-mulling-ipo-public-listing-route-this-year/,"Backed by the popular Winklevoss brothers Cameron and Tyler, crypto exchange Gemini is allegedly mulling conducting an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the United States. As reported by Bloomberg, citing anonymous, the trading platform has a timeline for later this year. The Gemini IPO Plans Gemini hopes to go public this year via the Initial Public Offering route, showcasing the growing interest in the cryptocurrency market. In a recent interview, Cameron Winklevoss acknowledged that the company is open to an IPO. Furthermore, he noted that the ongoing internal discussions are centered around deciding on the timing and feasibility of the move. Per the Bloomberg report , the firm has commenced discussions with several entities, including financial advisors. However, no decision has been made on the key details relating to the IPO. Pending the push for this IPO, Gemini has stayed focused on expanding its business. Last month, it appointed three new executives to pilot its European Union expansion drive. It hopes to build on the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license it secured in France last November. Beyond Gemini, Growing IPO Clamor There is an ongoing trend among crypto firms to go public. This trend could be attributed to the crypto market’s growth over the past year. For example, Bitcoin hit a $108,000 all-time high earlier in January. The coin also has ETF products tracking its price and has now raked in over $50 billion in inflows On this premise, investors’ interest in the burgeoning sector has peaked in recent months. Several firms are now trying to meet the increasing demand for crypto solutions. On the Bitcoin ETF front, companies like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale are among the solution providers. As a thriving digital currency trading platform, Gemini believes an IPO move might help it scale its services. In addition, Bullish Global also has IPO plans , as per an earlier report from CoinGape. While no official announcement has been made yet, there are talks about the exchange operator mulling plans to go public in the US this year. In addition, firms like Circle, Kraken, and Chainalysis are projected to go public later this year. Favorable Crypto Regulation Fueling IPO Hype This hype among crypto firms to go public is connected mainly to the improved regulatory landscape in the United States. President Donald Trump’s administration is pulling resources and investing efforts in implementing favorable crypto policies. Under Mark Uyeda’s leadership, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched a Crypto Task Force. This crypto task force , headed by Hester Peirce, will recommend practical policy measures that encourage innovation and protect investors. Ultimately, the goal is to clarify the application of federal securities laws to the digital currency ecosystem market, which may benefit potential IPO candidates.

While Aave dominated the lending sector and Cardano earned its strong reputation through research-backed blockchain development, another player is on the scene that challenges this status quo: FXGuys. What happens at the heart is that this investor-friendly move, innovative features, and strong global marketing drive make FXGuys a budding force to reckon with in 2025. Let's look at how AAVE and ADA are performing and why $FXG might be the best cryptocurrency investment opportunity in DeFi today! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Aave: Pressure Mounts On This DeFi Giant AAVE has always spearheaded the DeFi space by allowing users to accrue deposit interest and obtain crypto loans without intermediaries. Most recently, AAVE traded at $237 , approximately 19% below its price a week ago. The latest trading range saw a high of $202 and a low of $315. This downturn is attributed to overall market volatility and intensified competition from emerging DeFi projects. However, a recent governance proposal introducing a fee switch and token buy-back program has generated optimism among investors, suggesting potential for future price recovery. Cardano: Strong Fundamentals, But Struggling for Momentum Cardano has long been recognized for its research-driven approach and robust technical foundation. However, despite its ambitious roadmap, ADA has failed to maintain an uptrend in the ongoing market cycle. It recently traded at $0.69 , dipping 20% over the past week. The latest trading range was $0.57 to $0.93. The volatility, coupled with the gradual adoption of its smart contract functionality, has affected investor confidence. While Cardano remains a significant player in cryptocurrency, emerging projects with innovative features are increasingly attracting retail and institutional investors. $FXG: The New DeFi Token Conquering 2025 While AAVE and Cardona are under market pressure, FXGuys is introducing a very rewarding ecosystem for traders and investors. Unlike the competition, FXGuys isn't just another DeFi project; it's a complete financial ecosystem designed to foster growth, innovation, and real utility. Here are a few ways $FXG is dominating the DeFi world: Major Global Marketing: Unlike most DeFi projects, which have relied on organic growth, FXGuys has embarked on an aggressive global marketing campaign. With top-tier influencers, institutional partnerships, and international visibility, this project is rapidly gaining traction.

While Aave has been a leader in the lending sector and Cardano has garnered respect through its research-focused blockchain innovations, a new contender is emerging to challenge these giants: FXGuys. The core of this shift lies in FXGuys' investor-friendly strategies, cutting-edge features, and robust global marketing efforts, positioning it as a formidable force in 2025. Let's delve into AAVE and ADA's current performance and explore why $FXG could be the most promising cryptocurrency investment in today's DeFi scene! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Aave: The DeFi Leader Under Strain AAVE has been at the forefront of the DeFi movement, enabling users to earn interest on deposits and secure crypto loans without intermediaries. Recently, AAVE was valued at $237 , approximately 19% lower than its price a week prior. Its recent trading range spanned from $202 to $315. This decline is largely due to market volatility and fierce competition from emerging DeFi initiatives. Nonetheless, a new governance proposal that includes a fee switch and token buy-back initiative has sparked hope among investors, indicating potential future price recovery. Cardano: Strong Foundations, Yet Lacking Momentum Cardano is known for its research-centric methodology and solid technical framework. Despite its ambitious plans, ADA has struggled to sustain an upward trend in the current market cycle. It recently traded at $0.69 , experiencing a 20% decline over the past week. The trading range spanned from $0.57 to $0.93. The volatility and the slow rollout of its smart contract capabilities have shaken investor confidence. While Cardano maintains its significant status in the crypto world, new projects with cutting-edge features are increasingly drawing the attention of both retail and institutional investors. $FXG: The Rising DeFi Token Dominating 2025 While AAVE and Cardano grapple with market pressures, FXGuys is launching a highly beneficial ecosystem for both traders and investors. Unlike its competitors, FXGuys isn't just another DeFi project; it offers a comprehensive financial ecosystem aimed at fostering growth, innovation, and practical utility. Here's how $FXG is making waves in the DeFi sector: Extensive Global Marketing: Unlike many DeFi projects that rely on organic growth, FXGuys has initiated an extensive global marketing strategy. Collaborating with top influencers, forming institutional partnerships, and increasing international exposure, this project is quickly gaining momentum. Advanced Analytics Subscription: FXGuys provides comprehensive analytics to assist traders and investors in making informed decisions.

Prop Funding Program: FXGuys offers traders the opportunity to access up to $500,000 in prop funding, enabling them to expand their strategies without risking personal funds.

Holders of $FXG can stake their tokens on the platform, earning up to 20% APY.

The announcement was made by WLF co-founder Chase Herro at the Ondo Summit in New York, where Donald Trump Jr. also expressed strong support for the digital asset industry. Trump Jr. Calls Crypto the “Future of American Hegemony” Donald Trump Jr. made a surprise appearance at the Ondo Summit on Thursday, where he spoke about cryptocurrency’s role in global finance. Addressing industry leaders, he stated that he believes crypto will shape the future of the U.S. economy. “I think it’s perhaps the future of American hegemony, in terms of our economic status, our economic might,” Trump Jr. said at the event. His remarks were part of a broader discussion on the role of digital assets in financial markets and regulatory policies. WLF, which has been actively purchasing digital tokens in recent months, recently acquired $470,000 worth of ONDO, the native cryptocurrency of Ondo Finance. The company has also invested in Ethereum (ETH), wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), Tron’s TRX, AAVE, and Chainlink’s LINK, among other tokens. World Liberty Financial’s Strategic Reserve Plans Chase Herro, co-founder of WLF, revealed that the company is setting up a strategic crypto reserve but did not specify its intended purpose. “We are big builder fans,” he said, referring to WLF’s continued investment in digital assets. The idea of a cryptocurrency reserve has been a topic of discussion since Trump’s presidential campaign last year. In January, he signed an executive action to evaluate the feasibility of a digital asset stockpile. This has fueled speculation about the role WLF could play in shaping national policies on decentralized finance.

With ONDO seeing a significant $8.16 million influx to Coinbase, Hedera's (HBAR) spotlight courtesy of a Coinbase Derivatives futures filing, and FXGuys ($FXG) delivering groundbreaking solutions, the race to transform $1,000 into $10,000 is heating up. Even as ONDO and Hedera capture attention, FXGuys is making waves with its impressive presale drive and trading innovations. Offering zero fees, no-KYC policies, and a potential for 10x growth, $FXG is swiftly becoming the preferred DeFi token for investors eager to ride the presale wave. Learn why these low-cap opportunities are drawing interest and how you can embark on the 10x journey now! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE A Whale Transfers $8.16 Million in ONDO to Coinbase ONDO has witnessed a substantial surge in transaction activity this past week. As reported by OnchainLens , a crypto whale moved 5.76 million ONDO tokens, valued at $8.16 million, into Coinbase. This transaction came after a period of four months without activity. The whale systematically gathered these tokens over the year through seven transactions, the largest being a purchase of 4.18 million ONDO tokens worth $3.8 million 313 days ago. The latest transaction added $180,514 in ONDO tokens. ONDO's price reached a peak of $1.60 before dropping to $1.22 amid a market downturn. Yet, experts suggest that ONDO could climb to $1.72 in the weeks ahead. While the deposit raises the possibility of a sell-off, it also underscores increasing investor interest in low-cap tokens for substantial returns. The new DeFi token, $FXG, is on track for a potential 10x surge in 2025, catching the attention of ONDO holders. Coinbase Derivatives Plans to Introduce Solana and Hedera Futures Coinbase Derivatives, an arm of Coinbase, has submitted documents to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to offer futures contracts for Hedera and Solana, two leading altcoins. These proposed offerings will be cash-settled and renewed monthly. Hedera futures will have a contract size of 5,000 HBAR tokens. Solana futures will be available in two sizes: 100 SOL and a nano contract of five SOL. Looking at current prices, Hedera’s HBAR has seen a downward trend. Right now, HBAR is priced at $0.23. Experts are skeptical but suggest HBAR could reach $0.50 in Q1 2025 if bulls gain control. Coinbase's recent move underscores the growing institutional interest in the top 10 altcoins. While ONDO and Hedera continue to gain momentum, savvy investors are on the lookout for other low-cap DeFi tokens like $FXG.

This integration offers Scroll developers low-latency market data, allowing high-performance DeFi applications. Raza Zaidi, Scroll’s Head of Growth, highlighted the benefits, stating it lets developers build efficient dApps.

Furthermore, a market-wide slide since the beginning of this month has pushed PEPE lower, with many investors selling rapidly, trying to shield their portfolios from further losses. Although some investors are buying the dip, renowned crypto market experts say $FXG is the logical option to make higher returns than PEPE since it is not affected by the current market volatility.

The token's price drop is influenced by substantial sell-offs from large investors, who have divested over 1.1 trillion PEPE tokens.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance over the entire market is at 60.3% after a 4% increase in the past 24 hours. Notably, crypto analyst Rekt Capital pointed to the 71% dominance level as an important threshold for crypto investors still awaiting an altcoin season. Reaching 71% Is Critical For An Altcoin Season The Bitcoin dominance chart, which tracks Bitcoin’s market capitalization in relation to the entire crypto market, has consistently risen throughout this cycle, even during periods of price corrections. Bitcoin’s dominance has been fueled by institutional demand after the introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and market dynamics favoring BTC as a potential reserve for countries. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Paused Forever? What The Rising Bitcoin Dominance Says Will Happen A direct consequence of this prolonged Bitcoin dominance has been the sluggish performance of the altcoin market. Although some altcoins like Solana and XRP have managed to outperform Bitcoin for brief periods, the capital has consistently rotated back into Bitcoin, preventing a sustained altcoin market breakout. However, some analysts believe a significant shift could be very close, with Bitcoin dominance now sitting at a multi-year high. One such analyst is an analyst known as Rekt Capital on social media platform X. His analysis reveals a historical pattern where altcoin seasons emerge whenever Bitcoin dominance reaches a key threshold and subsequently faces rejection. According to a Bitcoin dominance chart that accompanied his analysis, Bitcoin’s dominance has been rejected around the 71% level three successive times in the past. Interestingly, each rejection has been marked by Bitcoin’s dominance falling over multiple monthly candles, as altcoins outperformed Bitcoin throughout those months. The most recent occurrence of this pattern was during the 2021 bull market. At the time, Bitcoin dominance briefly spiked above 72% before reversing course. Once rejected, it entered a five-month downtrend, ultimately stabilizing around the 40% level as altcoins took control of the market. Will 71% Trigger A New Altcoin Season? Although Bitcoin’s dominance is not at 71% yet, it is still steadily inching upward towards this level. Particularly, Bitcoin’s dominance is at 60.3%, and there are no signs of slowing down. This means that investors banking on a repeat of rejection around 71% might have to wait longer for the dominance to even reach this level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms First Daily Death Cross On Dominance Chart In 4 Years, What To Expect Next If the 71% dominance level eventually becomes a local top again, historical patterns suggest altcoins could experience rapid gains. However, unlike in previous cycles, Ethereum may not take the lead in an altcoin season this time around. The leading altcoin has struggled to gain momentum this cycle as recent market dynamics have diminished its dominance in relation to other altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, which are witnessing more interest among crypto traders.

He continues to contest money laundering charges in the Netherlands. His release comes ahead of his appeal against a 64-month prison sentence handed down in May 2024. Tornado Cash, a decentralized coin-mixing service, allows users to obscure Ethereum transactions by blending them with others. Authorities have accused the platform of facilitating illicit financial activities, including money laundering. Tornado Cash Sanctions Overturned—Will This Help Pertsev’s Appeal? In a post on social media X, he confirmed his release, stating that returning home would give him “a chance to work on my appeal and fight for justice.” He acknowledged that electronic monitoring is not full freedom but said it is “better than prison.” Dear Friends, on Friday 7 February at 10 am I will be free! It is not real freedom, but it is better than prison. Today, a Dutch court suspended my pretrial detention under the condition of electronic monitoring. This will give me a chance to work on my appeal and fight for… — Alexey Pertsev (@alex_pertsev) February 6, 2025 The Dutch court’s decision follows months of failed bail petitions from Pertsev and increasing scrutiny over the legal treatment of privacy-focused crypto developers. His case has been a focal point for debates over financial privacy and the criminal liability of software developers. Pertsev’s appeal gained momentum after a U.S. federal appeals court ruled in November 2024 that sanctions against Tornado Cash were unlawful. The ruling strengthened arguments from privacy advocates who claim that developers should not be held responsible for how their code is used. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin previously expressed concern over Pertsev’s prosecution, calling it a troubling precedent for developers. Speaking at a conference in Berlin last year, Buterin remarked, “The Alexey thing is definitely really unfortunate. I think a lot of people have been going under the assumption that just building software is something that’s okay and is a totally legal and legit way to fight for privacy.” Also, Pertsev’s defense argues that he was merely developing open-source software and should not be held liable for its misuse. Did Tornado Cash Enable Money Laundering? The Legal Battle Continues The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, alleging that the crypto-mixing service facilitated the laundering of over $7 billion since its inception in 2019. The sanctions primarily focused on its alleged role in laundering $455 million in stolen assets for North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Following the sanctions, Dutch authorities arrested Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev in 2022, accusing him of aiding illicit financial activity. On May 14, 2024, Dutch judges at the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal found Pertsev guilty of money laundering. He was sentenced to five years and four months in prison for allegedly laundering $1.2 billion through the platform. Pertsev has since announced plans to appeal the verdict. During his trial in March, Pertsev argued that he could not be held responsible for how users engaged with Tornado Cash. However, the court rejected this defense, stating that he and the other co-founders should have implemented stronger safeguards to prevent illicit activity. In a suprising legal twist, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas has reversed OFAC’s sanctions against Tornado Cash. According to a January 21, 2025 court filing , the judgment has been overturned and sent back to the district court for further review.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $12.59. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $34.29 and $39.7, with an average value of $35.49. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, which contributes to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon?

TL; DR Breakdown Optimism (OP) has recorded some gains in the short term. Support iholds at $1.023. OP resistance stands at $1.214. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP sees some gains despite bearish dominance The 1-day OP price analysis for February 07 shows a strong downward trend. The digital asset exhibits a series of red candlesticks, indicating strong selling pressure over the past few days. However, a slight recovery is observed as the latest candle shows a small gain of about 1%. Despite this, the overall bearish sentiment remains intact as the price struggles to regain momentum. The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) and the MFI indicates deeply oversold conditions. This suggests that selling pressure is still dominant, although a reversal or at least a short-term recovery might follow if capital inflows increase. Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP is consolidating The 4-hour chart of Optimism (OP) shows consolidation and signs of renewed buyer interest, with the price currently up to $1.05. The recent price action reveals a bounce from the $1.023 support level, instigated by some cash inflow. OP is consolidating The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 39.97, indicating that OP is within the oversold region and could bounce back. The red MACD histogram bars are disappearing, indicating that selling momentum may be fading and a potential reversal could be in play. However, a sustained bullish move would require OP to break past 1.167.

The price is consolidating around $1.04 after a sharp decline. However, for a sustained recovery, OP needs to break above the $1.147 resistance level; otherwise, a drop toward $1.023 and lower remains likely. Is Optimism a good investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up on $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and would require an unprecedented level of growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

However, this is altcoin market cap’s way of producing a shallower retrace to show how $425 billion is weakening as a point of rejection.” Source: Rekt Capital/X The analyst believes the shallower retracement could give the altcoin market cap more firepower to hit new local highs. “Since rejecting from $425 billion resistance (black) altcoin market cap has retraced -51%. This is still shallower compared to the previous rejections from ~$425 billion resistance (-69% and -85%). Should altcoin market cap bottom in the near future, then altcoin market cap will have an easier time at breaking beyond the weakened $425 billion resistance over time.” Source: Rekt Capital/X The OTHERS chart is currently at $271.27 billion. The analyst also updates his outlook on Bitcoin ( BTC ), predicting the flagship crypto asset will trade sideways in the near term on the weekly chart. “Bitcoin revisited the $101,000 level (black). In fact, Bitcoin even daily closed above it, but failed the subsequent post-breakout retest of it into new support BTC is probably going to consolidate between $98,300 and $101,000 for the time being.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Bitcoin is trading for $96,860 at time of writing, down 1.1% in the last 24 hours.

From political influence to adventurous narratives and community-driven growth, the latest meme coins deliver excitement, speculation, and jaw-dropping returns. Recent developments in the market have set the stage for an explosive rally, with projects like TRUMP meme coin and Bonk generating immense traction. The political narrative around the TRUMP token led to an initial meteoric rise, while Bonk’s resurgence as Solana’s premier meme token has captivated investors. However, a new contender, Arctic Pablo Coin, is shaking things up with a groundbreaking approach that blends mythology, adventure, and wealth generation. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is not just another meme token; it’s a thrilling expedition into Earth’s mysteries. With an unparalleled presale structure tied to unique locations, Arctic Pablo Coin invites investors to embark on an epic adventure. Arctic Pablo Coin – The Adventure That Pays Deep within the frozen tundras, where the unknown meets the mystical, Arctic Pablo embarks on an expedition unlike any other. From the icy cliffs of Frostburg to the fabled lands of Shangri-La, Arctic Pablo traverses through uncharted locations, uncovering hidden treasures. But this isn’t just an adventure; it’s an opportunity. Every investor who joins the Arctic Pablo Coin journey becomes part of an epic quest, where each presale phase represents a new chapter in an ongoing expedition. With each location, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is unveiling new opportunities for wealth generation. Unlike traditional meme coins, the presale structure isn’t based on arbitrary stages—it’s a literal journey through time and myth. Currently stationed in Frostburg, Arctic Pablo has already raised over $1 Million, and the momentum is snowballing. The anticipated launch price of $0.008 suggests a mind-blowing ROI potential of over 14,725.93%. Investors who jump in now could see a $500 investment turn into $74,148.12 by the time Arctic Pablo reaches its final destination. It is one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. Tokenomics are designed to benefit long-term holders. Weekly burns remove unsold tokens, ensuring scarcity. Staking opportunities offer a staggering 66% APY, allowing investors to earn passive income while being part of a groundbreaking expedition. With token transactions recorded on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), transparency and security are at the heart of Arctic Pablo Coin’s mission. Unlike meme coins that rely solely on hype, Arctic Pablo Coin is fusing narrative, innovation, and financial opportunity into one thrilling package. TRUMP Meme Coin – The Political Power Play The TRUMP meme coin took the crypto world by storm, riding the wave of political fervor and speculation. Initially marketed as a token of support rather than an investment, the coin skyrocketed to a peak market value of $14.5 billion before taking a two-thirds nosedive. Despite the drop, TRUMP meme coin remains a powerhouse in the meme coin sector, generating between $86 million and $100 million in trading fees by January 30. With over 50 investors bagging $10 million in profits and 200,000 wallets experiencing losses, the TRUMP coin is a high-risk, high-reward rollercoaster. Recent developments suggest a shift in its utility. Trump-branded products, including watches, sneakers, and fragrances, now accept the TRUMP token as payment. While its value plunged by 60% following Trump’s failure to mention digital assets in his inaugural address, efforts are being made to position the token as an online payment tool. With the political cycle heating up, the TRUMP meme coin could experience another wave of speculative mania, making it one of the top meme coins to invest in now. Bonk – Solana’s Meme Coin Revival Bonk ($BONK) has reclaimed its throne as the leading meme coin on the Solana network. Priced at $0.00002579, Bonk has surged by 9.06% in the last 24 hours, boasting a massive $317.9 million in trading volume. The token’s market cap has hit $2.5 billion, reflecting strong investor confidence. Bonk’s resurgence comes from a highly anticipated “BURNmas” event, where BonkDAO announced the incineration of 1.69 trillion tokens, tightening supply and driving up value. With an RSI of 44, Bonk is in neutral territory, slightly leaning toward oversold conditions—an indicator that an explosive move could be on the horizon. Bonk’s accessibility has skyrocketed following its listing on a major U.S. exchange, drawing in North American investors eager to capitalize on its growing ecosystem. Crypto analyst Jack.poor has projected a possible price of $0.11 in 2025, representing staggering gains for early believers. As one of the top meme coins to invest in now, Bonk’s combination of strong community backing and strategic supply reduction makes it a meme coin with massive potential. Conclusion Based on research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, TRUMP meme coin, and Bonk stand out as the top meme coins to invest in now. Arctic Pablo Coin offers an unparalleled adventure with astronomical ROI potential and a powerful burn mechanism ensuring long-term scarcity. TRUMP meme coin, despite its volatility, holds speculative allure tied to the political landscape. Meanwhile, Bonk’s strategic token burns and growing market cap make it a solid contender for future gains. As meme coins continue to captivate investors, now is the time to jump into the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale before it reaches its next mythical location. Don’t miss the chance to be part of this historic expedition—secure a spot before the launch price skyrockets.

This development means the SEC now has until October to decide whether to approve or reject the application. Previously, the SEC had rejected several applications for ETFs tracking Solana and had ordered Cboe to withdraw previously submitted 19b-4s for those ETFs. According to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, the move to recognize Grayscale’s filing is considered noteworthy. It is the first time the SEC has acknowledged an ETF filing for a cryptocurrency that was previously classified as a “security.” In an X post he noted: We are now in new territory, albeit just a baby step, but seemingly the direct result of leadership change. Eric Balchunas SEC acknowledges multiple crypto ETF filings as firms submit proposals On Thursday, the SEC also acknowledged several other crypto ETF applications, including Grayscale’s filing for a Litecoin (LTC) ETF and BlackRock’s proposal to enable in-kind creations and redemptions for its iShares Bitcoin ETF. Later in the US evening, Cboe submitted filings to list and trade shares of four ETFs designed to track the price of XRP (XRP). On Thursday, the exchange submitted four 19b-4 filings to the SEC for potential ETFs from Bitwise, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and WisdomTree. These issuers had already filed S-1s, the initial step in launching an ETF. The latest steps indicate that businesses feel more at ease with the current SEC administration expanding beyond Bitcoin and Ether ETF products, even if they do not necessarily mean that the SEC will approve all of these products. SEC opens public comment period on Grayscale’s Litecoin ETF proposal The SEC has also initiated a public comment period on Grayscale’s Litecoin Trust’s proposed conversion into an ETF. The agency has acknowledged NYSE Arca’s filing and is inviting comments to be submitted within 21 days of the proposal’s publication in the Federal Register. The agency could decide to approve, disapprove, or “institute proceedings.” NYSE Arca posted a 19b-4 filing a few weeks ago for the “Grayscale Litecoin Trust ” and a “Grayscale Solana Trust.” A 19b-4 filing is the second part of a two-step process for proposing a spot crypto ETF. Once the SEC acknowledges the filing, it will be published in the Federal Register, initiating the agency’s approval process. In recent weeks, firms have flooded the market with proposals for funds based on DOGE and other altcoins, likely hoping that the SEC’s leadership change would create a more favorable environment for approving crypto ETFs. After the former crypto-skeptic SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s exit last month, the agency’s acting Chair, Mark Uyeda, picked fellow Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce to lead a crypto task force. Peirce has stated that she intends to focus on clarifying which “crypto assets” qualify as securities. This could potentially change the ways firms register and work on providing clear statements when approving or disapproving exchange-traded products.

A proposed class action lawsuit alleges BofA promised to hand a trove of reward points to new credit card customers, as long as they spent $3,000 within 90 days. But according to plaintiff Jean-Baptiste Boyer-Gomez, the bank has routinely short changed customers who signed up for the Air France KLM World Elite Mastercard. BofA promised 70,000 bonus miles and 40 experience points when customers met the requirements. Instead, the bank allegedly executed a “bait and switch” by applying a different promotional offer without proper notice, handing over only 50,000 bonus miles and 60 experience points with a lower spending threshold. The difference in value between the two offers is estimated to be at least $200. Although BofA has not yet responded to the accusations, the suit says Boyer-Gomez sent a letter to the bank detailing what happened, and received a response from the lender that denied any wrongdoing. The lawsuit seeks damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and class certification to address and cease Bank of America’s alleged deceptive practices.

The proposed ETF, named the Franklin Templeton Digital Asset Index Fund, would track a mix of major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). According to the filing, the fund aims to provide investors with broad exposure to the crypto market by investing in BTC and ETH, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. If approved, the ETF would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange, a leading U.S. equities and derivatives exchange. The move comes amid growing acceptance of cryptocurrency-based investment products, with several financial institutions seeking regulatory approval for ETFs that track digital assets. Earlier this year, the SEC approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing investors to gain exposure to BTC without holding the asset directly. Franklin Templeton was among the firms that launched a spot Bitcoin ETF, joining competitors such as BlackRock and Fidelity. Industry analysts view the filing as another step toward the mainstream adoption of digital assets in traditional finance. Franklin Templeton’s decision to include both Bitcoin and Ethereum in a single index fund suggests confidence in the long-term viability of these assets. Despite the positive momentum, regulatory uncertainty remains a key challenge for crypto-related financial products. The SEC has historically been cautious in approving ETFs tied to cryptocurrencies, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. However, the recent wave of Bitcoin ETF approvals has set a precedent that could improve the chances of Ethereum and multi-asset crypto ETFs gaining regulatory approval. Franklin Templeton’s filing also highlights the growing competition among asset managers to bring crypto-based products to market. Firms like Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity have already established themselves in the space, with Ethereum-focused ETF applications currently under SEC review. If Franklin Templeton’s index fund receives approval, it could attract investors looking for diversified exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin has long been considered the dominant digital asset, Ethereum’s growing role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts has made it a key player in the crypto ecosystem. The inclusion of ETH in the fund suggests that Franklin Templeton recognizes the importance of Ethereum’s network beyond just price speculation. Franklin Templeton has been expanding its presence in the digital asset industry in recent years. The firm has explored blockchain technology for traditional financial services and previously launched blockchain-based tokenized funds. By filing for a crypto index ETF, the asset manager is doubling down on its commitment to integrating digital assets into mainstream investment portfolios. The SEC has yet to provide a timeline for its decision on Franklin Templeton’s latest ETF proposal. If approved, the fund could mark another milestone in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency, giving investors a regulated and familiar way to gain exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum through traditional financial markets.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-07 01:37:41

40019159,https://timestabloid.com/?p=56488,1738893601,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Former Shiba Inu Developer Says RCOF Is the Best Altcoin to Buy and Catch a 55,000% Upside",https://timestabloid.com/former-shiba-inu-developer-says-rcof-is-the-best-altcoin-to-buy/,"A seasoned developer from the early days of Shiba Inu now champions RCO Finance (RCOF) as the best altcoin to buy. He believes RCOF could surge by 55,000%, turning modest investments into staggering wealth. His journey from working on SHIB to endorsing RCOF speaks to the project’s potential for explosive growth. In this article, we explore his story and uncover why he believes RCO Finance is the best altcoin to buy. We’ll dive into his transition from Shiba Inu to RCOF and explain the innovative features driving its success. Learn why RCOF might be your ticket to the next crypto revolution. The Shiba Inu Developer’s Journey This developer began his career during Shiba Inu’s humble meme-coin days. Back then, few could imagine that Shiba Inu (SHIB) would transform from a dog-themed token into a major force in crypto. He played a role in early projects, contributing to key developments such as the launch of Shibarium. After helping drive SHIB’s initial success, he eventually moved on when the project shifted focus. Seeking more robust and sustainable opportunities, he discovered RCO Finance (RCOF). Captivated by its clear roadmap and tangible benefits, he now believes RCOF is the best altcoin to buy for anyone aiming for astronomical gains. His journey illustrates a shift from relying on viral memes to investing in platforms with real-world applications and advanced technology. His endorsement of RCOF isn’t mere hype—it’s grounded in firsthand experience and a deep understanding of what makes a project revolutionary. Why RCO Finance Could Skyrocket 55,000% RCO Finance is a next-generation DeFi platform combining cutting-edge AI with practical, real-world asset access. It allows users to buy stocks, bonds, and even real estate with cryptocurrency without lengthy KYC processes. This streamlined approach gives investors privacy and flexibility, keeping RCOF from traditional projects. At its core, RCO Finance is powered by an AI-driven Robo Advisor. This tool gathers real-time market data from top-tier sources like Reuters and Bloomberg, ensuring that up-to-the-minute insights back every trading decision. It tailors strategies to your financial goals, determining the best moments to enter a trade, mitigate risks, or secure profits. Consider the case of VidyCoin (VDY). Between November 2024 and February 2025, VidyCoin surged from approximately $0.00009 to $0.00115—a gain of roughly 1,152%. Imagine if the Robo Advisor had spotted those early signals in VidyCoin’s upward momentum. It would have alerted investors to buy in at a low price, capturing significant gains before the market caught on. This ability to find opportunities early is an essential factor in why experts now view RCO Finance as a game-changer. RCO Finance also provides its users with an interactive Beta Platform . Here, investors can test features like automated market making, staking, and liquidity pools. This early access fosters transparency and builds trust. With over 10,000 engaged users, RCOF is proving that its innovative tools are not just theoretical—they’re actively enhancing trading strategies. Security remains a cornerstone of the platform. A rigorous SolidProof audit confirms the solidity of RCOF’s smart contracts. This commitment to safety ensures that users’ funds are well-protected, a crucial factor for those investing significant sums in a rapidly evolving market. Harnessing the Power of AI in a Sluggish Market One key scenario where RCO Finance shines is during market downturns. When tokens dip, many investors panic-sell, often locking in losses. However, RCOF’s Robo Advisor actively monitors market conditions and can advise investors on the optimal moments to act. For example, suppose the market shows signs of a temporary dip. In that case, the Advisor might suggest increasing your position in a stable asset or even buying undervalued tokens—much like it could have identified the early surge in VidyCoin. This proactive strategy is vital in a world where rapid shifts in sentiment can quickly erode gains. Instead of reacting impulsively, the Robo Advisor uses real-time data to craft a strategy that balances risk and reward. This ability to make informed decisions in volatile conditions is why many experts now see RCO Finance as having the potential to achieve a 55,000% surge. Seize the Opportunity: Your Future in DeFi For investors tired of the moderate rallies seen in XRP and Ethereum, RCO Finance offers an alternative built for exponential growth. While XRP once surged several hundred percent and Ethereum enjoyed a 77% rally from January to March 2024, RCOF aims far higher. Its presale token is currently priced at $0.10, and with nearly $13 million raised so far, the momentum is undeniable. Analysts believe that a 55,000% increase isn’t out of reach if market conditions continue favorably. Imagine turning a $1,000 investment into over $500,000—this is the explosive potential that early adopters are eyeing. Early investments in RCO Finance might outperform traditional tokens like XRP and Ethereum and rewrite the rules of crypto wealth. If you’re ready to move beyond the modest returns of established projects and embrace a platform designed for massive growth, RCOF could be your gateway to the next big wave in crypto.

40017412,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=691825,1738893614,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/40017412.jpeg,Ethereum Outflows On Derivative Exchanges Hit Record Lows: What It Means for ETH,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-outflows-on-derivative-exchanges-hit-record-lows-what-it-means-for-eth/,"Ethereum has continued to face headwinds, mirroring the broader downward trend in the global cryptocurrency market. The persistent market slump has made it challenging for ETH to sustain upward momentum, even as it attempts to recover from recent losses. Interestingly, it appears there might be some notable factors behind the scenes influencing Ethereum’s price movements, particularly the exchange netflows on derivative platforms. Related Reading: Ethereum Leverage Elevated Despite Long Squeeze, Glassnode Says Ethereum Faces Record Outflow: Implications Amr Taha, a contributor on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, recently offered insights into the Ethereum market’s ongoing dynamics. In a detailed post on the QuickTake platform, Taha noted that Ethereum’s netflow on derivative exchanges dropped below -300,000 ETH for the first time since August 2023. This significant shift, according to Taha, holds potential implications for price direction and market structure. Taha outlined several key factors to consider when assessing the impact of ETH outflows on pricing. First, when large amounts of ETH leave derivative exchanges, it often signals that traders are either closing leveraged positions or transferring funds to cold storage. This reduction in available supply can alleviate selling pressure, creating conditions that are favorable for a price increase—provided demand remains stable or grows. However, the nature of these outflows can lead to short-term market volatility. If the withdrawals are driven by the liquidation of leveraged long positions, the market may experience a temporary reset. While this can dampen buying demand in the short term, it often results in a healthier and more balanced market structure over time. Current Liquidity Stance And Key Metrics to Watch Additionally, Taha highlighted the significance of liquidity conditions in the broader financial system. Using a metric known as Fed Net Liquidity—which subtracts the Treasury General Account (TGA) and Reverse Repo (RRP) from the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet—he pointed out that rising liquidity levels often have a bullish effect on risk assets. Recently, the metric increased from 5.85 trillion to 5.95 trillion, suggesting more capital is available to flow into markets such as cryptocurrency. Historically, higher net liquidity correlates with increased asset prices, potentially benefiting Ethereum’s outlook. Furthermore, one of the more immediate indicators to monitor according to Taha is Ethereum’s liquidation map. Taha observed that certain price levels might force short positions into capitulation if ETH continues to climb.

Additionally, the trajectory of net liquidity will remain an essential factor, as its direction often signals the broader sentiment toward risk assets.

Understand the DOGE Price Fall & Decline in ADA Whale Activity,https://thecoinrise.com/get-5-cashback-with-blockdags-affiliate-program-understand-the-doge-price-fall-decline-in-ada-whale-activity/,"The current trends in the crypto market are causing concern as the Dogecoin (DOGE) price experiences a significant 13% decrease within a day, landing at $0.2539. Observers are left questioning if the meme coin will stabilize above $0.25 or face further declines. At the same time, there’s a noticeable decrease in Cardano whale activity, sparking worries about ADA’s recovery chances after an 18% decrease. Big stakeholders are opting to wait, resulting in an uncertain market. Amid these challenges, BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing interest with its presale exceeding $192.5 million. The appeal is powered by a 5% USDT cashback offer through its straightforward affiliate program, which allows traders to benefit immediately without waiting for BDAG’s market introduction. DOGE Price Plummets Over 13% The DOGE price has declined sharply, over 13% in a single day to $0.2539, casting doubts on the meme coin’s short-term prospects. Despite previous hopes of a bullish pattern around $0.31, that optimism has waned. Market watchers are now assessing whether the DOGE price will find a new baseline above $0.25 or if it will retreat further. Market volatility is ongoing, and the continued sell-off indicates a cautious approach from buyers. For a recovery, the DOGE price might need an increase in trading volume or a shift in market sentiment to regain strength soon. Cardano Whale Activity Indicates Limited Buying Cardano whale activity is subdued, with ADA’s price at $0.7111 following an 18% fall recently. Observations suggest large holders are reluctant to increase their stakes, possibly showing a weak bullish sentiment. On-chain metrics report no significant change in the number of addresses holding between one million and ten million ADA, indicating stable but inactive whale participation. Should Cardano whale activity intensify, it could restore confidence in ADA’s market prospects. However, current indicators, like a falling ADX, suggest continued flat trading. Stakeholders remain watchful for any signs of increased Cardano whale activity that could potentially revive ADA’s market performance. BlockDAG’s 5% Cashback Strategy Nears $600M Target BlockDAG’s presale has amassed over $192.5 million by selling 18.3 billion coins at $0.0248 each. Early participants have enjoyed a remarkable 2,380% ROI, and BDAG is currently recognized as a top crypto to buy right now. The surge in interest is due to BlockDAG’s revamped Affiliate Program, which offers 5% cashback to both the referrer and the new buyer. Joining the program is easy: if a BlockDAG holder refers someone who then purchases $10,000 of BDAG, both parties receive $500 in USDT in their BEP-20 compatible wallets. This approach provides immediate benefits and has significantly boosted the presale, attracting new participants and rewarding existing ones. This initiative highlights BlockDAG’s commitment to its community. BlockDAG values the satisfaction and loyalty of its community, acknowledging their role in the project’s success. As the presale progresses, participants not only enjoy a 5% cashback but also contribute to reaching the ambitious $600 million target. With the mainnet launch anticipated this year, traders are eager to earn additional cash now, believing that early acquisition of BDAG coins could lead to more benefits as the presale amount rises in the challenging market. Despite Market Downturn, One Crypto Stands Out Recent market downturns have traders pondering the future direction. The DOGE price has fallen by more than 13% in a day, with little hope for a quick recovery. Concurrently, Cardano whale activity has diminished, indicating that major holders are wary of investing, leaving ADA’s price trajectory uncertain. In contrast, BlockDAG’s 5% cashback affiliate program continues to attract traders seeking immediate rewards. As BDAG moves closer to its $600 million crypto presale goal, it is highlighted as the top crypto to buy right now, with potential price hikes on the horizon. Those in search of stability and growth potential are advised not to delay, as such opportunities are rare.

LINK Ecosystem Expands,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-web3bays-6430-roi-4200-still-possible-but-times-running-out-to-join-this-web3-platform-link-ecosystem-expands/,"Some moments in markets are predictable—slow, steady, incremental shifts that barely move the needle. This isn’t one of them. Right now, some web3 blockchain projects are rewriting how industries operate, and those who understand what’s happening are already striking gold. LINK’s potential climb to $50—or its possible drop to $12.80—illustrates just how much the Chainlink ecosystem growth and broader market sentiment dictate success. AGII is proving that AI and smart contracts aren’t just a theoretical pairing—they’re already optimizing blockchain transactions for speed, security, and adaptability. But the most remarkable upside comes from Web3Bay (3BAY) , where early investors are securing returns that, frankly, don’t come around often. With three presale stages already gone, those who got in early are looking at a 6430% ROI by launch. Even those entering the ongoing Stage 4 will still see a 4200% gain! Chainlink Ecosystem Could See $50 LINK—Or Drop to $12.80 LINK’s future in 2025 could swing in either direction, depending on market sentiment and Chainlink ecosystem advancements. If optimism prevails, LINK could climb to $47.70—or even $50 if demand intensifies. However, if negative sentiment takes hold, the price may slip to $12.80. Much of this hinges on developments within the Chainlink ecosystem, which continues to expand its role in blockchain interoperability and smart contract security. With its previous all-time high at $52.88, investors are watching to see whether LINK can break past this level with upcoming upgrades. Web3 Platform AGII Deploys AI to Boost Smart Contracts Smart contracts have reshaped digital transactions, but they often struggle with efficiency and adaptability. AGII, an AI-driven Web3 platform, is tackling these challenges by integrating artificial intelligence directly into blockchain infrastructure. With AI-optimized smart contracts, transactions become faster, more secure, and capable of self-improvement over time. This advancement benefits industries like decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and supply chain management, where automation and accuracy are crucial. By merging AI with blockchain, AGII is helping businesses and developers build smarter, more reliable decentralized applications. Web3Bay Investors Secure ROIs Upto 6430%: Will You Be One of Them? Every major shift in technology creates two kinds of people—those who recognize it early and those who look back, wishing they had. Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace is proving that traditional e-commerce platforms are outdated, and those securing 3BAY now are positioning themselves ahead of the curve. Over $1 million has been raised in the presale, with 280 million 3BAY tokens already sold. Three stages have completely sold out, and Stage 4 is on the verge of closing at just $0.004562625 per token. But why is this web3 blockchain project gaining this level of success so early into its presale? Traditional e-commerce platforms hold too much power—setting fees, controlling algorithms, and collecting user data without consent. Web3Bay changes that by using blockchain to hand control back to buyers and sellers. With no middlemen, users own their data, set their terms, and transact securely. Holding 3BAY tokens gives users voting rights on key decisions, ensuring the community—not executives—shapes the platform’s future. The very fact that Web3Bay hands back control to its users makes it the leading Web3 blockchain project in the e-commerce space. Those who locked in 3BAY during Stage 1 at $0.003 are already looking at an estimated 6430% return on investment by launch. Even those joining at Stage 4 could see a 4200% gain—but only if they move fast before it sells out. Why Waiting Could Cost You Big Chainlink Ecosystem’s role in blockchain interoperability keeps it essential, but whether it surpasses its $52.88 all-time high will depend on whether demand aligns with development. Meanwhile, Web3 platform AGII is proving that AI-powered automation isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s becoming the new baseline. Coming to Web3Bay, its over $1 million presale has already positioned it as the leading web3 blockchain project in the online shopping space. Stage 1 3BAY investors have already locked in a potential 6430% ROI by launch, but there’s still room for major gains—if one acts fast. Right now, 3BAY is priced at just $0.004562625 in Stage 4, offering a projected 4200% return. But with each stage selling out, the price climbs and ROI shrinks. The chance to profit is fading fast—waiting could mean settling for far less!

As we move into 2025, investors are on the lookout for the next big thing in crypto. There are plenty of options, but three names stand out—Qubetics, Kaspa, and AAVE. These coins are not only showing promising growth, but they are reshaping the very foundation of blockchain technology and finance. If you’re asking, “What are the top crypto coins to buy now?” you’re in for a treat. Kaspa, in particular, has grabbed attention due to its blazing transaction speeds and unique architecture using the GHOSTDAG consensus protocol. Unlike older blockchains like Bitcoin, Kaspa processes transactions in parallel, offering impressive scalability and low fees. On the other hand, AAVE has shown its resilience in the face of market volatility, even managing to process massive liquidations without incurring bad debt. The DeFi protocol’s integration with emerging blockchains like Sonic is also fueling excitement, making AAVE a coin that could experience a serious rebound in 2025. But while Kaspa and AAVE are grabbing headlines, Qubetics is positioning itself as the project that will truly change the game. Through its innovative presale, Qubetics has raised over $12 million and is well on its way to becoming one of the top crypto coins to buy now. With an integration into the 1inch network, Qubetics is taking things to the next level by offering features no other blockchain project can currently match. Ready to find out why Qubetics is the project to watch? Qubetics: A Game Changer in Crypto As the crypto world continues to evolve, many projects promise decentralization, efficiency, and user-centric solutions—but few deliver on all fronts. Enter Qubetics. With its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet , Qubetics is set to offer a user experience that outshines its competitors. While Kaspa and AAVE have made their marks in scalability and DeFi, Qubetics brings something uniquely tailored for the needs of today’s crypto ecosystem. One of the biggest challenges in crypto today is managing multiple assets across different blockchains. You need multiple wallets, each with its own set of security protocols, which can become cumbersome, especially for businesses, professionals, or anyone who holds a diverse crypto portfolio. That’s where the Qubetics Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet comes in. It’s not just a wallet; it’s a revolution. Imagine having the ability to seamlessly manage your assets across Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and other networks all from one place—without relying on third-party custodians. For businesses dealing with cross-border payments or professionals handling client transactions, this feature can simplify daily operations. Take, for example, a freelancer who accepts payments in both ETH and BTC. With the Qubetics wallet, managing both currencies becomes a breeze, allowing the user to keep track of earnings across different chains without the hassle of maintaining separate wallets. Not only does this save time, but it also reduces the risk of errors, making it a safer and more efficient option. For larger businesses, the Qubetics wallet offers an added layer of security and control. Imagine a supply chain company needing to make payments to vendors across different countries, each operating on a different blockchain. The Qubetics wallet allows the business to execute transactions quickly, ensuring liquidity and cost efficiency without the delays and fees typically associated with traditional banking methods. With the wallet’s multi-chain functionality, this process becomes smoother, cheaper, and more secure. Qubetics x 1inch: A Strategic Partnership Redefining DeFi In another bold move, Qubetics has partnered with the 1inch network, a leader in decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregation. This collaboration positions Qubetics as a frontrunner in decentralized trading, offering users access to hundreds of DEXs for optimized pricing, better liquidity, and an overall smoother trading experience. This means that not only does the Qubetics wallet serve as a one-stop shop for asset management, but it also doubles as a powerhouse for trading. The integration with 1inch takes things a step further. With this partnership, Qubetics users can expect highly optimized trades, which are critical in the fast-moving world of DeFi. Advanced aggregation technology allows Qubetics to offer the best prices and lowest slippage by sourcing liquidity across multiple platforms. This means more efficiency and profitability for traders, no matter their experience level. For example, let’s say you’re a DeFi enthusiast looking to make a trade between Ethereum and Solana. Without 1inch, you’d have to navigate multiple DEXs, looking for the best price and hoping that slippage doesn’t eat into your profits. With the 1inch integration, the process becomes automated and simplified, ensuring you get the best deal possible without the headache. This is the future of trading—where complexity is minimized, and profits are maximized. The Qubetics wallet’s collaboration with 1inch sets it apart from other wallets in the market, and its seamless user experience is exactly what traders have been waiting for. Kaspa: The Speed King of Blockchain When people ask, “What are the top crypto coins to buy now?” Kaspa’s name should be at the top of the list. The cryptocurrency industry is all about speed and scalability, and Kaspa delivers on both fronts. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which process blocks sequentially, Kaspa uses the GHOSTDAG protocol to process multiple blocks simultaneously. This makes it capable of handling thousands of transactions per second, without bottlenecks. For businesses, the benefits of Kaspa’s high throughput are clear. Imagine a retail company using blockchain for supply chain management. With Kaspa’s lightning-fast transaction speeds, they can instantly verify product authenticity, track inventory, and even make real-time payments, all without worrying about delays or high fees. This is the kind of efficiency Kaspa brings to the table, and it’s why it’s being regarded as one of the top crypto coins to buy now. Kaspa’s innovative architecture doesn’t just address scalability issues; it also ensures decentralization and security. Unlike traditional blockchains where mining pools may centralize control, Kaspa’s blockDAG structure avoids this pitfall, ensuring that no single entity can dominate the network. This is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the network and keeping it truly decentralized. AAVE: DeFi Resilience at Its Best AAVE is no stranger to the spotlight. This DeFi powerhouse has weathered numerous market storms, showcasing its resilience and capacity to adapt. Recently, AAVE gained traction due to its potential integration with the Sonic blockchain, a move that could enhance its revenue potential and expand its user base. The decentralized lending protocol’s ability to withstand a market-wide flash crash and still process over $210 million in liquidations without incurring bad debt speaks volumes about its stability. AAVE’s innovative approach to DeFi lending has positioned it as a major player, and its community-driven initiatives make it one of the top crypto coins to buy now. As DeFi continues to grow, AAVE remains a key player, and analysts are optimistic about its future. Its innovative features and growing integration with emerging blockchains will likely drive further adoption, making it a solid investment for 2025. Conclusion As 2025 unfolds, the top crypto coins to buy now are clearly Qubetics, Kaspa, and AAVE. Each of these coins offers unique features and promising growth potential. Qubetics, with its revolutionary Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet and integration with 1inch, is ready to redefine how we interact with blockchain.

What makes Qubetics one of the top crypto coins to buy now? Qubetics stands out as one of the top crypto coins to buy now due to its groundbreaking Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, which allows users to manage multiple assets across different blockchains from one secure platform. This feature solves a major issue in the crypto world by eliminating the need for multiple wallets and reducing the complexity of managing diverse portfolios. 2. How does the Qubetics Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet work? The Qubetics Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet allows users to securely store, send, and receive assets across multiple blockchains, all within a single platform.

Why is Kaspa considered one of the fastest blockchain networks? Kaspa’s unique use of the GHOSTDAG consensus protocol allows it to process multiple blocks simultaneously, as opposed to traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which process blocks sequentially.

How does AAVE continue to perform well in the DeFi market? AAVE continues to thrive in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market because of its resilience and innovation. It has proven its ability to manage extreme market volatility, like the February 2023 flash crash, by processing liquidations without incurring bad debt.

Trump’s Rising Interest In ONDO Recently, a blockchain-based transaction tracker, Onchain Lens, shared a post on X (previously Twitter) revealing that Trump’s Liberty Finance has spent $4.7 million USDC to buy 342,000 ONDO tokens. Just In: Trump's World Liberty Finance has spent $4.7M $USDC to buy 342,000 $ONDO .

However, this substantial investment in ONDO is making waves in the cryptocurrency space, leading to a surge in its price while other major cryptocurrencies struggle to gain momentum. ONDO Current Price Momentum ONDO is currently trading near $1.35 and has surged over 3.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, heightened interest from traders and investors pushed its trading volume up by 15% compared to previous days. Bullish On-chain Metrics and Upcoming Level Despite this bullish outlook, investors have been found dumping their holdings onto exchanges, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have seen an outflow of over $11.54 million worth of ONDO coins, indicating potential accumulation by whales and long-term holders. This could create buying pressure and drive further upside momentum. According to expert technical analysis, ONDO appears bullish but is currently consolidating in a tight range between $1.175 and $1.65 over the past seven days. Based on recent price action, if the current market sentiment remains unchanged, it could soar by 22% to reach the $1.65 level in the coming days.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ONDO|TRADING|ZRX|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-07 02:25:01

Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the benchmark for cryptocurrency investments, delivering consistent value and stability over the years. However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly stealing the spotlight, with analysts projecting a potential 50,000% breakout. This groundbreaking token has already proven its worth, raising $1 million in just minutes during its presale. With momentum building and investor interest surging, OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM is positioning itself as the most promising crypto of 2025. What’s Driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Momentum? Record-Breaking Presale Success The demand for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has been unprecedented, with $1 million raised in minutes. This strong presale performance demonstrates overwhelming investor confidence, rivaling early excitement around XRP and SOL. Exclusive Availability Unlike XRP and SOLANA, which are widely available on major exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand and ensures that early adopters stand to gain the most from its projected breakout. Growing Investor Confidence With predictions of a 50,000% return, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has become a magnet for investors seeking exponential growth. Its strong performance and limited supply are fueling speculation that it could redefine the crypto market. How It Compares to Market Leaders Ripple (XRP): Known for its dominance in cross-border payments, XRP offers steady growth but doesn’t match the early-stage explosive potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Solana (SOL): A leader in blockchain scalability, SOL excels in speed but can’t rival the exclusivity and investor momentum driving this new token.

Some of the metrics dropping as per DefiLlama data include total value locked, app revenue, Toncoin’s price, the project’s market cap, unique daily active addresses, and DEX trading volume. The blockchain, which is best known for its tap-to-earn Telegram games, reached an all-time peak after Hamster Kombat’s launch. The game attracted over 100 million new users to the blockchain, increasing its daily active addresses. TON had also urged its validators in September last year to brace for a massive user influx as the blockchain game expanded. TON attained its highest number of addresses in September 2024 at over 1.81 million active user addresses. The blockchain also received one of the highest monthly active users at the beginning of October last year, reaching over 11.8 million users. As of February 5, the chain’s daily active wallets have dropped to a little over 200,000 and monthly users to a little over 5.1 million. Toncoin, the blockchain’s native token, hit its all-time high after Hamster Kombat’s launch in June last year, hitting $8.24. The coin has currently dropped by over 54% from its ATH, trading at $3.75 at the time of writing. Toncoin is down over 1.7% in the past 24 hours, over 22% in the past 7 days, and over 31% in the past month. TON transaction volume and profitable addresses drop Over 240,000 #Toncoin $TON have been transferred to exchanges in the past week, potentially signaling increased selling pressure as shown by on-chain data from @santimentfeed ! pic.twitter.com/FF9BBEMJzL — Ali (@ali_charts) January 29, 2025 IntoTheBlock data revealed that about 96% (over 108 million addresses) of TON holders are in losses, while only about 4% (a little over 4.2 million addresses) are in profits. The data also indicated that most investors were mostly bearish about the token. Toncoin is also receiving a lot of selling pressure, especially after the recent 240,000 Toncoin transfer to exchanges. The speculated imminent selling pressure led to the coin’s price dropping by over 2% at the end of January. TON experienced a similar sell-off after the arrest of Telegram’s CEO Pavel Durov, leading to the sale of over 800,000 TON. The DEX trading volumes and daily transaction volumes on the network increased, sparking speculations that TON holders were moving to other coins. At the time, investor confidence also dropped significantly due to the issues experienced on Telegram and the TON blockchain. Current Tonstat and DefiLlama data also indicated that the blockchain’s transaction volume and DEX volume have reduced significantly over the past few months. Transaction volumes on February 5 stood at a little over 2.7 million compared to September 18’s 18.1 million. Transactions on two major DEXs on TON, DeDust and STON.fi, have dropped to 1.746 million and 4.108 million from 3.928 million and 9.634 million, respectively. Token Terminal data highlighted that the monthly fees received by TON currently stands at a little over $1.9 million, a 10% drop from the previous month. Latest TON blockchain updates contribute to the downward spiral Telegram and $TON are going exclusive! 💕 All mini-apps on Telegram will now exclusively use TON as their blockchain infrastructure.

So let’s get on with it! 💎🚀 Also, TON Connect becomes the… pic.twitter.com/QcGN6ALmb7 — TON 💎 (@ton_blockchain) January 21, 2025 The negative metrics seen on the TON blockchain result from some of the latest updates by TON’s team to improve the network. The blockchain recently announced that it would be Telegram’s exclusive blockchain. TON demanded that all TG mini-apps would now have to use TON for their infrastructure. The developers explained that bridging apps would be exempted from the latest updates. The TON blockchain’s developers also declared TON a closed network instead of its previous open network status. TON has received backlash from users and projects on the blockchain, with some deciding to consider other networks. The TG game Frens Farm recently tweeted that it would delay its token launch after TON’s closed network update. The game further declared that it would conduct the token launch on Base instead of TON. TON blockchain has also demanded that all crypto users on TG leverage TON Connect instead of other wallets. A TON Foundation spokesperson allegedly mentioned that the messenger would not support third-party wallets after the migration. The director of Helika Ventures, Ilya Abugov, reportedly commented on the migration, saying that the change was sudden and delivered in a ‘strong protectionist way.’ Abugov mentioned that the latest blockchain updates would reduce TON’s desirability, further highlighting a reduced excitement among exchanges for TON projects. The Helika Ventures director gave an example of the recent partial HMSTR delisting on Bybit. Hamster Kombat has notably expressed interest in building its blockchain and branching from TON.

One project that is rapidly gaining attention is Lightchain AI , which has already raised $14 million in its presale at a price of $0.005625 per token. With its early success and growing investor interest, Lightchain AI is emerging as a strong contender for the next major market mover, offering a combination of cutting-edge technology and high-ROI potential. Why Low-Cap Cryptos Like Lightchain AI Offer High-Growth Potential Low-cap cryptocurrencies often offer excellent risk-reward potential, giving investors a chance to enter early before broader market adoption. Unlike well-established projects, these assets have the opportunity for exponential growth as liquidity builds and demand increases, making them an attractive option for those looking to maximize returns in the crypto space. Lightchain AI is gaining significant attention due to its strong presale momentum and growing investor interest. This early-stage project is positioning itself as a promising contender, with many speculating on its ability to deliver substantial returns. Such interest highlights the potential for rapid price appreciation as the project develops further. With the crypto market preparing for its next bullish cycle, projects like Lightchain AI could provide considerable upside. Early adoption remains key. Decentralized Governance – Lightchain AI Advantage Lightchain AI is rewriting the rules of blockchain governance with its community-first approach. Unlike Solana, which leans heavily on developer-focused tools, Lightchain AI puts power directly in the hands of its token holders. Decisions on network updates, partnerships, and the platform’s future direction are all shaped by the community—making inclusivity the core of its DNA. At the heart of this model is a cutting-edge quadratic voting system. This ensures smaller stakeholders have a louder voice while curbing the influence of large token holders, creating a fairer, more balanced power dynamic. It’s a system designed to promote transparency, diversity, and meaningful participation. But Lightchain AI doesn’t stop there. Through its governance framework, the platform actively funds community-driven initiatives like developer grants and AI projects. This not only fuels innovation but also aligns the platform’s progress with the shared vision of its users. By empowering its community, Lightchain AI offers a compelling, decentralized alternative to Solana’s more centralized strategy—one that’s built for collaboration, fairness, and a brighter future. Could Lightchain AI Be the Next Big Crypto? With $14 million raised in its presale and a strong foundation in AI-powered blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI is shaping up to be a major contender in the low-cap crypto space. As market sentiment shifts toward projects with real-world applications, Lightchain AI’s unique technology and early investor backing put it in a prime position to make significant moves once it enters the public market. For investors searching for the next high-growth opportunity, Lightchain AI’s rapid momentum suggests it could be one of the biggest success stories in the next crypto bull run. Keep an eye on this project as it continues to develop and see if it could be the market’s next major mover. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|SOL,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-07 03:00:00

He sold half of his $5 million DOGE holdings and committed $2 million to the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale , betting on a jaw-dropping 600x return in just two weeks. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Ultimate DeFi Innovation Set To Reward Investors WallitIQ (WLTQ) is not your run-of-the-mill altcoin. It is the native token of a revolutionary DeFi mega-platform that delivers superior security for crypto wallets. Using its state-of-the-art Escrow Connect feature, this trailblazing platform guarantees that every transaction is fully vetted and secure. This high level of security is further amplified by advanced biometric and facial recognition authentication , making it one of the most secure wallets in the crypto space today. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform has been meticulously designed with an intuitive interface that is modern and adaptive to individual user preferences through top-notch AI-powered behavioral analysis tools. The platform’s cutting-edge MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App integrates live market data from using the CoinGecko API, along with real-time sentiment analysis. The outstanding feature of the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform lies in its tokenomics. The platform’s native token delivers substantial utility. Investors can earn up to 180% APY by staking their tokens, making it one of the most lucrative staking opportunities in DeFi. Crypto experts predict that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token could surge by an astonishing 600x, propelling its price from the presale level of $0.0420 to $25. A $1,000 investment today could balloon to $600,000, a $10,000 investment could soar to $6 million, and a $100,000 stake might yield an eye-popping $60 million. Institutional investors and crypto whales are on alert and are already flooding the presale. With its CoinMarketCap listing , a SolidProof smart contract audit building confidence in investors, and a soon-to-launch Beta platform, the time for action is now . This is the moment to secure your stake in the token before the presale ends. The opportunity to invest at $0.0420 is fleeting, and once the market recognizes its true value, the price is expected to skyrocket. The potential for a 600x rally is too great to ignore. Snap up the tokens now and prepare for a remarkable ROI. Dogecoin: A Fading Legacy In The Face Of New Innovation Dogecoin (DOGE) once symbolized the wild, unpredictable spirit of the crypto market. Its meteoric rise during previous bull markets created countless millionaires and solidified its position as a household name. However, the current trajectory of Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of stagnation. Despite its iconic status, Dogecoin (DOGE) now appears to be a relic of a bygone era, unable to offer the robust, utility-driven benefits that modern investors demand in today’s market. While Dogecoin (DOGE) has a dedicated community and continues to generate buzz, its growth potential is limited compared to cutting-edge projects like WallitIQ (WLTQ). The trader’s decision to divest $2 million from Dogecoin (DOGE) is a clear indication that even seasoned investors recognize that DOGE may not survive the rigors of the upcoming bull market. Dogecoin’s reliance on fleeting hype and celebrity endorsements can only take it so far; without substantial technological innovation and real-world utility, its future remains uncertain. Conclusion: Seize The Opportunity With WallitIQ (WLTQ) As the 2025 bull market draws near, the window of opportunity for massive crypto gains is narrowing rapidly. While Dogecoin (DOGE) might have been the poster coin for explosive growth in the past, it’s the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token that is emerging as the leader in this new era. Investors looking to multiply their wealth cannot afford to miss the opportunity to buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token while it is selling at an affordable price of $0.0420 before it records a 600x price increase in two weeks. Institutional investors and crypto whales are already moving in, recognizing that the token is the best bet in a market where even Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are struggling to keep pace. Now is the time to act. Do not let this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity slip away.

OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM Is Gaining Momentum Fast!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-this-be-the-next-bitcoin-officialmagacoin-com-is-gaining-momentum-fast/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the cornerstone of cryptocurrency success stories, turning early adopters into millionaires. Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Kaspa (KAS) have also built strong reputations, while Arbitrum (ARB) has shown potential as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. However, a new coin, OFFICIALMAGACOIN, is now commanding the attention of savvy investors. OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Deliver 60,000% Returns OFFICIALMAGACOIN has emerged as a unique player, with a record-breaking presale raising over $1.5 million in minutes. The token is only available at officialmagacoin.com , adding an element of exclusivity that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its potential for 60,000% returns has investors speculating that it could mirror or even surpass Bitcoin’s early growth trajectory. Early-Stage Growth Potential: With its presale success, OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin poised for exponential growth. Exclusivity and Scarcity: Available only at its official website, the token creates urgency and a sense of premium access. Affordable Entry Point: At less than $0.20 per token, OFFICIALMAGACOIN provides a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. Comparing OFFICIALMAGACOIN to Competitors Bitcoin (BTC): Established but lacks the explosive growth of a new coin. Cardano (ADA): Reliable but maturing, leaving little room for exponential returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Focused on Web3 but cannot match OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s exclusivity. Kaspa (KAS): A promising blockchain but with a slower trajectory. Investors eager to secure their position in this promising token can do so exclusively at officialmagacoin.com . With market buzz intensifying, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming a top contender in the race for the next crypto millionaire-maker.

However, a potential newcomer has stepped in from the shadows of Remittix , a presale coin already making waves in the marketplace. This project has quickly crossed the $11 million mark in funding during its ICO, making one wonder whether Remittix could make a scene in the SOL and ADA dominion. Solana (SOL): A Speedy Blockchain That Continues to Impress SOL has earned a name for being one of the fastest blockchains, capable of processing about 65,000 transactions a second and having almost non-existent fees. This prowess of being fast and cheap makes SOL the favorite of dApp developers and NFT marketplace builders. But recently, Solana has been capturing increased attention from investors. Over the last three weeks, $674 million worth of SOL was bought, implying investors have returned to the scene. More importantly, SOL staking has seen an uptake; more than $62 million was staked recently. This shows that investors are buying and holding SOL over the long run a bullish indication. With the recovery of the crypto market toward maturity due to its speed and scalability, Solana is ready for the next period of acceleration. Cardano (ADA): Poised for Growth Aftermarket Liquidations Therefore, Cardano, on the other hand, is also witnessing good positive sentiment. Recently, the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, forecasted a bull run for the overall crypto market. This run is mainly triggered by the recent clearance of weak positions worth $710 billion in liquidations. According to Hoskinson, many over-leveraged positions in the market were eliminated in clearing these positions, leaving behind a stronger reservoir for future purposes. This positive sentiment is especially good news for Cardano (ADA), which has had its share of experiences down the competitive blockchain road. However, seeing new ecosystems being built upon the Cardano network, coupled with recent bullish predictions for the market, gives ADA investors some good incentive for optimism about the future. With ADA improving its strong fundamentals, it may be positioned to shine in the forthcoming crypto bull market. Remittix: A New ICO That’s Gaining Traction Seems like something new. Remittix has carved itself a path with its distinct selling point amid Solana’s dominance especially in that of Cardano. Altogether, Remittix is on the rise for cryptocurrency-to-FIAT transactions but mostly for its emphasis on financial inclusion. Fusing decentralized finance with real-life applications, Remittix attempts to fill gaps in the market not yet fully addressed by either SOL or ADA. Another noteworthy point will be the race at which Remittix is being adapted. With over $11 million already raised in the presale, 57% of the total tokens on offer have already been sold. Some degree of such confidence indicates high confidence on the part of investors in Remittix and its potential appeal in the future. The project’s interest in making blockchain solutions more mainstream and easily applicable to the real world is quite in tune with investors’ craving for the next big thing in the crypto space. As the ICO calendar pulsates with presale projects, Remittix distinguishes itself from the crowd. This is not just another meme token but a bona fide effort to bring crypto-to-FIAT solutions into the limelight. Whether Remittix becomes an alternative to Solana and Cardano is certainly yet to be seen; what is certain is that this new contender has the promise of leaving its mark. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Blockchain and Investment The Solana and Cardano war for blockchain supremacy is not quite done and now Remittix has injected some new energy into this ecosystem. SOL and ADA are existent and thriving, while Remittix has taken a new and interesting path by focusing on crypto-to-FIAT solutions and financial inclusion. With an initial coin offering of 11 million dollars already raised, Remittix shows there is still room for new entrants, even in giant-dominated markets. Will it develop its Remittix niche or become another hyped project that quietly disappears? Investors are surely watching closely while the ICO calendar keeps changing. It will likely become the next big thing.

ETH is now struggling to clear the $2,880 and $2,920 resistance levels. Ethereum started a decent upward move above the $2,620 zone. The price is trading below $2,750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,800 level. Ethereum Price Recovery Could Soon Fade Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $2,550 level, like Bitcoin . ETH was able to surpass the $2,600 and $2,620 resistance levels to move into a short-term positive zone. The price was able to surpass the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,400 swing high to the $2,120 swing low. However, the bears seem to be active below the $2,880 and $2,920 resistance levels. The price is again moving lower. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,770 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The first major resistance is near the $2,800 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,920 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,400 swing high to the $2,120 swing low. A clear move above the $2,920 resistance might send the price toward the $3,000 resistance. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,050 resistance zone or even $3,120 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,800 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,630 level. The first major support sits near the $2,600 zone. A clear move below the $2,600 support might push the price toward the $2,500 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

Bitcoin Network Activity Drops As Market Consolidates Data from CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Network Activity Index shows that activity has declined by 15% from its peak in November 2024. As of February 5, the Index stands at 3,760, marking its lowest level in the past year. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Hour RSI Hits Oversold Zone – Is A BTC Rebound Near? The decline in network activity is primarily attributed to a sharp drop in the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network. From an all-time high (ATH) of 734,000 transactions in September 2024, the total daily transaction count has fallen by 53% to 346,000. According to CryptoQuant, this downturn in BTC network activity is largely driven by a decline in the use of the Runes Protocol for minting tokens on the blockchain. The post explains: This is evident in the total daily number of OP RETURN codes in Bitcoin transactions, which the RUNES protocol uses to write data about token mints and transfers on the network. When the RUNES protocol emerged in April 2024, the daily number of OP RETURN codes spiked to 802K. However, the number of OP RETURN code has plummeted since, with only 10K OP RETURN codes used. For the uninitiated, The Runes Protocol is a new token standard for BTC, designed to enable fungible token creation directly on the network without requiring off-chain data or complex smart contracts. It aims to be more efficient and scalable than previous Bitcoin tokenization methods like Ordinals and BRC-20. Further evidence of reduced network activity is visible in Bitcoin mempool traffic. The total number of pending transactions waiting to be confirmed in a Bitcoin block has plummeted by 99%, from 287,000 in December 2024 to just 3,000 as of February 5, 2025. Notably, this is the lowest level of mempool traffic since March 2022. Is BTC Overvalued At Current Price? The analysis suggests that, based on network activity, Bitcoin’s fair value currently falls between $48,000 and $95,000. This implies that BTC’s current market price of around $98,000 may be overvalued. Related Reading: Bitcoin Withstands DeepSeek Dip And FOMC Volatility – How Close Is A New ATH? However, another CryptoQuant contributor argues that the current Bitcoin price presents a strong buying opportunity for investors looking to dollar-cost average their holdings. Similarly, another analyst suggests that BTC’s recent market performance indicates it is in the distribution phase of the market cycle. Despite short-term concerns, the long-term outlook for BTC remains bullish. A Standard Chartered executive recently predicted that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. At press time, BTC trades at $97,914, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

The summit saw the announcement from World Liberty Financial (WLF), a crypto project supported by the Trump family, which has recently invested in Ondo Finance’s native cryptocurrency. This move signals the Trump family’s commitment to expanding their presence in the cryptocurrency space. Additionally, WLF has recently made investments in various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, and others, and has purchased approximately $470,000 worth of ONDO tokens. As part of a broader strategy, the company is preparing to launch the “Ondo Chain,” a layer-one blockchain designed for tokenized assets. Chase Herro, co-founder of WLF, also shared exciting developments, including plans for the launch of a “strategic reserve” of crypto assets. The reserve will provide further liquidity and support for the crypto ecosystem, offering investors more diverse opportunities in a growing market.

Get Ready.,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/last-24-hours-this-next-100x-crypto-ends-its-ico-on-friday-get-ready/,"The post Last 24 Hours—This Next 100X Crypto Ends Its ICO on Friday. Get Ready. appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News There are just 24 hours left before the Dogizen ICO concludes this Friday, 7th February . Anticipating Dogizen as a future leader in the fast-growing Telegram gaming market, early investors have already poured $3.8m into its presale—the first-ever held on Telegram. Some think DOGIZ will be the next 100x crypto in 2025. Let’s find out why. Why Dogizen is primed for growth Dogizen is a new Telegram gaming project doing something no other project has ever done before: allowing investors to buy directly inside Telegram, tapping into a 950-million-strong user base that can invest in and claim tokens without ever leaving the app. First-movers tend to make history in this market, and Dogizen’s status as the first Telegram ICO could be key to becoming the next 100x crypto. Dogizen’s goal is to use the success of its revenue-generating game, launched last year to an audience of 1.4 million players, and build a full-fledged Telegram gaming ecosystem known as the Dogizen Universe, complete with developer tools, in-game economies, and a launchpad for new projects. Just as WeChat mini-games have dominated in China, regularly seeing over half a billion monthly users , Telegram games are increasingly popular. The network was home to 21% of all Web3 game launches last year, with titles like Hamster Kombat, Catizen, and Notcoin reaching mainstream fame. Hamster Kombat even angered Iranian authorities for disrupting an election. In the context of a GameFi market set to hit $200 billion by 2034 , Telegram is the next frontier. And while its competitors launched in the chop of Q2 and Q3 2024, Dogizen is set to ride the momentum of the 2025 bull run, just in time for the next explosion in Telegram gaming. Dogizen has plenty of room to climb post-ICO The numbers don’t lie: Dogizen’s presale has already raised $3.8m, indicating how bullish investors are in its vision. Many expect DOGIZ to be a prime target for a Binance listing, given the exchange listed several of Dogizen’s competitors in 2024. Importantly, Dogizen is laying the foundation for longevity. Unlike Catizen and Hamster Kombat, which relied on airdrops that tanked their prices at launch, Dogizen’s ICO model produces a community made up of actual investors, not just opportunists waiting to farm free airdrop money. Plus, Dogizen’s long-term incentive structure of 101% APY staking rewards and a revenue-sharing model further encourage token holding rather than dumping. Then there’s the market cap—Dogizen will go live shortly after 7th February with a market cap under $10 million. Considering other Telegram gaming projects have soared past $1 billion in the past , that means plenty of room for exponential growth as the market realizes what Dogizen is building. Even at $200 million, early backers could realize +20x gains; at $1 billion, DOGIZ will fulfill the next 100x crypto predictions. The clock is ticking: Dogizen’s ICO is about to close It’s clear that Telegram gaming is set to thrive in 2025. It nailed it in 2024 despite a relatively lackluster market compared to today. With crypto about to go fully mainstream under the new Trump administration, it could be the biggest growth market in mobile gaming. Launching at the perfect time with a low market cap and an ambition to become the go-to Telegram gaming hub, DOGIZ could well be the next 100x crypto. There are just 24 hours left in the presale—don’t miss the last chance to be an early adopter. The Dogizen presale is underway.

The price is moving lower and might struggle to stay above $2.250. XRP price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $2.80 level. The price is now trading below $2.60 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.60 resistance zone. XRP Price Moves Lower XRP price started a recovery wave above the $2.20 support zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum .

If XRP fails to clear the $2.50 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.260 level. The next major support is near the $2.1450 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1.750 swing low to the $2.780 high.

The filing, submitted under the 19B4 rule, is on behalf of WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, four firms aiming to launch exchange-traded products that track XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This filing represents the second part of a two-step process for launching a crypto ETF. Once acknowledged by the SEC, the proposal will be published in the Federal Register, officially starting the agency’s approval process. Industry experts predict that with a pro-crypto administration and the upcoming new SEC chair, the approval of XRP spot ETFs could happen as early as this year. “The Exchange believes that approving this proposal (and comparable proposals) provides the Commission with the opportunity to allow U.S. investors with access to XRP in a regulated and transparent exchange traded vehicle that would act to limit risk to U.S. investors,” the filing said. Unlike previous crypto ETFs, XRP lacks an established futures market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a key component in the SEC’s decision-making process for Bitcoin and Ethereum approvals. To increase the likelihood of approval, WisdomTree, one of the filing firms, is implementing safeguards such as sourcing XRP from secondary markets rather than Ripple Labs, avoiding any direct ties with the company at the center of the SEC’s legal battle. Firms Rely on Ripple’s Partial Victory Against SEC Interest in XRP ETFs has increased after Ripple Labs won a partial legal victory in July 2023, with a favorable ruling in its ongoing SEC lawsuit. This legal outcome has been referenced in ETF applications. As the approval process for these ETFs continues, there is growing anticipation that a wave of institutional investment could flood into the market. The launch of XRP ETFs, along with similar products targeting top cryptocurrencies like Solana, would offer investors greater exposure to the digital asset space.

According to a tweet from Solana validator Stakewiz, “MEV rewards now account for ~4% of the 11-12% APY stakers on Solana can earn.” The tweet explained that Solana stakers attached to validators with an MEV commission of 100% are being cheated out of almost 40% of the total rewards they should have earned. The drama goes back to the end of 2024 when Melea faced accusations from the Atlas staking team who accused them of misleading advertising by claiming a 0% commission rate, which is technically impossible as it contradicts the Cosmos Hub’s minimum commission requirement of 5%. There have been several tries to verify Melea’s claims. However, no concrete evidence of the 0% commission structure was found. An urgent message to Melea stakers Another tweet from Stakewiz contained an urgent message for the validator’s stakers. “Are you aware you’re not earning any MEV rewards despite Melea’s promise a few weeks ago to charge no MEV commission?” The post began. “He’s deleted that tweet now but how do you feel about a validator promising a 0% fee then yanking it up almost immediately to 100%?” The post urged readers to verify for themselves that 400+ SOL per epoch could be going to stakers by checking Jito’s reporting . Interested stakers can search for Melea’s vote account “GvZEwtCHZ7YtCkQCaLRVEXsyVvQkRDhJhQgB6akPme1e” and sort by epoch descending to see the change in MEV commission. “Stakers are often not checking on their validators daily, but if they knew, would they be happy?” The Stakewiz post continued. “How do we raise awareness of these behaviors?” “FWIW if you want to charge 100% MEV commission, that’s fine, you won’t be competitive on APY but you’re 100% entitled to do so, but don’t advertise a 0% fee then change it to 100% on-chain without further announcement!” the post concluded . Melea may have a history of misleading stakers In a separate tweet in the thread posted by Stakewiz, there was a link to a forum post on Cosmos addressing another instance of Melea falsely advertising commissions. In the post, Melea was accused of “actively promoting itself as a 0% commission validator, which is technically impossible on the Cosmos Hub.” The various attempts to verify Melea’s claims failed, and there is no on-chain data showing a rebate of any kind or funds sent to delegators from the validator wallet. The report added that if Melea was indeed charging the minimum 5% commission while advertising 0%, delegators were being misled and cheated without their knowledge or consent. Several problems with Melea’s website also contributed to their potential deceptive practices. Included in the report was also a mention of Melea’s previously questionable practices on other networks, including accusations on Solana of advertising false APY rates and making misleading claims about returns. It also has a history of advertising 0% commission while delivering suboptimal validator performance. They called on Melea to “provide clear, verifiable proof of their 0% commission claim on the Cosmos Hub since the v15 software upgrade that hard-coded 5% as minimum validator commission.” If unable to do so, they urged the accused validator to immediately correct all advertising and communications to reflect the actual commission rate and offer a public explanation to the community regarding the discrepancy. The report was from October 2024. An update followed in November 2024 that saw the community propose penalties for Melea’s actions. Some of the recommended penalties included: Temporary suspension from voting on network proposals Financial penalty: 100% tax on staking rewards: Public apology and rectification Possible tombstoning for failure to comply with the above Community actions were also suggested to prevent future misconduct. They included: Banning of all advertising and promotional content from on-chain monikers. Developing a community-maintained index that ranks validators based on their transparency, honesty, and performance. Launching educational campaigns to help delegators learn how to compare and select validators when choosing where to stake their tokens. Enlisting the wallet providers and their teams to implement strategies to improve decentralization. The accused validator is unapologetic despite being outed The initial Cosmos Hub report and response from the validator community were from 2024. However, Melea’s alleged dubious practices have continued into the new year, which is why Stakewiz, a company that constantly tracks all on-chain data relating to validators and logs this, is once again calling attention to the matter. Additional tweets from Stakewiz’s X account contained image proof that Melea has continued advertising 0% MEV commission even though it is impossible. Screenshots of Melea’s tweets advertising unsustainable rewards to stakers. Source: @laine_sa_ (X/Twitter) There is even one ad from January 19, just two weeks ago, according to Stakewiz. Melea reportedly first raised its MEV commission to 50% in epoch 731, starting January 23, four days later. When they called the validator out on Discord, they did not seem apologetic or remorseful but instead urged those complaining to “gfy,” short for “go f**k yourself.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",Solana News & Market Updates|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-07 04:47:02

With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1.5 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity. With its affordable price, exclusivity, and massive growth potential, it’s a must-watch for 2025. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and stay updated on their journey via Twitter/X.

The analyst also revealed the price level, which he believes is ideal for market participants to buy and hold XRP. XRP Price Eyes 40% Gains As Analyst Reveals Key Level In a TradingView post, ProjectSyndicate predicted that the XRP price could witness a 40% move to the upside soon enough. This came following his analysis of XRP’s 4-hour chart. He noted that the outlook remains bullish despite the current pullback in progress. The analyst added that buying low is still a perfect trade setup with low risk. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Descending Triangle On The Daily Chart, Why $1.95 Is Important Project Syndicate remarked that the price is currently in correction mode after the retest of the all-time high. He added that there is limited upside at the current market price of $2.50. In line with this, he asserted that the pullback isn’t complete and predicted that XRP could still drop to as low as $2 before it records the 40% gains that he predicted. Based on his strategy of buying low, he recommended that market participants should look to buy and hold the crypto when its price drops to $2. He also advised that they should take profit when XRP records the 40% gains as it rebounds to $2.80. The XRP price has suffered one of the worst pullbacks among the major caps amid the current bearish sentiment in the crypto market. As a result, XRP has also lost its spot as the third-largest crypto by market cap, dropping to number four behind USDT. However, amid this pullback, crypto analyst ColdBloodedCharter has also stated that now is a great opportunity to accumulate XRP. He highlighted $2.50, between $2.25 and $2.30, and between $1.90 and $2 as buy-the-dip levels that “make sense.” This Pullback Could Be The Final Low Before Liftoff In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades raised the possibility of this pullback being the final low before a price liftoff. She asserted that there has been no change to the overall bullish setup on XRP, although the crypto is now targetting Wave 3 down extensions at $2.16, $1.87, and $1.57 for the next major support. Related Reading: XRP’s Price Breakout Sets The Tone For A Historic Bull Run To A New All-Time High The crypto analyst opined that the XRP price is in the fifth wave of C within an ABC pattern for a large Wave 2. She added that the sell-off massively extended the asset past C targets, but the pattern still needs to be completed. With this development, CasiTrades stated that this means that XRP could be at the final low before a massive Wave 3 up begins. She added that this would send the altcoin past previous all-time highs (ATHs) with minimal resistance. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.45, down almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Similarly, VVV, which was valued at over $18 at the end of January, is down 67% and is currently trading around $5.82. Graph showing the decline in VVV. In early January, Binance introduced perpetual futures for ai16z, which the associated decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) has since rebranded as ElizaOS. Later that month, the exchange listed perpetual futures for VVV, the native token of the AskVenice AI infrastructure platform. Related News: Top FED Members Commented on Bitcoin, Cryptocurrencies and Interest Rates “Binance’s perpetual futures listings have become a death trap for many recently launched tokens, from ai16z to vine,” Arete Capital co-founder Ilya Paveliev said in a statement. “Instead of encouraging healthy price discovery, these listings create an easy path for investors to aggressively short tokens while offloading their spot holdings.” Unlike spot markets, perpetual futures allow investors to make significant market impact with relatively little capital. While spot prices reflect organic buying demand, perpetual futures can allow large investors to manipulate prices downward, according to Paveliev. “Market makers who are supposed to ensure stability often back away after listing and let prices fall,” he added. Paveliev argued that offering perpetual futures for tokens with low liquidity exacerbates price volatility and favors short-term traders over long-term holders. “Binance Alpha’s model prioritizes hype over fundamentals by following AI and memecoin trends, leaving retail investors vulnerable,” he said. *This was not investment advice.

The price is rising and might aim for a fresh move toward the $635 resistance. BNB price is struggling to clear the $585 resistance zone. The price is now trading near $580 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $578 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $560 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes Fresh Surge After a decent increase, BNB price struggled to settle above the $620 level. It started a pullback from the $619 high, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a drop below the $600 support zone. The price even dived below the $580 level. A low was formed at $559 and the price recently started a decent recovery wave. There was a move above the $570 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $619 swing high to the $559 low. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $578 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading near $580 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $590 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $619 swing high to the $559 low. The next resistance sits near the $595 level. A clear move above the $595 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $605. A close above the $605 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $620 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $632 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $590 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $570 level. The next major support is near the $560 level. The main support sits at $540. If there is a downside break below the $540 support, the price could drop toward the $532 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $510 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone.

With Bitcoin and most altcoins in the red over the last week, now could be the perfect time to pivot toward utility-focused ICO tokens showing high growth potential. Here are 5 of the best crypto presales to buy before the next bull run. Solaxy The top crypto presale on our list is Solaxy ($SOLX) , the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution designed for the Solana network. While Solana has already gained recognition for its high throughput, its rapid growth has sometimes caused network congestion. Solaxy addresses this problem by offloading transactions and bundling operations off-chain. As a result, it helps to reduce congestion and failed transactions—two major pain points that cause widespread disruption during peak Solana network activity. The project’s native SOLX cryptocurrency fuels every transaction on the Solaxy platform. You can buy SOLX for just $0.001626, but this price will soon increase in the next presale round. Solaxy has plans to launch an Ethereum-Solana bridge, to enable seamless interaction between the two blockchains. As more developers use Solaxy’s Layer 2 infrastructure, demand for SOLX will gradually increase. Solaxy plans to list SOLX on major crypto exchanges in Q2 or Q3 of this year. However, since it has quickly raised over $18 million during its presale alone, SOLX could list much sooner. Buyers can also stake their SOLX during the presale for an APY of up to 220% pa. Visit Solaxy Presale MIND of Pepe Next on our list of the best crypto presales is MIND of Pepe ($MIND) , a brand-new Pepe-themed meme coin ICO. Its team has created an advanced AI agent that analyzes market sentiment and identifies social media trends. MIND of Pepe’s AI will interact with the crypto community and influencers on X and Telegram. Applying automated real-time sentiment analysis eliminates the burden of guesswork for the project’s community. Since this AI is aligned with the latest market trends and sentiment, it has a significant edge over static trading bots. MIND token holders will gain access to the AI’s curated content, alpha calls, and market intelligence—potentially spotting the next big token before it goes mainstream or hits exchanges. The MIND token presale has raised $5.2 million in less than a month. Early buyers have a limited window to buy MIND at its current price of $0.0032662, as this price will increase in the next presale round. You can also stake your MIND tokens for up to 430% APY, even while the presale continues. Visit MIND of Pepe Presale Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is another popular crypto presale that’s attracting smart money. This token is native to Best Wallet, a leading crypto wallet and all-round Web3 platform that simplifies trading, staking, and access to new token launches within a single smartphone app. Since it eliminates the hassle of juggling multiple apps, Best Wallet has gained massive traction and already has over 250,000 monthly active users. A major reason for its growing momentum is its multi-chain support, which allows users to connect with 60+ blockchain networks. The wallet also has a dedicated “Upcoming Tokens” section that highlights high-potential vetted crypto ICOs. BEST holders get exclusive early access to these presales, increasing their potential for massive gains. Early investor confidence in BEST tokens is high, as the presale has quickly raised over $9.1 million. The BEST tokens are currently priced at only $0.023875 each, with the next price increase set to occur soon. By holding BEST tokens, users can also unlock perks like lower transaction fees, higher staking rewards, and governance votes. You can stake BEST tokens even before the presale ends for up to 180% APY. Visit Best Wallet Token Presale Meme Index Meme Index ($MEMEX) is the first project to redefine how we invest in meme coins by offering an index-based approach. It does this with an innovative, ETF-like structure. By grouping various meme tokens into themed indexes (Moonshot, Titan, Midcap, and Frenzy), which are accessible only using the MEMEX crypto, Meme Index allows investors to diversify their investments with a single token. Each index offers a different balance of potential risk and reward, allowing you to choose the ones that fit your investment strategy. MEMEX token holders also have governance rights over these indexes, so you can vote on which tokens should be part of each index. Having raised over $3.3 million thus far, MEMEX is clearly on investors’ radar. You can currently stake your MEMEX tokens for a high APY of up to 670% pa. The platform has reserved 25% of its total supply for staking rewards. Meme Index’s recently launched presale offers MEMEX tokens for just $0.0159077 each—but this price will quickly increase during future presale rounds. Visit Meme Index Presale Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has become one of the hottest meme coin presales of 2025 after raising $70 million in its ongoing ICO. While many Pepe-themed tokens rely solely on viral memes, Wall Street Pepe offers an ecosystem geared toward retail traders who want to outsmart crypto whales. The project’s “WEPE Army” community empowers token holders with access to exclusive market insights, helping them trade like the pros. Members of the WEPE Army will also receive alerts about all the hottest high-potential tokens. Such an approach will ensure that retail investors can make more informed decisions, rather than being left behind by the market’s biggest players. Early buyers now have a final window of 10 days to buy WEPE for $0.0003665. But looking at Wall Street Pepe’s current momentum, the tokens could easily sell out even faster. Token holders can also earn passive income by staking their WEPE for up to 18% APY.

40023466,https://coinpedia.org/?p=416710,1738905353,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,How UNOMEME Is Set to Dominate the Meme Coin Market Ahead of BONK and Dogwifhat in 2025,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/how-unomeme-is-set-to-dominate-the-meme-coin-market/,"The post How UNOMEME Is Set to Dominate the Meme Coin Market Ahead of BONK and Dogwifhat in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When the crypto markets get going in February 2025, a new contender is poised to take the crown. Forget about the chaotic rise of BONK or the quirky charm of Dogwifhat ($WIF); the meme coin market is about to meet its match with UNOMEME ($UNOMAI) . More than just another digital asset chasing the limelight, UNOMEME is a comprehensive ecosystem aiming to unite and elevate meme coins like never before. A New Era for Meme Coins? Meme coins have always thrived on chaos, but UNOMEME introduces something that feels almost paradoxical: order. With the full name of the “United Nations of Memes,” this revolutionary project has its fair share of audacity and ambition. By creating a unified governance structure for fragmented meme communities, $UNOMAI is rewriting the rules of engagement. Instead of siloed tribes waging their own wars, UNOMEME invites them to come together under one banner, pooling liquidity, influence, and purpose. BONK may have stolen the spotlight in its breakout moment, and Dogwifhat has charmed the internet with its canine flair, but neither comes close to the strategic depth of UNOMEME’s ecosystem. At its core are three pillars that are impossible to ignore: The Trading Parliament Offering up to 1000x leverage and cross-chain market access, this feature isn’t just for show. It’s a turbocharged platform for traders looking to dominate meme coin markets, giving them tools BONK and $WIF never dreamed of. The Universal Bridge Ethereum and Solana have long been rivals in the meme space. $UNOMAI’s Universal Bridge connects these chains and provides lightning-fast transfers and minimal fees. It’s the glue that holds this ecosystem together, making liquidity fragmentation a thing of the past. The Prosperity Program High-yield staking at 35% APY, daily profit-sharing, and community privileges mean that this isn’t just about speculative gains. It’s a passive income powerhouse designed to reward loyalty. The Competition: BONK and Dogwifhat For all their appeal, BONK and Dogwifhat are products of the old meme coin world. BONK capitalized on the novelty of being Solana’s first dog coin, but its lack of long-term strategy has left investors guessing about sustainability. Dogwifhat brought some charm with viral marketing, NFTs, and its cute behatted canine mascot, but beyond the surface, there’s little to keep serious investors interested. By contrast, UNOMEME doesn’t need gimmicks to stay relevant. It builds on the strengths of its competitors while addressing their glaring flaws. Where BONK struggled with liquidity, UNOMEME’s Universal Bridge solves the problem with ease. Where Dogwifhat relied on fleeting social media trends, UNOMEME’s structured governance ensures long-term growth and stability. Why $UNOMAI Is the Market Leader in Waiting UNOMEME isn’t a flash in the pan; it’s a calculated play for dominance in a space notorious for its volatility. Its tokenomics reflect this foresight, with 30% of supply allocated to staking rewards, 47.5% dedicated to infrastructure development, and the rest split among marketing, liquidity, and technical innovation. This is about establishing an ecosystem early. The roadmap, spanning from the initial formation of the United Nations of Memes to the global domination of meme markets, reads like a manifesto for long-term success. The Future Belongs to UNOMEME It’s tempting to dismiss $UNOMAI as just another name in a crowded market, but that would be a mistake.

Decoding the Bearish Signals and Altcoin Sell-Off : 10x Research appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is showing signs of weakness, as it is fluctuating between $95,850 and $97,729 in the past hour. It holds a market value of $1.917 trillion with a global trading volume of $47.52 billion. Its daily price range has been between $95,850 and $99,131, currently sitting 11% below its all-time high.

Reacting to the recent geo-political scenario’s, Bitcoin is struggling to maintain its bullish level of $100K. Looking at the loophole, 10x Research pointing out a bearish trend that started on February 2. Their analysis highlights a “Diamond Top” pattern, which often signals that prices might fall after a period of growth. This suggests Bitcoin could lose some of its gains since its November rally. Bitcoin was close to breaking out, targeting $105,500, but a few things changed the game. U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs added a layer of uncertainty, shaking investor confidence. At the same time, the Federal Reserve’s tough stance on interest rates made traders even more cautious. As a result, many investors are holding back, waiting for better market conditions before diving back in. Ethereum’s Impact on the Market While Bitcoin tried to bounce back, Ethereum experienced a sharp drop, adding to the crypto market’s instability. Despite Eric Trump supporting ETH, this decline was mainly due to complex trading strategies like option gamma hedging and futures liquidations, which can cause big price swings. Interestingly, past large Ethereum sell-offs haven’t led to strong recoveries, hinting that the crypto market could still be under pressure. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Altcoins? A recent flash crash triggered by new tariffs imposed by Donald Trump caused a massive sell-off across stocks, commodities, and crypto. The biggest hit was taken by altcoins, with the total market cap dropping from $1.46 trillion at the end of January to $1 trillion by February 3, wiping out $460 billion in value. In the meanwhile Bitcoin’s rising dominance is also directing towards delayed altcoin season. In the meanwhile Trump’s administrations comments to focus more on stablecoins is breaking the confidence of investors on alarge scale. While Bitcoin Reserve Plan is becoming less prominent in Trump’s 100 days strategy. With weak technical signals and ongoing economic uncertainty, Bitcoin might soon experience more price drops. Some believe the market might stabilize, while others think there could be more downside ahead. For now, it’s a wait-and-watch game as traders stay cautious, looking for signs of a potential turnaround.",News|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|ZRX|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-07 05:18:23

It appears that DeepSeek’s hype has erased concerns of trade wars among Chinese investors, due to which China’s tech stocks in Hong Kong continue to surge. According to a report by Bloomberg , this price movement suggests a technical bull market for China’s tech stocks, as Lenovo, Li Auto, and Xiaomi have taken the lead. Due to the hype around DeepSeek, investors are more confident about China’s tech companies despite trade wars concerns. Regarding this, Sat Duhra from Janus Henderson Investors said, “The recent DeepSeek announcement is a timely reminder that behind the scenes, industrial policy has pushed many sectors toward world-class status.” Stock markets remained stable as Washington announced gentler trade restrictions against China. Wall Street brokers have also shifted to optimistic predictions regarding the tech industry.

Despite being down from its all-time high, whale activity and on-chain data suggest a potential comeback in 2025. At the same time, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could emerge as a potential game-changer for Bitcoin. As a Layer-2 solution, it could bring instant transactions, lower fees, and Ethereum compatibility, which could solve Bitcoin’s biggest bottlenecks. Here’s a closer look at both projects. How High Can $PEPE Go In 2025? Pepe (PEPE) is trading at approximately $0.00001406, up 6.5% increase over the past 24 hours. The 24-hour trading volume is around $1.34 billion. One of the most notable recent events for Pepe was a massive whale trade — an early investor turned just $3,000 into over $51 million by selling off 500 billion PEPE tokens. The PEPE team recently transferred 170 billion tokens, with a significant portion sent to Binance. Despite being down 60% from its all-time high, PEPE’s 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) suggests that the token might be in a prime accumulation phase. On-chain data shows that more PEPE is moving into private wallets rather than exchanges. If this trend continues, combined with a broader crypto market recovery, PEPE could see a strong comeback in the months ahead. Crypto analyst Hovsep Markhinov predicts that PEPE could reach $0.000049 in February, $0.000091 in March, and, in an extremely bullish scenario, $0.00048. How PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Supercharge Bitcoin With Instant Transactions, Lower Fees, and Seamless Ethereum Integration Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, but it still faces major hurdles — slow transactions, high fees, and congestion. Networks like Ethereum and Solana have introduced solutions to scale efficiently, but Bitcoin hasn’t fully adopted innovations that could make it more practical for everyday use. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) , a cutting-edge Layer-2 solution, aims to change that by potentially making Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and more adaptable. PlutoChain could work alongside Bitcoin to speed up transactions and reduce congestion without altering the blockchain’s core structure. Instead of Bitcoin’s usual 10-minute confirmation time, PlutoChain offers block times of just two seconds using its Layer-2 technology. This boost could make Bitcoin more viable for daily payments, remittances, and microtransactions — areas where it has struggled due to long wait times and high costs. Beyond speed, PlutoChain could significantly cut transaction fees. By lowering costs, it could remove a major barrier for both individuals and businesses looking to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions. With cheaper and faster processing, Bitcoin could finally become a practical payment method instead of just a store of value. What sets PlutoChain apart is its seamless cross-chain compatibility. As a fully Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible network, it could allow Ethereum-based applications — including DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and AI-driven projects — to integrate directly with Bitcoin. During its testnet phase, PlutoChain has proven its potential by successfully processing 43,200 transactions in a single day without any network disruptions. Security is also a top priority. The platform has undergone extensive audits by SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi. Additionally, PlutoChain performs regular code reviews and stress tests to make sure its network is stable and resilient. Another standout feature of PlutoChain is its decentralized governance model. Rather than relying on centralized decision-making, it allows the community to propose and vote on upgrades, partnerships, and key protocol changes. With instant transactions, dramatically lower fees, seamless Ethereum integration, and community-driven governance, PlutoChain could be the key to making Bitcoin truly scalable, efficient, and ready for mass adoption. The Bottom Line Recent whale activity and on-chain data show $PEPE could reclaim lost ground and surge to new highs in 2025. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could be an effective Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin. With near-instant transactions, lower fees, and Ethereum compatibility, PlutoChain could be the key to solving Bitcoin’s scalability issues. —————— Remember, this article is not financial or trading advice.

The large-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $38.4 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $1.58 billion, has dropped over 25 percent in the past few days to trade around 26 cents on Thursday, February 6, during the early New York session. DOGE Price Expectations Dogecoin price, in the daily time frame, has been trapped in a correction mode since hitting a local high of around $0.48 in early December 2024. From a technical analysis standpoint, Dogecoin price has been forming a bullish pennant, through an ABC correction. The recent Dogecoin price selloff to 20 cents retested the lower border of a falling trend, thus signaling a potential rebound akin to the mid-December rebound. Moreover, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been hovering around the oversold levels for the past week. With the 200-day Moving Average (MA) acting as a support level, the DOGE price is well primed for a rebound toward the all-time high in the near future. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Terra Luna Classic Records 21% Drop Despite 1.6 billion LUNC Burn: What’s Next for LUNC Price? , Renewed Interest in Dogecoin from Whale Investors Whales seized the opportunity during the recent dip, buying 750 million #Dogecoin $DOGE !

As a result, the Dogecoin whale investors in this category hold over 23.2 billion DOGE coins. The launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin on the Solana network has instilled significant confidence in the meme industry. With Dogecoin having gained significant traction in the past decease, which involves miners and enterprises accepting it for payments, the dog-themed memecoin is well positioned to rally further ahead. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Analysts Say Likely!,https://timestabloid.com/will-coinbase-list-1st-gamblefi-token-as-it-nears-the-end-of-its-presale/,"Rollblock (RBLK) , an innovative GambleFi project, is gaining widespread market interest as its presale explodes. The innovative platform shows fast growth in the crypto gaming industry and is attracting thousands of investors as analysts predict it will list on major exchanges soon. The Rollblock presale has generated over $10 million in funding and experts project RBLK will surge by 50x post-launch. Here’s why it could be the next big thing. Rollblock: The Next Big Thing in Crypto Gaming Rollblock aims to restructure online gaming by implementing a transparent blockchain recording system that saves every Ethereum network trade. The platform implements a secure system that enhances transparency to resolve decades-old trust problems across the $500 billion global gaming market. All bids on the platform undergo verification from players to maintain both security and fairness. In December alone, Rollblock experienced an astonishing 600% surge in new user signups and over $1.75 million in wagers across its portfolio of 7,000+ classic games. This surge reflects growing confidence in Rollblock’s ability to deliver a best-in-class gaming experience, supported by AI-driven features and immersive live dealer modes that simulate the excitement of real-world casinos.

RBLK token holders can access up to 30% APY returns through the project’s revenue share mode. Each week, Rollblock will use 30% of its weekly earnings to repurchase $RBLK tokens. 60% of the tokens will be burned to maintain scarcity, and 40% will go toward rewarding stakeholders, fostering growth, and token value appreciation. The recent launch of Rollblock’s sports prediction league has added another layer of excitement, enabling live betting on thousands of sporting events globally. This feature has resonated with the community, further solidifying Rollblock’s position as a versatile and dynamic platform in the GambleFi space. Why Analysts Predict Coinbase Will List the GambleFi Token Several factors make Rollblock a strong candidate for a Coinbase listing. First, the token’s rapid adoption and presale numbers signal strong market demand. Coinbase typically looks for assets with high liquidity and a large, engaged user base, both of which are evident in Rollblock’s growth. Second, Rollblock’s robust security infrastructure aligns with Coinbase’s strict listing criteria. The platform uses Ethereum’s blockchain for transparent transactions and has undergone complete audits to guarantee the security of user funds. This commitment to security and compliance builds a strong foundation that improves the Rollblock’s chance to obtain exchange approval. Third, the potential for revenue generation through Rollblock’s innovative staking model is another attractive feature. These mechanisms foster a sustainable ecosystem, which is a key consideration for exchanges like Coinbase. The Final Countdown: Presale Insights The current price of RBLK during Stage 10 of the presale is $0.053 as the market demand continues to grow steadily. This price will likely surge in the upcoming weeks before the presale ends, giving investors a unique chance to secure a piece of the $540 billion crypto-gaming market.

Their search for solutions has led them to hire staff outside the US. There has been a recent trend of tech companies expanding their workforce internationally to gain flexibility to meet their artificial intelligence goals while maintaining cost efficiency. Companies like Salesforce Inc. and Workday Inc. are in this category. They have reportedly been reducing their US-based staff, replacing them with employees from India, Mexico and Costa Rica. This strategy is at odds with President Donald Trump’s “America first” agenda as it fails to prioritize American workers and relies on foreign labor. More companies are adopting this strategy in a bid to maintain their position in the competitive global market. Mass layoffs at Salesforce Inc. and Workday Inc. The demand for artificial intelligence solutions intensifies by the minute, and with the constant growth and integration of the technology into every notable industry, tech companies are pushed to invest in order not to miss out on the AI wave. However, the primary focus of these companies remains maintaining profitability. One popular strategy among these companies is hiring in international markets, particularly in regions with skilled labor pools and lower operational costs than in the West. Salesforce Inc. has decreased its US-based workforce from 58% to 51% between 2020 and January 2024. Earlier this week, the San Francisco-based software company announced that it would be laying off more than 1,000 employees to make room for new AI-focused staff. The company’s chief operating officer Brian Millham stated that the company would be considering hiring from less expensive locations with “incredible labor.” In Pleasanton, California, Workday Inc. is laying off about 1,750 employees. The layoffs are part of the company’s international expansion for the sake of its profit margins. The company’s CEO Carl Eschenbach emphasized the benefits of hiring in countries like Costa Rica to achieve cost efficiency. He also mentioned possibly integrating AI into its operations, such as call centers and finance departments. Unemployment sweeping the US PayPal Holdings Inc. reported a decline in its US-based workforce from 53% to 38% over a five-year period ending in 2023. ServiceNow Inc., and Synopsys Inc. have also reported a decline in the population of their US-based workforce in recent years. Some companies, like Oracle Corp., have most of their employees working from outside the US, while Microsoft Corp ., the world’s largest software company, has about 45% of its workforce overseas. Checkr Inc., a platform that helps companies with background checks of new employees, noted a 42% increase in the volume of international hires between 2023 and 2024. Despite the international expansion of their workforce and efforts to increase international sales, Salesforce Inc. and Workday Inc. along with many other companies still depend on the US for most of their business.

Many investors are afraid its drop will continue, leading them to join Propichain’s real estate ecosystem. Propichain stands out for bringing AI-powered investing benefits to the housing sector. Read on to see why analysts say it is the best alternative for investors who lost money from the XRP price decline. XRP Price Drop: Investors Express Doubt over a Swift Recovery February’s XRP price drop has shaken the market, causing waves of panic among altcoin holders. Many traders had expected the recent XRP price rally to extend beyond Q1 2025. However, the market tanked in February, sending XRP down by over 13% to its current value of $0.26. XRP price charts now show a 17.37% fall in the past 7 days. Moreover, investors are debating over how long the XRP price decline will last. With XRP’s future uncertain, Propichain’s AI-driven approach offers investors a promising, data-backed alternative for sustained growth. As investors seek safer, high-growth opportunities, Propichain’s AI-driven real estate investing offers a data-backed solution for those looking to diversify and capitalize on real estate markets. Propichain: How Asset Tokenization is Reshaping the Real Estate Sector High capital demands, geographic confines, and long, drawn-out processes have long characterized the real estate market. However, change is coming, thanks to Propichain, an advanced AI-driven blockchain project that is merging decentralized technology with real-world property investing solutions. Aimed to democratize access to the housing market while amplifying returns, PCHAIN’s ecosystem features the needed tools that ease investing and open up doors to global opportunities. Central to Propichain’s mission of breaking down investment barriers is asset tokenization. Propichain tackles the unaffordable cost of traditional real estate by introducing fractional property ownership. This new ownership model involves turning physical housing properties into digital tokens. Investors can invest in luxury apartments, commercial buildings, or vacation homes for a fraction of the cost. For example, a $1m villa in Miami can be tokenized into 10,000 tokens at $100 each. Investors with lower budgets can buy stakes in this villa while earning rental income in proportion to their investment, which will appreciate over time. Tokenized assets can also double as collateral for loans, helping investors gain extra profits from DeFi ecosystems. In addition to lowering investing costs, Propichain introduces novel AI tools that automate market analysis, helping investors to make smarter decisions. Propichain’s AI-powered suite removes the guesswork from real estate investing. Via predictive analysis, Propichain’s AI tools scan global markets for trends. For instance, it can pick up on rising demand for vacation rentals in Bali or office space in Berlin and deliver actionable insights via user-friendly dashboards. This helps users seize emerging opportunities while getting ahead of other competitors. It can also help newbies to navigate the housing market and find profitable opportunities. But Propichain doesn’t stop at market insights. Rather, they offer automatic trading that helps complete housing deals on behalf of users. Picture completing housing deals using commands like “buy 50 tokens of beachfront properties if tourism growth in Southeast Asia goes over 10% this quarter. ” The AI executes such commands in real time, ensuring users never miss profitable moves. If you are a new investor, you can benefit from the platform’s guided tutorials, making even more complex concepts, like ROI calculations or legal compliance, a piece of cake. While AI simplifies decision-making, Propichain also enhances the property viewing experience through metaverse-backed virtual tours. These tours offer unmatched convenience as they let you explore properties from your living room. With these immersive 3D virtual tours, an investor based in the US can virtually ‘walk through’ an apartment complex in Dubai, assess its condition, and buy tokens, all within minutes. This saves time and eliminates travel costs while facilitating easy collaboration between different investors across the globe. In addition to making investing more convenient for you, Propichain places safety first, with smart contracts audited by BlockAudit. The audit shows that no vulnerabilities were found within it. Another feature of these smart contracts is that they facilitate the creation of custom agreements. Investors can build custom agreements using these contracts to automate rent payments, lease terms, and token transfers. This further minimizes fraud risks. Propichain Vs an XRP Price Rally: Which Option Holds Better ROI Potential? Many experts say Propichain’s real estate trading benefits hold strong investment appeal, a factor that could help PCHAIN outshine the next XRP price rally Revenue from token sales in Propichain’s presale has surged past $2 million, fueled by its CoinMarketCap listing and AI−driven value proposition. Currently, in Stage 2, PCHAIN tokens are priced at $0.011, following a 208% jump from their initial value of 0.004. Stage three will bring another 108.93% increase, taking PCHAIN’s value to $0.023. With its listings planned at $0.032 (800% growth from the start), analysts agree that PCHAIN is one of the best tokens to buy now. Furthermore, analysts say PCHAIN is projected to grow by 9,000x, meaning a $2,000 investment could jump to over $180,000 by the start of 2026. Don’t miss the opportunity to buy PCHAIN at one of its lowest-ever prices ahead of its expected market boom.

As the digital asset associated with Ripple continues to fluctuate, market watchers are weighing the potential for future gains. Despite periodic surges in the broader crypto market, XRP has struggled to maintain significant upward momentum. The token, which reached an all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018, has yet to revisit those levels, raising questions about its long-term growth potential. Technical analyst Egrag Crypto remains optimistic about XRP’s trajectory, stating, “XRP at under $3 is an opportunity of a lifetime.” He suggests that historical price patterns indicate a potential breakout, arguing that the asset has been consolidating within a long-term structure that could lead to substantial gains. However, not all analysts share this bullish sentiment. Some market experts warn that XRP’s price action shows signs of weakness, particularly in comparison to other major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both seen strong rallies in recent months, yet XRP has lagged behind. A key factor influencing XRP’s performance is its regulatory history. Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has weighed on investor confidence. While a partial court ruling in 2023 determined that XRP is not a security when sold to retail investors, uncertainty remains regarding institutional sales and regulatory clarity. Another analyst, Dark Defender, pointed to technical indicators that could influence XRP’s price movement in the near term. “The daily close will be crucial,” he noted, suggesting that a breakout above certain resistance levels could pave the way for a rally. However, failure to maintain key support levels could trigger further declines. Market sentiment around XRP is also shaped by broader macroeconomic conditions. With growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency, some believe that regulatory developments could unlock new opportunities for XRP adoption. The potential approval of spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum has fueled optimism that other digital assets, including XRP, could eventually gain similar financial products. At the same time, some investors remain cautious. XRP’s trading volume and liquidity levels have fluctuated, raising concerns about sustained buying pressure. If demand does not pick up, it could limit the asset’s ability to rally in the short term. Despite the mixed outlook, XRP supporters continue to emphasize the asset’s utility within the payments sector. Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions worldwide highlight the token’s role in cross-border transactions, a use case that some believe will drive long-term value. As the crypto market evolves, XRP’s price trajectory will likely depend on a combination of technical factors, regulatory developments, and broader investor sentiment. Whether its current price represents a major opportunity or a sign of stagnation remains a topic of debate among analysts.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-07 05:36:00

The company believes it may fail to meet customer demand for its cloud computing devices despite planning to spend roughly $100 billion in the segment. Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said that hardware shipment delays and inadequate electricity supply are likely to interfere with the company’s cloud services delivery. He even argued that the company would be growing much faster were it not for the capacity troubles. Amazon hints at more cloud capacity issues linked to chip supply delay and power constraints Andy Jassy wants the firm to grow into an AI marketplace; however, he fears its growth in that direction could be a little shaky. He argued that hardware shipment delays, particularly chips, and insufficient power supply, would derail its cloud computing offerings, even adding that they deterred them from bringing in new data centers. However, Jassy is optimistic that the impact of these constraints will subside in the second half of 2025. So far, Amazon has invested over $26.3 billion in capital expenditures during the last three months of 2024, with the bulk of the spending directed toward AI-related projects within AWS. Much of its spending paid off, with the company seeing a 19% surge in its AWS revenue in the last quarter of 2024, making it the third time Amazon saw 19% growth in its cloud unit. Sky Canaves, a market analyst at Emarketer, commented on AWS’s steady 19% growth, suggesting that the company is still grappling with the same capacity challenges affecting Google and Microsoft. Amazon expects AI to curtail its earned profits Growing concerns over cloud capacity shrouded Amazon’s strong performance in its e-commerce and logistics segment at the end of 2024. Amazon’s e-commerce sales topped those of Walmart Inc., Temu, and Shein. The company even saw its quarterly revenue surge by 10%, settling at $187.8 billion by December 31. Moreover, its operating profit was $21.2 billion, and its operating costs were $166.6 billion, which, in retrospect, is less than its Q4 revenue. So far this year, its stock has surged by nearly 9% after a 44% rise in 2024. Nevertheless, the company expects its AI spending to eat into its gains. Amazon projected its operating income to range between $14 billion and $18 billion in Q1 2025. The quarterly sales could be as high as $155.5 billion, compared with an average estimate of $158.6 billion. Amazon is still preparing to release its long-awaited Alexa generative artificial intelligence voice service and has scheduled a press event to preview it later this month. Once released, it would mark the most significant upgrade to the product since its initial introduction accelerated a wave of digital assistants more than a decade ago. Earlier this week, Amazon sent press invites to an event in New York on February 26 featuring Panos Panay, the head of its devices and services team. The new generative AI-powered Alexa represents at once a huge opportunity for Amazon, which counts more than half a billion Alexa-enabled devices in the market, and a tremendous risk. Amazon hopes the revamp, designed to converse with users, can convert some of its hundreds of millions of users into paying customers to generate a return for the unprofitable business.

It soared from $2.30 on January 10 to almost $3.40 on January 16, marking a staggering 43% surge in just a few days. However, while some dream of the XRP price touching $100, one analyst calls the hype a mere distraction. He’s urging crypto whales and retail investors to look beyond the noise and shift their focus to the viral Ethereum-based platform WallitIQ (WLTQ) , claiming it is the last altcoin they’ll ever need in their portfolios. Analyst Calls XRP Price To $100 ‘A Distraction’ Since the XRP price picked up momentum, its community has been excited about its prospects. Several members claim that the price could surge to $100 in the near future. In just a week, the price surged by 43%. Key drivers behind the XRP price rise include Donald Trump’s inauguration, increased whale activity, rising network adoption, and others. Analyst Rajat Soni has, however, made a bold statement , dismissing the notion of the XRP price reaching $100 as ‘a distraction ‘. He argues that such a surge would require a market capitalization of $10 trillion, a feat he deems unrealistic. Instead, the analyst advises investors seeking substantial returns to consider the promising WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform, which he believes is the ultimate altcoin for any portfolio. At the time of writing, XRP’s market cap was $178 billion (per CoinGecko). Why WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Last Altcoin You’ll Ever Need In Your Portfolio WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) peculiarity lies in its non-conventional approach to asset management , which has caught the attention of both crypto investors and enthusiasts. The decentralized wallet aims to transform the industry by solving vital issues that have long existed. These issues have created a huge market gap, and bridging this gap creates new and fresh opportunities within the market. The decentralized wallet uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to create a world-class infrastructure that guarantees security and user satisfaction. To this end, WallitIQ (WLTQ) incorporates a cutting-edge feature, Escrow Connect , driven by AI Einstein. AI-Einstein analyzes every connection between investors’ wallets and external websites or dApps, making sure hackers can’t access their assets. WallitIQ (WLTQ) simplifies the blockchain for both newcomers and seasoned investors. It offers several comprehensive educational materials , ranging from audio and visual to video formats, that address investors’ specific needs. Investors can also participate in interactive sessions with crypto gurus, which helps them understand the complexities of the crypto market and contributes to a satisfactory experience. WallitIQ (WLTQ) recently announced that its beta platform will be launched in a few days. This revelation has thrilled its community, as the highly anticipated platform boasts several features that simplify and maximize asset management. Not to mention, the decentralized platform has unveiled the MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App . This innovative application was a major discourse in the crypto space at the time. It’s noteworthy that only token holders will maximize WallitIQ (WLTQ) ‘s utilities and gigantic potential gains. However, buying the token at its presale price is the wisest decision investors can make today. The presale, which has recorded an influx of thousands of crypto whales, is still fast-selling. Investors who have yet to participate are encouraged to do so for only $0.0420 now. The potential of the altcoin is not reflected in its price, as experts have called it undervalued. If WallitIQ (WLTQ) sustains its current momentum, it could yield returns similar to those of Bitcoin (BTC) in its early days. This means that investors who buy the WLTQ token early could become multi-dollar millionaires when its value surges. Final Thoughts: Grab This Golden Opportunity And Buy The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Altcoin For A Low Price Today! A crypto analyst believes that holding the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is the best investment decision investors can make today. The token, selling for only $0.0420 , is the last altcoin investors will ever need in their portfolios. Moreover, SolidProof has audited its smart contract as secure, and CoinMarketCap has listed it on its website. Savvy investors are encouraged to take advantage of this golden opportunity and join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale.

Meanwhile, the Cboe BZX Exchange also filed applications for spot XRP ETFs on behalf of major asset managers. Additionally, Franklin Templeton has joined the ETF race by filing for a multi-asset crypto index fund combining Bitcoin and Ethereum exposure. SEC Opens Door for Spot Solana ETF The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took a big step toward approving a spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) after acknowledging Grayscale’s amended application . This is the first time the SEC moved forward with a Solana ETF filing. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out this milestone, and mentioned that previous filing attempts for Solana ETFs were completely ignored by the regulator. Fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas agreed , and described the move as a ”notable” step, albeit a small one, but one that seems to be influenced by recent leadership changes at the SEC. Historically, the SEC refused to consider spot Solana ETF applications under the leadership of former Chair Gary Gensler, as the regulator classified Solana as a security rather than a commodity. This stance was reinforced by ongoing lawsuits against major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, which the SEC has accused of trading unregistered securities, including Solana. Seyffart previously estimated that it could even take until 2026 for a Solana ETF to get approval. The recent acknowledgment of Grayscale’s application, however, suggests that there is a potential shift in the SEC’s approach, though the final deadline for the regulator to rule on Grayscale’s ETF is set for Oct. 11. The SEC has been flooded with cryptocurrency ETF applications over the past few weeks as issuers test the regulatory waters under the current leadership of Commissioner Mark Uyeda. Alongside Grayscale, firms like 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital also submitted filings for spot Solana ETFs through the Cboe BZX Exchange. In addition to Solana, Bitwise put forward a proposal for a spot Dogecoin ETF. For now, Litecoin seems to be the next cryptocurrency likely to secure SEC approval for a spot ETF. On Feb. 6, the SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for a Litecoin ETF, which is a move that Seyffart believes puts Litecoin next in line after Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bloomberg analysts base this expectation on the fact that Canary’s S-1 filing for a spot Litecoin ETF is already under active regulatory review , whereas applicants for other cryptocurrency ETFs still have to reach this stage. If approved, a spot Solana ETF could attract a lot of investor interest. JPMorgan estimated that these ETFs could amass between $3 billion and $6 billion in net assets in its first year. Balchunas described this projection as a reasonable estimate, given the strong demand for crypto-based investment products. Solana ETF approval odds on Polymarket Meanwhile, the predictions market platform Polymarket currently places the odds of a spot Solana ETF gaining SEC approval before July 31 at 39%. While the road to approval is still uncertain, the latest developments suggest that the prospect of a spot Solana ETF is now closer than ever before. XRP ETF Filings Gain Momentum Cboe BZX Exchange also recently filed 19b-4 applications on behalf of four asset managers to launch the first spot XRP ETFs in the United States. The filings were submitted on Feb. 6, and represent Canary Capital , WisdomTree , 21Shares , and Bitwise , who are all looking to offer ETFs that track the price of XRP. These filings serve as official notifications to the SEC regarding proposed rule changes and, if approved, would be the introduction of XRP ETFs in the US market. Under the leadership of former Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC already approved ETFs tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum, and allowed them to begin trading in early 2024. However, the regulatory landscape has seen quite a shift with crypto-friendly leadership taking the helm. Bitwise was the first to submit a Form S-1 registration statement for an XRP ETF in October last year, which is an essential requirement alongside a 19b-4 filing for an ETF to be approved. Shortly afterward, Canary Capital followed with a Form S-1 for its Canary XRP Trust. Additional applications came in from 21Shares in November for the 21Shares Core XRP Trust and from WisdomTree in December for its WisdomTree XRP Fund. On Jan. 30, NYSE Arca, a subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange, also filed a 19b-4 application to convert Grayscale’s existing XRP trust into a spot ETF. Jersey-based asset manager CoinShares joined the race on Jan. 24 by submitting a Form S-1 for a CoinShares XRP ETF. JPMorgan also projected strong investor demand for these financial products, and estimated that spot XRP ETFs could attract between $4 billion and $8 billion in net new assets in their first year. Meanwhile, XRP is currently trading at approximately $2.36 after its price dropped by about 2.29% over the past 24 hours of trading. Franklin Templeton Files for Crypto Index ETF Franklin Templeton added to the growing list of ETF application after filing an application with the SEC to launch a multi-asset cryptocurrency ETF. If approved, the Franklin Crypto Index ETF will provide investors with exposure to the spot prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum in a single fund, with assets weighted by their respective market capitalizations. According to the filing that was submitted on Feb. 6, the ETF will be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The fund’s composition on the filing date was 86.31% Bitcoin and 13.69% Etherem, with the index set to be rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly in March, June, September, and December. Franklin Templeton’s move follows a similar filing from Bitwise on Jan. 31 for its Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. Proportion split (Source: SEC ) The firm mentioned that additional cryptocurrencies could be included in the Franklin Crypto Index ETF in the future, but only if both the fund and the Cboe BZX Exchange receive the necessary regulatory approvals to expand beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the filing made it clear that there is no guarantee that any other digital assets will be permitted for inclusion. The filing also outlined several risks for investors, particularly the potential impact of competition from other cryptocurrencies like Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano. The firm warned that the growth of alternative digital assets could reduce demand for the Franklin Crypto Index ETF. With Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs already in place, multi-asset funds will be the next phase in integrating digital assets into traditional financial markets. However, the SEC’s stance on further approvals is still uncertain.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|SOL|XRP|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-07 05:42:56

This week’s expiry event is about a third of the size of last week’s month-ending mammoth one. Therefore, there is likely to be a minimal influence on spot markets, which have retreated this week. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.58, meaning that there are many more call (long) contracts expiring than puts (shorts). The max pain point, or price where most losses will be made, is $99,500. Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $120,000 strike price, which is $1.7 billion, according to Deribit. There is also around $1.3 billion in OI at the $110,000 strike price, as derivatives traders continue to speculate that prices will rise from current levels in the longer term. Earlier this week, crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said , “The market is now very divided, with BTC being strongly supported by funding from both inside and outside the crypto.” It added that altcoins, represented by ETH, “are losing money violently, the vast majority of cryptocurrency prices have shrunk significantly, and the altcoin season that market was expecting has not arrived.” “But we can see from the options data BTC and ETH skew have maintained a positive value. The giant whale also bought a large number of call options in the pullback, indicating that the market is still optimistic about the future as a whole,” Skew refers to the difference in implied volatility (IV) between call and put options or across different strike prices and expirations. 7 Feb Options Data 26,000 BTC options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 0.58, a Maxpain point of $99,500 and a notional value of $2.54 billion. 203,000 ETH options expired with Put Call Ratio of 0.46, Maxpain point of $2,950 and notional value of $560 million. Market sentiment was… pic.twitter.com/UbN9mtdrJ6 — Greeks.live (@GreeksLive) February 7, 2025 In addition to today’s tranche of Bitcoin options, around 203,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring with a notional value of $560 million, a put/call ratio of 0.46, and a max pain of $2,950. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $3 billion. Crypto Market Still Retreating Total market capitalization has fallen just below 2% on the day to $3.3 trillion. However, it remains at the lower lines of a range-bound channel that formed in mid-November. Bitcoin dipped below $96,000 in an intraday low in late trading on Thursday but managed to recover marginally to reach $97,400 during the Friday morning Asian trading session. The asset has been down-trending for the past week, having lost 7% since the same time last week. There is still no love for Ethereum, which fell 3% to below $2,700 early on Friday and appears to be struggling to reclaim it. The altcoins were a sea of red, with only Tron (TRX) bucking the trend with a 4.5% gain on the day.

The company has announced plans to build a large crypto reserve, leaving many wondering what’s next. This news came at the Ondo Summit in New York, where Donald Trump Jr. strongly supported crypto, calling it important for America’s future power. Trump Jr. Sees Crypto as Key to U.S. Dominance At the summit, Trump Jr. made a surprise appearance, calling cryptocurrency the “future of American hegemony.” His remarks highlighted his belief that digital assets will be crucial in maintaining the U.S. economy’s strength. He spoke to industry leaders about the growing influence of crypto and how it could shape global finance. WLF has been quietly building its crypto portfolio, recently purchasing $470,000 worth of ONDO, the native token of Ondo Finance. However, the company has also invested in Ethereum (ETH), wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), Tron (TRX), AAVE, and Chainlink (LINK), showing a broad interest in major blockchain projects. Strategic Reserve with an Unclear Goal WLF co-founder Chase Herro shared the company’s vision for a strategic crypto reserve but did not specify its exact purpose. He noted that WLF is committed to supporting blockchain innovation and remains bullish on digital assets. Perhaps, the idea of a crypto reserve has been in discussion since Trump’s presidential campaign. Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive action to explore the feasibility of such a reserve, fueling speculation about WLF’s potential influence on national crypto policies. Regulatory Challenges In This Process The Ondo Summit gathered key figures from both the crypto world and government, including House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry and acting Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair Caroline Pham. Discussions focused on tokenization, regulation, and the challenges of integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. While WLF has positioned itself as a DeFi lending platform, it has yet to launch operations. For now, its growing crypto portfolio raises questions about its long-term plans and the Trump family’s increasing ties to the digital asset space.",News,EN,0,0,FIAT|ONDO|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|LINK,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-07 05:49:06

Is This Final Dump Before Pump?,https://coingape.com/when-will-altcoins-selling-stop-is-this-final-dup-before-pump/,"The altcoins market continues to face strong selling pressure as top assets like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA) have all corrected 3-4% today. Market analysts believe that there could be some more pain ahead, expecting the Bitcoin dominance to peak at 71% before the actual altseason begins. Will the Brutal Selloff In Altcoins Continue? Altcoins have been showing major weakness and have been volatile to macro developments. Earlier this week, the broader crypto market came under strong selling pressure following fears of the Trump trade war. Furthermore, the recovery in the past few days has been only partial, considering the magnitude of the fall. The latest 10x Research report mentions that there’s an inherent weakness in the Bitcoin price movement, which can spill over to altcoins as well. Also, macro developments like the Fed’s decision to delay interest rate cuts and declining US Dollar liquidity have discouraged crypto traders from increasing their exposure in the market and looking forward to more favorable conditions. Furthermore, the report mentions: “Bitcoin has staged a partial rebound, and Ethereum’s sharp drop was amplified by option gamma hedging and futures liquidations, past large ETH liquidations have not historically led to sustained recoveries. However, weak technical factors suggest further downside risk remains”. Bitcoin Dominance To First Reach 71%? Prominent crypto analyst Rekt Capital has highlighted key trends in Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), sparking discussion on its future trajectory. Rekt Capital emphasized that historically, whenever Bitcoin Dominance enters the 58-71% macro range, it has consistently revisited the 71% resistance level. Source: Rekt Capital After reaching this 71% peak, the analyst predicts that it would open the gates for an altcoin window. However, the analyst noted that during this period of rising Bitcoin dominance, a strong pullback of 5-10% is possible in altcoins. He noted: “These Altcoin Windows may progress in line with Altcoin Hype Cycles, whereby increases in Altcoin valuations occur during the second half of respective Quarters It’s just that these Altcoin Windows (i.e. retraces in Bitcoin Dominance) may be 5-10% deep during the macro Bitcoin Dominance uptrend” After reaching the peak of 71%, Bitcoin’s dominance will decline. This is when the actual altseason will begin, noted the analyst. As of press time, the Bitcoin price is trading 0.5% down at $97,320 levels with a daily trading volume of around $48 billion. Market Analysts Remain Optimistic Despite the recent turbulence in the crypto market, crypto market analysts remain hopeful of an altcoin rally moving ahead. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has shared an optimistic update on the altcoin market, highlighting the formation of a significant cup and handle pattern on the charts. “Most aren’t prepared for what’s next,” the analyst stated.

The market turbulence has raised concerns among investors, but well-known analysts like Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) maintain that the correction is a temporary setback. All #XRP holders will become millionaires. No exceptions. pic.twitter.com/zoLebdj8um — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) February 5, 2025 Analyst Draws Comparison to XRP’s 2017 Bull Run Steph recently presented a case for XRP’s continued bullish trajectory, highlighting a historical pattern from the 2017/2018 market cycle, in which XRP initially underperformed before experiencing an exponential increase in value. In late 2016, XRP struggled to gain momentum at the beginning of a broader market uptrend. However, by early 2017, it surged dramatically, recording three consecutive months of price increases from March to May. During this period, the token’s value skyrocketed by more than 800%. Steph suggests that XRP is currently following a similar trajectory. Between November 2024 and January 2025, the asset’s price climbed from $0.5089 to $3.4, representing a 568% increase. Despite this substantial gain, he suggests that XRP has not yet reached its full potential and expects another surge that mirrors 2017.

Steph wrote in his post, “All #XRP holders will become millionaires. No exceptions.” While Steph and many others are confident that XRP will make millionaires , the feasibility of this claim depends on the scale of the anticipated price increase. According to data from the XRP Rich List , most investors hold between 20 and 500 XRP. If the price reaches $50,000 per token, a 20 XRP holding would be valued at $1 million. Alternatively, at $2,000 per token, a 500 XRP portfolio would reach the million-dollar threshold. While these figures illustrate the potential impact of a major rally, the extent of such an extreme price surge remains uncertain. Many analysts agree that XRP has room for further growth, but reaching such high valuations would require unprecedented market conditions. Problems With the 2017 Pattern Despite the similarities between the current market cycle and the 2017 run, some analysts believe XRP’s trajectory no longer aligns with its historical movement. A recent correction saw XRP fall below $3, and a prominent crypto analyst showed that this decline broke the 2017 fractal . He believes the digital asset is following a different path, and confidently stated that comparisons to 2017 no longer apply to the chart. However, a swift recovery could put XRP back in a position to repeat the 2017 performance, and its trajectory over the next few days will be crucial.

40024898,https://coinpaper.com/7354/congressman-slams-trump-s-crypto-stance-and-industry-deregulation,1738908000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Congressman Slams Trump’s Crypto Stance and Industry Deregulation,https://coinpaper.com/7354/congressman-slams-trump-s-crypto-stance-and-industry-deregulation,"As the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the US continues to evolve, two recent congressional discussions have highlighted the growing political divide over cryptocurrency policy. President Donald Trump’s executive order establishing a Working Group on Digital Asset Markets has drawn interest from top industry executives, while his decision to launch a meme coin has sparked criticism from lawmakers. At the same time, a House Financial Services Committee hearing saw Rep. Al Green challenged claims that the previous administration unfairly targeted crypto firms, instead shifting focus to Trump’s pro-crypto stance and financial ties to digital assets. Congressman Al Green Slams Trump’s Crypto Agenda and Meme Coin Launch in Heated House Hearing In a Feb. 6 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee’s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, Texas Representative Al Green sharply criticized US President Donald Trump for what he described as a “deregulatory pro-crypto agenda” while simultaneously launching a controversial meme coin. The hearing, which focused on the Biden administration’s stance on crypto regulation, quickly escalated into a broader political battle over the future of digital assets in the United States. At the heart of the debate was the colloquial term “Operation Choke Point 2.0”, which Republican lawmakers and crypto executives have used to describe what they claim was an orchestrated effort by the Biden administration to debank the crypto industry. The term suggests that financial regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), pressured banks to cut ties with crypto firms. Rep. Al Green, a senior Democrat on the committee, pushed back against these claims, arguing that there was never an actual policy to systematically debank crypto businesses. According to Green, the FDIC and other financial regulators simply issued warnings about the risks associated with banking crypto companies but did not explicitly prohibit financial institutions from engaging with them. “Regulators asking banks to consider the risks associated with the cryptocurrency industry does not amount to debanking,” Green stated. His comments were echoed by Better Markets banking policy director Shayna Olesiuk, who testified at the hearing. She argued that federal regulators’ actions were misunderstood and that risk assessments were a necessary part of financial oversight. While the hearing was expected to focus on broader crypto regulatory concerns, Rep. Green shifted the spotlight to Trump’s recent launch of a meme coin. The coin, simply titled ”TRUMP”, was introduced before he took office on Jan. 17, and its listing on major crypto exchanges has sparked both excitement and concern within the industry. Green hinted that lawmakers should be paying closer attention to the ethics and implications of a sitting US president launching a cryptocurrency tied to his brand. However, neither subcommittee chair Dan Meuser nor Financial Services Committee chair French Hill directly addressed Trump’s meme coin in their opening statements. The lack of discussion around TRUMP coin raised eyebrows, with some critics questioning whether the coin represents a conflict of interest. If financial policy decisions made under Trump’s administration directly benefit his own cryptocurrency, it could lead to further scrutiny from regulators and potential legal battles over ethics violations. The hearing also saw a fiery exchange between lawmakers and Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, who accused US financial regulators of engaging in “regulation by exhaustion.” According to Grewal, the FDIC deceived the public by claiming crypto firms had access to fair banking services, while simultaneously pressuring financial institutions to pause crypto-related activities. A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed by Coinbase revealed that the FDIC sent letters to banks in 2022, advising them to ”pause all crypto asset-related activity.” Grewal argued that this created an unfair regulatory environment, where banks were forced to walk away from crypto partnerships despite the absence of any formal law prohibiting such activities. “You had question after question raised if even a hint of interest was shared that the bank wanted to enter into a basic service for its customers involving crypto or to facilitate basic crypto transactions,” Grewal testified. His comments bring attention to a long-running battle between crypto firms and US regulators, as companies like Coinbase, Binance.US, and Kraken have faced repeated legal challenges and enforcement actions from agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Political Fallout and Impeachment Talk Beyond the crypto debate, Rep. Green made headlines for another major announcement on Feb. 5, when he called for Trump’s impeachment over the president’s foreign policy stance regarding the Gaza Strip. Green accused Trump of pushing for US control of the region, a move that he said was ”unconstitutional and against American values.” However, at the time of publication, congressional records did not show any official impeachment articles had been filed. With Republicans controlling both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Green’s call for impeachment is unlikely to gain traction, but it adds to the growing political divide over Trump’s policies, including his handling of crypto regulations. The Feb. 6 hearing was the first meeting of the House Financial Services Committee’s Oversight Subcommittee in the 119th session of Congress, under a Republican-led House and Senate. Lawmakers are expected to continue debating the role of digital assets in the US economy as Trump’s pro-crypto stance contrasts sharply with the stricter regulatory approach of the previous administration. As the 2024 election season intensifies, crypto regulation is poised to become a major campaign issue, with industry leaders closely watching whether Trump’s policies will usher in a new era of crypto adoption or face intense political opposition from Democratic lawmakers. For now, the question remains: Will Trump’s pro-crypto agenda and memecoin launch backfire politically, or will it solidify his position as the most crypto-friendly president in US history? Trump’s Digital Asset Advisory Council: Crypto Executives Battle for Influence in US Policy Shift The potential candidates for US President Donald Trump’s newly established Working Group on Digital Asset Markets have been revealed, sparking a battle among top crypto industry executives for a seat on the influential advisory panel. The group, formed through a recent executive order, marks a significant policy shift in the US government’s stance on digital assets, drawing both praise and scrutiny from key stakeholders. According to a report from the New York Post, the list of potential members includes a lineup of high-profile figures from the cryptocurrency and fintech industries. Among those being considered are: Marco Santori, former general counsel at Kraken Brad Garlinghouse, co-founder and CEO of Ripple Frank Chaparro, host of a popular crypto podcast Jeremy Allaire, CEO of stablecoin issuer Circle Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com While this is not an exhaustive list, sources suggest that final selections will be made based on candidates’ industry experience, regulatory expertise, and alignment with the administration’s digital asset policy goals. The potential inclusion of these figures signals a move toward collaborating with industry veterans rather than imposing strict oversight led by government bureaucrats. President Trump’s executive order establishing the Working Group on Digital Asset Markets has been hailed as a ”seismic shift” in the federal government’s approach to cryptocurrency. In a stark departure from previous administrations, the order prohibits the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the US and instructs the newly formed advisory council to explore the potential for a strategic digital asset reserve, which could include Bitcoin (BTC). The directive shows Trump’s increasingly pro-crypto stance, reinforcing his campaign rhetoric positioning Bitcoin and digital assets as vital components of economic innovation and national security. The order reads, “The digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States.” Furthermore, the executive action mandates collaboration between key government agencies and the private sector to ensure a balanced regulatory framework. The Treasury Secretary, Attorney General, Commerce Secretary, Secretary of Homeland Security, and other senior officials will contribute to the Working Group’s policy discussions, alongside leading crypto executives. Notably absent from the council’s mandatory membership are representatives from the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)—two institutions that have played a controversial role in shaping US crypto policy. The exclusion drew attention from Custodia Bank founder Caitlin Long, who has been a vocal critic of the FDIC’s stance on digital asset banking. Responding to the decision, she remarked, “Both tried to kill the industry through debanking and especially targeted my company, Custodia Bank. Both belong on the outside.” The FDIC’s recent document release, spanning nearly 800 pages, further fueled controversy. It detailed correspondence between regulators and US firms seeking approval for crypto-related financial services. Many of these documents revealed pause letters and regulatory roadblocks that crypto businesses say were deliberate attempts to stall industry growth. Acting FDIC Chairman Travis Hill has since expressed willingness to collaborate with the new Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, signaling potential future engagement despite being left out of the initial advisory board. Trump’s shift toward a pro-crypto stance could have significant implications for the 2024 US presidential election, especially as cryptocurrency adoption continues to rise among retail investors, institutions, and major financial players. This move stands in direct contrast to regulatory crackdowns under the Biden administration, which saw aggressive enforcement actions against major crypto exchanges, lending platforms, and staking services. Under Trump’s new approach, industry executives may have a direct line to policymaking, ensuring that future regulations do not stifle innovation or drive businesses offshore. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who has been a vocal critic of regulatory uncertainty in the US, praised the shift in tone, stating, “ Trump is forcing everyone to up their game.” The potential for a US strategic digital asset reserve, particularly with Bitcoin at its core, is another game-changing element of this policy shift. If implemented, such a reserve could mark the first step toward Bitcoin being formally recognized as a national strategic asset, akin to gold and other store-of-value reserves held by central banks worldwide. The Battle for Influence Begins With some of the most powerful figures in the crypto industry now vying for a seat on the Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, the coming months will be crucial in shaping the future of digital asset regulation, adoption, and innovation in the United States. As Trump’s crypto advisory council takes shape, the big question remains: Will this be a turning point for crypto-friendly policies in the US, or will regulatory battles continue to stall industry progress? With Bitcoin hovering near all-time highs and institutional interest at record levels, the stakes have never been higher.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|FIAT|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-07 06:00:00

The altcoin last traded above the $3 mark on February 1. XRP is now trading within a broader sideways range. Despite a failed breakout attempt on January 16, where the price couldn’t sustain above the all-time high, a larger corrective pullback followed. This pattern suggests a potential continuation or reversal, with two possible scenarios in play. However, Bitcoin and majority of the top 10 altcoins have slid into the red zone and the overall market cap has also taken a hit. Short-Term Bullish Outlook The short-term bullish scenario sees XRP bottoming on February 3 and potentially moving towards new highs, aiming for levels between $4.20 and $5. If the price can break the $3 mark again, the next target could be $6.60. Short-Term Bearish Outlook In the bearish scenario, the recent dip could just be part of a larger corrective wave. A break below key support levels like $2.20 or $2.10 could signal a deeper decline, possibly leading to a drop towards $1.95. This scenario requires careful attention to the overall market structure. Key Support Levels to Watch Important support levels for XRP include $2.35, $2.22, and $2.11. A break below $1.95 could trigger a larger drop, bringing the price down to around $1.20, but this would likely signal a return to a larger correction phase. Bullish Breakout Signal Any movement above the trendline or a price surpassing $2.70 would indicate a shift in the microstructure and the potential for an upside reversal.

On Feb. 6, Bloomberg reported that ATB Financial, a government-owned bank in Alberta , has become a crucial ally for crypto companies in Canada , as most major Canadian banks remain hesitant to provide financial services to digital asset firms. The move has made Alberta a growing hub for blockchain businesses, with the provincial government aiming to generate $3.5 billion in revenue from crypto and tech by 2030. ATB, which reported $28.3 billion in total deposits in 2024, has quietly supported the crypto industry for over six years. In fact, during the 2021 crypto boom, many companies relocated to Alberta just to gain access to ATB’s banking services. However, despite its willingness to work with the industry, ATB remains a smaller player compared to Canada’s six largest banks, which control over 90% of federally regulated bank assets. These larger institutions have largely avoided crypto firms, citing compliance concerns, regulatory uncertainty, and the risks associated with digital assets. The collapse of FTX ( FTT ) in late 2022 only reinforced their cautious stance. Since then, Canada’s financial regulators have tightened oversight of the crypto industry. In Aug. 2023, the Canadian Securities Administrators and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization issued a notice requiring crypto platforms to register as investment dealers. Many in the industry hoped that increased regulation would lead to greater acceptance from banks, but that shift has been slow. Even with clearer rules in place, banks remain reluctant to open their doors to crypto businesses. As Darcy Daubaras, chief financial officer of Bitcoin miner Hive Digital Technologies, put it: “But with many of Canada’s largest banks having limited involvement in crypto, increased regulation may not change their risk aversion.” The growing divide The situation in Canada contrasts with recent developments in the U.S . There, banking restrictions on crypto firms have largely been driven by government policies rather than industry hesitance. Following Donald Trump’s return to office in Jan. 2025, his administration has taken several pro crypto stances . While this has opened the door for greater financial access in the U.S., Canada’s banking sector has remained largely unmoved, keeping most crypto companies at arm’s length. Amid this, tensions between Canada and the U.S. have also played into market uncertainty. On Feb. 1, Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian goods, triggering a sell-off across financial markets, including crypto. Ethereum ( ETH ) and Bitcoin ( BTC ) saw sharp declines. However, after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau secured a temporary 30-day pause on the tariffs on Feb. 3, market sentiment has since stabilized .",News|Banking|Canada|Crypto banking|Regulation|United States,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|ETH|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-07 06:03:52

In a recent interview, he attributed this weakness to regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Novogratz explained, referring to former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s actions against Ethereum-related entities: “I think the biggest reason it underperformed is because Gensler loaded up on ETH, sued Consensys, questioned whether it was a security.” Last April, Consensys filed a lawsuit against the SEC over its classification of ETH as a security. However, later in the year, the SEC approved the launch of spot ETH ETFs, further shaping the market’s view of the asset. Related News: Top FED Members Commented on Bitcoin, Cryptocurrencies and Interest Rates While Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) recently reached new all-time highs in the midst of bullish cycles, Ethereum’s price trajectory has been inconsistent. ETH has been on a steady decline since mid-December. Novogratz also commented on the developing investment trend for Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which has received more media attention, especially after former President Donald Trump’s Bitcoin 2024 speech, Ethereum’s primary investment thesis may have shifted. “Right now, most of Ethereum’s market cap is a store of value, but what’s bringing people there is a trend that this is going to be Web3,” Novogratz said. “The reality for all crypto ecosystems is that trend drives enthusiasm, and enthusiasm drives value.” Another factor that has been weighing on Ethereum is the uncertainty surrounding the Ethereum Foundation. Novogratz acknowledged the “FUD” (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) surrounding Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and the foundation itself: “Vitalik, the ETH Foundation, this is a bit of FUD. People are looking for excuses. The Foundation needs to continue to follow the right path, be a research organization, and organizations like Consensys or other relevant organizations need to be advocates.” *This is not investment advice.

Although the market is experiencing some turbulence right now, prominent market analysts like Sjuul and Cipher X have made bold price predictions for these altcoins. Nevertheless, a new rival is emerging quickly— IntelMarkets (INTL) , an altcoin that rose in value by 811% during its presale. Since this crypto ICO event is now in phase nine, more price pumps are coming. Experts have it pegged as the next 5x token in 2025. The IntelMarkets (INTL) Value Soars 811% in Ongoing Presale With More To Come While Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are some of the best cryptos, IntelMarkets (INTL) is a presale star. At this time, IntelMarkets is gaining traction as its presale raised over $8M and may hit $10M before this weekend. Not only that, but early investors in this project are now 811% richer—a percentage that will continue rising since a listing is still months away. Hype is high since IntelMarkets aims to launch the first smart trading platform powered by AI tech. It will introduce features like self-learning trading robots that improve their performance over time and autopilot bots that enable hands-free trading. With all these features, IntelMarkets enables traders to earn much more while taking much less risk, which is very rare in the market. Investors eager to join the movement buy INTL, its native token, at its current $0.082 price. This is an 811% jump from its starting value of $0.009. However, this altcoin price will rise to $0.091 after phase ten begins. Also, everyone is waiting for a Tier-1 CEX to list INTL. This move could lead to a pump to $0.11 – a 34% return for anyone buying this altcoin. The Ripple (XRP) Price Could Soar to $3.10 Soon, Analyst Claims Although one of the top altcoins, Ripple (XRP), has recently shown some red price charts. According to CoinMarketCap, it has struggled on the price charts, slipping over 20% in the past week. During this period, the price of Ripple fluctuated from around $3.10 to nearly $2.40. However, market analysts like Sjuul are still confident in the growth of Ripple (XRP). In a recent post on X, Sjuul claimed this crypto coin might see a rally if it gets to the $2.10 support area. As a Ripple price prediction, Sjuul pointed to the $3.10 level. An important issue to remember is that the Ripple market cap sits at around $140B. This makes it nearly impossible for XRP to see great price appreciation in the short term. For that reason, many traders are looking at INTL instead. Cipher X: The Price of Dogecoin (DOGE) May Skyrocket to $0.48 Dogecoin (DOGE) is among the meme coin titans but has also faced some turbulence. Its value moved from around $0.30 in the past week alone to nearly $0.25. In other words, over a 20% drop in the Dogecoin price in just a few short days, as per CoinMarketCap. The community is still watching Dogecoin (DOGE) thanks to some bullish statements from analysts like Cipher X. According to his X post, this meme coin is bullish in Q1 and Q2 of 2025. He foresees a potential jump to $0.48 in his Dogecoin price prediction. However, many traders are still sidestepping the Dogecoin crypto as it has already surged over 200% on the YTD chart. Therefore, its highest upswings may have passed. Because of this, they are focusing on INTL. Can IntelMarkets (INTL) Outpace Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in Terms of Gains? While Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) could see a price rebound soon, all attention is on IntelMarkets (INTL). This project is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the growth of the AI market, which Statista predicts could be worth $826B by 2030. As a result, its long-term growth potential and stability could be amazing. Furthermore, its low market cap means INTL will see faster price gains than XRP and DOGE since it needs less money. Due to all these factors, experts foresee INTL becoming the next 5x altcoin this year.

However, many investors have recognized the growing adoption of AI in crypto, offering many possibilities. The newly emerging artificial intelligence-based IntelMarkets (INTL) altcoin positions itself as a profitable and innovative opportunity, having raised over $8 million in its presale. IntelMarkets (INTL): The AI-Powered Disruptor IntelMarkets (INTL) is establishing itself as the top crypto player after SOL and Ripple attempt to gain ETF approval. Traditional blockchain projects differ from INTL because it connects cutting edge AI solutions to decentralized finance (DeFi) services. Through artificial intelligence, the platform provides current market assessment together by offering users advanced trading strategies that maximize profitability. Analysts praise IntelMarkets because of its promising potential. Led by a team of Open AI and MIT experts, the project has accumulated over $8 million for the upcoming INTL token. In the 9th presale stage, INTL tokens are offered at $0.082 apiece. Multiple analysts predict that INTL has the potential to rally 100x like SOL in 2021. Solana ETF: A Magnet for Institutional Interest Solana (SOL) remains on the DeFi throne even in 2025. With the SOL ecosystem receiving over $259 billion in turnover, investor interest in a Solana ETF is at an all-time high. Additionally, institutional investors show strong interest in SOL because it maintains a rapidly developing ecosystem. Approval of an Solana ETF may trigger billions of dollar investments which would strengthen its market position. Analysts estimate that SOL could witness a total of $5 billion in inflows from the ETF approval alone. However, recent price action has seen the SOL price decrease since its ATH price in January of $293. A price correction brought it to $206.75, falling over 16% on the monthly charts. Analysts speculate that the approval of the Solana ETFs could rally the price up to a new ATH above $300. Projections vary, but overall, market analysts are optimistic about the future of SOL. XRP ETF: Renewed Hype, But Is It Enough? Ripple (XRP) establishes itself as a leading digital asset because of its cross-border payment utility. The regulatory hurdles surrounding Ripple have failed to detour market attention, as institutional investors now show renewed interest in a XRP ETF. Since the pro-crypto administration under president Trump, the current board of SEC has been changed, increasing the likelihood of a XRP ETF. Projections see if Ripple were to achieve approval, the XRP ETF could see over $7 billion in inflows. The launch of the Ripple-based stablecoin RLUSD saw an increase in liquidity throughout the crypto markets. With the growing demand for Ripple’s solutions, analysts estimate that the approval of a XRP ETF stands at 90%. However, recent developments in the market have seen the XRP price drop drastically. Currently changing hands at $2.38, Ripple decreased over 20% in the past week. Based on an XRP ETF approval, analysts speculate that Ripple could rally above $5, marking a new era for the market. Conclusion: A Smarter Investment Choice The market status surrounding the approval of XRP and Solana ETFs is optimistic, with projections placing over $12B in new inflows. However, one AI-driven presale stands out. IntelMarkets enables its early investors to experience the financial revolution powered by AI and artificial intelligence technology.

On Feb 6, they shared their wild plan to simply get Germany out of the Eurozone, deregulate Bitcoin trading and crypto wallets, and bring back the Deutsche Mark currency with gold reserves backing it. Their ideas go head-to-head with mainstream parties, who think they’ve lost their minds—but AfD doesn’t care. They want Germany out of the currency bloc and believe the Deutsche Mark can make a comeback if it’s tied to something solid like gold. “The Deutsche Mark is Germany’s true monetary identity,” AfD leaders claim , vowing to repatriate Germany’s gold reserves held abroad. Bitcoin deregulation, cash protection, and rejection of a digital euro Wallets, exchanges, and trading platforms should be free from what the AfD calls “unnecessary government interference.” Regulators have historically always kept a close eye on Bitcoin in Germany, but AfD leaders say it’s time for a reset. They’re also waging a war against the European Central Bank’s digital euro plan. They see it as a threat to financial freedom/privacy and a way to snoop on Germans’ finances. The party also opposes any EU-wide deposit guarantee scheme, which would pool risk across European banks to protect depositors. AfD said it doesn’t want German taxpayers footing the bill for bank failures in other countries. Their tax proposals follow the same logic—they want to eliminate the wealth tax and inheritance tax while increasing tax-free allowances on capital gains, dividends, and interest income. While AfD is lighting financial fires, Germany’s other major parties are more measured. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD) are laser-focused on taxing the wealthy. They want a financial transaction tax on stock trades and plan to reintroduce the wealth tax, targeting millionaires and billionaires. Scholz’s party is promising that “the super-rich will do their part” in funding public services. They also want to tighten inheritance tax exemptions to force large estates to pay more. Meanwhile, the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, led by Friedrich Merz, is promising to turn Germany into Europe’s financial capital by making the country more attractive for startups and venture capital through tax incentives. They’re also committed to strengthening the European capital market union, which would make it easier for investments to flow across EU borders. Merz’s bloc is pushing for a digital euro but only if it benefits consumers. The CDU/CSU is also pushing for stronger customs enforcement to crack down on money laundering, a problem that has plagued Germany’s financial institutions in recent years, though their platform avoids specifics on how exactly they’ll achieve these goals. The Greens are playing the sustainability card, with a financial agenda centered around environmental and social responsibility. They want BaFin, Germany’s financial regulator, to have more power to fight greenwashing—when companies exaggerate their eco-friendly credentials. The Greens also want every state investment to meet sustainability standards so that public money isn’t spent on harmful projects, and they also have plans for a nationwide service center to help states combat financial crime tied to crypto. The Greens also want to work on Germany’s transparency register so they can make it harder for companies to hide funds using corporate structures, and their tax plan includes limiting inheritance tax exemptions and introducing a global billionaire tax. Finally, the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP), led by Christian Lindner, are trailing in the polls and may not make it into parliament. But their platform sticks to their core beliefs: lower taxes and fewer regulations.

SEC’s approval of XRP ETFs could shape future crypto investment products. XRP’s price remains stable despite increasing ETF filings and market interest. Several financial firms, including WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, have filed applications with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on XRP. These filings are a step towards accepting XRP into mainstream financial markets. If approved, these ETFs could provide institutional investors with a legal investment way to gain exposure to digital assets, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto assets. The filing of 19b-4 forms by Bitwise and Canary Capital marks an important milestone in the ETF approval process. Filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), these forms are basically asking for permission to list and trade the proposed XRP ETFs.

Talking to CoinDesk, Schwartz opened up about the importance of institutional adoption in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries, citing it as a key factor for mass retail adoption in the future. Schwartz began by reflecting on Ripple’s journey, noting the ups and downs the company has faced over the years. He said that while many in the industry once believed retail adoption would be the driving force behind blockchain’s widespread use, it is now clear that institutional adoption is a prerequisite for achieving mainstream success. https://twitter.com/DROPZXRP/status/1887573266371338508 Ripple’s Resilience and Recent Wins Schwartz acknowledged the challenges Ripple has faced, especially in the wake of the SEC’s lawsuit. “Four years ago, we had what I called the worst Christmas ever when I found out that the SEC was suing us and a lot of people thought that would be the end of business,” he said. Despite the setback, Schwartz pointed to Ripple’s resilience and the company’s recent successes, particularly with XRP, which has been one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies in recent months. He explained how the changing regulatory landscape in the U.S. has helped unlock new business opportunities both domestically and internationally. He further said that the change in the regulatory environment in the United States has had a ripple effect globally.

These coins have built massive communities and, at times, delivered jaw-dropping gains. Now, there’s a new contender in the arena: Doge Uprising . This next-gen new meme coin is already making waves, attracting investors from the SHIB and PEPE camps who are eager for the next 100x opportunity. While SHIB and PEPE have enjoyed their time in the spotlight, Doge Uprising is entering the game with a fresh and immersive narrative, strong community engagement, and a presale that has already hit impressive numbers. With the potential for explosive growth, investors are shifting their focus to what could be the next breakout star in the meme coins market. Why Doge Uprising Stands Out From the Meme Coin Crowd Doge Uprising plans to be more than just another Doge-themed token riding on nostalgia. Set in the year 2045, the project follows a dystopian storyline where mecha pilots rise against an oppressive rule, with $DUP tokens fueling their rebellion. This unique meme coin offers an immersive experience with NFTs, community-driven engagement, and Ethereum blockchain compatibility. Unlike SHIB and PEPE, which rely heavily on market trends and whale movements, Doge Uprising has a clear roadmap that includes influencer partnerships, NFT releases, and staking options. The project has already secured over $300k in presale investments, proving that investors are taking this uprising seriously. Why Early Investors Are Rushing In One of the most lucrative strategies in crypto investing is getting in early. Presales offer investors a chance to buy into a project before it hits the open market, potentially securing tokens at the lowest possible price. Doge Uprising’s presale has already shown promising traction, pulling in over $50k in its first hour alone. The advantages of investing in a presale include discounted token prices, early staking opportunities, and the potential for rapid price appreciation once the token launches. With Doge Uprising’s staking feature rolling out on February 14th, early investors can lock in their holdings and start earning APY rewards before the market catches up. Why SHIB and PEPE Holders Are Betting Big on Doge Uprising Both SHIB and PEPE started as underdogs before turning into billion-dollar assets. But as these coins mature, their upside potential shrinks. Investors looking for the next big breakout are eyeing Doge Uprising as a prime contender for 100x gains. The community-driven aspect of Doge Uprising mirrors what made SHIB and PEPE so successful. However, Doge Uprising goes beyond just being a meme coin—it’s a full-fledged movement with an engaging storyline, active developer support, and a strategic roadmap aimed at long-term success. Is Doge Uprising the Next 100x Meme Coin? With its presale gaining traction, a unique NFT-driven ecosystem, and a vision that extends beyond just another meme token, Doge Uprising is shaping up to be a serious contender in the meme coins space. SHIB and PEPE holders are making big moves, sensing the potential for massive returns. For those looking to secure their position early, now is the time to join the uprising. The presale is still open, but as momentum builds, opportunities like this don’t last forever. Be part of the uprising—visit Doge Uprising’s website and invest in the presale today.

This council is expected to play a critical role in shaping cryptocurrency regulations and policies in the United States. Garlinghouse, a well-known figure in the digital asset space, has a strong reputation for advocating balanced regulation and fostering innovation within the industry. If appointed, he would be among the key industry leaders advising the administration on issues related to blockchain, digital currencies, and regulatory frameworks. His selection would reaffirm the administration’s willingness to engage experienced professionals to shape the future of crypto policy in the U.S. Garlinghouse’s Relationship with Trump Garlinghouse has maintained an active relationship with President Trump, having met with him multiple times since Trump’s election victory in November 2024. Garlinghouse confirmed their first meeting shortly after the election, sparking excitement among XRP community members. In early 2025, Garlinghouse and Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, attended a dinner with Trump . Garlinghouse shared a photo from the meeting on X, captioning it, “Strong start to 2025!” His meetings with Trump have fueled speculation about his role in the administration’s digital asset strategy. While he was initially rumored to be considered for the position of Crypto Czar, the role ultimately went to venture capitalist David Sacks. Despite this, Garlinghouse remains a strong contender for a significant advisory role. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Role of the Crypto Advisory Council The U.S. Crypto Advisory Council proposed by the Trump administration will guide policies related to digital assets. This council aims to ensure the U.S. remains competitive in the global crypto economy while addressing regulatory concerns. Industry leaders, policymakers, and legal experts are expected to collaborate in crafting a balanced approach to blockchain regulation. If appointed to the council, Garlinghouse would contribute insights based on his experience leading Ripple, a company entangled in the regulatory web of the previous administration. Ripple has played a prominent role in fighting for clear regulations that promote innovation while ensuring consumer protection. Garlinghouse has also positioned himself as a moderate voice in the industry, opposing Bitcoin maximalism and advocating for a more inclusive approach that benefits the broader digital asset ecosystem. Ripple donated significantly more than its peers to political campaigns in 2024 to advocate for clear regulation, and the company’s efforts might finally be paying off.

Remember Floki Inu (FLOKI)? If you had thrown in just a few hundred bucks during its early days, you might be sitting on a small fortune right now. But hey, missing that train doesn’t mean you’re out of the game. Because guess what? History is serving up another golden chance in the form of BTFD Coin (BTFD) , and this time, you’d better be ready. BTFD Coin is already making waves, pulling in over $5.95 million in presale, with more than 69 billion coins sold to over 10,300 holders. Currently in its 14th stage, the price is locked at just $0.00016, and it’s gearing up for a 275% ROI when it hits the market at $0.0006. What’s more? This isn’t just another meme coin. BTFD packs real utility, including a high-reward staking program and a next-level Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that’s already live. So, are you going to let another Floki-like opportunity slip by? Let’s break it down. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution You Can’t Afford to Ignore If you’ve been around the crypto space long enough, you know the saying: “ Buy the Dip .” That’s exactly what BTFD is all about—seizing the moment when everyone else hesitates.

So far, over $5.95 million has been raised, with more than 69 billion BTFD coins sold. The final presale price will be $0.0006, meaning those who buy in now can expect a 275% ROI right out of the gate. Just imagine this: If you drop $12,500 into BTFD now at $0.00016, you’d be sitting on 78.125 million BTFD coins . Once it hits its listing price of $0.0006, your bag will be worth a staggering $46,875. Now tell me that doesn’t get your adrenaline pumping. Floki Inu: The Millionaire-Maker That You (Probably) Missed Let’s rewind a bit. When Floki Inu first launched, it was just another meme coin riding the hype wave of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. But what people didn’t realize back then was that Floki wasn’t just a joke—it had real utility and was one of the most engaged communities in the game. Fast forward to today, and FLOKI is one of the most recognized meme coins in the market. It soared from micro-penny prices to delivering jaw-dropping returns for early believers. Those who got in at the right time saw their portfolios explode by thousands of percent. But here’s the thing: While Floki Inu still holds weight in the market, the best time to jump in was in its early days. It’s already had its major breakout. The million-dollar question now is—where’s the next Floki? Well, you already know the answer: BTFD Coin . The Bottom Line: BTFD Is The Best New Meme Coin to Join This Week If you’re kicking yourself over missing out on Floki Inu’s meteoric rise, consider this your do-over. BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin riding the hype train—it’s backed by a thriving community, a high-earning Play-to-Earn game, and a staking system that could deliver serious returns. With over $5.95 million raised in presale, 69 billion coins sold, and the price still at just $0.00016, the window of opportunity is closing fast. Don’t be the one watching from the sidelines when BTFD takes off. Secure your position now and get in while the price is still low.

This marks the first time the SEC has recognized a Solana ETF filing, signaling a potential shift in its approach to cryptocurrency investment products. The SEC's announcement comes amid leadership changes, sparking optimism about a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. On February 6, the agency invited public comments on the filings, with a 21-day period to submit opinions after their publication in the Federal Register. This acknowledgment is particularly significant for Solana (SOL) ETFs, as the SEC had previously declined similar applications. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out that this move is noteworthy, considering past refusals. He suggested that it could reflect a changing perspective on Solana, which had previously been categorized as a security in legal cases against crypto firms. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett also highlighted the shift, noting that the SEC had pressured the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) to withdraw previous Solana ETF applications while Gary Gensler was still in charge. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called this a small but important step, emphasizing that it's the first time the SEC has recognized a financial product linked to an asset it previously labeled as a security. He attributed the decision to a possible shift in the agency’s stance under new leadership. Recently, the Cboe resubmitted 19b-4 filings for Solana ETFs on behalf of several firms, including Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital. These firms are hopeful that the SEC’s changing attitude will eventually lead to approval. Seyffart estimated that the SEC’s final decision on the Solana ETF will likely come around October 11. Alongside Solana, the SEC also acknowledged the NYSE’s application for a Grayscale Litecoin ETF , marking the second time the regulator has considered a Litecoin (LTC) ETF. Seyffart predicted that Litecoin could be the next digital asset to receive SEC approval for a spot ETF. The SEC also took a step forward with the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) by acknowledging a Nasdaq filing related to in-kind creations and redemptions. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called this a necessary move but criticized how long it had taken. While the SEC’s latest decisions mark progress for crypto ETFs, actual approval is still uncertain. The impact of the SEC’s new leadership under President Trump remains to be seen, but many investors are hopeful that more cryptocurrency ETFs will gain approval in the near future.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|SOL|LTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-07 07:19:59

This shift indicates a crucial change in investment approaches within the crypto sphere. Explore the elements driving this movement and discover what it might imply for future financial prospects. XYZ’s Meteoric Rise: The Meme Coin Champion Taking the Crypto World by Storm XYZVerse is emerging as the reigning force in meme coins. Awarded the title of Best NEW Meme Project, it merges the dynamic spirit of sports with meme culture, attracting millions of enthusiasts eager to join a larger movement. Every epic tale needs a protagonist. Not always the largest or the mightiest, but the one bold enough to keep advancing. That's XYZepe, the masked warrior, the unwavering advocate, and the steadfast holder of $XYZ. His quest is to elevate XYZVerse to the pinnacle of CoinMarketCap and etch XYZ into the annals of crypto history. In support, the CMC community stands firmly behind this rising star: 95% are decidedly optimistic about $XYZ. Yet, achieving greatness requires effort—it's earned through challenges. $XYZ has progressed through 9 out of 15 presale phases, with its vibrant community fueling its momentum for an impressive launch. Currently undervalued at $0.002, $XYZ presents a promising opportunity. By the conclusion of the presale, it's anticipated to climb to $0.1. The battle isn't over, but the route to triumph is clearly mapped out. Rewards for the Victorious In XYZVerse, the community directs the action. Active participants aren't mere onlookers—they're rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their involvement. It's a scenario where the most committed players achieve significant rewards. Pathway to Triumph With robust tokenomics, strategic listings on CEX and DEX, and regular token burns, $XYZ is primed for a victorious journey. Every strategy is crafted to propel it forward, fortify its value, and galvanize a community of believers who understand this is more than just a meme coin—it's the dawn of something extraordinary. XYZepe is battling for glory. Are you ready to step into the arena? Pepe (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) has recently witnessed notable price fluctuations. Over the last week, the coin saw a decline of 17.56%, contributing to a larger 50.87% drop over the past month. However, over the past six months, PEPE has still recorded a 20.04% increase. This indicates that despite recent downturns, the coin has sustained some long-term growth. At present, PEPE is trading within a range of roughly $0.0000089 to $0.0000136. The nearest support level sits at $0.000007078, potentially providing a buffer if prices continue to decrease. In contrast, the closest resistance level is at $0.000016618. Surpassing this resistance could indicate potential for further growth. The secondary support and resistance levels at $0.0000023083 and $0.00002138 suggest broader limits the coin might explore in the future. Technical indicators offer a mixed perspective for PEPE. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are nearly aligned, at $0.00001019 and $0.00001036 respectively, hinting at a consolidation phase. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 52.42, which is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The stochastic oscillator measures 71.42, suggesting a lean towards overbought conditions. The MACD level is slightly positive at 0.000000021313, reflecting minimal bullish momentum. Based on these indicators, PEPE's price could either stabilize or experience slight upward movement, but traders should closely monitor the support and resistance levels. Conclusion While tokens like PEPE have their merits, XYZVerse (XYZ), the inaugural all-sport memecoin, aims for 20,000% growth by uniting sports enthusiasts within a community-driven ecosystem.

A warning has been issued by the scam detection platform Scam Sniffer. In a Feb. 6 post on the social media platform X, Scam Sniffer said that cyber criminals were connecting to legitimate Phantom wallets and attempting to trick users to expose their private keys with a fake “update extension” signature request. Phantom wallet becoming a target for scammers as popularity surges A potential reason Phantom wallet users are being targeted by scammers could be because the application has observed rapid user adoption recently, particularly in the expanding Solana meme coin market. According to DeFiLlama, Phantom’s revenue from transaction fees has been over $470,000 in the last 24 hours, exceeding Coinbase Wallet. This is after the daily revenue for Phantom peaked at $3.6 million on Jan. 19. Additionally, the Solana-based crypto wallet currently boasts more than 10 million monthly active users and processed more than 850 million transactions in 2024 alone. Phantom just added multi currency support for 16 different currencies as well, and raised $150 million in a Series C investment round headed by Sequoia Capital and Paradigm, valuing the firm at $3 billion, according to a Jan. 17 announcement by the wallet’s team. Crypto holders lose $10.25 million to phishing attacks in January Scam Sniffer’s warning around phishing attacks targeting Phantom wallet users follows a Feb. 4 X thread posted by the platform that revealed 9,220 victims lost $10.25 million to phishing attacks in January. This was a 56% drop from the $23.58 million that was lost through this type of attack in December 2024. 🚨 ScamSniffer January 2025 Phishing Report 9,220 victims lost $10.25M to crypto phishing scams last month, a 56% drop from December 2024 ($23.58M). While losses fell, malware threats surged—though this report covers only wallet-draining phishing signatures. 🧵 [1/6] pic.twitter.com/DW00yPdBTo — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) February 4, 2025 The platform said that Ethereum (ETH) investors were hit the hardest, with holders of the leading altcoin losing more than $8.6 million in January, accounting for approximately 80% of the funds that were stolen. The rest of the crypto that was stolen was from other blockchains including BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Polygon and Optimism. Earlier in the year, on Jan. 31, Scam Sniffer took to X to warn investors about about the fake Phantom wallet popups. It urged users to never enter their recovery phrase on any website. It also said that investors can take steps to identify potential scam websites when in doubt. Some of the preventative actions mentioned by Scam Sniffer is to try and right-click on a website, because scam websites remove the ability for visitors to right-click. Another step users can take is to verify the URL.

As markets react to macroeconomic changes and Trump’s trade policies , traders are watching closely to see how this impacts short-term price movements. Bitcoin options show a higher number of buy contracts compared to sell contracts , indicating optimism among investors. The price point causing the most losses for BTC holders sits below the highly anticipated six-figure mark. Meanwhile, Ethereum options are also expiring, with a similarly cautious outlook. This week’s expiration is much smaller compared to last week, when total contracts exceeded several billion dollars. The difference comes from last week including a full month’s worth of expirations. Analysts note that market sentiment has been weaker, contributing to lower key price thresholds for Bitcoin and Ethereum. ETH recently dropped to its lowest point in a long time, while BTC has struggled to stay above a major psychological level. Experts at Greeks.live point out that recent market swings are still influenced by Trump’s tariffs , which triggered one of the biggest single-day liquidations in history . In addition to trade policies, economic data is in focus. US unemployment and job reports are being released today, and they could heavily impact investor confidence. Higher unemployment could push more investors toward Bitcoin , while stronger job numbers might make traditional markets more appealing. With global economic shifts and policy uncertainty at play, crypto markets remain volatile.

The report highlights rapid growth in the crypto sector, with over 37 million tokens now in circulation, most of them on Solana. January 2025 saw the crypto market reach its highest value of the year, with strong gains in several areas. However, AI-related crypto projects struggled, particularly due to DeepSeek's impact. Binance Research, a division of the world’s largest crypto exchange, released its latest Monthly Market Insights report, emphasizing the explosion of new tokens. According to the report, the rise of token launchpads and meme coin hype has driven the number of tokens past 37 million, with projections expecting more than 100 million by year-end. While this trend has fueled speculation and trading activity, it has also led to capital being spread across numerous projects, making it harder for many tokens to maintain high values. Despite the enthusiasm around meme coins, the report also raised concerns. Binance noted that the rapid increase in these tokens is shifting focus away from traditional altcoins and reducing long-term investor commitment. The research pointed out that most of these newly launched coins have little real market value. However, the meme coin boom has had a major effect on decentralized exchanges ( DEXs ), particularly on Solana. The surge in meme coin trading helped Solana’s DEX volume grow significantly, pushing its trading ratio compared to Ethereum past 300% in January. Binance Research also examined the political shifts that followed Trump’s inauguration and their effect on the crypto industry. Following the resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler , ETF applications soared. The report confirms that there are now 47 active ETF applications in the US, covering 16 different asset types , including meme coins. Overall, Binance concluded that January was a strong month for the crypto sector, except for AI-related tokens , which suffered major losses. DeepSeek’s actions caused a severe downturn in AI crypto projects, though the DeFAI sector managed to recover slightly by the end of the month, limiting its losses. While the AI market took a hit, the rest of the industry continued to show resilience and expansion.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET|RESEARCH|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-07 07:29:27

After struggling in 2024, experts believe it could make a big comeback in 2025. Some predictions even suggest that LINK could 4x in value and hit $100! This sudden rise is linked to major partnerships and support from Trump’s World Liberty Financial project. If these deals help Chainlink grow, its price could skyrocket. Let’s see why Chainlink price prediction for 2025 looks so exciting. Chainlink Price Prediction: Will LINK Rise Again? The crypto market has seen a wild ride from Chainlink (LINK). It struggled most of 2024, losing value and troubling investors. But in November, the price shockingly surged by 200%. But it fell once more in December, mostly negating all of its increases, right as fast as it rose. Though some analysts believe Chainlink price prediction shows a strong comeback in 2025, many investors felt letdown. LINK indicated some encouraging movement at the beginning of 2025, which gave investors hope. Its price has been erratic, thus some people are not sure about its future. At $20.40 right now, Chainlink trades still far from its all-time high. The Chainlink crew is developing fresh plans to stabilize the token and drive its price higher in order to recover strength. Chainlink’s significant influence in the crypto scene is one main factor explaining why its price prediction stays positive. Many blockchain initiatives depend on Chainlink since it links smart contracts with actual data. Demand for LINK tokens could rise as more companies and developers adopt Chainlink’s products, driving the price higher. Certain analysts advise Chainlink to try meme coins in line with Solana’s strategy. After testing and supporting new tokens, Solana noticed a significant increase in value; this approach might also help LINK. Should Chainlink be able to gather momentum and draw more users, 2025 could show significant expansion. While some investors are wary of past price swings, others think that Chainlink price prediction points to a bright future. This project should be under close observation by investors since, in the next months, it might be among the top performing cryptocurrencies.

According to the report, the malware was hidden inside seemingly harmless apps, such as food delivery services and AI chatbots, allowing attackers to access users’ photo galleries. The goal was to extract private recovery keys without raising suspicion. Kaspersky has not confirmed how much money or cryptocurrency was stolen but emphasized that this was a highly sophisticated attack . The operation mainly targeted users in Europe and Asia , and the language found in the malware’s source code led researchers to conclude that the perpetrators were of Chinese origin . The affected apps have since been taken down, but this discovery is significant because crypto-related malware attacks had been declining. In contrast, social media scams involving meme coins have become more common, using aggressive tactics to manipulate investors . SparkCat’s approach was notably different, focusing on stealth rather than deception. Its ability to bypass multiple security protocols raises concerns about whether similar attacks could emerge in the future. At this stage, it remains unclear if SparkCat represents a new trend in crypto theft. Unlike traditional scams that exploit greed through fake projects, this malware relied on its victims' carelessness, silently extracting valuable data without requiring any direct engagement.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-07 07:32:42

The filings, submitted on behalf of asset managers including Bitwise, WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Invesco Galaxy, signal growing interest in expanding crypto investment options beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple, has long been a subject of regulatory scrutiny, particularly due to its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite this, the latest ETF applications highlight increasing confidence in XRP’s potential as a tradable asset on major exchanges. Speaking on the development, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted, “This is just a first step. We’ll need to see 19b-4 and S-1 filings before the SEC officially acknowledges them and sets a decision timeline.” His comments suggest that while the filings are a notable milestone, the approval process could take time. The move to introduce XRP spot ETFs follows the broader trend of crypto ETFs gaining traction in traditional finance. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in early 2024 opened the door for asset managers to explore similar products for other major cryptocurrencies. Ethereum spot ETFs have also been filed and are awaiting SEC decisions, setting a precedent for potential approval of other digital asset ETFs. However, the regulatory landscape remains a key factor in the success of these filings. XRP’s legal history with the SEC has created uncertainty in the past, as the regulator has argued that XRP constitutes an unregistered security. The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC has seen partial victories for both sides, with a 2023 ruling stating that XRP is not a security when sold to retail investors but may be considered one in institutional sales. Despite the regulatory challenges, ETF issuers remain optimistic about XRP’s viability in the market. If approved, spot XRP ETFs would provide investors with direct exposure to the asset without requiring them to hold or manage digital wallets. This could attract institutional investors and potentially boost liquidity for XRP. Market experts believe that the SEC’s decision on Ethereum ETFs could influence the fate of XRP-based ETFs. If the commission approves Ethereum spot ETFs, it may set a precedent for XRP’s approval. However, if the SEC continues to resist broader crypto ETF offerings, issuers may face significant hurdles. At present, the filings are in the early stages, and the SEC will need to review them before making any official decisions. The approval process for Bitcoin spot ETFs took several years, and analysts suggest that XRP ETFs could face a similarly lengthy evaluation. For now, the crypto industry is watching closely to see how regulators respond to this latest development. If approved, XRP spot ETFs could mark another major step toward mainstream adoption of digital assets within traditional financial markets.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|MARKET|ETH|BTC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-07 07:36:00

Russian traders make up the second-largest user group on the platform, but several other exchanges remain dominant in the country’s crypto market. While this decision aligns with EU regulations, it may impact Deribit more than Russia’s crypto sector . According to TASS , Deribit is fully withdrawing from Russia, with some exceptions. Russian-born individuals holding citizenship or permanent residency in the European Economic Area can still use the platform, but Russian firms are completely banned . Deribit issued a statement explaining its decision: “Due to EU sanctions against Russia, we can no longer accept Russian nationals or residents as clients, unless an exception applies. Since our parent company is Dutch, these sanctions affect us directly.” Sanctions have significantly influenced Russia’s crypto industry , with digital assets becoming a widely used tool to bypass financial restrictions. Russian officials have openly acknowledged crypto’s role in this strategy, as seen at last year’s BRICS Summit . However, the U.S. Treasury continues to tighten its grip by imposing additional sanctions on crypto platforms facilitating Russian transactions. Deribit previously operated in Russia despite U.S. sanctions, but the new EU measures forced it to change course. This is part of a broader regulatory struggle that led Deribit to relocate to Dubai in 2023. However, even Russians living in Dubai are now prohibited from signing up. This is not the exchange’s only challenge . Recently, Deribit was considering a buyout by Kraken , signaling possible financial uncertainty. Additionally, while the platform is popular in Russia, it ranks below several larger competitors in the country. These sanctions could ultimately harm Deribit more than Russia’s crypto market . The incident also highlights the growing importance of decentralized finance ( DeFi ) .

Meanwhile, the sluggish trend of Bitcoin, without a strong attempt to reclaim the levels above $100K, raises some concerns over the next price action. Meanwhile, over 26,000 BTC options are about to expire today worth over $2.54 billion, with a maxpain point at around $100,000. Therefore, the BTC price is expected to display a significant rise in volatility in the next few hours. Besides this, the ETF volume has dropped to some extent, while the outflows have to be more than that of inflows. Amid the growing uncertainties around Bitcoin, the massive outflow from the centralized exchanges flashes massive bullish signals for the crypto. As per the data from Glassnode, over 170,000 BTC were withdrawn from centralized exchanges during the previous day’s trade, marking it one of the largest outflows since April 2024. This is a massive bullish signal for the BTC price rally, as the market participants could be extremely bullish on the price rally ahead. This suggests the whales are holding, which validates that this is not the top for the BTC price rally. Hence, this shift could introduce new opportunities for the market participants. What’s next? When will the price rise back above $100,000? After the recent pullback, the Bitcoin price is struggling to rise above the crucial resistance zone between $98,612 and $99,500 for a couple of days. This consolidation is expected to prevail for some more time as the bulls continue to display weakness. The drop in the CMF suggests the growing weakness within the rally as the bears are gaining strength against the bulls. However, the RSI has displayed a bullish divergence hinting towards a potential rebound. Therefore, Bitcoin (BTC) remains within a bullish range, provided the support at $95,000 is defended well. Otherwise, a pullback could lower the ranges close to $92,000, wherein a reversal is expected at $91,500. Hence, a pullback below $90,000 could be less viable until the bears do not intensify their action.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-07 07:46:02

With the scalability and security aspects having been solved through layer one and layer two chains, the distribution of altcoins to achieve higher decentralization has been a work in progress in most projects. The use of play-to-airdrops (P2A) has gained significant momentum in the GamiFi sector. However, the control of altcoin projects by whale investors remains evident in most tokens. Shiba Inu Leads in Whale’s Control According to on-chain data analysis by Santiment, Shiba Inu (SHIB), the leading memecoin on the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, has the highest level of whale control in the top altcoins. Specifically, 61.3 percent of the total circulating supply holdings is held by the top 10 largest wallets. With over 41 percent of SHIB’a total supply already burnt, 61.3 percent of the remaining 59 percent is a big proportion in the hands of whale investors. According to Santiment, the huge control of SHIB by whale investors is a double-edged sword that every retail trader should closely monitor. On one hand, the huge control of SHIB by whale investors instills confidence in the dog-themed memecoin. On the other hand, a potential selloff by the whales could be catastrophic for the memecoin.

Also, the put/call ratio for this is 0.58, indicating a significantly higher number of call (long) contracts compared to put (short) contracts. The max pain price—the level at which the majority of losses would occur—is $99,500. Source: Deribit Additionally, the Deribit data shows that the Bitcoin options open interest (OI), which represents the value of outstanding BTC options yet to expire, is concentrated at the $120,000 strike price, amounting to $1.7 billion. This shows that market analysts continue to expect bullish momentum, despite the current crypto market selloff . 204,376 Ethereum Options Contracts Set to Expire Today A total of 204,376 Ethereum (ETH) options contracts will be expiring today with a combined notional value of $557.04 million. As per the Deribit data, the put-to-call ratio of 0.46, signals a dominance of call (long) contracts over puts (shorts). The max pain point—the price level where the greatest losses would be realized—is set at $2,950. Thus, the expiry could potentially influence ETH’s price action and volatility in the short term. Source: Deribit As of press time, the Ethereum price is trading at 5.30% down, slipping under the crucial support of $2,700. This happens amid a strong altcoin market correction as the Ethereum futures open interest tanks 7.3% to $32.1 billion while the 24-hour liquidations soar to $41.79 million with $32.8 million in long liquidations. US Jobs Data Release to Decide Crypto Market Action Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins are bracing for volatility ahead of the US Job data scheduled later today.

As the U.S. prepares to release January’s Unemployment and Non-Farm Payrolls data tonight, the influence of macroeconomic factors on U.S. equities remains a focal point.

The announcement marks a key step in Bybit’s strategy to re-enter the Indian market, following a temporary suspension of its services last month . The exchange revealed that it has resolved previous regulatory concerns by settling a monetary fine of $1 million. It has ensured full adherence to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and related guidelines. “We have been working diligently with FIU-IND to address their concerns,” Bybit noted in its statement. VDASP License Bybit has applied for a Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider (VDASP) license, with its registration submission dated June 26, 2024. This license is critical for maintaining full compliance with Indian regulations governing digital asset service providers. Vikas Gupta, Bybit’s country manager for India, expressed optimism about the situation, stating they expect operations to resume fully within weeks. The move comes at a time when regulatory scrutiny around cryptocurrencies is intensifying in India. The country’s financial authorities have ramped up their oversight of digital asset transactions to combat money laundering and financial crimes. Exchanges like Bybit are now required to perform extensive anti-money laundering (AML) measures, including source-of-funds verifications, risk assessments, and customer due diligence (CDD). Broader Industry Compliance Trends India’s regulatory environment for crypto remains uncertain, with cryptocurrencies yet to be recognized as legal tender. However, crypto trading continues to thrive as users engage with exchanges operating under evolving compliance frameworks. The government is currently drafting the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, which aims to introduce an official digital currency while potentially restricting private cryptocurrencies. Other global exchanges have also faced similar regulatory hurdles in India. The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance resumed operations in June 2024 after settling a $2.25 million fine imposed by FIU-IND for non-compliance issues. As compliance standards continue to tighten in India, industry players are navigating the challenges to maintain their foothold in one of the world’s most dynamic cryptocurrency markets.

Bitcoin Coinbase Flow Pulse Is Still Signaling A Bull Market In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the latest trend in the Coinbase Flow Pulse for Bitcoin. The “Coinbase Flow Pulse” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the net amount of BTC that’s moving between Coinbase and other exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means coins are flowing from wallets associated with other exchanges to those connected to Coinbase. On the other hand, the indicator being under zero implies Coinbase is going through outflows. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Crash To $1,700 If This Support Fails, Analyst Says Now, here is the chart for the Bitcoin Coinbase Flow Pulse shared by the analyst that shows the trend in its 30-day and 90-day simple moving averages (SMAs) over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day SMA of the Bitcoin Coinbase Flow Pulse surged above the 90-day a few months back and has since maintained its steep climb, creating distance between the two lines. Historically, this type of crossover has signaled a shift toward a bull market phase for Bitcoin. Clearly, BTC hasn’t seen the reverse type of crossover yet, so this signal could still be considered active. The 30-day MA crossing above the 90-day MA implies that inflows into Coinbase are gaining momentum. The reason this acts as a bullish signal for BTC is that the platform is primarily used by institutional entities based in the US. Whenever coins are flowing into Coinbase, it’s a sign that these American traders are interested in the cryptocurrency. As the analyst explains, Currently, a bullish phase prevails, driven by strong institutional interest. The absence of significant red zones indicates no large-scale outflows typically seen in a bear market when capital shifts from the spot market to futures. While a transfer of wealth from other exchanges to Coinbase is a positive sign for Bitcoin, exchange inflows that occur from self-custodial wallets can be a bearish sign instead. Fortunately, BTC doesn’t have to worry about this for now as the BTC Exchange Reserve, a metric that measures the total amount of the asset sitting on centralized exchanges, has plunged.

IntelMarkets (INTL) presents itself as the upcoming market leader by combining AI and DeFi technologies into a disruptive trading platform. The strong presale response for INTL makes investors beg the question: Is this presale the next Dogecoin? IntelMarkets (INTL): The Next Evolution of Crypto Trading Unlike Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), which are experiencing significant volatility, IntelMarkets (INTL) utilizes strong foundational technology in its foundation. Trading with AI-backed insights enables users to maximize their crypto trading decisions with superior efficiency. The AI trading robots from INTL use real-time market data to recognize trading strategies and opportunities. The analysis is powered by AI optimizing strategies through historical data and the preference of the users, to ensure the best fit for each individual user. This concept has brought much attention to the platform, with IntelMarkets tokens reaching a total of $8 million in presale earnings. The current 9th ICO stage of INTL offers tokens priced at $0.082. The strong interest from investors becomes evident, as many experts are drawing parallels between the early days of DOGE and SHIB when they were undervalued. IntelMarkets has emerged as one of the most promising cryptos of 2025, as industry analysts predict INTL tokens could rally 100x after the platform is launched. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Former High-Flyer with Fading Momentum Shiba Inu (SHIB) appeared in 2020 to become a popular crypto among users across the entire ecosystem. First, based on the ETH blockchain, Shiba Inu achieved significant value growth through its passionate community. SHIB was initially branded as a competitor to Dogecoin, hailed as the “DOGE Killer.” The meme coin reached its peak value at $0.00008845 in October 2021, which generated immense returns for early investors. However, current market conditions have seen Shiba Inu experience a substantial correction. The current trading price of SHIB is approximately $0.00001559, falling over 80% of its ATH value. After developing its own Shiba Inu ecosystem, developments like Shibarium and ShibaSwap have seen increased real world use cases for SHIB. However, there are still many forks in the road for SHIB. Analysts are sceptical of Shiba Inu repeating its ATH rally, unless BTC reaches a new high above $200k. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Faces an Uncertain Future No one has forgotten the 2021 rally of Dogecoin when it achieved its highest price point at $0.7376. However, since then, DOGE’s value has faced continuous challenges during the present year after settling at $0.2660 in current market conditions. Facing a significant 40% fall in price, Dogecoin has seen increased skepticism as the market moves away from memecoins. Due to the lack of innovative improvements, the DOGE price will always be dictated by speculative movements. Many analysts claim that in current market conditions, Dogecoin is too risky to buy, with the RSI at 32. As investors search for alternatives, IntelMarkets (INTL) emerges as one of the sophisticated utility-driven platforms that threatens DOGE’s market dominance. Conclusion: The Future of Crypto is AI-Powered The crypto industry is advancing toward a new era as IntelMarkets (INTL) takes the lead in shaping this evolution. As investors find Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) less attractive due to their growth prospects, many have pivoted. The AI-driven trading ecosystem of IntelMarkets provides market enthusiasts with a cutting-edge system that serves as a dynamic solution above traditional altcoins.

Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin, is being called the next big opportunity for exponential growth. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Ultimate Choice 1. A Fresh Entrant With Massive Potential: As a newly launched coin, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors the chance to enter at the ground floor. Its early-stage momentum makes it one of the most promising opportunities to achieve life-changing gains. 2. Record-Breaking Presale Success: Raising $1.5 million almost instantly, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven itself as a high-demand asset. This presale success has cemented its place as a token with unmatched growth potential. 3. Exclusivity That Drives Demand: Unlike ETH, MATIC, or APT, which are widely traded on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity creates urgency and scarcity, increasing its value to early adopters. How It Stands Up Against Competitors XRP: A leader in payments, but it no longer offers the early-stage returns seen with this new coin. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability but can’t match the momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Optimism (OP): A rising Layer-2 solution but lacks the excitement surrounding this token. SEI: Innovative but doesn’t have the same presale success or exclusivity. Secure Your Position Before It’s Too Late With its record-breaking presale and massive growth projections, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly becoming the most talked-about investment of 2025.

Legal challenges and market volatility have almost clouded Ripple’s future. However, a new crypto player, DTX Exchange is gaining attention. This pioneering hybrid trading platform, priced at $0.16, is marking its name by combining traditional financial elements with cryptocurrencies. With a unique model and impressive early performance, could DTX end up being the next big crypto disruptor, possibly even an XRP alternative? Let’s explore the possibilities. XRP Price Plunges: What’s Next for Ripple? As of February 6, 2025, the XRP price stands at around $2.4. In 2012, Ripple made headlines as the parent company of XRP when major banks joined up to reshape how cross-border payments work. By 2017, Ripple had wide adoption that took the XRP price to new peaks. Things took a drastic turn when in late 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple for selling unregistered securities. This lawsuit shook investor confidence. Despite the legal battles, XRP price has shown resilience and bounced back by 30% in early 2025 after the market dip. Analysts have mixed views on the XRP price growth. Some predict exponential growth, while others expect a minor increase. Key factors like the outcome of the SEC lawsuit, market trends, and strategic partnerships will determine the XRP price’s future. These events could make it a coin to watch closely. However, crypto investors and traders who are tired of uncertainty, increasingly search for newer and more stable crypto alternatives such as DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange: An AI-Backed Crypto with 100x Potential DTX Exchange is rapidly gaining waves in 2025 as a hybrid trading platform that is attempting to bring some uniqueness to crypto and traditional finance. By early February 2025, the platform has managed to raise more than $13 million in presale stages while having more than 500,000 users on its side to back the project. DTX has grown remarkably well. Its token price rose from $0.02 to $0.16 during the presale stages and reflected an almost 700% rise. First Hybrid Trading Platform: Can DTX be the Next XRP at $0.016? DTX Exchange is aiming to present the hybrid trading model to the crypto world. This would combine the best of traditional finance and decentralized finance. It could also be a one-stop exchange through which crypto traders can buy stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies and sell them accordingly. Besides this rich trading interface, DTX Exchange supports the tokenized real-world assets of commodities and real estate. These tokenized products further enhance trading opportunities by providing a range of assets, ultimately increasing the overall profit potential in the platform. Another strong feature of the platform is the staking mechanism, which could enable users to receive passive income in the form of staking. DTX’s hybrid model could prove to be a strong contender against established players like XRP, especially in terms of asset diversity and leverage options. While XRP price has gone through legal battles and volatility, DTX’s fully integrated approach to the old as well as new crypto market can attract a larger group of investors. The hybrid nature of DTX allows it to offer more liquidity as well as the chance for higher profit, which may lead to faster adoption and further growth in the long run. Conclusion DTX Exchange is poised to reform the crypto market with its hybrid trading model. Combining CeFi and DeFi features, DTX is well on its way to becoming a major competitor to Ripple and other established players. Its impressive growth in presale and promise of high liquidity and leverage could attract retail and institutional investors. If DTX meets its full potential and fulfills all the promises it has for the future, it could be the next XRP.

In a new video, the analyst pseudonymously known as Credible Crypto tells his 67,500 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is about to embark on the fifth wave of a bullish trend. According to the analyst who regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, BTC could rally by a minimum of 52% from the current level over the coming weeks and months. The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. “ The moves to the upside as we go up here should get even more aggressive than the move from $58,000 to $90,000 because this is essentially the parabolic blow-off top, the final fifth wave of the fifth wave of the cycle that started back when Bitcoin was at $3,000 in 2018. So this is seven years in the making and this move should be the most aggressive move we’ve seen in the cycle – which means it should be the most violent move to the upside that we’ve seen the last seven years… …we have our minimum target here of $150,000. We should break that I think in the next wave up, see some consolidation and go for a final fifth wave. I’m not sure how high that’s going to go but it should be somewhere under $300,000.” Source: Credible Crypto/YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $98,500 at time of writing. Credible Crypto, however, says Bitcoin could first plunge to levels last witnessed in November of 2024 without altering the bullish market structure he sees developing before a potential breakout. “So people that are freaking out if we do get a move into the $80,000, you should not be. That’s totally healthy and fine. Even the $70,000 is fair game, although I don’t think that we will necessarily get that now.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The cryptocurrency is yet to break out in either direction, leaving investors in suspense about its next big move. The current pattern suggests that Bitcoin is still working through a consolidation phase. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading below the $98,000 mark and the coin has dropped by more than seven percent in the last week. Resistance and Support Levels to Watch Bitcoin is currently moving from a support level near the lower boundary of the sideways range towards resistance. The immediate resistance area lies between $97,521 and $98,430. If the price pushes through this range, it could signal a potential upward shift. However, a failure to break above this resistance may suggest more downside in the short term. Short-Term Bearish or Bullish? Currently, the short-term trend leans slightly bearish, as Bitcoin navigates through a corrective wave. If the price fails to maintain support at $93,633, there could be more downside, possibly targeting the mid-to-low $80k range. On the other hand, a strong breakout above resistance could signal the start of a more significant upward movement. While the current focus is on short-term price action, it’s important to remember that the larger pattern remains bullish. The ongoing corrective structure could be part of a more extensive upward movement that could eventually take Bitcoin back to higher price levels. Popular analyst Capo wrote, “Don’t get scared if we see another 5%-10% drop to form a higher low. Just hold/buy the dip. This really looks like a local bottom formation.” However, he later made another prediction and said, “Maybe $88k-90k for BTC.”",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-07 08:09:41

Utah is making waves in the crypto world as its House advances a bill that could allow the state to invest public funds in Bitcoin and other high-cap cryptos. The bill , known as HB230, now heads to the Senate, bringing Utah one step closer to holding Bitcoin in its treasury. If passed, it would make Utah the first U.S. state to officially establish a Bitcoin reserve—at least, that’s what supporters claim. A Bold Move or a Clever Rebrand? The bill, proposed by Representative Jordan Teuscher, would allow the state treasurer to allocate up to 5% of certain public funds into “qualifying digital assets.” Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other top cryptos could be included in this mix. Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Action Fund, celebrated the bill’s progress, calling it a massive win for Bitcoin adoption in the U.S. Joining the excitement, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett said that the states are moving fast on BTC legislation. MASSIVE BREAKING: The ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ bill has officially PASSED the House in the state of Utah – The bill now moves onto the Senate! pic.twitter.com/qIaE7bWCzB — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) February 6, 2025 However, not everyone is convinced. Crypto analyst Justin Bechler poured cold water on the excitement, arguing that the bill isn’t actually a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” I hate to be a buzzkill but you've been deceived (again). Utah H.B. 230 is not a ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve."" It has nothing whatsoever to do with Bitcoin. In fact, it doesn't reference Bitcoin once. https://t.co/2TYCQwhK5q pic.twitter.com/X17gALIdMI — Justin Bechler (@1914ad) February 6, 2025 He pointed out that nowhere in the bill does it explicitly mention Bitcoin, suggesting that its scope might be broader than what supporters are claiming. This has raised questions about whether the bill is truly a pro-Bitcoin initiative or simply a rebranding of general crypto investment. Responding to the critics, Dennis Porter clarified that although the Utah bill doesn’t explicitly mention Bitcoin, it’s intentionally drafted this way to increase its chances of becoming law. He explained that the bill’s language is designed so that only Bitcoin qualifies, even without directly naming it. According to Porter, this strategic wording helps avoid political resistance, making it the most effective approach to get states to invest in Bitcoin. Other States Are Jumping In Utah isn’t alone in pushing for Bitcoin-friendly legislation. Arizona has a similar bill, SB1025, which has already passed the Senate Finance Committee and now awaits a House vote. Meanwhile, New Mexico has joined the race with its own proposal, SB57, which also aims to allocate 5% of public funds to Bitcoin. Not all states are on board, though. North Dakota recently rejected a crypto investment bill, with lawmakers voting 57-32 against it. This mixed response across the country shows that while some states are eager to embrace Bitcoin, others remain skeptical about its role in public finance.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-07 08:13:48

Here’s All,https://coingape.com/can-fartcoin-price-rally-to-1-4-or-a-crash-to-0-35-looms-heres-all/,"Fartcoin price remains much-eyed by crypto market traders and investors globally as the meme coin has fallen from grace, down nearly 83% from its peak and now at the $0.46 level. Nevertheless, recent market data flagged rising whale accumulations for the Solana meme coin, conversely generating sentiments of a price recovery ahead. Despite the current market volatility, two smart whales collectively bagged nearly 6 million tokens. As a result, market participants speculate whether a recovery to $1.4 or a crash to $0.35 awaits amid broader trends. Fartcoin Price Bullish Amid Smart Whale Accumulations? The latest whale data suggests that a potential recovery awaits the meme coin despite the broader turbulent trend. According to the on-chain transaction tracker’ ai_9684xtpa’ on X , two smart money addresses bagged massive amounts of the Solana meme token amid its slump. Per the data, smart trader ‘Ansem’ added 818,000 tokens at an average price of $0.4142. Further, the new address ’59aZn..’ bagged 5 million tokens from Kraken at a withdrawal price of $0.4574. Although Fartcoin price is currently down 83% from its peak, these accumulations sparked optimism surrounding the coin’s future movements, signaling a ‘buy-the-dip’ opportunity. Crypto Enthusiast Rationalizes Price Dip Meanwhile, crypto market enthusiast ElonMoney recently took to X, rationalizing the current dip in Fartcoin. According to the market enthusiast, a broader slumping action can currently be witnessed across the altcoin sector, with AI tokens, ai16z, & Fartcoin following the trend. In light of this broader trend, the Solana meme coin also dropped from a $2.6 billion market cap despite having strong sentiment, high mindshare, and significant inflows. The market expert adds, “This isn’t about the token – it’s about the market.” Source: ElonMoney, X Fartcoin Price Target: $1.4 Or $0.35 Ahead? At the time of reporting, FARTCOIN price witnessed a 10.5% drop in value over the past day and is currently trading at $0.4662. The coin’s intraday low and high were $0.4126 and $0.5166, respectively. Crypto traders and investors remain bullish in the wake of the abovementioned smart money accumulations, expecting a recovery ahead. However, the current crypto market trend has presented altcoins and meme coins with substantial pressure. In light of this trend, market analyst Vegeta further took to X, spotlighting that the range from $0.39 to $0.69 remains vital to confirm a bullish or bearish run ahead. A sustained break above $0.69 could pave the way for further gains, and thus a $1 price target, given the asset sees renewed market interest as seen with the abovementioned buying by smart whales. Conversely, a slip below $0.39 may bring further downside pressure to the asset. Source: VegetaCrypto1, X A recent Fartcoin price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the token witnessed a drop amid market interest shifting toward the TRUMP token. As per the analysis, the meme coin significantly lost its market cap amid TRUMP’s launch as liquidity from the broader Solana meme coin sector shifted to the new token. Nevertheless, with smart whales buying in action, a market sentiment shift could be witnessed ahead. The analysis further revealed that a recovery above $1.00 could signal renewed confidence, thus paving the way for $1.4, given buyers sustain the movement.

The initiative aims to advance decentralization in community governance through the Taiko Grant Factory Hackathon. The Taiko Grant Factory Hackathon is designed to unleash developer creativity—driving innovation, interactive applications, and projects with real-world impact. After months of intense competition, the finalists are now heading into the voting phase—one of the biggest steps yet toward large-scale, community-driven decision-making. At the core of this vote is Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (MACI), a game-changing privacy-preserving and collusion-resistant voting mechanism originally conceptualized by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Vitalik has long pointed out the fundamental flaws of traditional voting systems—fraud, collusion, privacy leaks—and MACI is Ethereum’s answer to fixing them. Dora Factory, the decentralized governance protocol, carried Vitalik's mission and shipped the best MACI product the market has seen. For the final round of Taiko’s Grant Factory Hackathon, voting will be executed entirely on-chain via MACI, ensuring encrypted ballots, zero-knowledge proof integrity, and protection against vote buying and collusion. Users will submit their votes through smart contracts, with timestamps recorded on-chain, making the process transparent yet private. At the end of the voting round, results will be revealed by the designated operator, ensuring both fairness and credibility. As an incentive, Taiko is distributing 50,000 Trailblazer points to participants, which will later translate into an airdrop. ""This is decentralization in action,"" says Ben Wan, Taiko’s Community Director. ""We’re thrilled to bring MACI to this scale and grateful to the community for participating in Taiko’s growth. The future of Ethereum is decentralized, and we’re here to make that happen—together."" This vote isn’t just big—it’s historic. Over 920,000 participants are taking part, making it the largest whitelisted anonymous community vote in Ethereum’s history The voting event has attracted significant participation, with more than 920,000 individuals expected to take part, making it one of the largest whitelisted anonymous community votes in Ethereum’s history. Steve Ngok, Partner at DoraHacks, adds: “We’re incredibly excited to work with Taiko on launching the biggest MACI-powered vote in Ethereum history. DoraHacks and Dora Factory have committed resources to expanding Ethereum’s mission—advancing MACI for decentralized governance and privacy protection. We look forward to exploring MACI’s full potential alongside Taiko and its dynamic community.” About DoraHacks DoraHacks is the world's largest hacker movement and a leading global platform for open-source funding, hackathons, and developer grants. Since its inception in 2014, DoraHacks has empowered 200,000 developers and funded 20,000 innovative startups in multiple frontier tech verticals in Web3, AI, Quantum and more.

With the election now moved to 23 February , it could reshape how digital assets are handled in Europe’s biggest economy. Why This Election Matters for Crypto Germany has been facing political uncertainty since the ruling coalition, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, collapsed last year. To stabilize the government, the election was moved up to February 2025 instead of September 2025. Overall 630 parliament members will be elected through the voting, and at least 316 seats are needed for a majority. The outcome could bring big changes to crypto rules and wealth taxation. AfD Pushes for Crypto Deregulation One of the biggest surprises in this election is the stance of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party which is currently ranking second in the polls according to the Polymarket prediction platform. The AfD is calling for fewer restrictions on Bitcoin, crypto trading, and digital wallets. However, the party wants businesses and investors to have more freedom when dealing with digital assets, which could drive more adoption in Germany. Right now, Germany has strict laws under the German Banking Act to regulate crypto activities. But, if AfD gains power, they plan to loosen these rules, making Germany a more crypto-friendly nation. The party also opposes the introduction of a digital euro, arguing that cash should remain the country’s only official legal tender. Greens Party Aims to Tackle Crypto Crime While AfD pushes for deregulation, the Greens Party currently in third place has a different plan. They propose creating a nationwide service center to fight financial crimes linked to crypto. This would help track activities like tax evasion, money laundering, and fraud, ensuring stricter oversight of digital asset Germany’s Crypto Boom Despite political uncertainty, Germany’s interest in crypto is stronger than ever. Last year, Deutsche Bank launched a crypto custody service, and DZ Bank introduced a crypto trading pilot program for retail clients. As election day approaches, the big question remains will Germany loosen crypto laws, or will new regulations make it tougher for digital assets.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-07 09:05:43

As investors scramble to build position ahead of a potential blockbuster run in the market, analysts are pointing to a rush of fresh excitement across the crypto market. Bitcoin’s resilience through recent macroeconomic and geopolitical turbulence has kept the broader bullish crypto outlook intact. Adding to the optimism is the successful conclusion of Dogizen’s DOGIZ token offering on Telegram. Dogizen’s ICO: a final chance for an early entry? The crypto market has had a jittery start to 2025. However, analysts such as VanEck’s head of digital asset research Matthew Sigel maintain a bullish outlook. In a recent analysis , Sigel and fellow VanEck analyst Patrick Bush project that the price of Solana will rise to $520 before the end of the year. This prediction focuses on the US M2 money supply. If this is the case for SOL, other uniquely positioned projects are likely to see a similar trend. Hiccups such as US-China trade wars may only be a buy-the-dip opportunity. With the ICO ending and Dogizen shifting on Sui, investors are extremely upbeat. A lot of this optimism is down to Telegram’s growth as a base for major mini-games. The explosive rise of Hamster Kombat, Catizen, and others gives positive vibes. More significantly, Dogizen’s ICO, which raised over $4.5 million during its presale, showcases a strategic and structured approach that contrasts sharply with the disorderly aftermath often associated with tap-to-earn game airdrops. The presale’s success indicates strong interest and a committed community of holders, signaling potential sustained engagement even after the DOGIZ token is listed on exchanges. If the project takes advantage of its rollout on Sui and the expected traction on Telegram, it could be one of the new market entrants to watch in 2025 and beyond. This would mean buying DOGIZ at the presale price of $0.000089 could be a great opportunity. What are Dogizen buyers eyeing? Post-presale, the Dogizen token’s listing on DEX and CEX platforms will be a crucial step. However, other than price appreciation, there are plenty of bullish projections for this game on Telegram. After reaching the 1 million user milestone, completing the ICO, and probably listing on top exchanges, the focus will be on the next phase of growth. This includes the release of the Dogizen Launchpad and the expansion of the gaming arcade. Powered by DOGIZ, growth for these innovations means greater adoption for Dogizen. But apart from securing key brand partnerships, the other massive opportunity is the launch of revenue sharing for DOGIZ holders. Add to that the opportunity that comes with staking rewards and the incentive to become a long-term holder grows. Riding both the Telegram game train, a bullish 2025 and an anticipated meme coin rally is why Dogizen is a hot trend today. Learn more about Dogizen, the tokenomics, and the roadmap here .

Here Are the Details",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoins-network-activity-index-drops-15-percent-since-november-golds-rise-continues-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to pause as weak on-chain activity dampens investor sentiment, while gold remains on an upward trajectory ahead of the all-important U.S. nonfarm payrolls report. Gold Rises, Bitcoin Continues to Fall Ahead of Key US Employment Report Despite Bitcoin recovering from the recent drop, it has struggled to maintain momentum above $100,000. Analysts at CryptoQuant estimate BTC’s fair value to be between $48,000 and $95,000, suggesting the asset may be overvalued at its current price level of $97,000. In addition, Bitcoin’s Network Activity Index has fallen by 15% since November, reaching 3,760 points, its lowest level in more than a year. The decline was driven by a 53% drop in daily transactions, falling from an all-time high of 734,000 in September to just 346,000. The Trump administration’s slow progress on creating a proposed BTC strategic reserve has also dampened sentiment. Even Eric Trump’s recent support for BTC through his family-linked World Liberty Financial has failed to generate significant bullish momentum. In contrast, gold is up over 9% year to date, hitting an all-time high of $2,882 per ounce. The metal, which has gained 2.32% this week alone, marked its sixth consecutive weekly gain. UBS analysts say gold’s role as a store of value and hedge against uncertainty is a factor that has distracted investors from Bitcoin’s modest price action. All Eyes on Nonfarm Payrolls and the Fed Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report is expected to be a key market mover. Forecasts tracked by FXStreet predict that 170,000 new jobs will be added in January, up from 256,000 in December, and the unemployment rate will remain at 4.1%. A weaker-than-expected report could revive hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts and potentially boost riskier assets like Bitcoin and stocks. On the other hand, strong employment data combined with rising tariffs could complicate the Fed’s rate strategy and lead to risk aversion and further weakness in BTC. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Hyperliquid remains steady and TRUMP token faces challenges, institutional investors are showing interest in BitLemons. Table of Contents BitLemons drives new GambleFi solutions HYPE maintains momentum despite market pressure TRUMP token faces growing challenges With real revenue and growing demand, BitLemons soars As Hyperliquid (HYPE) shows strength and TRUMP token faces uncertainty, institutional investors are quietly positioning themselves in what could be 2025’s most interesting GambleFi token. BitLemons (BLEM) has already secured an impressive $1 million in seed funding, with major players betting big on this revenue-generating powerhouse. BitLemons drives new GambleFi solutions BitLemons is transforming the online gaming landscape with its unique platform that’s already generating real revenue. The project has secured $1 million in seed funding, demonstrating strong institutional confidence in its potential to disrupt the $450 billion gaming industry. Beyond mere speculation, BitLemons offers immediate utility through its operational platform, verified by comprehensive audits from both SpyWolf and SolidProof. What sets BitLemons apart is its smart tokenomics model, allocating 30% of gross gaming revenue (GGR) to value creation: 15% powers strategic buybacks and burns, while 15% rewards staking participants, creating a sustainable ecosystem for long-term growth. HYPE maintains momentum despite market pressure Hyperliquid’s HYPE token continues to demonstrate remarkable strength in current market conditions, trading at $24.99 and maintaining its position as one of the most valuable airdropped tokens with a market capitalization exceeding $10 billion. The token’s impressive 20% surge to reach new highs reflects growing institutional confidence in the platform’s fundamentals. Looking ahead, Hyperliquid is preparing to enhance its ecosystem with the launch of its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) integration, HyperEVM, currently in testnet phase. While this update promises to introduce Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and boost cross-chain capabilities, questions remain about sustaining the current valuation in an increasingly competitive market, especially as new players emerge with revenue-generating models. TRUMP token faces growing challenges The Official Trump (TRUMP) token presents a complex market picture, currently trading at $17.91 with a 5.3% gain in the last 24 hours. Despite experiencing significant volatility since its launch ahead of President Trump’s second inauguration, the token maintains a substantial $3.59 billion market cap with robust daily trading volume of $2.37 billion. After an initial surge from $10 to $74.59, TRUMP has found a new equilibrium around current levels. While day traders capitalize on price swings between $20.35 and $17.00, the token’s speculative nature contrasts sharply with revenue-generating platforms that offer sustainable growth potential through real utility. With real revenue and growing demand, BitLemons soars Most GambleFi and crypto casino projects rely on speculation, but BitLemons is already generating revenue. Thanks to its custom-built casino platform, featuring exclusive games verified on the blockchain, the project is doing exceptionally well. But what makes it different from other crypto casinos? Unlike meme-based casino projects, BitLemons has a sustainable economic model backed by real earnings. With institutional investors already securing $1 million in the seed round, BitLemons . And with a deflationary token supply, high staking yields, and revenue-driven rewards from its GGR sharing model, early investors could see exponential gains.

He added that the company had nothing specific to report but fully expected to collaborate with Switch. Since its launch, Take-Two has brought various games to Nintendo Switch, including Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, NBA 2K, BioShock titles, and L.A Noire. Take Two’s latest report on GTA 6 stated that the game will launch in 2025; however, the company has not confirmed whether GTA 6 will be available on Switch 2. The publisher announced last year that the game would be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Take Two’s statement comes after EA CEO Andrew Wilson hinted at the company’s support for the new Switch console. The CEO hinted that the Madden NFL series could return on the new Nintendo Switch 2 console. He added the last time the franchise made an entry on Nintendo was in 2012 through Madden NFL 13 and Wii U. In an earnings call earlier this week, the EA CEO revealed that any time a new console was introduced into the marketplace, it benefited the company. He added that the console allowed the company to access new players. Wilson pointed out that the franchise typically did well on Nintendo platforms in the past. He said the company expects products like EA Sports FC and Madden to find energy on the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console. Wilson acknowledged that the Sims series succeeded on Nintendo Switch, drawing more players who had not played EA games before. Former Play Station head Shuhei Yoshida also commented on the Switch 2 reveal. He expressed his excitement for the new console and added that he hoped Nintendo would have more surprises regarding it. He pointed out his surprise at the joy-con mouse feature, noting that the Nintendo Switch 2 could be more powerful than its predecessor.

Nintendo to announce more details about Switch 2 in April Nintendo revealed the Switch 2 console last month, highlighting improvements in the system specs compared to its predecessor. In the trailer, Nintendo revealed the Switch 2 would be backwards compatible with most physical and digital Switch games. However, the company warned that certain Nintendo Switch games would not be fully compatible with the new console. The gaming company also highlighted that more details on the Switch 2 console will be revealed at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct scheduled for April 2, 2025. The company did not reveal titles that will feature on the new console. However, gamers identified from the trailer that Mario Kart may be part of the roundup in the new console. The company also revealed more details on the console, such as the new magnetic joystick design, an improvement from its predecessor, whose joysticks slid into position via rails. Nintendo has yet to confirm the console’s exact launch date, system specs, and price, which gamers anticipate will be revealed in the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.

SEC Lawsuit Updates, Cardano (ADA) Price Predictions, and More: Bits Recap Feb 7",https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-updates-cardano-ada-price-predictions-and-more-bits-recap-feb-7/,"TL;DR The legal battle between Ripple and the SEC continues, but recent changes in the regulator’s leadership may favor the company. Analysts predict a parabolic rally for Cardano (ADA), with strong fundamentals and rising adoption signaling a possible breakout despite recent price declines. Whales accumulated 750 million DOGE during the dip, and analysts see $0.17 as a potential bottom before a major price surge. More Changes at the SEC Over the past few years, Ripple secured some vital partial court wins that seemingly positioned the regulator as the underdog in the legal tussle. Most recently, the SEC enforced some amendments to its leadership, which could also be interpreted as good news for the company. As CryptoPotato reported , the agency moved Jorge Tenreiro to its computer systems management department. The law expert joined the agency 11 years ago and signed the SEC’s notice of appeal in its case against Ripple. The plea was submitted in October last year, challenging Judge Torres’ 2023 decision. At that time, she ruled that Ripple’s sales of XRP to retail investors through centralized exchanges did not violate securities regulations. Earlier this year, the SEC’s former Chairman, Gary Gensler, stepped down . The agency had a quite hostile approach towards the cryptocurrency industry during his tenure , and somewhat expectedly, the XRP community cheered his resignation. His role was succeeded by Mark Uyeda, who is pro-crypto and even criticized the SEC’s previous leadership for launching a war on the sector. ADA Bull Run in the Cards? Cardano’s native token suffered the consequences of the market decline at the start of the business week and is currently deep in the red on a 7-day scale, trading at approximately $0.71 (per CoinGecko’s data). ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko However, many industry participants believe a fresh resurgence could be just around the corner. Such is the case with Ali Martinez, who observed ADA’s performance in the past years and assumed that it might be “at the very beginning of a monster parabolic rally.” The X user Lucky was also bullish, telling his over 2 million followers on the social media platform that “strong fundamentals and rising adoption make Cardano a solid bet before the next big move.” DOGE Price Predictions Last but not least, we will touch upon the OG meme coin – Dogecoin (DOGE). Similar to ADA, it has also sank by double digits in the past week, but some factors signal a potential reversal. DOGE Price, Source: CoinGecko Martinez recently disclosed that whales accumulated 750 million tokens during the correction, describing the move as “a strong sign of confidence in the market.” For their part, the X users AMCrypto and KALEO outlined predictions for the near future.

The token lacks a compelling narrative like that of its larger peer bitcoin (BTC, the bank said, adding that bitcoin benefits from its perception as a store of value and as digital gold. Despite upgrades, such as Dencun , activity has shifted from the main Ethereum network to its layer 2's, which is detrimental to the blockchain's growth, the report said. The network's latest upgrade, Pectra , is likely to happen in early April. ""Competitive pressures have led some decentralized applications (dapps) to migrate from Ethereum to other application-specific chains for better performance,"" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. Examples include decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap, dYdX and Hyperliquid, the bank said. Uniswap's upcoming move to Unichain is important because it is one of Ethereum's ""largest gas consuming protocols,"" and its migration could result in a significant loss to the network's fee pool, the bank noted. JPMorgan said this trend of dapps moving to other layer 2s or alternative layer 1s could negatively impact Ethereum by lessening activity on the main network, which could result in lower transaction fees and validator revenue. Layers 2s are separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s , or the base layer, that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data. In terms of supply, this could make ether inflationary as ""fewer transactions imply reduced token burning,"" the authors wrote. The bank noted that Ethereum's growth is behind that of competitors such as Solana, which saw a surge in activity linked to memecoins. The Ethereum ecosystem still dominates the stablecoin , decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenization spaces in spite of these challenges, the bank said. The network could see increased institutional demand from tokenization enterprises but ""competition from other networks is likely to remain intense in the foreseeable future,"" the report added.

According to an analyst, the cryptocurrency’s recovery and ongoing retests of this crucial level could lead to a rebound in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility ‘Relatively Low’ Despite Market Shakeouts – Analysts Eye This Crucial Level Aptos Recovers From 6-Month Low Aptos has recovered 24% from the recent market correction, which sent Bitcoin to $91,000 and most cryptocurrencies to monthly lows. On Sunday, the token briefly nosedived 34% from its daily high above $7 to its lowest price since August 2024. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that APT has been moving within two horizontal levels since its launch. The higher horizontal level ranges from $15 to $17, while the lower zone ranges from around $4.80 to $5.45. During the pullback, Aptos “didn’t quite sweep the August lows” but “held on to that same ~$5 area again,” Daan pointed out. Similarly, Crypto Analyst Rekt Capital analyzed the cryptocurrency’s recent performance, explaining that “APT has now dropped into the Macro Wedge Bottom, holding support there while producing downside wicking below it.” APT’s Macro Wedge Bottom is also the “technical uptrend line dating to early 2023,” which is crucial to maintaining the technical uptrend and the macro market structure in general. Rekt Capital suggests that the cryptocurrency must print Weekly Closed above this line, at around $5.97. However, he noted that, in the monthly timeframe, APT appears to be in a Macro Range. The analyst explains that, in this Macro Range, APT seems to be developing a third cluster, but the price needs to hold the crucial $5.45 support zone to maintain this range and rebound. If the cryptocurrency holds continued stability above this level, it could reverse in the following months, as previous clusters saw “several after three monthly candles at the Range Low.” However, the price could see several retests before a rebound. He pointed out that the previous consolidations included a “downside wicking below support.” APT To Breakout In Three Months? If Aptos reverses, its price must break its 11-month downtrend. According to Rekt Capital’s analysis, a rejection from the downtrend line, followed by a drop to the Range Low, could “spell that the rebounds from the Macro Range Low are getting weaker, signaling weakening support there.” As a result, APT needs a strong rebound from this Macro Range Low “to go against the diminishing returns” that seem to be developing from this range. The 2023 rebound saw Aptos bounce 211% from the range lows before facing resistance near ATH levels, while 2024’s price rebound recorded a 145% jump before retracing from the $13 mark. Related Reading: Memecoins Crowned As ‘Defining Narrative Of 2024’, What’s The Next Key Sector To Watch? This suggests a potential diminishing in returns from the range low, signaling that Aptos must climb 95%, above the $11 resistance, to break out of the downtrend line. The analysis concluded that price stability at $5.45 is vital for the cryptocurrency’s rally, and a Monthly Close above this level is necessary for a future price rebound and retest of the downtrend. As of this writing, APT trades at $5.74, a 23% decrease in the weekly timeframe.

Currently, Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.7634 (down 0.5% in 24 hours), while Binance Coin (BNB) sits at $580.85 (up 1.63%). Both boast strong track records and substantial user bases. Yet a lesser-known contender, Remittix (RTX), has quietly raised over $11 million, sold 442 million tokens and trades at $0.0539. Below is a closer look at each coin’s growth potential and why analysts believe Remittix (RTX) might outshine even these established giants for the largest returns ahead. Cardano (ADA): A Methodical Approach Cardano, known for its meticulous, peer-reviewed development style, aims to deliver a secure, scalable, and eco-friendly blockchain solution. With a price of $0.7634, ADA has climbed slightly, reflecting cautious optimism. Critics, however, argue that Cardano’s slower rollout can hamper short-term price booms. While it excels at thorough, research-driven upgrades like the Alonzo era and smart contracts the pace might limit dramatic gains. Still, Cardano’s community remains loyal, envisioning a future where ADA powers everything from DeFi to enterprise solutions. If major partnerships or dApps choose Cardano over rival chains, the token’s price could jump. But in a market craving fast, tangible progress, Cardano’s methodical advancement may not yield the most explosive returns for 2023. Binance Coin (BNB): The Exchange Powerhouse At $580.85 and up 1.63% in a day, Binance Coin holds a key role in global crypto trading. BNB’s success owes much to the ecosystem of the Binance exchange lower fees for holders, staking rewards, and the expansive Binance Smart Chain (BSC). If Binance retains its influence despite regulatory challenges, BNB might continue climbing. Large-scale exchange volumes and ongoing token burns can buoy its value. Still, BNB’s higher price point can mean smaller percentage gains. While it remains a relatively safer bet for moderate returns, hitting a 5x or 10x jump within a year might be a stretch unless crypto market conditions turn overwhelmingly bullish. BNB’s fortunes ultimately correlate strongly with Binance’s marketplace dominance. Remittix(RTX): Tapping a Massive Everyday Market So why do many analysts say Remittix (RTX) offers the highest upside? While Cardano fine-tunes blockchain theory and BNB banks on exchange dominance, RTX tackles a universal issue: skyrocketing cross-border fees. Picture a digital designer in Argentina who frequently bills clients in Asia. Traditional banking siphons off a hefty slice of her earnings. RTX slashes that overhead by bridging crypto and fiat seamlessly. With over $11 million raised, 442 million tokens sold, and a price of $0.0539, Remittix (RTX) stands at the sweet spot for explosive growth. If enough freelancers, families and small businesses adopt it for remittances, demand may spike to levels overshadowing slower chains. A PayFi approach, one that instantly resonates with everyday people, could spark user expansion beyond what pure staking or exchange utility coins can achieve. Conclusion: Where the Biggest Gains Likely Lie Both Cardano and Binance Coin boast robust fundamentals and broad user support. Yet for sheer potential to multiply an investment, analysts increasingly point to Remittix (RTX). By offering a cost-saving solution to a global population tired of hefty wire fees, it can scale up rapidly, regardless of whether the market is purely bullish or not. While ADA and BNB remain formidable, RTX could well yield the largest returns among the three especially for those chasing a 5x or even 10x scenario in the near term. Ready to Explore Remittix (RTX)?

40032411,https://timestabloid.com/?p=56576,1738921178,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Breaking: Major Crypto Firms File for XRP ETFs,https://timestabloid.com/breaking-major-crypto-firms-file-for-xrp-etfs/,"In a landmark move for the cryptocurrency industry, leading asset managers WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have each filed for spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through the Cboe BZX Exchange. These filings follow recent XRP ETFs filled by CoinShares and Grayscale among others. The filings, reported by Cointelegraph , mark a significant step toward bringing XRP into the regulated financial ecosystem. Approval of the ETFs would grant institutional and retail investors direct access to XRP, obviating the need for direct asset custody. This regulated investment vehicle would offer enhanced security. The timing is significant, as crypto-based investment products enter the mainstream, following the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2024. Why Do XRP ETFs Matter? An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a regulated financial instrument that tracks the price of an asset and trades on traditional stock exchanges. A spot XRP ETF would hold actual XRP tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly purchasing, storing, or managing it. With XRP ETF, investors can trade XRP through familiar financial markets without using crypto exchanges. In addition, a spot ETF could attract significant institutional capital, stabilizing XRP’s price and reducing volatility. The introduction of regulated ETFs would strengthen XRP’s standing within traditional finance. These advantages make the potential approval of XRP ETFs a transformative moment for the asset and its broader adoption. Regulatory Hurdles: The SEC vs. Ripple Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which were approved with relative ease, XRP’s ETF approval process is complicated by its ongoing litigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) In December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple Labs, alleging that its sales of XRP constituted an unregistered securities offering. This lawsuit has been pivotal in defining crypto regulation in the U.S. In July 2023, a federal judge ruled that Ripple’s institutional sales violated securities laws but retail sales did not—a partial win for Ripple. However, the regulator has appealed this decision, leaving uncertainty around XRP’s full legal status. The SEC’s view on XRP as a security could influence whether these ETFs gain approval. Despite this legal uncertainty, the latest ETF filings signal strong confidence from institutional players in XRP’s long-term regulatory clarity. Is XRP ETF Next? The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 was a game-changer, opening the floodgates for Ethereum ETFs later that year. These milestones demonstrated that the SEC is increasingly open to crypto-based financial products, provided they meet strict regulatory requirements. With multiple firms now pushing for XRP ETFs, the question remains: Will XRP be next in line? Market Impact: How XRP ETFs Could Change the Game If approved, XRP ETFs could dramatically reshape the asset’s market dynamics. Large financial institutions and hedge funds could invest in XRP through ETFs, bringing billions of dollars into the ecosystem. Higher liquidity typically leads to more stable prices and reduced volatility. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Crypto ETFs historically drive up demand—Bitcoin surged over 50% in the months following ETF approval. If XRP ETFs follow suit, a major price rally could be on the horizon. A regulated investment vehicle would enhance the credibility of XRP among traditional investors, creating a foundation for future innovation in crypto-based financial instruments. However, regulatory uncertainty remains the biggest wildcard in this equation. A Defining Moment for XRP The filing of multiple XRP ETF applications is a watershed moment for Ripple. Approval of these ETFs could boost XRP’s prospects, establishing it as a legitimate mainstream financial asset, drawing in significant institutional investment, and potentially triggering a substantial price increase. However, the outcome of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC remains crucial in determining whether these ETFs will move forward. What’s Next? The SEC will review the applications and decide whether to approve, delay, or reject them. Legal clarity on XRP will be a key factor in determining the fate of these ETFs. The crypto industry will be closely watching for regulatory signals on broader adoption of digital assets. As the market awaits the SEC’s decision, one thing is clear: the demand for XRP ETFs is real, and institutional players are ready to bring them to Wall Street.

In a commentary to Livewire Markets, CEO and founder of the Nasdaq-listed tech company IREN Daniel Roberts said Bitcoin needs to reach at least a $900,000 price to reach gold in terms of market cap, and it will by 2030. Table of Contents Roberts’ prediction Bitcoin vs gold Roberts’ prediction Daniel Roberts is no stranger to cryptocurrency. His company, IREN, is an Aussie enterprise providing data centers using renewable energy for Bitcoin mining, powering AI, and other ventures. In November 2024, amidst a powerful crypto rally, Roberts famously said that Bitcoin is “dirt cheap.” Bitcoin is often dubbed a digital gold. Like a famous precious metal, it is scarce and is seen as a safe haven in turbulent economic conditions (the pandemic-era rise of crypto demonstrated it well). Read more: Cryptocurrencies Amid the Covid-19 Pandemic and the Global Market Roberts uses gold metrics to express his views on the future of the BTC value. He believes that Bitcoin, which is increasingly viewed as a safe haven asset similar to gold or even better than gold, its market cap should quickly get by the market cap of gold. Roberts is sure that it will happen by 2030. Given that the gold market cap is $19.3 trillion while the Bitcoin market cap is $1.95 trillion, Bitcoin needs a 10x price increase to reach parity. If the BTC price crosses the $1,000,000 mark, Bitcoin gets bigger than gold in terms of market capitalization. Roberts concludes that one million per unit by 2030 won’t be surprising for him. He cites ETF traction and high-profile purchases of Bitcoin by institutional investors as contributing factors to the speedy growth of the BTC price. It’s worth noting that by 2030, the gold market cap may gain substantial extra. In the last five years, the price of gold has grown by over 80%. Following the logic of Roberts, it may mean that by 2030, Bitcoin should gain even more than one million to reach gold parity or probably, the Bitcoin market cap will need more time to eclipse the one of gold. Roberts proceeds to explain: “The easiest way to conceptualize the value of bitcoin is to think about it as gold 2.0. We live in a world where digital and social networks have disrupted their physical equivalents. If you compare bitcoin and gold, it’s like digital versus analog, Blockbuster versus Netflix. Bitcoin’s better at being gold than gold is. It’s scarcer, easier to transfer, and easier to divide. So, all those characteristics that give gold value, bitcoin is objectively better at.” Bitcoin vs gold Roberts is far from being the first to paint Bitcoin as the “better gold.” Many other professionals and experts from the crypto community and the broader financial sector claim they prefer Bitcoin to gold, and the temporary divergence between rising gold and declining Bitcoin doesn’t change it. Following the start of the new stage of the U.S. trade war against China, investors flocked to assets they saw as a haven, and gold turned out to be one of the preferred assets. On Feb. 5, its price reached a new historical maximum at over $2.8 thousand per ounce, while Bitcoin was two days deep in a correction triggered by the same imposed tariffs. On Feb. 2, 2025, in an interview with Bloomberg, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood admitted that Bitcoin is a new asset class, a market leader, and a new global monetary system. https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/1885984185413689374?mx=2 Wood added that her mentor economist Art Laffer said back in 2015 that Bitcoin is what he has been waiting for since 1971 when the U.S. government closed the gold window. In 2023, Wood claimed that Bitcoin “hands down is better than gold” and called it a hedge against inflation and deflation. She said that the younger generation would prefer to hold Bitcoin rather than gold, as Bitcoin is a new asset not associated with institutions as much as gold. A television personality and a billionaire businessman Mark Cuban told Wired that Bitcoin is similar to gold as both are seen as a hedge against economic crises. He added that Bitcoin is a great store of value. “People look at bitcoin as a better version of gold, and I agree with that,” said Cuban. Last year, Jerome Powell, who has been a Fed chair since 2018, said that Bitcoin is a virtual gold, and it’s not a competitor of the American dollar but a competitor of gold. Other high-profile proponents of the idea that Bitcoin is better than gold (mostly for all the same reasons mentioned above) include Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , Pantera Capital founder Dan Morehead, Bitwise CIO Matthew Hougan , and others.

The SEC officially acknowledged the amended application for a spot Solana ETF by Grayscale on Feb 6. It is a huge development considering earlier filings of SOL ETFs had been rejected during the leadership of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Finance attorney Scott Johnsson, in a thread on X, said previous rejections were all because Solana products had been improperly classified as commodity trust shares. Back in January, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart claimed the issue was that the SEC’s Division of Enforcement had treated Solana as a security, making approval difficult under a commodities ETF framework. Timeline for a Solana ETF Remains Unclear The timeline for approval of a Solana ETF is now anyone’s guess, with analysts’ estimates all over the board. As far back as November, ETF Store President Nate Geraci speculated that approval might come before the end of next year, citing them growing engagement with issuers as a good omen. But Seyffart warned the process could spill into 2026, since the SEC takes 240 to 260 days on average to process this kind of filing. Surge in Crypto ETF Filings as Issuers Test SEC’s Stance This comes as crypto ETF filings have been piling up before them in the last couple of weeks. Major issuers including 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck and Canary Capital are vying for the approval of a spot Solana ETF. Cboe BZX Exchange refiled 19b-4 forms on behalf of the aforementioned issuers on Jan. 28. Beyond Solana, the SEC has acknowledged several other crypto ETF applications . Among them is Grayscale’s filing for a Litecoin (LTC) ETF, as well as BlackRock’s proposal to enable in-kind creations and redemptions for its iShares Bitcoin ETF. Additionally, Cboe BZX submitted forms for Canary Capital, WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Bitwise to list a spot Ripple (XRP) ETF. Bitwise has joined the lot with a spot Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF proposal, which shows the increasing interest of institutions into digital asset investments. The SEC’s acknowledgment of these filings does not necessarily mean that they will be approved, but rather is part of the evolving regulatory landscape around cryptocurrency ETFs.",Blockchain|ETF|SEC|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-02-07 09:43:15

Pepe & Bonk Set for Explosive Gains,https://thecoinrise.com/arctic-pablo-blazes-through-frostburg-1-million-raised-pepe-bonk-set-for-explosive-gains/,"Meme coins are once again taking the crypto world by storm. With investor sentiment shifting rapidly and new opportunities emerging every week, selecting the right meme coin can mean the difference between a moonshot and a dud. Recently, Arctic Pablo Coin has been making waves with its adventurous presale journey and deflationary model, while Pepe Coin and Bonk continue to capture market attention through strong community backing and high trading volumes. Arctic Pablo Coin is revolutionizing the meme coin space by blending myth and reality in an epic investment journey. Unlike traditional meme coins, Arctic Pablo Coin ties its presale to unique locations, allowing investors to participate in a one-of-a-kind experience while securing high ROI potential. Meanwhile, Pepe Coin has been on a rollercoaster ride, seeing fluctuations but holding strong due to its dedicated fanbase. On the other hand, Bonk, a Solana-based token, has capitalized on community-driven initiatives and continues to grow in prominence. Arctic Pablo Coin, Pepe Coin, and Bonk are among the top meme coins to invest in this week . Here’s why they stand out. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Adventure-Fueled Meme Coin In the icy depths of the unexplored world, Arctic Pablo, an intrepid explorer, embarks on a thrilling journey across mythical lands, uncovering lost treasures in the form of $APC coins. These are no ordinary digital assets; each Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is imbued with the magic of the forgotten world, bridging the realms of myth and reality. Currently, Arctic Pablo has reached Frostburg, the ninth phase of its expedition, after successfully uncovering treasures in Shangri-La and eight other mythical locations. As he ventures forward, more investors are joining him, eager to secure their share of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The current price is $0.000054 per APC, with over $1 Million already raised. The anticipated launch price is $0.008, offering an ROI potential exceeding 14,725.93%. If an investor buys in at Frostburg with $500, they would receive 9,268,515 APCs, which at the launch price would be valued at $74,148.12. This astronomical growth potential has generated a frenzy around Arctic Pablo Coin, making it one of the top meme coins to invest in this week. The deflationary mechanism also plays a crucial role in increasing scarcity. Every unsold APC token is burned weekly during the presale, ensuring a limited supply and a potential increase in price post-launch. Additionally, APC transactions are recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering transparency and security. The 66% APY staking program is another lucrative avenue for those looking to stake their APC tokens. Investors hold their coins and earn substantial passive income while participating in Arctic Pablo’s legendary journey. Pepe Coin: The Resilient Meme Giant Pepe Coin ($PEPE) has solidified its position as one of the most recognized meme coins in the industry. Despite the recent downturn in price, it continues to be a dominant force in the market, attracting both retail and institutional investors. The current price of Pepe Coin stands at $0.000010 USD, with a 24-hour trading volume of $694,561,884. Its market cap has reached $4.21 billion, with a circulating supply of 420,689,899,999,995 PEPE. Ranked #29 on CoinMarketCap, PEPE saw a recent decline of 1.02%, primarily due to large-scale sell-offs by whales. However, on-chain data suggests that PEPE could be poised for a comeback. Analysts point to a strong Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, indicating that previous downturns have often been followed by substantial gains between 51% and 72%. A key factor behind PEPE’s resilience is its dedicated community. The coin has seen widespread adoption across exchanges and remains a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts. With speculation mounting over a potential rebound, PEPE remains one of the top meme coins to invest in this week. Bonk: The Solana-Based Powerhouse Bonk ($BONK) has taken the Solana ecosystem by storm, becoming one of the most actively traded meme coins. What sets Bonk apart is its community-driven model and strategic token burns, which have contributed to its meteoric rise. The current price of Bonk is $0.00002579, with a 24-hour trading volume of $317.9 million. Its circulating supply stands at 77 trillion BONK, with a market cap of $2.5 billion. Bonk recently surpassed all other Solana-based meme coins, reclaiming its position as the leading Solana meme token. A major catalyst for this surge was the BURNmas event, where BonkDAO burned 1.69 trillion BONK tokens, effectively reducing supply and increasing scarcity. Further fueling its growth is its listing on a major U.S. exchange, making it more accessible to North American investors. With an RSI of 44, Bonk is currently in neutral territory, but many traders see this as a buying opportunity before the next major rally. According to crypto analyst Jack.poor, BONK could hit $0.11 by 2025, representing a massive upside for investors buying at today’s prices. Its strong community backing, exchange listings, and token burns make it one of the top meme coins to invest in this week. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, Pepe Coin, and Bonk offer investors some of the most exciting opportunities in the meme coin sector this week. Arctic Pablo Coin stands out with its immersive storytelling, high ROI potential, and deflationary model. Pepe Coin remains a staple in the meme coin market, with strong community support and indicators pointing to a potential rebound. Meanwhile, Bonk’s dominance in the Solana ecosystem and strategic burns and exchange listings make it a compelling investment choice. With meme coins gaining momentum, investors should act fast to secure their positions before the next big surge.

In a press release shared with crypto.news, ByBit said it is now registered with the FIU and compliant with and compliant with India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act. “We have been working diligently with the FIU-IND to address their concerns,” the firm wrote, adding, “We recognize the importance of robust Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism measures and are dedicated to upholding the highest standards in these areas.” As part of the registration process, the Dubai-headquartered firm has settled an inr 9.27 crore fine (roughly $1.06 million) imposed by the Indian Ministry of Finance. The penalty was issued after regulators flagged Bybit for operating in India without securing the necessary FIU registration. According to a Jan. 31 notice from the ministry, ByBit’s “persistent and continuous non-compliance” prompted the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to block its website under the Information Technology Act of 2000. India has made it mandatory for all crypto exchanges, including offshore platforms, to register with the FIU and comply with the PMLA since March 2023. Exchanges must follow strict reporting and record-keeping obligations under the law, and non-compliant entities are subject to enforcement actions.

Last year, Binance settled a fine of approximately inr 18.82 crores ($2.25 million), while KuCoin paid around inr 34.5 lahks ($41,000) before resuming operations. ByBit is also pursuing a Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider license, having submitted its application on June 26, 2024, as part of its broader efforts to align with Indian regulations. Beyond compliance efforts, ByBit is actively engaging with the local blockchain advocacy group, the Bharat Web3 Association, to promote Web3 adoption in the country. It has also launched educational initiatives through partnerships with the blockchain societies of premiere universities like IIT Delhi and IIT Kharagpur, the release added.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) miners in Russia aren’t thrilled about a new government registry that’s scooping up sensitive data, including crypto wallet addresses, under new rules. If leaked, it could be a “big gift to our geopolitical opponents,” warned Anton Gorelkin, a Russian lawmaker overseeing information policy. The crypto miner registry in Russia has been up and running since November 2024. National’s registry is available through the service on Russia’s Federal Tax Service. Daniil Yegorov, head of the tax agency, mentioned earlier that about 150 miners submitted registration requests in the first three weeks of the registry’s operation. In a Telegram post on Feb. 7, Gorelkin said Russian crypto miners are now worried about the registry, fearing a data leak could expose sensitive information and lead to sanctions. The tax agency reassured him that the data is stored in a “separate internal protected system,” with Gorelkin noting that not everyone even within the agency itself has access to it and that external access is “practically impossible.” “And although cybersecurity experts like to repeat the mantra “everything that can leak, will eventually leak,” the Federal Tax Service claims that the risk of sensitive information leaking from its internal systems is now reduced to zero.” Anton Gorelkin In 2024, Roskomnadzor, Russia’s communications watchdog responsible for banning YouTube, Discord, and Viber, among hundreds of others VPN services, recorded 135 data leaks, with over 710 million records of Russians leaking online.

Before the changes, companies could only be fined up to 100,000 rubles (around $1,000), but after the update, the maximum fine skyrocketed 150-fold to 15 million rubles (around $150,000). Russia’s crypto mining sector isn’t directly under international sanctions, but some companies have still been caught in the crossfire. In April 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned BitRiver AG, a Swiss-based holding company with operations in Russia, which was the first time a crypto mining company was targeted. Fast forward to March 2024, and OFAC hit 13 Russian entities, including fintech firms like B-Crypto, Masterchain, Laitkhaus, and Atomaiz, for helping to evade sanctions through crypto services.

Analysts Explain!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-next-for-bitcoin-and-altcoins-when-will-the-altcoin-rally-begin-will-there-be-more-delays-analysts-explain/,"Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) continue to face strong selling pressure. While investors focus on when the decline will end, analysis platform 10X Research shared its current expectations. Stating that at this point, Bitcoin is following a “Diamond Top” pattern, which generally signals that prices may fall after a period of growth, 10X Research said that this pattern indicates that BTC could fall further and lose some of its gains since its rally in November. Noting that altcoins also experienced a major decline, but Ethereum took the biggest hit, analysts said that despite Eric Trump’s support for ETH, the sharp decline was mainly due to complex trading strategies such as option gamma hedging and futures liquidations, which can cause large price swings. Analysts stated that Bitcoin recovered after the sharp declines, but Ethereum could not, and said: “Bitcoin staged a partial recovery, but Ethereum did not. Interestingly, unlike Bitcoin, the large Ethereum sell-offs did not lead to strong recoveries, suggesting that the ETH price may still be under pressure.” Analysts have recently warned that Bitcoin and altcoins could experience further price declines in the short term, given the combination of weak technical signals and ongoing economic uncertainty. For now, analysts recommend that investors follow a wait-and-watch strategy, where they remain cautious and look for signs of a possible reversal. When Will the Altcoin Rally Begin? While 10X Research analysts predict that Bitcoin and altcoins may experience further declines in the short term, a similar analysis came from popular analyst Rekt Capital. Rekt Capital has highlighted the fundamental trends in Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), arguing that the altcoin rally will begin after the 71% peak of Bitcoin dominance is reached. At this point, the analyst pointed out that historically, Bitcoin Dominance has reached the 71% resistance level every time it has entered the 58-71% macro range. The analyst also added that during this period when Bitcoin dominance increases, a strong 5-10% pullback in altcoins is possible. “If history repeats itself, the real Alt season that everyone is waiting for will begin when Bitcoin Dominance is rejected from 71%.” *This is not investment advice.

MARA Holdings (MARA) mined 750 BTC in January , representing a 13% decline from December. Similarly, Cleanspark (CLSK) saw a 6% decrease, mining 626 BTC.

""In January, our production saw a 12% month-over-month decline in blocks won, largely due to fluctuations in network difficulty and intermittent curtailment,"" said Fred Thiel, MARA's chairman and CEO.

He emphasized that XRP, as an ISO 20022-compliant asset , enables faster and more secure cross-border transactions, positioning it as a key bridge currency for the future. MASSIVE NEWS! RIPPLE IS NOW INTEGRATED INTO SWIFT! WITH EASTNETS’ PAYMENTSAFE, XRP MOVES SEAMLESSLY ACROSS SWIFT’S NETWORK AS AN ISO 20022-COMPLIANT ASSET, ENABLING FASTER, SECURE CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS. XRP IS THE BRIDGE CURRENCY OF THE FUTURE! #XRP #RIPPLE … pic.twitter.com/TbewF96Q1N — Alessio Meloni (@Panzbaby777) February 5, 2025 This development highlights Ripple’s expanding role in the financial sector, further integrating digital assets into traditional banking systems. Using XRP within SWIFT aligns with ongoing efforts to modernize international payments by improving speed, efficiency, and transparency. PaymentSafe’s Role in Financial Messaging EastNets’ PaymentSafe functions as a payment hub between multiple payment networks, including domestic and international systems, along with SWIFT. A key feature of this platform is its universal translator, which facilitates the conversion between different payment formats, including traditional MT messages and the ISO 20022 standard. A video accompanying Meloni’s tweet explained that PaymentSafe is designed to enhance straight-through processing (STP) across different payment networks. The universal translator ensures that legacy and modern financial messaging standards can interact efficiently, reducing delays and improving compatibility between institutions. The system supports formats like the widely used MT standard as well as ISO 20022, including CBPR+, cross-border payments, and reporting standards. This integration simplifies the transition to ISO 20022, which is being adopted globally to enhance the quality of financial data exchanged between banks and financial service providers. Implications for Cross-Border Transactions The adoption of ISO 20022 is a significant step toward improved interoperability in the financial industry. SWIFT has been working to harmonize instant payments and enhance global payment systems, reinforcing the need for a standardized messaging format. This transition ensures that financial institutions can exchange richer data, improving transaction accuracy and efficiency. Ripple’s compliance with ISO 20022 further strengthens XRP’s position as a bridge currency in international finance. The integration with SWIFT via PaymentSafe allows for a seamless and cost-effective solution to common challenges in cross-border payments, such as high fees and slow processing times. As financial institutions continue to upgrade their infrastructure, the collaboration between Ripple and EastNets represents an important step in the modernization of global payments. This integration demonstrates how blockchain-based assets like XRP can work alongside existing financial networks, offering a more streamlined approach to international transactions.

While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2. Exclusive Availability Unlike UNI and DOT, which are available on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity gives early adopters an edge and keeps the token’s growth stable and controlled. 3. Unparalleled Growth Potential Analysts project that THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN could deliver returns of up to 2,000%, thanks to its early-stage momentum and community-driven development. While Bitcoin and Polkadot are well-established, they can’t match the rapid trajectory of this groundbreaking token. 4. Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here. Bitcoin (BTC): A store of value, yet its market maturity limits growth opportunities compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Litecoin (LTC): Known for efficiency, but it hasn’t captured the market excitement that this new token has.

A successful regulatory approval will create history by giving professional investors direct control of XRP ETFs while reducing their need to manage self-custody and on-chain requirements. Ripple finds itself at a critical point as it continues fighting legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Having scheduled the next hearing in April, Ripple achieved a court victory time, but regulatory uncertainty persists in burdening the XRP price. SEC’s Reluctance: Will Ripple Finally Get Its XRP ETF? Since the beginning of its legal battle with regulators, the SEC has declared Ripple as a security. However, since the change in the SEC’s management, many analysts believe that now is a more favorable time for the XRP ETF. After the SEC’s recent appeal of the Ripple case, regulators have expressed more acceptance of the Spot XRP ETF to gain approval. The favorable legal rulings Ripple obtained from its case have given Grayscale a reason to be optimistic. A green light from the SEC will trigger an institutional cash flow towards XRP that will boost its market value. The XRP price will be increasingly more competitive against Bitcoin and Ethereum in institutional sectors because of the regulated legal access. How ETF Approval Could Impact XRP Price The approval of an XRP ETF by the SEC would bring fresh market liquidity because institutional investors and retail investors would obtain a regulated product to buy into Ripple. ETF approval events have consistently produced strong market transformations that propelled Bitcoin prices higher after its spot listing approval. XRP’s price is likely to fluctuate beyond the $3.50 to $4.00 range in the short-term period while extending its long-term price above $5 when institutional investors increase their demand. Currently, Ripple changes hands at $2.40, noting a 6% decrease on the daily charts. An unsuccessful SEC application may cause XRP to remain stuck in its present trading boundaries. However, market analysts are optimistic for Ripple, with some saying that the XRP ETF approval has an over 90% likelihood. DTX Exchange: The New Disruptor in Crypto Trading DTX Exchange (DTX) quietly establishes itself as a market revolution while XRP remains at the forefront of regulatory debate. DTX is a next-generation trading system that integrates features from TradFi and DeFi to establish a Layer-1 blockchain network that unifies the management of traditional assets with crypto assets. It’s an exchange solution which integrates the best features of centralized and decentralized platforms with deep asset liquidity and strong encryption and easy access for users. DTX Exchange stands apart from regular exchanges by allowing users to trade over 120,000 asset classes including stocks, forex, ETFs and commodities through its VulcanX hybrid blockchain system. The Massive Growth Potential of DTX Exchange The presale phase of DTX Exchange has successfully secured more than $13.5 million in record time. According to analysts, DTX tokens have the potential to rally 75x when the platform is live. Currently in presale, DTX tokens are available at a discounted $0.16 price. DTX Exchange has announced a listing price of $0.20, providing early backers with a 20% ROI once the DTX tokens gets listed on tier-1 exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Bybit. DTX stands as a strong investment option due to its hybrid blockchain technology and expanding investor network. The platform is running a limited time presale offer, where new users get a 50% bonus on their deposits if they use the promo code STAGE8 !

If approved, the Franklin Crypto Index ETF will provide exposure to the spot prices of Bitcoin and Ether in a single investment vehicle on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Balanced Exposure to Bitcoin and Ether Prices According to the February 6 filing, the ETF will allocate holdings based on the market capitalization of the two largest cryptocurrencies. As of the filing date, Bitcoin accounted for 86.31% of the weighting, while Ether made up 13.69%. The fund will be rebalanced quarterly in March, June, September, and December to maintain these proportions. The filing also hinted at potential future expansions, noting that additional digital assets could be considered for inclusion if both the ETF and the Cboe BZX Exchange obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. However, Franklin Templeton acknowledged uncertainties, stating there is “no assurance” that any cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ether will be approved. Growing Competition in Crypto ETFs Franklin Templeton’s application joins a surge of similar filings in the wake of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, which ushered in changes at the SEC, including the resignation of former Chair Gary Gensler. The current acting SEC Chair, Mark Uyeda is more favorable toward cryptocurrency initiatives . Uyeda recently appointed a policy director from Coin Center, a crypto advocacy group, to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. Just days before Franklin Templeton’s filing, Bitwise sought approval for a comparable product, the “Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF.” Meanwhile, the Cboe BZX Exchange filed applications on behalf of four asset managers, including WisdomTree and 21Shares, to launch spot XRP ETFs. Despite rising investor interest, Franklin Templeton’s filing cautioned about risks, including competition from emerging tokens such as Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Cardano (ADA). ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that regulatory hurdles could delay the approval of ETFs tied to newer assets like Solana until at least 2026. As regulatory clarity continues to evolve, Franklin Templeton’s move reflects a growing demand for diverse and accessible crypto investment products.

Almost all traders now prefer finding undervalued projects that present solid fundamentals and expansion opportunities. IntelMarkets (INTL) brings AI and DeFi together to deliver a completely new trading experience which positions it as a leading disruptor in the market. IntelMarkets (INTL): The AI Crypto That Could Leave Meme Coins Behind IntelMarkets (INTL) positions itself as a trading platform that brings artificial intelligence into all trading components to transform the $36 billion crypto trading industry. INTL represents more than a new altcoin since it introduces fundamental trading system improvements. The platform employs AI trading robots that process enormous real-time market data for traders to execute precise high-frequency trades. The AI system learns independently from market conditions which allows it to perform profitable trading operations using the AI insights from the Intell-M algorithms. The dual-chain system of IntelMarkets allows operations between Ethereum and Solana blockchains. This infrastructure provides highest operational efficiency and full DeFi compatibility between Ethereum and Solana networks. The INTL token begins its public listing at $0.11 and is currently available in presale at $0.08 apiece. Analysts claim that if IntelMarkets reaches a $1 billion market cap, INTL tokens will rally over 50x. Investor confidence in IntelMarkets is high, indicated by more than $8.1 M in initial presale fundraising. The growing popularity of AI in crypto makes INTL an appealing long-term investment as it’s ready to emerge as a major market leader. BONK: The Solana-Powered Meme Sensation In late 2022 BONK emerged as the first “Dog themed” meme coin which operates on the Solana blockchain and became highly popular. BONK had one of the biggest market rallies, increasing 60,000% to an all-time high of $0.000059 in November of 2024. However, market sentiment has caused the token to fall over 70% to its current price of $0.000018. 50% of that decrease came in the month of January, even as the Solana ecosystem was booming. Rumors of a BONK ETF have emerged, alongside a DOGE and Trump Coin ETF. This speculation could lead to an increase in BONK’s price, should regulators approve of the ETFs. PEPE: The Internet Meme Turned Crypto Powerhouse The crypto community shows significant interest in PEPE and many sister memecoins. The viral popularity of the “PEPE the Frog” internet meme provided the inspiration for a digital crypto. Similar to BONK, PEPE exploded in Q4 2024, rallying to an ATH price of $0.000028. Nevertheless, PEPE fell a drastic 60% to $0.000010, losing half of its value in the past 30 days. However, PEPE-themed meme coins are starting to emerge, which result in an increase in price. Many analysts have shared that PEPE is currently oversold, and according to a technical analysis by TradeView, the short-term moving averages indicate a buy for the memecoin. Conclusion: Which Crypto Has the Best Shot at 50x? The price potential of BONK and PEPE is overshadowed by a new AI crypto. IntelMarkets (INTL) provides state-of-the-art technology with robust fundamentals alongside increasing demand for its AI-enabled trading solutions. With an affordable entry cost and no low-market cap, the INTL tokens have a shot at rallying 50x before Q3 starts.

It has just launched its own Layer-1 blockchain, grabbing the interest of investors and experts. Many experts believe that a major exchange listing could send its price soaring. Some analysts even predict a massive 15,000% rise. But could DTX Exchange really beat XRP price and change the future of blockchain? Let’s understand. XRP Price Amidst Market Struggles: Will Ripple Ever Recover? XRP price is going through an uncertain phase, despite being an old and favorite cryptocurrency among investors. As of 6th February, XRP price stands at around $2.4. In the past week, the XRP price fell down by almost 20%. However, Ripple showed some strength by displaying a growth rate of about 390% within the last 90 days. Its current price hovers between $2.3-$2.4, which could indicate its strength as well as volatility. Moreover, Ripple vs SEC case is another drawback that XRP price has to face. The SEC case affected Ripple market performance in different ways, but a change of SEC head to crypto-friendly David Sacks could be a chance for Ripple to see some stability again. There’s also growing excitement about a possible XRP ETF and Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD. These developments could give XRP the boost it needs to bounce back. Some analysts believe that should these factors align favorably, XRP could target a price of $4 or even reach $10 in 2025. However, the broader crypto market is bearish at the moment, and such volatility is pushing investors towards new platforms such as DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange Presenting Layer-1 Blockchain: A Threat to XRP Price Supremacy? While Ripple struggles, DTX Exchange , with a Layer-1 blockchain, has entered the crypto scene, positioning itself as an attractive competitor. Unlike XRP, which is part of Ripple’s ecosystem, this new altcoin runs on its own blockchain. This could mean better decentralization, security, and scalability. Its focus on DeFi, gaming, and institutional finance has sparked excitement, with experts comparing it to early blockchain leaders. Layer-1 blockchains are powerful because they support DApps and smart contracts without needing extra tools. This makes transactions faster and cheaper, and this feature makes them highly attractive to developers and enterprises alike. With solid tokenomics and a growing ecosystem, DTX Exchange is rapidly gaining traction. This leads many experts to speculate that it could overtake XRP’s market position. A Major Listing for DTX Exchange: Could It Trigger 15,000% Rally? The speculation about DTX Exchange is being further fuelled by its potential for a major exchange listing. Analysts argue that if this Layer-1 blockchain secures a spot on leading platforms such as Binance or Coinbase, it could experience an explosive price surge. In the past, new blockchain projects have seen massive growth after big exchange listings, and this altcoin seems to be following the same path. Some predictions say its price could jump by 15,000%, which could make it one of the most exciting crypto platforms to watch this year. Conclusion As XRP price battles regulations and works to stay strong in the market, new Layer-1 blockchains are making their mark. With the crypto world constantly evolving, competition is heating up between well-known networks and fresh blockchain projects. Will XRP reclaim its top spot, or will DTX Exchange take over? With the layer-1 blockchain launch, DTX Exchange could prove to be a major player. For investors and traders looking for the next big opportunity in 2025, DTX could be the altcoin to watch.

Having raised $193 million and sold over 18.2 billion BDAG coins, early participants have seen gains of 2,380%. The next phase is even more promising. BlockDAG has announced listings on 10 major exchanges. This could be a significant catalyst for its price. Cryptocurrencies often experience their most substantial price increases after exchange listings. Millions of new traders gain access, driving demand. With BDAG still in its final presale phase, those who participate now are positioning themselves ahead of a large market entry of one of the biggest crypto gems today. Exchange listings bring exposure, liquidity, and price momentum. History indicates that projects with strong presales often experience significant growth once trading begins. The window to secure BDAG at its current presale price is closing quickly. BlockDAG’s Presale Performance Highlights Its Huge Growth Potential BlockDAG’s presale has been remarkably strong, surpassing initial expectations. When the presale began, BDAG was priced at $0.001 per coin. As interest grew, the price increased through multiple batches, reaching $0.0248. This 2,380% increase has already placed early buyers in a favourable position. The numbers speak for themselves. Raising $193 million and selling 18.2 billion coins demonstrates the confidence buyers have in the project. Unlike many presales that struggle to gain traction, BlockDAG has consistently sold out batches. This proves strong market demand. These gains occurred before BDAG had even been listed on exchanges, showing why it is a crypto gem. The next significant move is about to happen. How Exchange Listings Could Transform BDAG’s Future When a cryptocurrency becomes available on major exchanges, the entire dynamic changes. BlockDAG’s upcoming 10 exchange listings will make BDAG accessible to a much larger audience. Millions of traders will be able to buy and sell the asset. This level of exposure is essential. It introduces BDAG to people who couldn’t participate in the presale and significantly increases daily trading activity. Crypto gems with successful presales have often seen substantial price increases after exchange listings. Listings create an influx of new buyers. Demand often exceeds available supply in the early stages of trading. The primary advantage goes to those who already hold BDAG before this occurs. Early buyers won’t have to chase the price. They will be positioned to benefit from the anticipated surge in demand. Driving Demand—How Exchange Listings Could Spark a BDAG Buying Surge Cryptocurrency trading is driven by momentum. Exchange listings fuel this momentum. When news of a new listing spreads, it attracts attention from individual traders, social media personalities, and automated trading systems. This often results in a rapid increase in buying, leading to higher prices. Many exchanges also run promotions for newly listed cryptocurrencies. They may offer incentives like trading competitions and reduced fees, which further stimulate demand. The combination of increased visibility and market accessibility leads to price action that benefits those who got in early. The presale offers a final opportunity to acquire BDAG at a fixed price before listings introduce price fluctuations driven by market demand. More Than Listings—Why BDAG’s Growth Is Set to Continue While exchange listings are a significant milestone, they represent just one part of BlockDAG’s long-term vision. Unlike projects driven solely by hype, BlockDAG offers real technology. Its DAG-based blockchain is designed for speed and scalability. This makes it more efficient than traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Another key benefit is the cryptocurrency mining app. This app allows users to earn BDAG directly from their smartphones. The X1 Miner App is already gaining users, expanding the network even before BDAG goes live on exchanges. These fundamental aspects give BDAG lasting utility that extends beyond the initial launch excitement, cementing its position as a crypto gem today. As adoption increases, so does the potential for further price appreciation. Over 15,800 miners have been sold, generating over $6.4 million in sales. The Bottom Line: Grab Today’s Crypto Gem! BlockDAG’s presale has already delivered 2,380% gains. The next phase could be even more significant. With 10 exchange listings confirmed, BDAG is about to become available to millions of traders who could not participate in the presale. This level of exposure often leads to rapid price increases as demand surpasses what the presale offers. Currently, BDAG is still available at fixed presale prices. This opportunity won’t last much longer. Once the coin goes live on exchanges, pricing will be determined by the market. History shows that cryptocurrencies with high-profile launches often move quickly. The ideal time to secure BDAG before the next price jump is now. Once trading begins, the real FOMO begins. BlockDAG has sold over 18.2 billion coins, and the total amount raised has surpassed $193 million. BlockDAG is currently in batch 27 and priced at $0.0248, reflecting a 2,380% surge.

As the first-ever ICO launched directly on the social messaging app, Dogizen’s presale is catering directly to the app’s billion-user community hungry for new projects to sink their teeth into. And as evidenced by the staggering $3.8m that its presale has raised, Dogizen is on the verge of a massive breakout year. Plus dog coins are having a moment right now, with Dogecoin ETFs in the works and a government department named after a dog coin, Dogizen has all the tailwinds it needs to beat frogs like Pepe. The smart money is locking in early positions in the Dogizen ICO before it ends, tomorrow, 7th February. Telegram GameFi ready to break out in 2025 Telegram GameFi first demonstrated its breakout potential in 2024 after early leaders like Hamster Kombat and Notcoin smashed player number records and surged to over $2.5 billion in capitalization, respectively—and the rest of the industry’s big names earned Binance listings as each mooned to all-time highs. One of the major catalysts propelling the Telegram GameFi narrative is the fact that 50% of Telegram gamers have never held crypto. That means the sector has the inside track in inducting new Web3 users like no other fad has ever done before. If Telegram gaming can onboard just a fraction of the app’s near 1 billion users, it could send Dogizen on a parabolic run. The Dogizen ICO: The final Ace in the hole Old dogs can’t learn new tricks—but this young gun can. Dogizen is iterating on everything its predecessors have done, but only better. And the ace in the hole is its groundbreaking ICO. It’s the first-ever ICO held on Telegram, and you know how pivotal the status of being the first mover is in the crypto world. Dogizen’s predecessors all held airdrops. In principle, the airdrop mechanism worked well to get as many tokens to as many holders as possible. However, since few holders lacked any incentive to hold, prices tanked as soon as holders could dispose of their tokens. Not Dogizen. By virtue of its ICO launch, Dogizen has been building a strong community for its token from the ground up. A community that’ll be keen to hold since they’ve actually invested in DOGIZ. As opposed to having tokens landing in their wallets for free. When that levee breaks, DOGIZ should skyrocket. With a provisional market cap set at below $10 million pre-launch, Dogizen has all the legroom it needs to go on a parabolic run. 30x is modest considering how well other Telegram gaming names did—and if it hits a billion like say, Notcoin price did, a 100x is well within the realm of possibility this year. Dogizen presale ends imminently The ICO’s wrapping up on 7th February, with an exchange listing to follow. That means you’ve got a limited window to jump in, and it’s likely investors are about to be tripping over each other to get themselves a piece of the pie. Dogizen is available at just $0.000085. But with the presale set to end imminently, now’s your last chance to get in at a favorable entry before the rocket takes off. Are you in?

As tax season rolls around, crypto investors in the U.S. need to be aware of their tax obligations. Kraken’s U.S. crypto tax guide 2025 has all the information you need to stay compliant as you file your 2024 tax year taxes. What you’ll find in Kraken’s U.S. crypto tax guide 2025 To help you navigate the complexities of crypto taxation, Kraken has put together a comprehensive guide covering the key topics you need to understand before filing your taxes: 1. How the IRS classifies crypto As far as the IRS is concerned, crypto isn’t cash — it’s property. That means buying, selling and even spending digital assets could result in taxable events. The guide breaks down the difference between taxable and non-taxable transactions so you know what to report. 2. Capital gains vs. Income tax on crypto Whether your crypto is subject to capital gains tax or ordinary income tax depends on how you acquired it. The guide explains how different activities — such as trading, mining, or earning staking rewards — are taxed. 3. Tracking and reporting crypto transactions Keeping accurate records is essential for calculating your tax liability. The guide provides insights into: How to determine your cost basis (the original price of your crypto) What happens when you sell, trade or gift crypto The tax implications of moving crypto between wallets and exchanges 4. Common tax mistakes to avoid Many crypto investors make avoidable mistakes, such as misreporting transactions or overlooking taxable events. Our guide highlights these pitfalls and offers tips to ensure you file correctly. 5. Tax reporting tools and strategies The guide also explores crypto tax software and other tools that can help automate calculations, generate reports, and make filing your taxes easier. Why this matters The IRS treats cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin , Ethereum and even NFTs as property , which means that many transactions – whether you’re trading, staking or receiving an airdrop – can have tax consequences. Failing to report these transactions correctly can lead to substantial penalties, so understanding how crypto is taxed is more important than ever. With tax laws evolving, our U.S. crypto tax guide 2025 can help you understand your obligations, stay on the right side of U.S. crypto tax law and potentially minimize your tax burden.

Though in distinct ways, they both introduce new currency. Investors and users can manage changes in blockchain networks more easily if they understand these ideas. What Is a Hard Fork? A hard fork occurs when a blockchain splits into two distinct networks. It happens as a result of modifications to the blockchain’s code that render the previous version incompatible. Developers, network users, or the community may suggest modifications to improve functionality, security, or speed. The network can break up if the community is not entirely in agreement. The fork allows both cryptocurrencies to share the same blockchain history up until the block where the fork occurred; thereafter, each independent blockchain continues on its own. Reasons for Hard Forks: Fix security vulnerabilities. Improve transaction speed or efficiency. Add new features to the network. Resolve disagreements within the community. One famous example is Bitcoin Cash. It split from Bitcoin in 2017 because some developers wanted larger block sizes for faster transactions. Another well-known hard fork is Ethereum Classic, which split from Ethereum after a major hack in 2016. What Is an Airdrop? Airdrop means free distribution of new cryptocurrency into the wallets of users. Developers do this to promote their project and gain new users. Airdrops can happen for many reasons, such as marketing campaigns or rewarding loyal users. Unlike hard forks, airdrops do not require a blockchain split. Instead, developers send new tokens to existing wallet holders. Sometimes, users must complete tasks like signing up for a newsletter or following a social media account to receive the tokens. Reasons for Airdrops: Promote a new project. Reward loyal users. Increase awareness and adoption. Encourage trading and market activity. Some well-known airdrops that gained value include UniSwap (UNI), dYdX, Arbitrum (ARB), and ApeCoin (APE). However, many airdrops end up worthless because they fail to gain interest or utility. Key Differences Between Hard Forks and Airdrops Feature Hard Fork Airdrop Blockchain Split Yes No Requires User Action Sometimes Often (to claim tokens) Purpose Improve or change a blockchain Promote a new project Coin Distribution Users get new coins from the fork Users receive free tokens Example Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic UniSwap, Arbitrum , ApeCoin Are Airdrops Worth It? Many airdrops end up worthless. When people get free tokens, they often sell them immediately, causing prices to drop. However, some airdrops become valuable if the project succeeds. If an airdrop token gains utility and demand, it may increase in value over time. Can You Make Money from Airdrops? It is possible, but not guaranteed. Some airdrops, like UniSwap’s UNI token, gained significant value. Others became worthless because they failed to attract enough users or investors. Researching projects before participating in an airdrop is essential. Are Hard Forks Good or Bad? Hard forks can be both positive and negative. Changes might strengthen a blockchain if the improvements are observed and supported by the community, while on other occasions, a fork can just lead to more confusion and fragmented user bases. Success in this respect is about adoption and, ultimately, market demand. Hard forks and airdrops both introduce new cryptocurrencies but in different ways. Hard forks result from blockchain changes, while airdrops are marketing tools to distribute new tokens. Understanding these concepts can help crypto investors make better decisions. Investing always requires research, be it new coins coming from a hard fork or an airdrop, since not all projects end in success but just disappear in a puff of smoke.

Now, we’re seeing the rise of programmable money, which is changing the way transactions are made. This new type of money uses smart contracts to automatically process payments when certain conditions are met. Unlike traditional money, which needs human involvement to make transactions, programmable money moves on its own according to rules written in code. That will all be enabled through blockchain. Smart contracts make the processes faster, more secure, and more transparent. That is already one revolution slowly dawning on such industries as finance, supply chain, and electronic commerce. By understanding how programmable money works and its various benefits, this can help individual and business smart financial decisions. What Is Programmable Money? Smart contracts are self-executing agreements resident on a blockchain. No middlemen, such as banks or payment processors, are required. A good example is whereby a company hires a freelancer, and upon the work being done and verified, a smart contract can automatically release the payment. This automates and reduces delays in adding fairness to both parties. Unlike the traditional banking systems that take days to effect transactions, programmable money enables instant and trustless transactions. How Smart Contracts Work in Payments Smart contracts are built using blockchain networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano . These contracts contain rules that trigger actions when conditions are met. Here’s how they work in payments: Agreement Setup – Two or more parties define payment terms in a smart contract. Verification – The contract checks whether the conditions are met, such as product delivery or service completion. Execution – Once the criteria are fulfilled, the smart contract releases the payment automatically. Record Keeping – Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. By removing manual processes, smart contracts improve efficiency and reduce costs associated with third-party involvement. Benefits of Programmable Money Programmable money offers several advantages over traditional financial systems: Faster Transactions – Payments occur in real time without needing manual approval. Lower Costs – No intermediaries mean fewer transaction fees. Security – Blockchain ensures fraud prevention and tamper-proof records. Transparency – All transactions are recorded publicly, reducing disputes. Automation – Payments are processed automatically, improving efficiency. Global Access – Cross-border payments become easier and cheaper. These benefits make programmable money attractive to businesses, freelancers, and financial institutions. Use Cases of Programmable Money Smart contracts enable various real-world applications for programmable money. Some of the most impactful use cases include: Use Case Description Payroll Automation Companies can use smart contracts to pay employees automatically on a set schedule. Supply Chain Payments Suppliers receive payments instantly when they deliver and verify goods. Insurance Payouts The system processes and pays out claims automatically when conditions are met. Lending and Borrowing Automated agreements issue and repay loans. Subscription Services The system handles payments for memberships or services without manual renewals. Escrow Services The system holds and releases funds only when both parties fulfill their obligations. These use cases show how different industries can benefit from smart contract-based transactions. Challenges and Limitations While programmable money offers many advantages, there are also challenges to consider: Technical Complexity – Not everyone understands blockchain and smart contracts. Regulatory Uncertainty – Governments are still developing rules for digital payments. Security Risks – Smart contracts can have coding errors that hackers exploit. Limited Adoption – Many businesses still rely on traditional banking systems. Network Fees – Transactions on some blockchains can become expensive during high demand. Despite these challenges, ongoing innovation is making programmable money more accessible and reliable. The Future of Programmable Money Programmable money will be a big element in the international financial systems. More businesses and people realize its potential, therefore, have started to adopt it. Governments are also exploring CBDCs with smart contract features. Blockchain, as it evolves, will have lower transaction costs and greater security. Financial institutions will adopt smart-contract-powered payments, making each digital transaction frictionless. In turn, programmable money in this process replaces a host of traditional bank processes over due course. Programmable money through smart contracts is the new order to make payments for speed, security, and automation, reducing reliance on intermediaries. That means businesses can automate payroll, supply chain payments, and insurance claims, while people conduct transactions instantly and transparently. While there are still challenges ahead, the future of programmable money is bright. As blockchain technology continues to advance, more industries will adopt financial solutions based on smart contracts. Understanding this innovation today empowers individuals and enterprises to prepare for the future in digital payments.",Reviews|Programmable Money,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ADA|FIAT|SOL,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-02-07 11:39:17

Whales accumulated millions of tokens during the dip, and the RSI briefly dropped below 30, suggesting a potential price rebound. The Potential Catalysts Ripple’s XRP did not start the business week on the right foot, briefly tanking below $2 during the market correction witnessed on February 3. In the following days, the bulls reclaimed some lost ground, but the price remains deep in the red on a weekly scale , currently trading at around $2.37 (per CoinGecko’s data). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the bearish environment, some essential factors hint that a move to the upside could be incoming. On February 6, Cboe BZX Exchange lodged 19b-4 filings on behalf of Canary Capital, WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Bitwise. The well-known asset managers seek to list the first spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the USA. The filings represent a formal request submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency must approve or reject the application, often within 240 days. A potential green light would grant American investors additional options to gain exposure to Ripple’s native token, which could create upward pressure on its price. The whales’ activity is another factor worth observing. The popular X user Ali Martinez revealed that large investors had accumulated 520 million XRP (worth over $1.2 billion at current rates) during the latest dip. Whales seized the opportunity during the recent dip, buying 520 million $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/v2Lu4uBMgm — Ali (@ali_charts) February 6, 2025 Such actions reduce the circulating supply of the asset , possibly setting the stage for a rally (should demand keep its level or rise). Last but not least , we will focus on XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the speed and change of price movements. The technical analysis tool varies from 0 to 100, with readings below 30 indicating oversold conditions and a potential for a bounce. Earlier this week, the ratio plunged below the bullish mark, currently set at around 35. Bonus: Garlinghouse and Trump The president of the USA, Donald Trump, started his second term at the White House with a bang, signing numerous executive orders and doubling down on his focus on the cryptocurrency industry. He reportedly plans to establish a crypto advisory council that may be comprised of some well-known names. One of the people who could find a place there is Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. The advisors’ main role will be to design a comprehensive regulatory framework for the sector and work closely with Trump and David Sacks (whom the president tapped to serve as cryptocurrency and AI “czar”). Garlinghouse’s possible connection with the White House could have a significant impact on Ripple’s native token. He might advocate for clearer regulations surrounding the asset, which has faced scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for years. Ripple’s CEO and the American president have shown a close connection to each other, having a dinner meeting at the Mar-a-Lago estate earlier this year.

CryptoQuant Analyst Shares His Detailed Analysis!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-long-expected-bullish-signal-for-ethereum-eth-may-have-arrived-cryptoquant-analyst-shares-his-detailed-analysis/,"While Ethereum (ETH) has taken the brunt of the recent declines, analysts are not in a clear consensus on the ETH price. While some say the decline could continue to lower levels, some analysts predict that a rise is on the way. At this point, one of the analysts who was bullish was CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha, who argued that increasing Ethereum outflows on crypto derivatives exchanges were a bullish signal. The analyst said that the amount of Ethereum withdrawn from crypto derivatives exchanges has reached its highest level since August 2023, which is a positive signal for the ETH price. Analyzing the impact of ETH outflows on the price, the analyst stated that investors withdrawing their Ethereum from the derivatives exchange means that selling pressure is decreasing, leverage positions are being closed and ETH is potentially being moved to cold storage, which is a bullish signal. “When ETH leaves derivatives exchanges, it typically indicates that investors are closing leveraged positions or moving ETH to cold storage. This reduces the supply available for sale and makes it harder for the price to drop. If demand remains constant or increases, price tends to rise due to lower available supply.” “There has been increased Ethereum outflows on crypto derivatives exchanges. Large moves like this usually mean less selling pressure and closing of large positions, which is usually a bullish signal,” another analyst commented. *This is not investment advice.

A new contender, 1Fuel (OFT), is stealing attention with its cutting-edge technology and real-world utility. 1Fuel is quickly becoming the preferred choice for investors. The protocol offers seamless cross-chain transactions and lucrative staking rewards. As momentum builds, could 1Fuel be the next big crypto success story? 1Fuel – The game-changing crypto solution competing with top altcoins like Shiba Inu and Solana As investors seek better opportunities, 1Fuel (OFT) is quickly emerging as a top contender in the crypto space. With its innovative features and rapidly growing presale, 1Fuel is poised to revolutionize digital asset trading. At its core, 1Fuel offers a seamless one-click cross-chain transaction system. Unlike traditional wallets that require multiple steps and high fees, 1Fuel simplifies the process. Users simply select their token and the platform handles everything in the background. This game-changing feature eliminates one of crypto’s biggest challenges: complex and expensive blockchain transactions. Security is also a major focus. With integrated privacy mixers and cold storage options, 1Fuel ensures that investor assets remain protected from hacks and unauthorized tracking. Users can trade confidently, knowing their funds and transactions are fully secure. Beyond trading, 1Fuel’s staking program offers up to 30% APR, making it an attractive option for investors looking to generate passive income. This combination of convenience, security, and profitability is already drawing attention from Solana investors who recognize its potential. As the presale nears completion, now is the best time to secure OFT tokens before demand drives prices even higher. 1Fuel isn’t just another crypto project,it’s a true game-changer in digital finance. Vaneck predicts $520 for Solana Solana has dropped 21% in the past week, impacted by broader market conditions, but its fundamentals remain strong. Q4 revenue surged 213% to $840 million, driven by memecoin trading and a 150% rise in DEX volume. Solana now dominates 56.48% of the AI token market and continues to expand through Solaxy’s layer-2 scaling. According to VanEck, Solana’s SCP market share could rise from 15% to 22% by the end of 2025, potentially pushing SOL price to $520. Solana’s revenue, largely from MEV fees, could double to $6.8 billion with optimizations in Jito and Firedancer. As Solana surpasses Ethereum in dApp revenue, further developer adoption and MEV improvements could fuel long-term price growth, reinforcing its position as a top layer-1 blockchain. Shiba Inu traders eye a massive surge in 2025 Shiba Inu price dropped 65% from its cycle high, underperforming the broader meme coin market. While tokens like PEPE and FLOKI broke resistance, Shiba Inu lost momentum, forming a lower high before declining. After breaking below its trend line, it found support at $0.0000143, preventing a deeper drop. However, bearish RSI and MACD signals suggest this bounce may be short-lived. Despite weak technicals, whale accumulation has surged, with large holders moving trillions of Shiba Inu in anticipation of a recovery. Beyond speculation, Shiba Inu is expanding into real-world applications. The memecoin recently partnered with the UAE’s Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure for Web3 integration. Short-term rallies are possible, but failure to reclaim key resistance could trigger further declines. The bottom line While Solana and Shiba Inu have had their time in the spotlight, 1Fuel (OFT) is emerging as the new favorite among investors. With its seamless cross-chain transactions, strong security, and real-world usability, it offers more than just hype – it delivers lasting value. As its presale gains traction and analysts predict massive growth, now is the time to secure OFT before it skyrockets. Don’t miss out on the next big crypto opportunity!

Are these crypto memes fading into oblivion now? What lies ahead for $DOGE, $PEPE, $WIF, and $TRUMP? Is $DOGE Still the Top Contender for Survival? Source: TradingView Among all the memecoins, $DOGE has managed to endure over time and might be the strongest candidate for survival due to its ties with Elon Musk. Observing the weekly chart above, the upward trend persists, but maintaining the 0.786 Fibonacci level is crucial for the bulls. A slight drop below the upward trendline will also need correction, ideally before the weekend concludes. On the bullish side, the Stochastic RSI appears at the chart's bottom. If these indicators can reverse direction and move upward beyond the 20.00 mark, it could spark new upward price momentum, potentially extending over several weeks. Has $PEPE Hit Rock Bottom? Source: TradingView Over the past few months, $PEPE took a significant plunge, now sitting about 66% below its peak. However, it appears the bottom might have been reached, with the price stabilizing at the intersection of horizontal support and the rising bullish trend line. Similar to $DOGE, the weekly Stochastic RSI for $PEPE is at its lowest point. This might present a favorable moment for those interested in $PEPE. Nevertheless, if the price dips below the support level, it could signal the end of this bull phase for $PEPE. $WIF's Chart Offers Little Hope Source: TradingView The weekly chart for Dog Wif Hat (WIF) appears bleak. A promising breakout from the triangle last November didn't result in a higher high, and since then, the price has plummeted through the triangle's base, leading to its current unfortunate state. Despite the Stochastic RSI indicators being at their lowest point, the 84% decline doesn't inspire much confidence among potential investors. Nonetheless, with favorable conditions in the final bull market stage, $WIF could still experience an unexpected turn. Is $TRUMP Entering a Bottoming Phase? Source: TradingView With only three weeks of price activity, forecasting $TRUMP's future is challenging. What is clear is that $TRUMP has plummeted by 77% since its remarkable initial surge on launch day. This decline was somewhat anticipated due to the massive hype surrounding this memecoin and its associated figure. However, if it is undergoing a bottoming process, those willing to take a gamble might consider entering. The chart above outlines potential targets based on Fibonacci levels.

As a result, crypto analyst Roxii recently pointed out that Polygon was eyeing the $0.75 zone if a triple bottom pattern saw the light of day. She pointed out , “POL is fighting to make the current level $.33 a support, this would be pretty much Polygon’s last line of defense. If a support is made, this could be a triple bottom pattern in the making. The upward target is $0.75.” Source: Roxii Renowned market analyst Ali Martinez also opined that the zone between $0.36 and $0.50 presents a crucial support zone since on-chain data shows that most POL tokens were accumulated in this area. Polygon continues to hover around the $0.30 zone, according to CoinGecko data. Polygon’s Quest to Tame Slow Speeds As a Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution, Polygon intends to solve some pressing blockchain challenges, such as high fees and slow speeds. Therefore, POL serves as an expressway for blockchain transactions since they are quickly processed on a different chain before being securely linked to the Ethereum network. Having been rebranded to Polygon (POL) from Polygon (MATIC), the ecosystem intends to transition to a full-scale network that supports multiple scaling solutions. This rebranding started in September 2024 as part of the major Polygon 2.0 upgrade . This shift was instrumental in the network’s evolution since the primary focus is on zero-knowledge (ZK) – powered Layer 2 chains meant to tame Ethereum’s scalability challenges.",Cryptocurrency|News|MATIC|Polygon,EN,0,0,MATIC|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|ZK,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-07 11:57:13

Analyzing the Future of $DOGE, $PEPE, $WIF, and $TRUMP",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/are-memecoins-dead-analyzing-the-future-of-doge-pepe-wif-and-trump,"It now seems a distant memory when memecoins would spike hundreds, and sometimes thousands of percent in short periods of time. Are the crypto memes dead or dying now? What is the future for $DOGE, $PEPE, $WIF, and $TRUMP? Is $DOGE the best bet to survive? Source: TradingView Of all the memecoins, $DOGE has stood the test of time, and is arguably the best bet to survive, given its connection with Elon Musk. Looking at the weekly chart above, it can be seen that the trend is still up, although holding on to that 0.786 Fibonacci will be of prime importance for the bulls. Falling just under the ascending trendline will also need to be reversed if possible by the end of this coming weekend. In favour of the bulls, is the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart. The indicators are reaching the bottom now. If they can turn around and start heading back up, and past the 20.00 level, this will bring in new upside price momentum, potentially lasting a few weeks. The bottom may be in for $PEPE Source: TradingView $PEPE took quite a fall over the last couple of months, currently down around 66% from the top. It does look as though the bottom may have been found. The price is holding at the juncture of the horizontal support, and the ascending bull trend line. Just as for $DOGE, the weekly Stochastic RSI for $PEPE is at the bottom. This could be a good time to enter a position if $PEPE is your thing. However, if the price does confirm below the support, it could well be the end of this bull run for $PEPE. $WIF price chart does not give cause for optimism Source: TradingView The weekly chart for Dog Wif Hat (WIF) does not look good. A great looking breakout of the triangle, back in November last year, failed to make a higher high, and the price has since rolled over and crashed down through the bottom of the triangle, to end up in its present sorry state. Even though the Stochastic RSI indicators are at rock bottom, the 84% crash will not give potential investors much cause for optimism. That said, if a fair wind does get behind the sails of $WIF going into the final stage of the bull market, who knows where this could end up. $TRUMP in a bottoming process? Source: TradingView Given that $TRUMP has only experienced 3 weeks of price action up to now, making predictions is not easy. What we can say is that $TRUMP has lost 77% of its value from that incredible spike up on the first day it was released. This was probably to be expected given the sensational hype of this memecoin, and the figure it is tied to. That said, if some kind of bottoming process is happening now, those who want to take the casino-like bet could start thinking of an entry. The targets, based on the Fibonacci levels, are in the chart above. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It's surprising prices have not yet crossed that threshold, especially after President Donald Trump's son, Eric, encouraged the family-linked WLFI to invest in BTC in a post on X on Thursday. Typically, such endorsements during a bull run lead to substantial gains. That that hasn't materialized is a sign markets are no longer buoyed by talk alone and Trump needs to walk the walk. Early this week, the administration said it's evaluating the feasibility of a strategic BTC reserve. Another possibility is that caution ahead of nonfarm payrolls is capping the upside. If that's the case, a breakout may occur once the data is out, especially if the figure prints weaker than estimated, potentially driving Treasury yields and the dollar index lower. Crypto newsletter service LondonCryptoClub recommends keeping an eye on revisions in the previous figures. ""Bloomberg Intelligence expecting some large downside revisions suggesting the Labour market not as strong in 2024 as first appeared We still think the market (and the Fed themselves) are massively under pricing the rate cuts that will need to come,"" the newsletter service's founders said on X. At press time, Volmex's one-day bitcoin implied volatility index stood at an annualized 51%, suggesting a daily price swing of 2.6%, or about $2,600. In other words, the figure could move the spot price by $2,600 in either direction. Notably, some traders are buying put options, bracing for potential downside volatility should the data come in strong. In other news, the ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve"" bill passed the House in the state of Utah and will now move to the Senate. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reported that the U.S. SEC has acknowledged Grayscale's Solana 19b-4 filing. And VanEck predicted a $500 price for SOL, more than double its current value of around $180. Additionally, FOX reporter Eleanor Terrett shared that U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill and Digital Assets Subcommittee Chairman Bryan Steil have released a stablecoin regulation discussion draft, which proposes a two-year ban on stablecoins backed solely by self-issued digital assets and mandates a Treasury study on their risks. And finally, Berachain's BERA token, which debuted yesterday, has already recorded a staggering perpetual trading volume of $4.8 billion, with its price currently sitting at $7.60, a significant drop from yesterday's peak of $14.

TST, or Test Token, was issued on the BNB Chain using the BEP-20 standard. It was not officially launched by Binance, but rather used in a token creation tutorial video by the BNB Chain team. The price surged after the video was shared by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao on X because users took it to be an official Binance token even though Zhao no longer has a formal role at the company. Zhao deleted his repost of the video later. TST skyrocketed to a market cap of around $40 million shortly after Zhao's post, reaching trading volumes of over $90 million at peak.

Solana (SOL) Price Eyes Recovery as XRP Supply Sparks Debate,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-finalcall700-dont-miss-350-bonus-before-launch-solana-sol-price-eyes-recovery-as-xrp-supply-sparks-debate/,"Crypto excitement is building around Solana, XRP, and BlockDAG, each with compelling narratives. Solana (SOL) price analysis shows SOL is hinting at a potential rebound. Meanwhile, XRP’s circulating supply is back in the spotlight, fueling fresh discussions. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is stealing the show with its incredible FINALCALL700 bonus. Get ready for a jaw-dropping 350% extra BDAG with every purchase! This offer is igniting an already record-breaking presale, with over $192 million raised and demand soaring. Smart players are grabbing this limited-time opportunity before BDAG’s price jumps. It’s a chance to maximize your crypto holdings like never before. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis: Can It Bounce Back? A recent Solana (SOL) price analysis shows the cryptocurrency briefly fell below $195 before quickly rebounding. This drop happened after a rejection near $280, raising concerns about short-term price action. Despite this pullback, market observers suggest the asset could still move upwards if key resistance levels are surpassed. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates an oversold condition, potentially supporting a future price increase. For Solana to potentially reach $500, it must overcome resistance at $280 and $400, while maintaining support above $180 and $200. The Solana (SOL) price analysis also notes Bitcoin’s influence, as overall market trends continue to affect its performance. XRP Supply: Why the 100 Billion Cap Is Here to Stay The XRP supply has become a topic of renewed discussion. Some have questioned whether Ripple can create more units beyond the original 100 billion. However, XRPL validator Vet has clarified that the network’s design prevents any supply increase. The XRP Ledger uses an “invariant checker,” a security feature that ensures no new units can be created. Unlike Bitcoin, which once experienced a bug related to inflation, XRPL’s structure makes such an issue very unlikely. Furthermore, XRP’s supply is gradually decreasing because transaction fees burn small amounts with each transaction, emphasizing the unit’s scarcity. FINALCALL700: Last Chance For A 350% Bonus! BlockDAG’s presale is setting new records, and its latest offer, FINALCALL700, adds to its appeal. For a limited time, each BDAG purchase includes a 350% extra unit bonus. This is BlockDAG’s most generous offer to date. People wanting to maximize their holdings before launch are acting quickly, as this bonus substantially increases their BDAG holdings. For example, a $1,000 BDAG purchase with FINALCALL700 results in $4,500 worth of BDAG. This kind of opportunity is rare in early-stage cryptocurrency sales. The BDAG unit presale has already generated over $192 million and sold over 18.2 billion units, making it one of the largest presales. BDAG’s price has seen a 2380% surge, rising from $0.001 to $0.0248, driving strong demand. The combination of rapid growth and FINALCALL700 has many calling it a top cryptocurrency choice now, with presale participation accelerating. The bonus is not just an extra incentive; it is actively driving momentum, propelling BlockDAG towards new milestones as interest soars. What does the future hold for BDAG holders once the presale concludes? Market analysts predict a $1 price soon after launch, positioning BDAG as a strong long-term contender. The FINALCALL700 bonus may be the best opportunity to acquire BDAG units before prices climb even higher, but it is a limited-time offer. With accelerating demand, those who have not yet participated risk missing this opportunity as BDAG advances to its next phase. Miner sales have exceeded $6.2 million, with over 15,500 miners sold. This further indicates the project’s growing momentum and community involvement. BlockDAG’s success in attracting both early adopters and miners underscores its potential in the cryptocurrency space. The 2025 Outlook For SOL, XRP & BDAG As the market changes, each of these contenders offers a unique opportunity. The Solana (SOL) price analysis suggests a potential rebound, but overcoming resistance levels will be crucial for its next rally. The XRP supply remains fixed at 100 billion, confirming its scarcity as discussions about its structure subside. However, BlockDAG’s momentum is exceptional. With FINALCALL700 offering 350% extra BDAG, demand is high, and the presale has surpassed $192 million. Analysts predict BDAG will reach $1 post-launch, making this generous offer the perfect entry point for those looking for massive gains in 2025. Once the FINALCALL700 bonus ends, so does the chance to acquire extra BDAG units at this current price.

IntelMarkets is disrupting the trillion-dollar crypto market with its groundbreaking AI technology combined with its proprietary L1 blockchain. Analysts hint at a potential 100x gains for INTL’s altcoin in Q3. Cardano Price Reversal Inbound, ADA To Hit New ATH Before dropping to red zones, the Cardano price was among the top-performing cryptos toward the end of 2024. During the tenure, the Cardano price rose to an almost three-year high of approximately $1.30. From then on, the Cardano price has lost some steam, and its valuation briefly slumped to as low as $0.60 during the crypto crash on February 3. While the bulls managed to reclaim some of the lost ground in the following days, ADA is currently trading at around $0.75, with a 30% decline on a monthly evaluation. Despite the recent downtrend, popular industry participants believe the Cardano price is poised for a massive comeback. X user Ali Martinez reminded us that ADA’s price exploded from less than $0.1 to over $3 during the previous bull cycle in mid-2021. He assumed that the Cardano price could be ‘at the very beginning of a parabolic rally,’ and if history repeats, the valuation could skyrocket to $15 in the near future. Cardano Price Could Soar Ahead If Bulls Take Control Despite the optimism from multiple market observers, certain factors suggest that ADA bulls might experience more pain in the short term. As CryptoPotato reported earlier this week, whales have offloaded more than 330 million tokens (worth almost $250 million at the time). A huge sell-off by large investors triggers a surplus of supply in the market. Moreover, the actions of these whales could spark panic among other (smaller) traders, which could intensify the downward pressure on the Cardano price. Conversely, when large investors accumulate a substantial amount of ADA, it can have the opposite impact. According to CryptoPotato, whales bought over 130 million tokens in November when ADA was around $1. IntelMarkets To Bag 100x Gains Amid Cardano Price Dilemma As the Cardano price is losing grip of its loyal investors, there’s another strong contender making noise in the crypto market.

Ripple (XRP) continues to gain ground as a US senator recently supported the adoption of the XRP ETF. Investors wonder if government institutions will extend their approval to the high-speed blockchain network Solana (SOL) together with the AI-driven financial platform IntelMarkets (INTL). Ripple’s Political Endorsement and Market Impact of XRP ETF The crypto market experienced significant movement because a US senator provided his endorsement to Ripple. The political support might allow Ripple to progress toward the highly anticipated XRP ETF launch, establishing a long-term financial market. An increased level of institutional support might help XRP ETFs get approval and some analysts speculate that Ripple will receive over $20 billion in inflows. Ripple continues trading at below the $2.50 resistance yet analysts claim that this correction in price is only temporary. A rise in regulatory support for the XRP ETF could lead to Ripple surpassing its ATH price of $3.84 in the near future. Following the senator’s support, investors remain optimistic about XRP ETFs getting the green light, with analysts claiming that approval could be granted by the beginning of Q3 2025. Solana Price Struggles And $200 Resistance Solana (SOL) achieved high market performance through its capabilities for fast transactions at low fees. The adoption of its ecosystem was incredibly high during the last few months, especially in January, when the Solana price reached an ATH of $294.33. The increased regulatory favor towards Bitcoin and Ripple has investors wondering if SOL will gain matching institutional investment support. During the last 24 hours Solana kept its value between $202.85 and $218.30 with a current price of $205.18. The Solana price movement exhibits significant instability because of the ongoing US foreign tariff policies. SOL’s ecosystem witnessed a spectacular growth period and gained significant ground in the NFT market, as Raydium surpassed Uniswap recently. Additionally, the current Solana price action does not diminish its fundamental stability since there has been significant growth among investors and developers using its platform. Several market analysts express support for a SOL ETF, which is set to rally the Solana price. Soma analysts believe that SOL might get its ETF approved faster than Ripple, with some projections estimating approval by the end of Q2 2025. IntelMarkets (INTL): The AI-Driven Disruptor Gaining Momentum The crypto world has turned its attention to IntelMarkets (INTL) as this disruptive project. The trading platform IntelMarkets implements an AI-Defi convergence to build an entirely new marketplace that helps users make the best trades with AI insights. INTL targets the $36 billion crypto trading market with operations based on AI to automate trades and real-time market analysis while optimizing portfolio management. The 9th ICO stage of IntelMarkets enables investors to acquire tokens for only $0.082, which provides an attractive entry point for investors. The combination of AI-powered trading bots and data-driven choices attracts traders who need competitive advantages during market volatility to use INTL. Numerous experts predict that IntelMarkets’ dual strategy will bring it to mass-market acceptance, emerging as a competitor against Ripple and SOL. Backed by a team of leading OpenAI and MIT researchers, the INTL presale has already raised over $8 million in only 3 months. As the US government continues funding AI projects, Institutional support stands ready to thrust IntelMarkets toward becoming the leading crypto innovation of the year. Post-listing, analysts claim that INTL’s new AI-driven solution could rally over 75x once the IntelMarkets platform is live. Conclusion: The Future Belongs to Innovation IntelMarkets shows increasingly strong potential by building its presence as a competitor against both Solana and Ripple. The growing political support for XRP ETF indicates how institutions and regulators believe in the future of crypto. As SOL prepares for a new rally, many experts view the Solana price as oversold. IntelMarkets creates a distinct AI-driven trading environment through its DeFi platform while meeting demands of both investors and institutions. As the financial market seems to favor AI-powered solutions, the INTL presale is only likely to gain in momentum.

The last crypto dip saw the asset plunge below $100k as billions in value were liquidated. For most traders, light shines at the end of the tunnel following investor accumulations as funds flow out of centralized exchanges. Institutional demand remains a major factor behind flash upticks recorded in mid-day trading. Supply Shock Can Drive The Next Rally A new CryptoQuant report points to reduced Bitcoin centralized exchange reserve, a metric that marks the beginning of an uphill movement. Historically, bull cycles have seen accumulation and transfers to other custodians, signaling long-term holding. After the BTC price dropped below $98K, whales began repositioning holdings, as seen in the exchange reserve charts. At the moment, exchange reserves are below 3 million, with additional signs of growing bull activities. Asides exchange volumes, miners reserves are on the rise with expected hodling until the asset breaks the all-time high. Crypto miners offload assets in a bear market to recover losses but tend to hold in bull seasons. This played out in 2022 amid the crypto winter that saw BTC price plunge to yearly lows. While miner sales spiked, figures dropped in Q1 2023, fueling the recovery phase. At the same, institutional investors longed to spot BTC ETFs projecting mass adoption in the crypto leader. “ Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have been on an aggressive decline, signaling an accumulation phase by investors. This suggests that market participants are withdrawing their BTC from exchanges and moving them into self-custody, reducing the circulating supply available for trading. Given that exchange reserves serve as a supply-side indicator, this persistent decline could contribute to further price appreciation in the coming weeks.” CryptoQuant wrote. What’s Next For BTC Price? Bitcoin price slipped to $96,405, although sentiments spiked among whales. The status quo comes on the heels of negative macroeconomic factors and fears looming the U.S. trade wars. Last week, the launch of DeepSeek sent US tech stocks downward, impacting crypto assets. Market analysts expect a recovery in Bitcoin followed by inflows to altcoins as positives trickle in. The Bank of England’s decision to lower policy rates can fuel local traders with an impact on US markets. Interest rate cuts result in an uptick because of fund flows into risky assets. On Feb 5, Standard Chartered set the BTC price target at $500K by 2025.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-07 12:00:56

This achievement makes Enso one of the top three blockchain aggregators according to seven-day volume. Processing $3.1B completed. 84 shortcuts executed. Fueled by Boyco, Enso shortcuts powered execution at massive scale for @berachain 's mainnet launch. Yes, the chain is actually real. pic.twitter.com/7nLefHOgln — Enso 🛠️ (@EnsoBuild) February 6, 2025 Boyco campaign liquidity The spike in transaction volume was largely driven by Boyco, a liquidity campaign tied to Berachain’s pre-launch strategy. Boyco relies on Enso’s infrastructure to route deposits across multiple decentralized finance ( DeFi ) protocols. That is, acting as the execution layer for Boyco’s liquidity deployment, Enso facilitated billions in on-chain transactions, illustrating its potential to handle high-volume DeFi operations. Enso also simplifies blockchain development via so-called “shortcuts”, or bundled actions designed to reduce multi-step DeFi interactions to a single transaction. As such, Enso provides the infrastructure necessary to scale frictionless Web3 applications. Automated on-chain executions with no intermediaries Built on the Royco Protocol, the Boyco campaign redefined how new blockchains attract liquidity. Developed in collaboration with Berachain, LayerZero, Stargate, and Enso, Boyco eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries, which allows dApps to incentivize liquidity directly. Enso also integrated 12 applications and 20 asset issuers to tackle transactions more efficiently. One of the highlights was executing $300 million in one transaction, a number that underscores the growing demand for accessible automated on-chain executions.

Bitcoin (BTC) traded just over $97,300 in European morning hours Friday, down 1.7% in the past 24 hours. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index of the largest tokens by market capitalization, fell 2.3%. “Bitcoin failed to reclaim the $99K resistance level last night, triggering a broad selloff in the market and pushing BTC back to a new daily low of $95.6K,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast. “With a three-day losing streak, the outlook for crypto remains uncertain.” Ether (ETH) fell 2%, while XRP outperformed BTC with slight declines of 1.1% after a brief Thursday sell-off. Solana’s SOL was up 0.2% as investment firm VanEck predicted the token hitting $520 at the end of 2025. Some traders pointed to continued volatility in crypto markets next week. “It's been a volatile week as China has proved that it can take measures against new tariff policies,” Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “It looks as if there is a wide breadth of tools at their disposal which can act as leverage. “Additionally, we've yet to see Trump tariffs hit the EU, so markets will likely continue to be fluctuating through the next few weeks,” Mei added, referring to the multiple tariffs issued or hinted by Trump against Canada, Mexico, EU and China last week. The U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) is a monthly report detailing job creation, unemployment rate, and wage changes which influences markets by affecting expectations around Federal Reserve's interest rate policies. Strong job growth can lead to fears of inflation, and raising interest rates, while weak data might signal an economic slowdown, lowering rates expectations and affecting currency and bond yields. Bitcoin's price reacts to this data through shifts in risk sentiment, liquidity, and the dollar's value. Positive payrolls might bolster bitcoin — and the broader crypto market — if it spurs a risk-on market mood and vice-versa.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ADA|DOGE|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-07 12:02:31

New digital coins are emerging with innovative features and potential to surpass Ethereum. This article looks at five promising cryptocurrencies that could take the lead by 2025, offering fresh opportunities and shaking up the current rankings. XYZVerse: The Best New Meme Project You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where crypto enthusiasts can score big off the growing demand for meme coins. But every revolution needs a hero—someone willing to fight against the odds and push the $XYZ token to the top. That hero is XYZepe , the masked fighter, the true believer, the relentless $XYZ holder whose mission is to bring XYZVerse to the #1 spot on CoinMarketCap. It’s about proving that underdogs can rise to greatness. With millions of sports fans ready to hit the field, the XYZVerse ecosystem is set to keep expanding—and your rewards will slam dunk through the roof! And here’s a highlight reel moment: XYZVerse has been officially recognized as the Best NEW Meme Project—a title that underscores its explosive potential in the meme coin arena. XYZ presale is your first-quarter chance to get in before the mind-blowing explosion! Meme coins are the undisputed champions of the crypto world, and XYZ is set to crush the competition. Currently priced at $0.002, $XYZ remains an undervalued crypto gem poised to rise to $0.1 at the final presale stage. But victory doesn’t happen overnight—it takes dedication, strategy, and a fighter willing to go the distance. XYZepe knows the battle ahead, but with the community behind him, he’s taking $XYZ to legendary status. With upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, rock-solid defense in the form of audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, XYZ is already ahead of the game. The first-mover advantage is key here—get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! XYZepe is fighting for glory—will you stand with him? Solana’s SOL: The Speedster Challenging Ethereum and Cardano Solana is a blockchain platform built for speed and scalability. It offers a foundation for decentralized apps, competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano. What sets Solana apart is its unique design that allows for faster transactions and development in multiple programming languages. At the heart of Solana is SOL, its native cryptocurrency, which powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. SOL holds real value because it keeps the Solana ecosystem running smoothly. Unlike some blockchains, Solana doesn’t rely on sharding or layers to scale up. This makes it attractive to developers and investors looking for a high-capacity network that can handle busy products and services. In the current market, where speed and scalability are crucial, SOL looks promising. Its ability to host high-activity applications could give it an edge over competitors like Ethereum, especially as users seek faster and more efficient platforms. Ethereum’s Next Leap: Why ETH Could Dominate the Crypto Market Ethereum is more than a digital coin; it’s a groundbreaking network changing how we use the internet. Started by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, Ethereum introduced smart contracts, which let people create apps that run without central control. In 2022, it moved to Proof-of-Stake, making transactions faster and using less energy. Solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon help speed up transactions and lower costs. Ether (ETH), Ethereum’s own token, powers the network, allowing operations and rewarding those who help maintain it. Right now, Ethereum looks promising in the crypto market. Based on past trends, ETH could reach up to $6,580.53 next year. With plans to improve the network to handle more transactions at lower costs, Ethereum aims to stay ahead in blockchain tech. While other coins like Bitcoin are important, Ethereum’s focus on practical uses, like apps and finance tools, gives it an edge. As the crypto world grows, Ethereum’s ongoing improvements make it an attractive choice for those interested in the future of digital technology. BNB: The Powerhouse Coin Fueling Binance’s Crypto Empire BNB is the digital coin at the heart of the Binance ecosystem. Launched in 2017, it began as a token on the Ethereum network. Now, it fuels both the Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain. BNB isn’t just for trading; it’s used to pay fees, create new tokens, and move assets. It supports smart contracts, letting users earn rewards by staking their coins. Beyond the blockchain, BNB offers discounts on Binance.com and is accepted by many third-party services. What makes BNB stand out is its plan to boost value by reducing supply. Every quarter, Binance burns some BNB, aiming to cut the original 200 million coins in half. This scarcity can increase demand and value. In the current market, BNB looks attractive due to its strong technology and practical uses. Compared to other coins, BNB offers real-world benefits and a growing ecosystem. With its unique features and the backing of Binance, BNB could be a bright spot in today’s crypto market. Cardano’s ADA: The Green Blockchain Revolution Challenging Ethereum Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world with its native coin, ADA. Designed for smart contracts, Cardano allows developers to build decentralized apps, tokens, and games. Unlike many other platforms, Cardano is both flexible and sustainable. It uses a proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros, which is more energy-efficient than the traditional proof-of-work models. This makes it an environmentally friendly option in the crypto space. What sets Cardano apart is its two-layer architecture. The Settlement Layer handles transactions, while the Computing Layer takes care of smart contracts. This design boosts its processing power, potentially reaching up to a million transactions per second. Since March 2021, Cardano’s native tokens have enabled secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. Compared to Ethereum’s ETH, ADA offers a scalable and eco-friendly alternative. In the current market, ADA looks attractive for those interested in sustainable and efficient blockchain solutions. XRP: The Fast and Borderless Cryptocurrency Changing the Game XRP is a digital currency that’s making waves in the world of finance. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, it was designed to be fast, low-cost, and open to everyone. Unlike traditional currencies, XRP doesn’t rely on banks or central authorities. It operates on a decentralized system called the XRP Ledger, making transactions secure, irreversible, and borderless. With an initial supply of 100 billion coins, 80 billion were gifted to Ripple to develop the ecosystem further. What makes XRP stand out is its potential to simplify payments across different currencies. Its technology aims to make money transfers as easy as sending an email. In the current market, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum often face high fees and slow transaction times. XRP offers a solution with its speedy and low-cost transactions. While the crypto market is always changing, XRP’s focus on real-world utility could make it an attractive option for those interested in the future of digital payments. Conclusion Ethereum, Solana, Binance Coin, and Cardano are strong in 2025, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans and aiming for massive growth through a community-driven approach.

Standard Chartered Forecasts 500% Growth In a new note, Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s head of digital asset research, wrote that Bitcoin price will hit $500,000 before the end of Donald Trump’s term. According to analysts, a 500% growth is possible due to favorable market conditions ushered in by the present administration. Factors cited include soaring institutional interest in Bitcoin, the wider market, and positive regulations. Institutional interest has been the pillar of a growing BTC price in the last eighteen months. In 2023, spot Bitcoin ETF applications propelled the market to recovery from the 2022 crypto winter . The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of these funds fueled a new chapter of institutional inflows. Massive inflows recorded due to the new window spurred Bitcoin to multiple all-time highs. This year, more traditional firms are tipped to widen their market exposure. This spike in adoption from institutional and retail traders will reduce volatility and build sustainability peaks. With over $40 billion in spot BTC ETFs , Kendrick projects a massive run in the next four years. “ The ETFs have attracted a net $39 billion of inflows so far, supporting the theory of pent-up demand being unleashed by increased access… Trump’s January 23 order that the administration evaluate a potential national digital assets stockpile is also important, as this could encourage other central banks to consider Bitcoin investments,” he added. Trump’s Pro-Crypto Policy At the Center Most commentators have pointed to President Trump’s pro-market approach, predicting a surge in fresh capital. So far, all looks set to dismantle the harsh stance of the former administration with sweeping reforms. From bills around a strategic Bitcoin reserve, whales look to reshape holding ahead of price movement. Recently, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) noted that it plans to revise regulations to allow banks to offer Bitcoin and crypto-related services. Standard Chartered placed a $200k BTC price target this year and a $300k mark by 2026. These factors can fuel the crypto leader to break these points in anticipation of $500K in 2028.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-07 12:06:11

According to a report on Wednesday, the bank said 2025 is the year that China eats the world. Furthermore, global investors have since realized that China is out-competing the rest of the world. As a result, more investors have proliferated into undervalued Chinese tech companies in anticipation of catching the bull rally, which Deutsche Bank believes started in 2024. What’s in for the Crypto Market The exponential growth of the crypto industry in Singapore, which is widely considered a proxy for China, is an indication that mainland China investors are still investing in crypto assets, potentially through over-the-counter means instead of regular methods. With Chinese capitalism heavily outweighing the political-socialism agendas, the venture into the crypto market by China in the coming years will significantly grow. Moreover, Hong Kong has already approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have attracted capital from investors based in mainland China. With China developing AI tech solutions at a fractional capital compared to Silicon Valley’s oriented firms, a deep venture into the altcoin industry by Chinese developers will be phenomenal in the near future. Currently, the Chinese cryptocurrency market is still choked by the 2021 ban by the People’s Bank of China.

According to a Bloomberg report , co-founder of World Liberty Financial, Chase Herro, said that the platform aims to build a “strategic reserve” using cryptocurrency that the project has bought. Although, he did not specify what sort of purpose the reserve will have. Based on data from Arkham Intelligence , a wallet linked to World Liberty Financial recently bought 342,000 ONDO ( ONDO ), which is WLF’s governance token, for $470,000 USDC ( USDC ) on the CoW Protocol. This brings World Liberty Financials’ ONDO holdings to 342,002 ONDO, worth approximately $478,800. WLF also bought ONDO tokens worth $245,000 two months ago before sending them to Coinbase Prime. On the same day, Ondo Finance announced that will launch its own layer 1 blockchain called Ondo Chain. According to data from crypto.news, ONDO dipped slightly by 0.06% in the past 24 hours and nearly 8.5% in the past week. The token is currently trading hands at $1.40.

Fake Updates and Seed Phrase Requests On February 6, Web3 scam detection platform Scam Sniffer issued a warning on X, alerting Phantom users to a coordinated phishing attack . According to the platform, scammers connect to real Phantom wallets and trick users by generating a fraudulent “update extension” signature request. If unsuspecting victims approve the request, a prompt appears, demanding the input of the wallet’s seed phrase. Once entered, this sensitive information grants scammers full control over the wallet, enabling them to drain funds. This isn’t the first such attack. In late January, Scam Sniffer flagged similar malicious pop-ups on fake websites imitating Phantom’s user interface. These deceptive prompts urged users to share their wallet seed phrases under the guise of establishing a secure connection. To help users detect fraudulent attempts, Scam Sniffer advised right-clicking on suspicious links. Genuine Phantom pop-ups do not block this action, while phishing pages typically restrict it. Additionally, Scam Sniffer emphasized that legitimate Phantom windows display “chrome-extension” in their URLs and behave like system windows that can be minimized, resized, or maximized — unlike fake pop-ups trapped within browser tabs. Phantom Grows The increasing adoption of Phantom amid the rising popularity of Solana-based memecoins has made it a prime target for attackers. According to DeFiLlama, Phantom’s 24-hour revenue from fees recently stood at approximately $470,000, surpassing that of Coinbase Wallet. On January 19, Phantom achieved a record-breaking $3.6 million in daily revenue. As of 2024, the platform claims to have more than 10 million monthly active users and over 850 million total transactions. On January 17, Phantom secured $150 million in a Series C funding round, achieving $3 billion valuation. Despite its successes, Phantom has faced challenges, including rumors of a token airdrop. In January, the platform firmly denied speculation that it would launch a token alongside its upcoming social discovery feature. As phishing scams evolve in complexity, the crypto community continues to stress the importance of vigilance.

AI agent tokens, which enjoyed huge gains in late 2024, are now one of the hardest-hit narratives in the current crypto market downturn. Collectively, their market cap has bled 40%, falling from over $10 billion to around $6 billion, according to CoinGecko . Over the past week, the market cap trends for the top 10 AI agents by mindshare reveal a mostly downward trajectory, according to cookie.fun . Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) experienced a sharp decline, losing 53% of its market cap, while Ai16z ( AI16Z ) followed closely with 51%. The market caps of Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ) and aixbt ( AIXBT ) also bled heavily, shrinking by 49% and 45% respectively. Griffain ( GRIFFAIN ) and ARC fell by 32% and 43% respectively. Out of the 10 top AI agents by mindshare, only HENLO (+1%), VVV (+2.8%), and (SNAI) (+127%—a remarkable contrast to the widespread losses) market caps are in the green over the week.

He also observed that liquidity appears to be rotating into large-cap altcoins, while on-chain AI projects are struggling the most. However, he believes that liquidity may rotate back into AI coins at some point, but this would require large caps to stop pumping, continued interest in AI agents, and no new catchy narrative emerging.

Central banks are rethinking their approach to state-backed digital currencies, with Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard ‘s head of crypto & blockchain, noting that while many once considered issuing their own digital currencies to keep pace with the private sector, the focus is now shifting. In a Feb. 6 blog post , Dhamodharan forecasted that in the near future central banks will stop prioritizing digital currencies for the general public. “Today, more and more central banks have concluded that the private sector is innovating well on its own and that central bank digital currencies aimed at the general public needn’t be a high priority.” Raj Dhamodharan Instead, Dhamodharan expects more central banks to focus on “wholesale” central bank digital currencies , which are intended for use by financial institutions, not the general public. He believes the shift will help boost settlement capabilities and speed up cross-border capital flows. “These CBDCs could fundamentally increase institutional settlement capabilities and enable the faster movement of capital across jurisdictions.” Raj Dhamodharan You might also like: Research reveals 98% of global economy exploring CBDC solutions In 2025, Dhamodharan believes the trend will continue, with central banks leaning more towards wholesale CBDCs while leaving retail projects aside.

Berachain (BERA) has officially been listed on the Crypto.com App, allowing users to purchase the token with USD, EUR, and over 20 other fiat currencies. This development adds another milestone for the fast-growing project, which has already secured listings on a few reputable centralized exchanges including MEXC , Upbit, and Bithumb .

Berachain officially launched on Feb. 6, after over a year of anticipation following the release of its public testnet. During this period, the project secured more than $100 million in funding. Berachain is finally real. pic.twitter.com/hN8KEzrkXO — Berachain Foundation 🐻⛓ (@berachain) February 6, 2025 Berachain’s origins can be traced back to the popular NFT collection known as “Bong Bears.” The NFT series was created by a four-person team of pseudonymous co-founders who go by the monikers Homme Bera, Dev Bear, Papa Bear, and Smokey The Bera. The project has been gaining a lot of traction for its innovative Proof of Liquidity consensus mechanism. However, a gaming-chain executive expressed his concern about the project to The Block , criticizing the way Berachain first raised significant funds through NFTs before pivoting to build a blockchain later. How does Berachain work? Berachain is an EVM-identical Layer 1 blockchain built on the modular EVM-focused consensus client framework known as BeaconKit. It employs a novel Proof of Liquidity consensus mechanism, which differentiates it from typical proof-of-stake networks. BERA serves as both the gas and staking token for the Berachain network. In addition to BERA, the Berachain network features BGT and HONEY. BGT is the staking token that can only be earned by providing liquidity to DeFi primitives on-chain, such as exchanges and lenders. Unlike traditional staking tokens, BGT can’t be purchased on the open market—it must be earned through active participation in the network. Users who acquire BGT can choose to burn it to receive BERA. Once BGT is burned, it becomes irredeemable. Validators who deposit their BGT tokens also generate HONEY, the network’s stablecoin, as rewards through protocol fees and user “bribes.” You might also like: Berachain debuts on South Korean Upbit and Bithumb Feb. 6",News|DeFi|layer 1|Liquidity,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|AIRDROP|FIAT,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-07 12:13:42

This move saw XRP’s 24-hour transaction volume soar by 127.7%, per Coinmarketcap data, signaling heightened investor interest. Notably, South Korean exchange Upbit reported a trading volume of $4.895 billion on Tuesday, with the XRP/KRW pair capturing a 22.2% market share, leading Bitcoin. In a tweet , Santiment analysts attributed the resurgence to XRP’s efficiency, low transaction costs, and potential for banking and cross-border payments. According to the firm, positive sentiment surrounding the token has been further fueled by former President Donald Trump’s upcoming plans to introduce friendlier SEC regulations and clearer crypto token guidelines after his inauguration next week. Additionally, speculation over the potential approval of an XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has added to the bullish sentiment. Earlier last month, JPMorgan analysts estimated that Solana (SOL) and XRP ETFs could attract up to $14 billion in new investments, with XRP potentially drawing between $4 billion and $8 billion. As the surge continues, many analysts are drawing comparisons to XRP’s meteoric rise in 2017. On Wednesday, popular analyst Javon Marks highlighted that in 2017, XRP briefly faced resistance at the 1st Fibonacci level before surging to the 1.618 Fibonacci level. As per the pundit, presently, the 1.618 Fibonacci level sits at $16.57, over 400% higher than XRP’s current price, suggesting a major surge may be underway. “A massive XRP surge can be commencing,” Marks tweeted. Notably, on December 30, the pundit had projected an even more ambitious price target of over $100, expecting a breakout move with a more than 45X increase from current levels, following a break above XRP’s 2018 peak. Meanwhile, analyst Cryptobull shared with his 155,000 X followers that XRP could surpass $20 in this bull cycle, reaching $13 within weeks. Based on Elliott Wave theory, the pundit pointed to the five-wave pattern that drove XRP from $0.002 to $3.84 in 2017, a 70,000% gain. He believes the current wave could propel XRP from $0.50 to as high as $26, yielding a 6,000% gain. Elsewhere, Digital Asset Investor pointed out that Google search trends for XRP have seen more than double the interest over the past two months compared to the 2017 run, when the coin surged over 60,000% to reach its all-time high, suggesting a similar bull run could be underway. However, analyst Alex Thorn offered a word of caution, noting that despite the surge, XRP has yet to surpass its 2018 all-time high of $3.31. Adjusting for inflation, Thorn stated that XRP would need to reach $4.24 to exceed its previous peak in 2018.

The firm’s financial muscle has been growing, and with $7 billion in excess reserves, Tether is now ramping up investments even further. A person familiar with the firm’s operations, speaking anonymously, explained Tether’s investment strategy might seem “haphazard,” but the firm is aiming to stay ahead of potential risks to its USDT token. In Europe, Tether is facing challenges as markets adjust to the MiCA regulatory framework. Large crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Crypto.com have signaled their plans to remove Tether’s USDT from their offerings to comply with the local rules.

With competition from up-and-coming stablecoins and the possibility of a drop in U.S. interest rates, sources close to Tether compared the firm’s approach to how petro-states like Saudi Arabia use oil wealth to diversify. “It makes sense for Tether to keep branching out,” they said.

Over the past three weeks, the meme coin market has lost over $44 billion, as noted by crypto analyst CryptOpus in a recent post on X . The current meme coin market cap stands at approximately $75 billion, down from over $110 billion in late Dec. 2024. 📉👀 Over $44 billion has been wiped out from the #memecoin market in the past 3 weeks. #crypto pic.twitter.com/sHFZu3LwEm — CryptOpus (@ImCryptOpus) February 7, 2025 This downturn comes after a year of unprecedented growth, where meme coins outperformed all other crypto asset classes, surging from a $20 billion valuation in Jan. 2024 to $120 billion by Dec., marking a staggering 500% increase. A full-year analysis from Binance highlighted that meme coins were the best-performing crypto sub-sector in 2024, gaining 212% over the year and dominating market mindshare. The leading meme coins were split between Solana ( SOL ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), though Ethereum still held the top three projects, including Dogecoin ( DOGE ). The key driver of this growth has been the success of Pump.fun , a dedicated meme coin launchpad that facilitated over 5.7 million new projects and generated more than $400 million in revenue in 2024. You might also like: Solana’s Pump.fun hit with cease and desist over alleged IP violations Is the meme coin sector entering the “trough of disillusionment”? However, after peaking at around $120 billion in late December, the meme coin market has seen a sharp pullback, with the meme coin market cap dropping to approximately $75 billion, as of press time, according to CoinGecko . This massive drop raises questions about the sustainability of the meme coin frenzy and whether the sector is entering a new phase. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, recently shared his perspective on X , describing the current state of the meme coin market as the “peak of inflated expectations.” According to Ju, this phase is often followed by a “trough of disillusionment,” where speculative excesses fade before the market stabilizes and finds a more sustainable footing. The way value is assessed in the meme coin market is similar to that of the art market. Both markets legitimize intangible value through narrative.

However, Ju believes that meme coins are unlikely to disappear entirely. Instead, he predicts a gradual maturation process over the next five years, eventually carving out a more established role within the crypto economy.

As key projects see their prices dropping, investors are on the hunt for coins that promise stability. However, in the midst of market turmoil, hidden gems often surface, presenting significant opportunities for growth.

With a booming presale and robust adoption rates, some investors are betting on RBLK as the ultimate 1,000x opportunity in today’s volatile market. Rollblock (RBLK): The Upcoming Star in Crypto Gaming Rollblock (RBLK) is quickly emerging as a hot topic in the crypto market.

When stablecoin issuers, like Circle, mint new tokens, it usually means that there is an inflow of fresh US dollar into the ecosystem, with investors depositing USD to Circle (or other issuer) in exchange for USDC (or other stablecoin). Events of significant inflows – as observed in the past 30 days, with one-fifth of all tokens being issued, or the $250 million of today – could suggest that there is a renewed interest from highly-capitalized investors in the ecosystem, which could translate into a bull rally, as these stablecoins are used to buy other cryptocurrencies. Notably, some analysts like BITCOINLFG believe “alt season is about to start.” Finbold has reported other analysts sharing a similar belief, eyeing the Bitcoin ( BTC ) dominance index and altcoins’ capitalization. “Altcoins have broken out from the daily bullish pennant! Running straight into all-time high resistance here — once that breaks, the sky is the limit. Strap in boys, we’re in for one heck of a ride.” – Jelle Altcoins total market cap, bullish pennant, and all-time high resistance. Source: TradingView / Jelle These bullish expectations are also aligned with recent news that hint at Donald Trump considering adding US-based altcoins to the United States Treasury reserves , instead of only Bitcoin, as many enthusiasts first thought. On that note, Michael Saylor was one of these investors who previously held a “BTC-maximalist” position, now admitting being wrong . If an altseason really happens, altcoin investors are expected to see far higher gains than Bitcoin holders in the following months. However, many altcoins lack solid fundamentals and can usually expose investors to higher risks; requiring caution while opening positions.

Simultaneously, the report also showed that the unemployment rate came in at 4% in the starting month of the year, down from 4.1% in the prior month. As the latest data indicates a cooling labor market, investors are keeping close track of Bitcoin price ahead. Cooling US Job Data Sparks Bitcoin Price Rally Hope The latest US Job data by the Labor Department showed that nonfarm payrolls recorded a surge of 143,000 in January, down from 256,000 in the prior month. Notably, the market was expecting the number to remain near the 169K level. Simultaneously, the US unemployment report came in at 4% last month, down from the December figure of 4.1%. The market was eagerly waiting for this crucial labor market data, as it tends to influence the US Federal Reserve’s rate cut plans. Meanwhile, this lower-than-expected job data has fueled speculation over a potential Bitcoin price rally. Impact Of US Job Data On Financial Market For context, the cooling jobs data usually gives space for the central bank to trim their policy rates. On the other hand, if the labor market shows resilience despite the high rates, the Fed may stick to its plan to keep the rates steady. Having said that, the latest cooling data signals a bullish road ahead for Bitcoin price. However, despite that, the data is likely not enough to compel investors immediately over a Fed rate cut soon. Notably, the market is expecting only two rate cuts this year, with the first being expected after the first half of the year. In the latest FOMC, the US central bank has kept the interest rate unchanged. In addition, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has shifted towards a hawkish tone, saying that they would gauge inflation with more data before deciding on their rate cut plans. Meanwhile, following the release, the US 10-year Bond Yield rose 0.77% to 4.471. On the other hand, the US Dollar index advanced 0.23% to $107.790. However, CME FedWatch Tool data showed that there is only a 10.5% chance of a 25 basis point Fed rate cut in the upcoming FOMC in March. Source: CME FedWatch Tool What It Means For Bitcoin? Usually, the cooling US Job data boosts the market sentiment over lower rates, which increases the appeal of the risk-bet assets like Bitcoin and other crypto. Having said that, investors are keeping close track of the impact of the data on Bitcoin. Notably, Bitcoin price has witnessed highly volatile trading lately, witnessing a strong decline from its ATH. However, some investors see this latest cooling data as a positive catalyst for the crypto market ahead. Despite that, it is worth noting that the investors are still betting towards a Fed rate cut after the first half of the year. Besides, any hawkish comments from the Fed officials could further dampen the market sentiment. Meanwhile, despite that, market experts remain bullish on Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market. For context, in a recent X post, top crypto market analyst Mister Crypto lauded the US job data, citing it as a “BULLISH FOR CRYPTO” development. Source: Mister Crypto, X BTC price today also noted a surge following the US Job data, increasing to $98,497 from a 24-hour low of $95,707.35. Bitcoin Futures Open Interest also rose in the one-hour and four-hour time frame, signaling the impact of the data on the investors’ sentiment.

KBW assumed coverage of Strategy with an outperform rating and a $560 price target. The shares were 1% higher at around $329 in early trading. Once Strategy, the company co-founded by Michael Saylor, adopts the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated accounting treatment for bitcoin holdings in the first quarter of this year, it will shift from an ""outdated measurement approach to fair value accounting, with unrealized gains/losses flowing to net income,"" analyst Bill Papanastasiou wrote. The company reported an impairment loss of $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024 because it did not adopt new FASB rules. One of the most important criteria for joining the S&P 500 index is positive net earnings in the last quarter and the sum of the previous four quarters, the report said. Strategy has the ""largest bitcoin treasury held by a public operating company,"" , and the company has a number of tools it could use to expand its BTC stack, KBW said. In the longer term, there is also the opportunity for Strategy to generate yield on-chain from applications built on the Bitcoin network, the bank said. The development of applications on top of the Bitcoin network could result in a massive value unlock, as it is the most secure, decentralized and valuable public blockchain, the report added.

In other words, the fusion of AI with DeFi is gaining traction in the crypto market as it can simplify on-chain interactions for non-crypto users with the help of AI agents. The agents can potentially handle the entire workflow: from moving tokens across networks or swapping them to more complex tasks like identifying secure bridge protocols, optimizing swap routes, and even creating a liquidity pool on a lending platform. This, at least ideally, would reduce the anxiety (and burden) often associated with complex DeFi operations. But DeFAI is barely in its infancy, and many of these projects are evidently quite experimental. Nevertheless, this new narrative has become one of the hottest trends in the crypto space, with market analysts and researchers believing it could bring billions of dollars into the ecosystem. Let’s find out what DeFAI is, how it works, and some top projects leading the ranks. Quick Navigation What is DeFAI? Top DeFAI Projects in 2025 Griggain (GRIFFAIN) PAAL AI Hey Anon AI16Z Mode Network Orbit Neur Autonolas Gekko AI Closing Thoughts: Top DeFAI Projects in 2025 What is DeFAI? DeFAI, also known as AiFi, AgentFi, is one of the fastest-growing crypto ecosystems. Fun fact: it’s already a one billion dollar market, according to CoinGecko data. Several projects are leading the charge, leveraging natural language processing and AI-driven automation to redefine user interaction and efficiency in DeFi: Source: CoinGecko So, where’s the value proposition, and what’s the TLDR? Right now, using DeFi often means jumping between different apps, connecting wallets, and manually entering all the details for every transaction. No matter how innovative, the average user experience in DeFi is often poor because it’s complicated and easy to mess up. DeFAI changes that by letting users use simple commands like, “Swap 3 ETH for USDC” or “Invest in a liquidity pool” to an AI agent that will figure out all the details for, such as finding the best rates or options. All they have to do is approve the final action. This makes using DeFi as easy as sending a text message. It’s like having ChatGPT for crypto. Users just tell a smart assistant to handle all the steps of a complicated task. For example, users might say, “Move my ETH to another network, swap some of it for USDC, and use it to earn rewards in a liquidity pool.” The AI agent will take care of everything: Choosing the best tools for each step. Making sure it’s secure and cost-effective. Sending the results back to your wallet. DeFAI makes DeFi easier to use, even for beginners. It handles the hard parts, helps users avoid costly mistakes, and saves time as well. With tools like simple commands, smart assistants, and instant research, it opens the door for more people to take advantage of decentralized finance without feeling lost or overwhelmed. Below are some of the top DeFAI projects that are currently trending in the crypto community. Top DeFAI Projects in 2025 Griffain (GRIFFAIN) Griffain was built on the Solana blockchain by Tony Plasencia , a veteran developer on Solana known for projects like Backan Underdog and Blink.fun. Source: Griffain Griffain offers several types of agents, which are divided into two categories: Personal agents : customizable models that can search for data, complete general tasks, and interact with blockchain applications. Special agents : are more advanced agents that can perform complex tasks, such as providing an in-depth analysis and reports on crypto narratives and trends, delivering news on crypto, simulating complex conversations in different languages, and much more. All agents have one thing in common: they are designed to execute on-chain actions through natural language commands. For example, they can carry out copy trading, create memecoins from scratch, automate trading processes like profit-taking strategies, or just be your virtual assistant. The platform is a user-friendly gateway for simplifying complex on-chain activities, making it a pioneer in natural language-driven DeFi applications. PAAL AI Source: PaalAI PAAL AI is an Ethereum-based DeFAI platform that offers a wide range of advanced AI-powered features, including AI-powered chatbots and assistants: MyPaalBot : A personalized assistant that can act as a chatbot, moderator, researcher, and even community manager. It’s the most basic type of agent, but it can provide tailored insights and recommendations for different tasks. AutoPaal : A more advanced research and analysis tool that can be used to gain an edge with market insights and predictions for cryptocurrency projects and coins. PaalX : A decentralized in-chat trading feature enabling users to swap tokens, manage wallets, and view portfolios without leaving the chat interface. The platform supports multimodal AI capabilities, processing information from text, images, audio, and video. This functionality enhances crypto analysis and aids in informed decision-making. Another perk of PAAL is how customizable their AI agents are. Users can train their agents using their own custom datasets. Their multimodal capabilities allows them to understand and respond to different types of inputs, making them quite versatile in different applications. Hey Anon Hey Anon (ANON) is a multi-chain DeFAI project deployed on Sonic, Solana, Base, and Arbitrum. It focuses on natural language transaction interfaces, autonomous DeFi agents, and research tools. Source: Hey Anon The project has gained significant attention, partly due to its controversial founder, Daniele Sesta , who is known for creating multi-billion-dollar protocols like Spell and Wonderland in previous cycles. Hey Anon plans to open its public beta by the end of January, supported by a $20 million AI Agent Fund from DWFlabs. So far, detailed features are scarce, but the project seeks to streamline DeFi interactions using AI-powered tools. As per its whitepaper, Hey Anon agents can be used for cross-chain interactions through LayerZero, get accurate price data through Pyth Network, and even borrow and earn using lending protocols like Aave. As per CoinGecko data, it’s the third largest DeFAI project by market capitalization, exceeding $180M as of January 13th. AI16Z AI16Z is self-described as “the first investment DAO led by AI agents.” The project combines AI with decentralized governance to make autonomous investment decisions, which are carried out by an AI agent called Marc AIndressen. Sourec: AI16Z While it has no relation to the VC firm Andresseen Horowitz (a16z), the agent is trained on data available about its co-founder, Marc Andresseen. Marc operates as the central intelligence within the AI16Z ecosystem, managing a $28 million asset pool, and you can check the breakdown here . Moreover, the agent bases its decisions on a combination of data-driven analysis and inputs from token holders, who can also pitch investment ideas. Token holders with significant stakes in the ai16z token can influence the AI’s decisions via a mechanism called the “Virtual Marketplace of Trust,” which determines the credibility of user contributions. At the core of AI16Z is ElizaOS , a framework that enables the creation of AI agents tailored for specific tasks. ElizaOS has gained significant traction, becoming one of the fastest-growing repositories on GitHub and surpassing projects like Google Gemini in Stars History, an important popularity metric. The team is also considering launching an AI agent creation platform, similar to Pump.fun, using AI16Z as the primary currency, which became the first of its kind to reach a market cap of over $2B in the Solana network. Mode Network Mode Network brings AI-driven automation to Ethereum Layer-2s (L2), building a fully AI-operated DeFi economy. It’s one of the largest ecosystems with roughly 129 AI agents that have collectively executed over 1,600 DeFi transactions. Source: Mode Network Some of these agents include: Arma by Giza : Optimizes USDC yield farming. Brian : Enables natural language execution of transactions and smart contract deployments. Sturdy : Aggregates and optimizes returns using AI-powered yield-bearing vaults. MODIUS by Olas: Supports launching or co-owning AI agents for liquidity farming strategies. Amplifi : Provides cross-chain liquidity and AI optimization for maximizing returns. Orbit Orbit (GRIFT) allows users to interact with protocols across over 100 chains, including all EVM-compatible networks and layer-1s like Solana , Aptos , Sui Network , and even Bitcoin. Source: Orbit It was developed by SphereOne , a crypto payment platform that raised $2.5 million in 2023. Orbit simplifies cryptocurrency onboarding and on-chain actions using AI agents, allowing users to perform key actions like: Swap and bridge tokens and bridge assets across several chains Stake to maximize returns using an advanced AI strategy Lend and borrow cryptocurrencies to earn interest or access liquidity Manage portfolios through an AI agent that can track, gather, analyze data, and optimize positions and strategies. Neur Neur is an intelligent copilot for Solana, focusing on natural language interfaces for DeFi. Source: Neur The project leverages cutting-edge AI power from some of the most advanced models, including Claude 3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o, using it to monitor and analyze Solana-based data in real-time and perform automated actions. The cherry on top is that users can connect Neur with practically every Solana dApp. Its GitHub presence has grown despite being in beta, earning 350 stars. So far, the project incentivizes developers to contribute to its security and features through bounties. Yet, early Access requires a fee of 1 SOL, providing limited functionality during this phase. Autonolas Founded in 2021, Autonolas (OLAS) is a robust AI and crypto platform with a simple purpose: creating autonomous AI agents that can decentralize AI-driven economies to serve human needs. Source: Autonolas Autonolas provides a robust framework for developing and managing autonomous AI systems through its Olas Stack and Olas Protocol, which provide the foundation for creating, deploying, and co-owning the AI agents. The project’s architecture is built around the following core components: Agent Services : Independent programs working together to achieve specific goals. Composable Autonomous Apps : Extendable and modular applications that can be combined to create more complex systems. On-Chain Protocol : Ensures the security of agent services while incentivizing developers to contribute code. Moving on, Autonolas’ agents are quite versatile, making them useful for several tasks and protocols, including but not limited to Automated Portfolio Management : AI agents can manage and rebalance investment portfolios, optimizing returns while reducing manual oversight. DAO Governance Participation : Services like Governatooorr enable AI agents to engage in decision-making processes within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Payroll Management for DAOs : AI agents can streamline payroll operations, ensuring efficient and error-free fund distribution. Cross-Chain Operations : The technology supports complex workflows across multiple blockchains, maintaining seamless operation for diverse tasks.

Its AI-driven trading system monitors and interprets market trends 24/7, executing trades based on real-time data and predefined strategies. Users can also take advantage of Axal’s Autopilot system to create custom trading agents tailored to their specific needs and risk preferences. Closing Thoughts: Top DeFAI Projects in 2025 The fusion of DeFi and AI could become the next catalyst for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole just by simply leveraging the rise of AI agents to streamline traditionally complex on-chain processes. DeFAI is simple: reduce the steep learning curve of DeFi with AI Agents. Whether automating workflows, optimizing transactions, or enabling interactions with natural language just like ChatGPT, this innovation could transform how users tap into the blockchain and DeFi worlds. However, notice this sector is quite young, and most projects haven’t fully established themselves with finished, or fully shipped products. It’s very early, but the ecosystem is growing exponentially, with many market analysts predicting significant growth in the coming years. The post What is DeFAI?

A small group of 10 wallets holds over 61% of SHIB’s supply, meaning their moves could trigger sharp market shifts, either through heavy selling or strategic accumulation. Underwater SHIB Investors Pile up The cryptocurrency market correction seen on February 3 has sent shockwaves across the entire sector, with multiple leading altcoins taking the biggest blow. The popular meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) was among the worst affected, experiencing a weekly price collapse of approximately 20%. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Unsurprisingly, the plunge has resulted in an increased percentage of investors currently sitting on paper losses. According to IntoTheBlock, that share has surged to over 57%, while 41% are still in the green. As of writing these lines, less than 2% are break-even. It is worth mentioning that the percentage is still far from the worrying figures registered in September 2023. Back then, almost 90% of the SHIB holders were underwater. One element suggesting that the meme coin may experience enhanced volatility in the future, hence changing the share of people sitting on paper profits, is the high level of centralization. As CryptoPotato reported , more than 61% of the total supply is controlled by 10 wallets. If those whales decide to dump their holdings, the excess of tokens on the market could cause a sharp decline of the valuation. On the other hand, if they accumulate en masse, it might signal confidence in the project, leading to more people joining the ecosystem and upward pressure on the SHIB price. Are Bulls Ready to Step Up ? Several factors indicate that SHIB may soon return to the green track. One of those is the further advancement of the layer-2 blockchain solution, Shibarium. Most recently, total transactions processed on the network surpassed 900 million. The protocol’s main goal is to enhance the development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, and according to some industry participants, its progress could benefit the underlying token. Next on the list is the partnership between the meme coin project and the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure of the United Arab Emirates. The entities shook hands earlier this week, aiming to transform how nations embrace Web3. “For the first time, a world government is integrating blockchain at a federal level. This isn’t just another crypto partnership – it’s a nationwide movement unifying Shiba Inu’s Operating System across all Emirates,” the announcement reads. High-profile partnerships of this type can make Shiba Inu more attractive to investors, positioning it as more than just a speculative asset. Last but not least , we will touch upon the meme coin’s burn rate, which has exploded by over 1,000% in the past 24 hours. The program’s ultimate goal is to reduce the circulating supply of SHIB, potentially making it more valuable via scarcity.

So why is everyone pulling Ethereum out of derivatives exchanges? And is it setting the stage for a major $ETH bull run and a boost for the best presales? It just might be. As investors move $ETH off derivatives exchanges and into spot – or straight into cold storage – it reduces selling pressure on the asset. At the same time, it gives investors a bit more flexibility and control over their $ETH, indicating that many investors seem to be preparing for a major, positive Ethereum price move. Against that positive news, $ETH is down in recent days. But it increasingly feels like Ethereum holders are simply waiting for the tide to change, and for $ETH to follow $BTC when it moves up again. Other positive news – such as the potential approval of $ETH staking – adds weight to that impression. As the market poises for big moves, here are the best presales ready for crazy gains in 2025. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Four Meme Indexes, Four Ways to Gain Meme Index knows that following the memecoin markets can be a bit crazy. So to make it simpler, $MEMEX deploys four separate indexes, each designed to appeal to a different kind of memecoin investor. True degens will love the Meme Frenzy index, loaded with volatility and potential for crazy gains Investors on the hunt for the next big thing should find the Meme Midcap index appealing, aimed at emerging, largely unproven projects More risk-adverse meme coin fans will be drawn to the Meme Moonshot index; lots of room to grow, but more of a track record And traders who want only the biggest and best meme coins can follow the Meme Titan index Indexes are nothing new in the stock market, but Meme Index is the world’s first decentralized meme coin index. That makes the project incredibly appealing as a memecoin with genuine utility baked-in. Join the Meme Index presale here. PEPETO ($PEPETO) – Divine Frog Memecoin with 344% Staking Rewards Pepeto takes Pepe’s origin story to a whole new level, giving the green frog a history tracing back to the beginning of civilization. Not that it matters too much – at its heart, $PEPETO is a super-powered Pepe memecoin with added utility. Purchase $PEPETO during the presale (current token price: $0.000000109), and you’ll be able to stake your tokens for an impressive 344% staking rewards. Early investors will be able to maximize their rewards in preparation for the full launch when the presale ends. The launch roadmap includes a multi-chain bridge and a native exchange, giving the memecoin invaluable real-world utility, and positioning it as a new cryptocurrency project with some interesting potential. Mind of Pepe ($MIND) – Pepe Gets AI Agent Superpowers MIND launches Pepe into the rare and wonderful world of AI, empowering an automated AI agent on X with memecoin momentum. The MIND agent will analyze and respond to messages on social media, gain insights into the market, and eventually deliver high-value alpha tips exclusively to $MIND token holders. The techmap for MIND goes even further, envisioning a future where MIND of Pepe trades its own tokens and even launches new ones! It’s a whole new world for Pepe and the legions of memecoin traders who follow him. The $MIND token presale already passed the $5.3M mark, with a current token price of $0.0032792. Follow the MIND of Pepe presale page . Litechain ($LCAI) – Proof of Intelligence to Revolutionize AI Adoption Litechain is another ambitious project with its sights set on far more than creating a successful token. In fact, the $LCAI token presale is only the first step on a roadmap that sees the full development of a blockchain with AI in every aspect. Proof of Intelligence rewards nodes that perform AI computations, making contributions to AI development the bedrock of the ecosystem. Artificial Virtual Intelligence Machine (AIVM) functions as the fundamental computation layer and a living, dynamic entry – not simply a static system. The Lightchain.ai project has raised over $15M in its presale, demonstrating the power and appeal of the crypto and AI marriage. With AI projects potentially garnering increased investor interest due to the latest developments , Litechain stands to be one of the best gainers this year. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Final Chance for Hedge Fund Pepe Wall Street Pepe doesn’t need your support. He knows what’s in the bank ($70M+), and how much power that gives him – and all the early investors who joined him. But it’s entirely possible that you might need $WEPE. The $WEPE community is poised to ride the incredibly successful presale to new heights, delivering token insights and winning plays to a dedicated core of token holders who want to learn true Wall Street savvy. And there’s only days left in the current presale; it’s now or never to learn how to buy Wall Street Pep e and join the $WEPE Army. The presale token allocation could sell out early, so don’t wait. Visit the Wall Street Pepe presale . Pending Ethereum Moves Push Presales Higher These five presales, all ERC-20 tokens, stand to benefit when $ETH makes its next run, pulling the entire Ethereum ecosystem upwards. As always, do your own research – this isn’t financial advice, so make sure you know what you’re investing in; crypto is always volatile. But the market looks set for big moves – so don’t delay.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-07 13:51:51

That’s precisely what has been created, the Bitcoin Everything Indicator. Recently added to Bitcoin Magazine Pro, this indicator aims to consolidate multiple metrics into a single framework, making Bitcoin analysis and investment decision-making more streamlined. For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: The Official Bitcoin EVERYTHING Indicator Why We Need a Comprehensive Indicator Investors and analysts typically rely on various metrics, such as on-chain data, technical analysis, and derivative charts. However, focusing too much on one aspect can lead to an incomplete understanding of Bitcoin’s price movements. The Bitcoin Everything Indicator attempts to solve this by integrating key components into one clear metric. Figure 1: The new Bitcoin Everything Indicator. View Live Chart 🔍 The Core Components of the Bitcoin Everything Indicator Bitcoin's price action is deeply influenced by global liquidity cycles, making macroeconomic conditions a fundamental pillar of this indicator. The correlation between Bitcoin and broader financial markets, especially in terms of Global M2 money supply , is clear. When liquidity expands, Bitcoin typically appreciates. Figure 2: Global Liquidity cycles have had a major influence on BTC price action. View Live Chart 🔍 Fundamental factors like Bitcoin’s halving cycles and miner strength play an essential role in its valuation. While halvings decrease new Bitcoin supply, their impact on price appreciation has diminished as over 94% of Bitcoin’s total supply is already in circulation. However, miner profitability remains crucial. The Puell Multiple, which measures miner revenue relative to historical averages, provides insights into market cycles. Historically, when miner profitability is strong, Bitcoin tends to be in a favorable position. Figure 3: BTC miner profitability has been an accurate gauge of network health.

The MVRV Z-Score , for example, compares Bitcoin’s market cap to its realized cap (average purchase price of all coins). This metric identifies accumulation and distribution zones, highlighting when Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. Figure 4: The MVRV Z-Score has historically been one of the most accurate cycle metrics. View Live Chart 🔍 Another critical on-chain metric is the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) , which examines the profitability of coins being spent. When Bitcoin holders realize massive profits, it often signals a market peak, whereas high losses indicate a market bottom. Figure 5: SOPR gives insight into real-time realized investor profits and losses.

View Live Chart 🔍 How the Bitcoin Everything Indicator Works By blending these various metrics, the Bitcoin Everything Indicator ensures that no single factor is given undue weight. Unlike models that rely too heavily on specific signals, such as the MVRV Z-Score or the Pi Cycle Top, this indicator distributes influence equally across multiple categories. This prevents overfitting and allows the model to adapt to changing market conditions. Figure 8: The most influential factors impacting the price of bitcoin. Historical Performance vs. Buy-and-Hold Strategy One of the most striking findings is that the Bitcoin Everything Indicator has outperformed a simple buy-and-hold strategy since Bitcoin was valued at under $6. Using a strategy of accumulating Bitcoin during oversold conditions and gradually selling in overbought zones, investors using this model would have significantly increased their portfolio's performance with lower drawdowns. Figure 9: Investing using this metric has outperformed buy & hold since 2011. For instance, this model maintains a 20% drawdown compared to the 60-90% declines typically seen in Bitcoin’s history. This suggests that a well-balanced, data-driven approach can help investors make more informed decisions with reduced downside risk. Conclusion The Bitcoin Everything Indicator simplifies investing by merging the most critical aspects influencing Bitcoin’s price action into a single metric. It has historically outperformed buy-and-hold strategies while mitigating risk, making it a valuable tool for both retail and institutional investors.

Undeterred demand for $BTC at $98K also means the crypto market has remained fairly unfazed during the recent turbulence. Another factor driving optimism is the way $BTC is respecting the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), which is steadily moving upwards. Combined with the massive support being provided by the $92,500 level and $BTC’s RSI level also looking bullish, a breakout and then a rally looks imminent. Overall, the market is very optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, which is why this may be the perfect time to invest in some crypto presales that could explode in the coming weeks. Here are the top 5 to get you started: 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Overall Best Crypto Presale for 100x Returns Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has crossed $70M (yep, you read that right) in presale funding, stamping its authority as the biggest and best crypto presale to buy into right now. The hype for this frog-inspired meme coin is partly owing to the way it aims to solve inequality in the crypto markets, empowering small traders with the intel they need to take on the industry whales. $WEPE will give token holders unique, real-time, and actionable market insights, trading calls, and investment strategies, all within a vibrant trading community. With any luck, this means they’ll no longer have to suffer at the hands of institutional investors who use insider info to gain the edge in the markets. In the pro-crypto Trump administration, $WEPE’s demand will only increase as more new traders join the ‘Frog Army’ in hopes of becoming a profitable crypto player. Join the $WEPE revolution for just $0.0003665 a token. The presale ends in just 9 days, so interested investors should act now. Here’s how to buy $WEPE . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Solana Layer 2 Solution Solaxy ($SOLX) is hands down one of the best cryptos to invest in right now. This is thanks to its revolutionary mission to make the Solana network more efficient, low-cost, and faster than ever. You see, even though Solana has had an impressive run of late – beating Ethereum in monthly revenue and posting the best quarter for any blockchain in history – several issues are holding it back. These include network congestion and limited scalability, which can lead to failed transactions. By executing transactions off-chain and combining Ethereum’s liquidity and Solana’s efficiency, Solaxy ($SOLX) will breathe new life into Solana. Investing in the $SOLX presale (which has already raised a staggering $18.5M) would mean backing one of the best blockchains, Solana, plus one of the key factors that’s going to drive its future success. You can get 1 $SOLX for $0.001628, but the price will increase in the next few hours as the presale enters its next stage. For more info, here’s a guide on how to buy $SOLX . 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Changes the Way You Invest in Meme Coins Meme Index ($MEMEX) is a one-of-a-kind crypto project that will change the way people invest in meme coins. It offers various meme coin indexes, whose prices depend on the cumulative performance of the coins that make up the index. That’s exactly how stock market indexes work! You can invest in one or more of four meme coin baskets, depending on your risk tolerance. Titan : Made up of well-established cryptos like $DOGE, $PEPE, and $SHIB, it’s the least risky and offers comparatively low but steady returns. Moonshot : It contains high-potential trending crypto coins that could break into the top 10 biggest cryptos in the world. Midcap : This includes meme coins with a market cap between $50-250M. It’s a bit riskier than the two above, but also more rewarding. Frenzy : This index comprises potential 100x meme coins, tailored for aggressive investors. As the crypto economy’s first project that allows meme coin investors to diversify risk , $MEMEX looks poised for growth – and over $3.4M in presale funding proves investors agree. You can buy it now for only $0.0159713 per token. 4. YourTrump ($YTP) – The Next $TRUMP? Whether you capitalized on the official $TRUMP madness, $YTP could very well be the second lightning strike. This is because, like Official Trump, YourTrump also derives its value from Donald Trump’s popularity. $YTP’s price depends on how many followers Trump has on his X profile. The number is currently just shy of 100M. The presale offers a tantalizing proposition as the token’s expected listing price is over 125x of what you can buy it now for (just $0.0572). Plus, with top industry players such as the Standard Chartered banking group expecting the next four years to be bullish for Bitcoin (and crypto overall), $YTP could easily be among the top gainers. 5. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) – Combining AI & Blockchain Unlike other AI crypto projects , $LCAI doesn’t just take advantage of existing AI solutions. It aims to lend a hand in the technology’s development, especially regarding how it interacts with blockchains. Lightchain AI combines a revolutionary consensus mechanism, Proof of Intelligence (PoI), and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) to build more secure blockchains. To this end, token holders will be rewarded free $LCAI tokens for completing tasks such as inference, model training, and computations that are crucial to AI development. Even better, if you’re an $LCAI holder, you’ll also get a say in the project’s development. $LCAI’s presale numbers are nothing short of outstanding. It’s raised over $15M at the time of writing, which goes to show just how much investors are responding to this AI-crypto partnership. You can get 1 $LCAI for $0.006 if you get in now. This makes it one of the top cryptos under $1 right now. Bottom Line Now that we’ve pointed you towards the best presales as Bitcoin prepares for a break-out, we’d like to once more reiterate the importance of risk management and due diligence in crypto investing. None of the above is meant to be financial advice, and you should always do your own research before parting with your hard-earned money.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|SOL,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-07 13:57:42

Tron ( TRX ) price dropped to $0.2290 on Friday, but several fundamental and technical factors point to an eventual rebound. TokenTerminal data shows that Tron is now the second-largest fee earner in the crypto industry after Tether. So far this year, it has generated $330 million in fees, compared to Tether’s $430 million. Tron’s fees surpasses that of Ethereum ( ETH ), which has generated $172 million this year while Solana ( SOL ) generated $278 million. This growth is largely driven by Tron’s expanding presence in the stablecoin market. Its stablecoin market cap has surged to over $61 billion, while its transfer volume on Thursday alone was around $100 billion . The number of USDT holders on Tron has also continued to grow, reaching over 60.4 million. Some of the fees generated on Tron are distributed to the network’s validators and holders through staking. According to StakingRewards , Tron’s staking yield stands at 4.5%, higher than Ethereum’s 3.12% and Sui’s 2.54%. You might also like: Berachain mainnet launches on Bitget Wallet with airdrop rewards Beyond staking, other fundamental factors could drive TRX’s price higher in the coming months. Tron’s circulating supply has been steadily declining as more TRX tokens are burned than minted, creating a deflationary effect. The total number of TRX tokens in circulation has dropped to 86.11 billion, down from 86.15 billion a month ago. Additionally, Tron’s network activity has been increasing. On Thursday, there were over 7 million transactions, up from 5.4 million a week earlier. This growth has pushed the cumulative transaction count past 9.56 billion. Tron price wedge points to a strong rebound Tron price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that TRX has been forming a pattern of lower lows and lower highs since December. This pullback has created a falling wedge pattern, with two converging trend lines. Historically, a falling wedge signals a potential breakout as the price nears the point of convergence. Tron has also found support at the 200-day exponential moving average, which it has failed to break below this month. This suggests that bears are reluctant to push the price lower. Given these factors, TRX could see a strong bullish breakout in the coming weeks, with a potential target at its all-time high of $0.4485—an increase of about 96% from its current level. However, a drop below the 200-week moving average would invalidate this bullish outlook.

Base network organic growth and leading metrics in transactions and stablecoin transfer volume highlight its sustained success compared to other L2 networks. Despite positive Q4 projections, Coinbase's reliance on consumer transaction volume and high valuation multiples pose long-term challenges. Stablecoin growth, particularly USDC, presents a compelling long-term investment thesis for Coinbase, though current headwinds prevent a buy recommendation. With Coinbase ( COIN ) set to release the company's full-year earnings performance on February 13th, industry analysts are expecting $1.7 billion in top-line revenue: COIN Earnings Estimate (Seeking Alpha) For Q4 2024, Coinbase previously guided for $505-580 million in Subscription and Services Revenue and also noted an estimated $190 million in October transaction revenue. While the company typically cautions against using any single month surge in transaction revenue to extrapolate a full quarter of performance in the segment, we now have third-party volume estimates for the rest of the quarter and I suspect transaction revenue in Q4 is going to be quite good. In this article, I'll give my revenue estimates for Q4, we'll look at on-chain data for Coinbase's Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) scaling chain Base, and we'll compare Base to Solana ( SOL-USD ) in the all-important stablecoin market. The latter of which may have long-term implications for the future of payments technology. Q4 Earnings Preview While Coinbase guiding transaction revenue quarter to quarter can be dubious and genuinely unknowable, we can build our own estimates based on Coinbase transaction volume from third-party data providers: Transactions Volume Estimated Revenue October $62,500 $193.75 November $175,790 $544.95 December $191,870 $594.80 Estimated Q4 Transaction Rev at 0.31% margin $1,333.5 Source: The Block, dollars in millions If we take the total transaction volume metrics from Q4 via The Block and apply Q3's 0.31% margin on total transaction volume, we get a full quarter transaction revenue estimate of over $1.3 billion. Accepting just the middle range of Coinbase's Subscription & Service Revenue guidance from the last earnings release and adding $542.5 million to that transaction revenue, we get a net revenue figure of nearly $1.9 billion in the quarter before diving into additional segments. Based on this alone, I think COIN beats top-line revenue estimates for Q4 by at least 12%. However, this may actually be undershooting the company's results in Q4 because I suspect revenue from stablecoins and revenue from Base sequencer fees will both outperform their Q3 numbers. Base L2 Data In my personal opinion, Coinbase's position as a publicly traded company and reluctance to issue a chain-native token to this point have allowed the Base network to grow more organically than competing L2 networks. In the past, we've seen L2 chains like Base enjoy explosive early growth from a user base that seems generally more interested in farming for future token airdrops. No such promise seems to exist with Base. Thus, my view is that this growth is more sustainable than what we've seen from other networks in the past. And network usage picked up considerable steam in Q4: Base 'GDP' (Token Terminal) Base's aggregated 'GDP' in the fourth quarter came in at $184 million, with Base 'fees' of $26.4 million. This is important because the company runs the transaction sequencer on Base and derives revenue from those transaction fees. Coinbase categorizes revenue from its Base ecosystem as 'other transaction revenue' in its quarterly reporting. That revenue segment produced $34 million during Q3 despite just $79.3 million in Base GDP during that timeframe. My own estimation of Q4 revenue from the Base ecosystem based on these third-party metrics puts 'other transaction revenue' somewhere between $52 and $72 million. Potentially bringing transaction revenue in Q4 right up to $1.4 billion. Over the last year, Base has quickly become the top scaling network in the L2 space as measured by important metrics like transactions, stablecoin transfer volume, and daily active addresses: DAAs, ETH Scaling Networks (Artemis) The Artemis chart above shows Base daily active addresses in blue by month. From about 3k DAAs during the month of the chain's June 2023 launch, Base just ended January with 1.2 million DAAs on average each day. This marked the 6th consecutive month leading the ETH L2 networks in the metric. While other L2 chains have seen explosive growth fizzle out quickly through the years, all indications to this point are that Base has turned into the ETH scaling winner on a consistent basis: ETH L2s, Monthly Transactions (Artemis) Q4 transactions totaled over 664.1 million. 2025 is off to a terrific start as well, with Base's 329.7 million transactions in January totaling more than every other blockchain in the chart above combined. Coinbase's Stablecoin Growth Stablecoin Transfer Volume (Artemis) And one of the most important metrics that I see for Base going forward is stablecoin transfer volume - here we see a chart that looks almost hockey stick-like. What's important to know here is the $895 billion in stablecoin transfer volume on Base in the month of December was actually more than Ethereum's mainnet, but still ways behind Solana's $2.3 trillion. Base and Solana are natural peers here because they are similarly low transaction fee chains, developed by US-based companies, and are reliant on the same stablecoin for most of the supply: Stablecoin Footprint By Chain (DeFi Llama) With just under $4 billion in stablecoin supply on Base, the L2 chain comes in at number five among all blockchains in the market. Additionally, the chain is absolutely dominated by stablecoin USDC ( USDC-USD ) which accounts for 92% of stable share on the chain. It's important to note that stablecoins like USDC are typically backed by short-term US treasuries. This means that Coinbase's revenue from stablecoins is at risk of going down as yields on T-bills decline. However, that decline in rates can and likely will be offset in Q4 by growth in USDC supply: Stablecoin Supply By Token (Defi Llama) In the chart above, the pink line is Tether ( USDT-USD ) and the blue line is USDC. While Tether is clearly still the dominant stablecoin in the market at $142 billion in total supply, USDC is solidly in second place with over $55 billion in total supply. From the beginning of Q4 to the end, USDC stablecoin supply grew from $35.2 billion to $43.9 billion. And to be clear, this supply benefits COIN whether it lives on the Base blockchain or not. The token's T-bill reserves benefit owners of USDC's issuer Circle - of which Coinbase is one . Thus, regardless of the chain where USDC is moving around, the simple fact that supply is growing at all helps COIN shareholders. Given the 24.7% supply growth in USDC from the end of Q3 to Q4, I think it's nearly a certainty that Coinbase's Q4 stablecoin revenue will grow for the 4th consecutive quarter. Valuation & Ongoing Concerns Given all this, I expect Q4-24 revenue to be somewhere in the ballpark of $2 billion for Coinbase. Perhaps more importantly, early data from Q1 does not indicate a dramatic drop-off in activity if transaction volume, Base usage, or stablecoin supply growth are a sign of what is to come for the rest of the quarter. Still, even if we annualized Coinbase's Q4 revenue estimate of $2 billion, the company still trades at over 8.6x forward sales - more than double the 2.9 sector median in the financials. COIN Revenue Sources (Coinbase, Author's Calculations) Furthermore, I still see the very existence of Base being something of an admission of a long-term problem; namely, Coinbase is still highly reliant on consumer transaction volume for top-line revenue, but that cohort has continued to see its share of Coinbase's total volume decline from over 80% in Q1-18 down to just 18.4% last quarter: Share of Volume (The Block) I have a hard time believing the company will be able to meaningfully grow retail share of volume given the availability of spot ETFs at such drastically lower upfront fees . If Coinbase was generating a large portion of sales volume from smaller altcoins, I could see this being less of an issue. But Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum, and Solana combined for 62% of the company's transaction revenue in Q3. We already have spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the US. Solana could very well be next under the new administration. Closing Thoughts There is a lot to like about Coinbase in my view. The company's balance sheet is in terrific shape. With $7.7 billion in cash and equivalents against just $4.2 billion total debt, the company's net debt position is negative. In an environment where cash pays 4.3%, I see no reason for Coinbase to get aggressive with this hoard. Furthermore, I'm very bullish on the concept of stablecoins on networks like Base and Solana and my view is the Trump administration is going to let the companies building these networks continue to innovate global payments. In my view, this makes Coinbase a really interesting long term investment idea on the thesis that stablecoins, and specifically USDC, will become a more important part of the global financial system. In spite of that, I'm still not ready to call the company a buy yet given what I view to be headwinds in the company's consumer transaction volume business, but that could change in the future if we see USDC continue to grow in supply and in usage.",ETH-USD|USDC-USD|COIN,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|USDC|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-02-07 14:00:00

After facing recent turbulence, buyers are stepping in to reclaim control, signaling a possible shift in market sentiment. This renewed push comes as Dogecoin finds stability above key support levels, allowing bulls to build upward pressure and challenge higher resistance zones. The growing optimism surrounding Dogecoin is driven by increasing trading volume and improved market conditions, which could fuel an extended rally. If the price continues to climb and breaks through critical resistance barriers, it may set the stage for further upside, reinforcing the bullish outlook. Analyzing DOGE’s Potential For Continued Bullish Growth Currently, Dogecoin is displaying steady bullish momentum as it gradually moves toward the $0.2677 mark. The price action suggests increasing buyer interest, with bulls attempting to sustain upward pressure after overcoming recent consolidation. If this trend continues, DOGE might build the strength to challenge key resistance levels ahead. Related Reading: Dogecoin $10 Price Target Back In Play? Here’s What The Charts Say Despite trading below the 4-hour SMA, DOGE’s price action shows signs of strengthening. With sustained positive movement, the meme coin may gather enough pressure to break through key resistance levels. A successful move above the SMA would confirm a trend shift, opening the door for more upside. Key technical indicators are reinforcing Dogecoin’s steady upward movement, with momentum oscillators signaling increasing strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching the 50% neutral mark, indicating a potential shift in sentiment as buying pressure builds. A move above this level would confirm growing bullish momentum, possibly driving the price higher. Additionally, if the RSI continues its ascent, it implies that Dogecoin is entering a more favorable zone for buyers, reducing the chances of an immediate pullback. When combined with rising trading volume and other indicators, such as a positive MACD crossover, these signals strengthen the case for more growth. Should momentum hold steady, Dogecoin could be on track for a breakout toward key resistance levels, paving the way for a more extended rally. Can Dogecoin Maintain Its Uptrend And Secure A Stronger Rally? If Dogecoin continues its upward momentum, the price could gain traction for a sustained rally. A break above the $0.2677 key resistance level would strengthen the bullish outlook, pushing DOGE toward higher targets such as $0.3066. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crashes 40%, But This Analyst Sees A Bullish Setup Furthermore, bulls maintaining their momentum and driving the price above the 4-hour SMA will see DOGE transitioning toward a positive direction. This move may pave the way for further gains, pushing the price to key resistance levels and extending the ongoing uptrend. However, for the uptrend to remain intact, DOGE must hold above critical support zones and maintain steady buying pressure. Should momentum weaken, a period of consolidation or a minor retracement might occur, causing a price drop to support levels such as $0.1800 before another breakout attempt.

That’s why crypto analysts are tipping Panshibi’s new meme coin revolution as the next biggest thing that outperforms Ethereum and Litecoin. While Ethereum price struggles to stay up and Litecoin fights for relevance, this AI-backed social fi token is gearing up to be this year’s best-performing asset. Its ongoing 60-day presale is the tangible proof; over $620,000 was accrued from over 1,000 investors in mere days. Could a meme coin outperform giants like Ethereum and Litecoin? Let’s find out. Why analysts tip Panshibi for mega gains in 2025 Panshibi has been on top of many analysts’ top-performing tokens this year, and it’s unsurprising. This ultimate meme revolution is taking the meme culture to greatness from the rubles to which speculative assets like DOGE and Shiba Inu reduced the meme culture. At its heart, Panshibi brings the adorable Panda and Asian culture to meme enthusiasts. But Panshibi is more than just a meme coin ; it’s a gateway to limitless possibilities. Its ecosystem is nothing but absolute fun and value. Members have access to a gamified experience with its AI-driven social fi elements. Quests and in-platform missions attract mouthwatering incentives. This incentivized participation extends to its staking program of up to 1200% APY and exclusive VIP membership at the Bamboo Club. Despite being in presale, Panshibi has attracted massive attention. Its ongoing 60-day presale has raised over $620,000 from thousands of investors. Mainstream media and analysts are particularly interested in its explosive potential, which many believe could go 145,000% on tier-one CEX listings. Stage 3 is still on, and the price is discounted to $0.004. The stage is set for another meme revolution and 1000x gains, and Panshibi is leading it. The smart contracts have been audited by Coinsult, and critical allocations have been locked. Ethereum Price Targets New High In 2025: Whale Accumulation And Etf Demand In Focus Ethereum has been teetering on a thin edge for months. The DeFi king has underperformed YTD with just a 15% gain. However, industry experts speculate about a potential breakout as whale accumulation and institutional demand fuel bullish momentum. Whale holdings have steadily recovered from $285 billion to $313 billion in just three days. In fact, data from Arkham Intelligence revealed Trump’s WLFI added a whopping $10 million to its massive ETH holding – a move that coincides with BlackRock’s $250 million investment. This significant accumulation indicates that major players are positioning for a price surge. Right now, Ethereum’s price is hovering around $2,700, days after plummeting to $2,400. However, analysts are eyeing a decisive move to $3,700 – a 37% growth from current levels. Echoing the same sentiment, crypto analyst Ted Pillows recently highlighted a bullish price pattern that could push the price to the $4,000 psychological zone. Why Is Litecoin Struggling Despite Grayscale Ltc Trust Inflow? Litecoin is also at a crossroads. Despite recently clinching an institutional milestone with Grayscale LTC Trust (LTCN), Litecoin’s price is still struggling to maintain upward momentum. Just this week, Quartz reported the Trust pulling in a whopping $70 million increase in net assets, a performance that starkly contrasts the LTC price’s decline of 22% in just seven days. Apart from the broader market downtrend, Litecoin’s struggle stemmed from the stifling competition from more efficient chains. Declining adoption and its fight for relevance have also dampened momentum. One key indicator, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, suggests that Litecoin is in an undervalued zone. Moreover, technical indicators like Parabolic SAR suggest Litecoin could soon break past the $137 resistance level and target $141.15, a meager 31% from its current price of $102. Conclusion Ethereum and Litecoin are battling to maintain their position in the crypto market. But while their grip slips, Panshibi is emerging as analysts’ choice to outperform them with mega gains this year. With its innovative meme coin ecosystem, AI-driven social fi features, and skyrocketing presale success, Panshibi is proving it’s more than a passing trend. The $620,000 already raised in presale speaks volumes about investors’ strong demand and confidence.

The Solana blockchain has attracted significant amounts of inflow from stablecoins and meme coins. In addition, the President of the United States launched his own meme coin, Official Trump ( TRUMP ) on the Solana blockchain . Though understandably controversial, the move did lead to a marked increase in network activity , as well as investor interest. On January 19, the price of Solana reached a peak of $239.31. That rally didn’t last long, however — the price of SOL began receding after January 26. Although there were two attempts to break out to the upside, both were unsuccessful. First, the markets panicked after Trump failed to mention cryptocurrencies in his inauguration speech. Then, market-wide uncertainty on account of the President’s imposition of tariffs caused a risk asset selloff. By press time on February 7, Solana was trading at $199.26 — a level just 3.30% higher than the Solana price seen on January 1 and just under the psychological level of $200. SOL price year-to-date (YTD) chart. Source: Finbold Despite the recent drop, one technical analyst is confident that a rebound is coming — and a pretty significant one, at that. Triple bottom hints that Solana price could skyrocket to $380 Pseudonymous cryptocurrency researcher TradingShot outlined a case for a Solana price surge to $380. The analyst first noted that the digital asset has been trading in a channel-up pattern since the July 29 2024 high. On its own, even that alone would be a bullish setup — but in addition, SOL’s February 3 low doesn’t just represent a higher low on the channel up, but also the third leg of a triple bottom chart pattern on the $182 – $178 support zone. That same low also represents the second leg of a double bottom chart pattern on the 200-day moving average (MA) on the 1-day timeframe, represented by the orange line below. SOL price chart with triple bottom, double bottom, and channel up patterns. Source: TradingShot on TradingView According to the analyst, this demonstrates a high level of demand — and thus, the support level in question is a long-term support level. As such, a bounce from those levels should initiate the next bullish leg of the channel up — much the same way as it happened with the September 6 low. The last time this happened, Solana’s price surged by 119.43%. A corresponding rally from slightly below the support zone would lead to prices around the $380 mark — in other words, roughly 92.58% higher than the current price of SOL.

The ecosystem launches with Partnr Chat , an app that turns AI agents into active participants in users’ everyday lives, and Partnr Vaults , a platform that tokenizes strategies for both user and agent-owned DeFi vaults. Partnr’s ecosystem focuses on agent enablement, a key category at the intersection of crypto and AI as more agent frameworks and AI agents are launched each day. By creating products that help agents create real value and impact for consumers, Partnr connects the dots between the rapidly growing on-chain agent space and the need for more consumer crypto products. “Partnr is a blueprint for how consumer crypto and AI intersect,” said Corey Wilton, CEO of Partnr . “Both crypto and AI still have room to grow when it comes to consumer awareness and user experience. Partnr is building products that compete with the best consumer UI/UX while simultaneously developing infrastructure for agents to build value for their creators.” In Partnr Chat, users can form meaningful connections with AI agent companions that adapt and evolve over time using shared memory to recall past exchanges and deliver increasingly personalized experiences. Crucially, Partnr Chat’s AI Agents are more than passive companions: they are independent entities capable of managing on-chain wallets, and can be created with their own long-term goals and intentions. User interactions refine and shape the agents, and in the future, Partnr will support user-created Agents within the Chat framework. Partnr Vaults allows both users and agents to create powerful tokenized DeFi vaults. Vaults can represent complex DeFi strategies or act as escrows for users and agents to manage funds for depositors while earning a performance fee. Vaults extends the ecosystem’s potential by equipping users with tools to deploy AI agents within decentralized AI finance (DeFAI) application. Partnr’s approach to blending consumer product surfaces with on-chain agent compatibility is unique in consumer AI applications. “Partnr is leading at the intersection of innovation and utility,” said Steve Nguyen, co-founder and CTO of Partnr. “By enabling AI agents to perform automated on-chain tasks with shared memory and long-term learning, we’re giving creators and users the tools they need to experience a whole new range of Web3 applications.” Partnr’s lightweight, web-based design ensures global accessibility, making consumer AI products available to users worldwide. By removing barriers to entry, Partnr is creating a platform that prioritizes inclusivity and broad adoption. Partnr CEO Corey Wilton added : “Accessibility is at the heart of what we’re building. We’re committed to making both consumer crypto and consumer AI products available to anyone, anywhere, while maintaining the high standards of performance and security that Web3 demands.” Partnr is positioned to lead the next wave of AI Agent-driven Web3 innovation.

Here Are the Details",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/as-bitcoin-continues-to-fall-long-term-btc-holders-continue-to-accumulate-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has fallen to a one-year low, but rising demand from long-term holders could point to bullish momentum in the coming months, according to a new analysis by CryptoQuant. Bitcoin Network Activity Drops to 1-Year Low, But Long-Term Holders Are Sending Bullish Signals The firm’s Bitcoin Network Activity Index has fallen 15% since its peak in November 2024 to 3,760 points, its lowest level since February 2024. The index tracks active addresses, transaction counts, block sizes, and fees to measure overall Bitcoin usage. A major driver of the low network activity is the sharp decline in Bitcoin transactions. Daily transactions fell 53% to 346,000 from an all-time high of 734,000 last September. The Bitcoin mempool, a tail of unconfirmed transactions, has fallen from 287,000 in December to 3,000 as of today, marking levels not seen since March 2022. CryptoQuant attributed this slowdown primarily to the decreasing use of the Runes Protocol, a method introduced in April 2024 for issuing tokens directly fungible on Bitcoin. At its peak, the protocol processed 802,000 OP_RETURN code transactions per day, but this figure has now dropped to just 10,000. “The decline in Bitcoin’s network activity can mostly be explained by the collapse in Runes Protocol usage,” CryptoQuant said. Bullish Signals From Long-Term Holders Despite the slowdown in network usage, Bitcoin's price outlook remains positive due to increasing demand from long-term accumulator addresses. These addresses continually accumulate BTC without selling, reducing the available supply and relieving pressure on the sell side. Historically, increases in long-term holders have preceded Bitcoin rallies, strengthening BTC's status as a store of value. While the decrease in on-chain activity raises concerns, the increase in long-term accumulation suggests that Bitcoin may be preparing for its next bullish phase. *This is not investment advice.

Despite attempts, the cryptocurrency has struggled to break the $1 mark. The broader crypto market continues to face bearish trends, which have impacted DOGE’s upward momentum. Investors are questioning whether the digital asset can hit $1 in February. Dogecoin Price Eyes $10 Surge: Will $0.19 Hold the Line? Crypto analyst Ali has shared an optimistic outlook for Dogecoin price, suggesting that if the coin maintains a price above $0.19, it could set the stage for a significant rally. According to analysts, this price level is critical for the potential of a parabolic move toward $10. If Dogecoin remains above this threshold, the setup for a sharp rise remains intact, with the possibility of the coin reaching as high as the ambitious level. Why has DOGE Not Hit $1 Yet? Dogecoin price has struggled to hit the $1 mark despite meme coins gaining mainstream popularity. Unlike newer meme coins, Dogecoin has faced a decline in attention, with many newer tokens overtaking its spotlight. The meme coin market has seen a significant downturn, losing $44 billion in market cap over the last three weeks, now standing at $3.19 trillion. The overall uncertainty in Bitcoin’s price movements has further dampened investor sentiment, with many re-evaluating their positions. Instead of holding on to long-term targets like $10, the focus should shift to shorter-term goals, such as achieving a new all-time high of $1. Can DOGE hit $1 in 2025? The latest DOGE price hovered at $0.25464, showing a notable uptick of 2.72%. The Ripple price recently rebounded off the crucial 200-day SMA, indicating a potential bullish trend for the upcoming months. This bounce suggests the price could soon test key resistance levels and may even target $1 in 2025 under the right market conditions. For the Dogecoin price prediction to hit $1, a few factors need to align. First, it must break through key resistance levels, including the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement at $0.35680. Following this, the asset should aim for the 1 Fibonacci extension at $0.48434 before attempting to approach the $1 mark. The support levels play an equally critical role; the price must maintain stability above the 200D SMA and avoid dipping below the $0.26284 range. The power of 3 setups, used in this analysis, refers to a technical strategy that combines key Fibonacci levels, moving averages, and market trends. When these elements align in a favorable way, the chances of significant price movement increase. In this case, if DOGE continues to follow this setup, breaking through the 50D SMA and maintaining support at $0.26284, it could signal a steady rise toward the $1 target. Source- TradingView To summarize, DOGE hitting $1 in 2025 is possible if it continues to show resilience at current support levels and breaks through resistance. Market sentiment and broader adoption will also play a role in determining whether DOGE can sustain its momentum and reach new price highs.

The introduction of the first-ever XRP ETF is expected to broaden XRP’s appeal, but whales are also turning to alternative blockchains that offer scalable micropayments and decentralized applications. One of the most anticipated projects is Coldware (COLD) , an IoT-powered blockchain designed for ultra-fast, low-cost transactions. With Ripple (XRP) holders looking to expand their investments, Coldware (COLD) ’s micropayment infrastructure is gaining traction as a next-generation blockchain solution. XRP ETF: A Game-Changer or a Short-Term Catalyst? On February 5, 2025, Purpose Investments launched the first-ever spot XRP ETF, marking a historic development in crypto investing. This regulated investment vehicle offers institutional investors a secure and transparent way to gain exposure to Ripple (XRP) without the need for private key management. The key benefits of the XRP ETF include providing institutional access to XRP without direct token ownership, operating within a regulated environment under Canadian standards, and offering market legitimization. The introduction of the XRP ETF may help increase mainstream adoption and stabilize XRP’s long-term price. However, despite strong investor interest, Ripple (XRP) continues to face challenges such as market fluctuations and network limitations, prompting whales to look into decentralized alternatives like Coldware (COLD). Why XRP Whales Are Investing in Coldware (COLD) Coldware (COLD) offers a decentralized blockchain ecosystem driven by IoT technology, distinguishing itself from Ripple (XRP), which focuses primarily on institutional partnerships. XRP investors are particularly drawn to Coldware (COLD) due to its key features, such as near-instant, low-cost micropayments, which make it well-suited for decentralized commerce. Coldware’s IoT integration allows smart devices to interact directly with the blockchain, enabling real-world payment automation. Additionally, Coldware’s decentralized staking system, which allows lightweight nodes to participate, reduces centralization risks seen in traditional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems. Furthermore, Coldware’s distributed architecture ensures scalability without congestion, in contrast to Ripple (XRP), which has experienced network outages. This makes Coldware (COLD) a compelling alternative for XRP whales seeking a more robust, decentralized option. Can Ripple (XRP) Reach New Highs in 2025? Despite recent market downturns, analysts remain optimistic about Ripple (XRP)’s long-term potential, with some predicting that XRP could reach $5 or higher if institutional adoption picks up following the launch of the XRP ETF. Several factors will influence XRP’s price prediction for 2025, including regulatory clarity, particularly with a favorable SEC ruling that could trigger a price rally. Institutional demand, fueled by the XRP ETF, may also boost liquidity. However, the growing competition from new blockchain projects like Coldware (COLD) , which offer decentralized, scalable solutions, could divert investor interest and limit XRP’s potential for growth. The Shift Toward Decentralized IoT Blockchain Networks While Ripple (XRP) continues to grow, a new wave of blockchain technology is emerging. Coldware (COLD) represents the future of decentralized transactions, offering low-cost, high-speed micropayments designed for global accessibility. For XRP whales, the opportunity to diversify into scalable PoS ecosystems like Coldware (COLD) presents a hedge against regulatory risks and network congestion. With institutional players backing both XRP and Coldware (COLD) , these platforms may coexist as leading blockchain solutions, serving different financial needs. In 2025 and beyond, Coldware (COLD)’s IoT-driven network could become a cornerstone of decentralized micropayments, attracting long-term investors seeking efficiency, scalability, and decentralization.

Increased hash rates compared to global have kept Riot's BTC production steady, indicating some operational improvements. Quantum computing poses a significant risk to BTC mining, potentially disrupting Riot's business model and long-term viability. Selling power capacity to AI/HPC companies presents a new revenue opportunity, but its impact on Riot's financial health remains uncertain. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) is a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner I covered over a year ago . Titled, I Doubt It Will Ever Be a Buy , I was very skeptical of its business model and rated it a Sell, summarizing in my conclusion: I believe long-term investors should own a company that can organically generate cash flows and whose business models give them the adaptable traits to continue succeeding. Neither of these seem to be the case for Riot. That means shareholders must either face continued dilution of their equity or will eventually get wiped out. RIOT 1Y Price History (Seeking Alpha) In the year that's passed, RIOT's price has bounced up and down many times, as high as $15 and as low as $7, reflecting the uncertainty that the market feels toward this company. I continue to doubt Riot's ability to produce positive cash flows and create value for shareholders. For that reason, I still do not consider it a Buy. Events of 2024 While Q4 2024 results are yet to be announced, a lot still occurred in 2024. There was the halving in April, which permanently cut the block rewards for mining in half. All else being equal, this made every miner, including Riot, half as productive. Q3 2024 Company Presentation Not everything else was equal, though. As global hash rates grew, Riot's grew significantly faster, making the company more competitive in mining compared to the rest of the world. Crucially, this improvement shows how YoY BTC production held steady when comparing Q3 2024 (first full quarter post-halving) to Q3 2023. Riot is therefore doing something right. Cash Flow Statement (Q3 2024 Form 10-Q) The cash flow situation remained concerning. The first three quarters saw not only negative operating cash flows, but hundreds of millions spent on more equipment. The expense of BTC miners was a major issue I highlighted last time, particularly as they cease to be competitive after a few years and have no use besides mining BTC. Cash Flow Statement (Q3 2024 Form 10-Q) This has required more share dilution to keep the company going, another concern I raised in my previous article. Total shares outstanding rose from 230.8M at the end of 2023 to 324.3M by the end of Q3. RIOT Share Price vs. Market Cap 1Y History (Seeking Alpha) The impact can be most clearly seen by the marginal increase in share price, while the market cap of RIOT has nearly doubled. Without the effect of dilution, RIOT's share price should be $18.84 instead of $11.74. These ATM equity offerings can keep the company solvent, but this is how long-term shareholders eat the cost. The screenshots I provide also show investments in marketable securities. These primarily refer to shares of Bitfarms ( BITF ) that Riot purchased in an attempt to take over that company. I actually don't think it's that impactful to Riot's results, so I won't say much more here, but folks can start with my second article on BITF if they are interested in reading my perspective about it. Riot Press Release If we shift to activity in Q4 that is known, the screenshot above shows how BTC production has similarly kept up with the same months in 2023, in spite of the halving. What is different, however, is that they are holding all their BTC now and now selling it. This continued in December and January . Balance Sheet (Q3 2024 Form 10-Q) Coinciding with this is an adjustment in how Riot prepares their balance sheet. Bitcoin is now reported as a long-term asset, and they no longer represent it as part of their liquid position. BTC 1Y Price History (Seeking Alpha) Considering how BTC more than doubled in the past year, as Trump took a pro-Bitcoin position in the campaign and proceeded to win the election, Riot may believe they'll benefit from holding. The press release for January production suggests that Riot currently holds $1.8B in BTC. Future Outlook As Riot isn't liquidating their BTC, they still need a way to generate cash and remain solvent. They do still receive some revenue, primarily from the mining services they sell to the broader mining community. Income Statement (Q3 2024 Form 10-Q) In spite of this, the company still reports an operating loss and the negative cash outflows I mentioned before. Q3 2024 Company Presentation When Q3 results were released, there was much talk about continued capital projects, at much larger scales than currently exist for the company. I take this to mean that plenty of cash burn is yet to occur. It's worth noting that, in the Q3 earnings call , management discussed a potential future in selling their power capacity to AI/HPC companies: Over the past few quarters, the demand for power assets by both Bitcoin miners and now AI/HPC companies has grown significantly. There is a notable sense of urgency for power access in 2025 with AI/HPC companies willing to pay a premium for timely access at attractive sites. Longer term, we continue to see a robust pipeline of energy assets available to us, and we remain highly active in continuing to evaluate opportunities to enhance our pipeline of power capacity well into the future. Despite no sales or marketing efforts in selling their power capacity, management discussed unsolicited offers from potential customers during Q&A. This could prove to be a much more lucrative way for Riot to make money than the mining business, and as Q4 results come out, we will want to see if there is any progress on this front. Q3 2024 Company Presentation Until this revenue materializes, the cash burn continues. While this slide describes their near-term capex as ""fully funded,"" Riot proceeded with the issuance of more convertible notes in December, which solves the cash problem but contributes to the trend of dilution that I mentioned before. Risk Factor of Quantum Another interesting development in December was something that I don't think any BTC miners were anticipating, but nevertheless created new doubts about their future: quantum computing. Quantum computers, with their computational advantages over classical computers, could change the long-term narrative on cryptocurrencies in a couple of ways. Bitcoin's safety and resilience come from its cryptographic properties, which make it difficult for malicious actors to derive a user's ""key"" to access their BTC. An article from Deloitte describes the bigger threat of BTC theft in clear terms: As long as it takes a quantum computer longer to derive the private key of a specific public key then the network should be safe against a quantum attack. Current scientific estimations predict that a quantum computer will take about 8 hours to break an RSA key, and some specific calculations predict that a Bitcoin signature could be hacked within 30 minutes. This means that Bitcoin should be, in principle, resistant to quantum attacks (as long as you do not reuse addresses). However, as the field of quantum computers is still in its infancy, it is unclear how fast such a quantum computer will become in the future. If a quantum computer will ever get closer to the 10 minutes mark to derive a private key from its public key, then the Bitcoin blockchain will be inherently broken. All one needs to do is imagine quantum being given adequate time to accomplish this. How soon it could happen is debated, but it does throw into question the long-term value of a business such as Riot whose cash flows are currently negative as it is. There's a less scary course of events that could still disrupt miners like Riot. Writing for GSD Venture Studios, Gary Fowler lays it out as such: This rapid mining could also lead to an acceleration of Bitcoin's fixed supply being mined out, undermining the halving schedule that regulates inflation. This would drastically alter the balance between supply and demand, potentially destabilizing Bitcoin's price...If the entire supply is mined faster than anticipated, the market could be flooded with coins, causing a sharp decline in price as demand struggles to keep up. While this wouldn't cause people to be robbed of their BTC, tapping out the finite supply faster than classical computers would give Riot almost nothing to do and render most of this capex pointless. An associated BTC crash would also make their mine-and-hold strategy unlikely to salvage the situation for shareholders. Conclusion My initial appraisal of Riot appears to be mostly correct. Its situation has been mitigated somewhat by its capital investments and a rise in BTC price after Donald Trump got behind the cryptocurrency. Yet, cash flows remain negative, and while selling their power capacity is a new opportunity, it may not be enough. On top of that, the recent boom in quantum computing stocks suggests BTC mining could be entirely disrupted in the not-too-distant future, calling into question the long-term values of the mining business. With about $1.8B in BTC on a $4B market cap, we have to trust that Riot may be worth another $2.2B for however long positive earnings exist. As more share dilution is likely until that occurs, any upside that could occur might not be felt in the individual share. Because of these mixed outlooks, I think it's fair to consider RIOT a Hold and to wait for more confirmation that the upside is likely to materialize.",RIOT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-02-07 15:42:46

Their expectation for the much anticipated $1 target is beginning to be undermined by the recent price action. The same could be said with the market sentiment for Shiba Inu (SHIB), as traders now look for alternatives. However, high utility alternatives like 1Fuel (OFT) are on the way up, with a next-generation crypto wallet. 1Fuel is the best cryptocurrency to invest in with utility and well-aligned incentives, it is set to thrive beyond expectations. This utility has led experts to forecast it would rule DeFi in 2025. Dogecoin: Can DOGE Hit The $1 Target? Dogecoin (DOGE) remains one of the leading cryptocurrencies in crypto discussions as speculation continues to grow about whether or not it eventually manages to achieve $1. Currently, Dogecoin is valued at $0.26. However, if Dogecoin were to hit this mark, it would bring the market cap to around $147.8 billion . This bullish sentiment is additionally driven by the speculation in the market about a potential Dogecoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). DOGE would be integrated into an ETF vehicle so institutional investors are able to instantly get into DOGE, and more financial institutions are afforded the chance to take some stake in this asset. Cryptocurrency insiders are growing more interested in the possibility of a Dogecoin ETF, which can increase market access and adoption for the coin. Shiba Inu: Investors are Optimistic Amidst Volatility Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues its path in a volatile market position as it trades at $0.00001658. Analysts indicate that this year will be of great changes for its value and according to the market trend, it is estimated that its value would be between $0.000007 and $0.00004. However, the growth of user adoption of the ShibaSwap and Shibarium networks could potentially lift the Shiba Inu crypto performance. News from SHIB’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama , about an upcoming partnership has inspired positive sentiment for Shiba Inu crypto investors. The community had been intrigued about this development as many presumed it would prompt price appreciation. This upcoming partnership is watched very closely by investors eyeing the next big price swing for Shiba Inu. 1Fuel: Unparalleled Tokenomics to Ensure Long-Term Viability Beyond memes and vibes, the long term viability of a crypto project hinges a lot on its tokenomics. The new DeFi gem, 1FUEL, is designed in such a way that the right actions are rewarded because the incentive structure rewards actions that contribute to the network's success. This is a question of game theory. It makes for a more active and engaged community when it is aligned perfectly. With up to 30% APR, users are encouraged to hold tokens in their possession as they become more valuable with growing utility, and earn a passive income at the same time. This wallet is an AI driven next generation crypto wallet and addresses one of the major problems new users face when interacting with the blockchain. With 1-click cross-chain transactions, this wallet streamlines crypto transactions across blockchains. Moreover, the P2P exchange service enables users to trade tokens with other users in any part of the world. Each new user adds to the system's network effects. Users gain exposure to multiple assets using the native utility token OFT. Users with physical and virtual cards can spend crypto on everyday purchases. The cards let users make instant crypto-to-fiat transactions. 1FUEL will provide privacy and anonymity by offering anonymous transactions with a built-in privacy mixer. Moreover, it has on-demand wallets that allows users to generate disposable wallets that can be discarded once they are done with it. With cold storage, users can store digital assets offline. Conclusion Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and 1FUEL are the tokens that are attracting the interest of investors who are seeking the best cryptocurrency to buy, and 1FUEL has the potential to offer a 1,000x ROI.

Their hopes for the highly anticipated $1 mark are being shaken by the latest price movements. A similar sentiment surrounds Shiba Inu (SHIB), prompting traders to seek out other options. However, alternatives with significant utility, such as 1Fuel (OFT), are gaining traction, especially with the introduction of a new-generation crypto wallet. 1Fuel emerges as a top choice for those seeking a cryptocurrency with substantial utility and well-matched incentives, poised to exceed expectations. Experts predict that its high utility will help it dominate DeFi by 2025. Dogecoin: Will DOGE Reach the $1 Milestone? Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to be a hot topic in cryptocurrency discussions, as speculation mounts about whether it can finally hit $1. Currently priced at $0.26, reaching this goal would elevate its market cap to approximately $147.8 billion . This optimistic outlook is further fueled by rumors about a potential Dogecoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Integrating DOGE into an ETF would allow institutional investors quick access to DOGE, and offer more financial institutions the opportunity to invest in this asset. The prospect of a Dogecoin ETF is capturing the interest of cryptocurrency insiders, as it could boost market access and adoption for the coin. Shiba Inu: Optimism Persists Despite Market Fluctuations Shiba Inu (SHIB) is navigating a volatile market, currently trading at $0.00001658. Analysts suggest that significant shifts in its value are expected this year, with predictions ranging from $0.000007 to $0.00004 . However, increased user adoption of ShibaSwap and Shibarium networks could enhance Shiba Inu's market performance. Positive sentiment among Shiba Inu investors is fueled by news from SHIB's lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama , regarding an upcoming partnership. This development has sparked curiosity within the community, as many anticipate it will drive a price increase. Investors are closely monitoring this partnership, hoping for a significant price movement for Shiba Inu. 1Fuel: Unique Tokenomics for Sustained Success Beyond just memes, the sustainability of a crypto project heavily relies on its tokenomics.

Like most newly launched tokens, there’s high volatility around BERA, clearly visible in the price performance. It is a concern for investors, especially considering the current market conditions. However, the question is more concerned with its long-term trajectory, as many newly launched tokens have crashed significantly in the last few weeks amid market turbulence. So, how low can Berachain price drop in this context? Let’s discuss. Berachain Price Surged 1400% But Crashed Soon The BERA token entered the market on January 6, following a significant Berachain airdrop and token generation event. Interestingly, it rode the bulls right after launch, as the Berachain price surged 1400%, creating an ATH of $14.99. The Binance listing also played a significant role in this BERA price rally, exposing the token to a broader market and attracting investors’ interest. However, volatility soon took over, with the larger whale taking the profit by shortening the token. As a result, the price has crashed 48.35% since the prime, currently trading at $7.91 with a market capitalization of $849.66M per CoinmarketCap . However, the trading volume is still high at $2.19B, showing high investor activity, including sellers. As a result, bearish momentum has built, which could continue this trajectory if the sellers’ activity remains maintained. How Low Can BEAR Price Crash? The cryptocurrency market is already turbulent, and it quickly caught up with the newly launched Berachain coin. Its nearly 50% drop from its prime within a day raises concerns about its long-term price trajectory, especially as the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coin failed. Both tokens had a bullish start, and many investors bagged heavy profits. However, as these took the liquidity, the remaining meme coins crashed . Eventually, the TRUMP meme coins hype settled with time, pushing them into an 80-90% consolidation from their prime. As a result, TRUMP’s price declined from $75.35 to $17.60, whereas MELANIA’s dropped from $13.73 to $1.51. Most newly launched tokens go through a similar process, especially with the top crypto exchange listings. If the same pattern followed, the Berachain price could crash similarly due to high volatility and market sentiments. Comparative analysis indicates that the BERA price could hit bottom at $1.90 Disclaimer: This is a possible scenario considering global market conditions and similar incidents. So, the outcome could vary completely from this forecast. Investors must do their own research. What You Should Do Next? Although the Berachain coin price rallied 1400% after launch, its significant drop indicates the need for caution. This becomes more important in the early days, when the airdrop receivers are on a selling trajectory, and the market is witnessing high liquidity. Investors must carefully analyze the BERA price movement and the community sentiments around it. If it follows the momentum of the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins, it could crash to as low as $1.50.

Notably, the cryptocurrency rose above $100,000 for the first time since Feb. 4, following a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing the economy added 143,000 jobs in January, below the forecast of 170,000 and down from 256,000 in December. Unemployment Rate Drops to 4%, Wage Growth Surpasses Expectations The unemployment rate fell to 4%, better than the expected 4.1%, and matched December’s rate. Additionally, average hourly earnings increased by 0.5%, exceeding the expected 0.3%. Grayscale’s Head of Research Zach Pandl noted that the high wage inflation and low unemployment suggests that the Federal Reserve isn’t likely to cut rates soon, but the market already knows that. “As long as equity markets stay stable, Bitcoin could reach new highs later this quarter,” he added. The likelihood of the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates at its March meeting dropped to 8% from 15% after the report, according to CME FedWatch data. The Fed reduced rates by 100 basis points in the last four months of 2024, and investors had expected similar cuts in 2025. However, recent strong economic and inflation data has led the Fed to quickly shift away from its more relaxed stance, with traders now expecting no further rate cuts. The market is only anticipating two rate cuts this year, with the first likely after the first half of the year. Implications For Bitcoin The weaker-than-expected job data has sparked speculation about a possible Bitcoin price surge. Cooling job data typically gives the central bank room to lower interest rates. If the labor market remains strong despite high rates, the Fed may keep rates steady. However, the latest data suggests a positive outlook for Bitcoin’s price. Investors are closely watching how this data impacts Bitcoin, which has seen volatile trading and a significant drop from its all-time high. Experts remain optimistic about Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Besides, recently, top crypto analyst Mister Crypto praised the U.S. job data, calling it “BULLISH FOR CRYPTO.” While Bitcoin surged following the U.S. job data release, the BTC and ETH options expiry today could bring volatility to the crypto market.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-07 15:47:46

Although these tokens enjoy tremendous hype and have experienced wild price swings, a new contender is emerging with real-world utility and strong fundamentals. Remittix is quietly building a platform that connects cryptocurrency with traditional fiat payments, offering fast, low-cost, and secure transactions across borders. As the payments market expands into a multi-trillion-dollar arena, Remittix is positioning itself to capture a significant share of this space. Experts now forecast that, over the coming weeks, Remittix could potentially deliver over four times its current value—a growth rate that many believe will outstrip the performance of popular meme coins like SHIB and PEPE. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Excites Holders Optimistic for a SHIB Price Surge On February 2, the spotlight shifted to Shiba Inu’s dramatic token burn activity—an impressive increase of over 7,200% in 24 hours that saw more than 1 billion Shiba Inu tokens destroyed. This massive burn has sparked fresh conversations among Shiba Inu investors, many of whom are convinced that slashing the circulating supply could be the catalyst for a significant SHIB price recovery. Adding to the buzz, notable whale purchases signal that big players are still placing their bets on SHIB's long-term potential. SHIB price has had its share of fluctuations. After enduring a period of stagnation, Shiba Inu experienced a modest rebound. Over the course of the week, SHIB's price has climbed by roughly 21.4% from February 2 lows of $0.000012, suggesting that renewed momentum might be building. Yet, despite these gains, SHIB price remains well below its all-time highs, currently trading at levels that are more than 70% down from its peak back in October 2021. Still, Shiba Inu community's optimism hasn't waned, particularly with the anticipated launch of Shibarium—the promising layer-2 scaling solution that many believe could spur further interest and investment in SHIB. Analysts Think Pepe Will Recover to Its Past Glory Days Pepe has been making waves lately, drawing attention with an impressive surge in value that’s hard to ignore. In a remarkable rally, the token recently reached a price of $0.000014, which catapulted its market cap to over $4.5 billion. This meteoric rise is largely thanks to substantial investments from institutional players, as well as expanded trading access on popular platforms like Robinhood and MoonPay. With its current price of $0.0000104 and a $4.29 billion market cap, Pepe now ranks 29th among all cryptocurrencies , even outpacing more established projects like Aptos and Matic. Beyond its stellar price performance, PEPE has also seen a significant uptick in trading activity. Record-high volumes signal robust engagement from both retail and institutional investors alike. The integration with mainstream platforms has made it easier for everyday investors to participate, further amplifying its market presence. Together, these developments underscore a growing confidence in PEPE, positioning it as a viable and exciting option within the meme cryptocurrency space. Comparing the Landscape: PEPE, SHIB and the Remittix Advantage Recent ecosystem news reinforces the potential of Remittix. Analysts and industry experts have been increasingly vocal about the benefits of a payment network that reduces the friction associated with global money transfers. They argue that while memecoins might generate short-term buzz, they often struggle to deliver lasting value. Remittix is making significant strides in creating a secure and efficient payment system. This is especially important in areas where every dollar saved on transaction fees can have a big impact, particularly in communities that depend on remittances for daily needs. Traditional banks often struggle with high fees and slow services, but Remittix aims to change that by offering a more streamlined alternative. Pepe and Shiba inu investors are taking note, with some anticipating that Remittix could see its value increase more than fourfold in the coming weeks. The Defi project's strength lies in its clear vision and solid financial support, having raised almost $11 million to build a platform tailored to the real needs of global payments. Its easy-to-use interface and low transaction costs give it an edge in a market where efficiency and reliability are key. As digital payments become more commonplace worldwide, the demand for innovative solutions like Remittix is expected to grow. While tokens like Shiba Inu and Pepe often grab attention with rapid price changes, Remittix offers a more measured and sustainable growth path. With strong technology, practical applications, and impressive fundraising, Remittix is positioned to not only match but potentially surpass the performance of popular meme coins in the near future. In a market often driven by speculative hype, Remittix provides a more stable and promising alternative for investors seeking long-term value. As the digital economy matures, projects that blend technological innovation with real-world utility—like Remittix—are set to lead the next wave of financial evolution. Investors looking for long term solutions in a rapidly changing and volatile market should keep a close eye on Remittix, a project that aims to combine the best of blockchain efficiency with the practical needs of everyday transactions.

With over $13.5 million raised and tokens priced at $0.16 in stage 8, DTX could offer unique features such as high-speed transactions and promising growth potential. Let’s find out why investors are choosing DTX over Solana. Why SOL Price’s Recent ATH Could be Short-Lived January 2025 was probably one of the best months for SOL price as it became popular due to memecoins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens. After these, thousands of memecoins were introduced into the Solana ecosystem, and most of them were rug pulls which might affect the investor confidence in the project. This influx could also have some unforeseen risks such as Solana network congestion and performance issues. According to CoinMarketCap, Solana reached a new all-time high of $294.33 in January 2025. However, SOL price after that faced a strong decline and is currently trading below $200. Source: CoinMarketMap With the bull run approaching and the SOL price declining because of overall market sentiment, smart investors are moving their funds into fundamentally strong projects with real-world utility. One such project is DTX Exchange on which Solana whales are putting more money into it. Why Are Investors Choosing DTX Exchange Over Solana DTX Exchange is quickly positioning itself as a major player in the cryptocurrency market and has attracted the attention of investors seeking a platform with strong fundamentals. With the SOL price in a downtrend, investors are moving their funds into DTX because of its innovative features. One of DTX Exchange’s standout features is its speed. The platform employs a layer 1 blockchain called VulcanX which is capable of processing over 200,000 transactions per second. This high transaction speed will ensure that trades are executed quickly even during times of high market volatility. The platform also offers its very own wallet named Phoenix. This wallet contains quantum-proof technology which could make it one of the most secure crypto platforms available. Further, this cutting-edge wallet could protect users’ funds from potential future online threats. DTX will also offer a range of AI trading tools like trading bots, automated investment manager, and 1000x leverage. This huge leverage could amplify trading positions for traders seeking to make significantly higher profits with a small investment. DTX Exchange Exceptional Presale Outperforming with $13.5 Million Raised While the SOL price underperforms and shows a blurry picture of regaining ATH again, DTX Exchange could offer better value for investors. This platform offers faster transaction speeds and introduces stronger security measures compared to other traditional cryptos. These could be the reasons why smart investors have been so interested in DTX Exchange and have contributed to the presale success. DTX Exchange has raised over $13.5 million in value in under 8 presale stages. Currently, the per token price has been set to $0.16 and will soon increase to $0.20 and much more according to experts. Even if DTX manages to get 1% of Solana’s market cap (1 billion) it will be a 100% increase for DTX tokens and will boost its price to $2 in no time. Conclusion Both Solana and DTX Exchange have gained significant attention in the crypto world for their speed and scalability. But the former has been facing difficulties with SOL price declining by the day. DTX Exchange, on the other hand, offers even better real-world utility, making it a solid choice for traders and a strong alternative for the future.

With the platform having raised over $13.5 million and tokens priced at $0.16 during stage 8, DTX presents potential unique benefits like rapid transaction speeds and promising growth prospects. Let's explore why investors might be choosing DTX over Solana. Could Solana's Recent High Be Fleeting? January 2025 marked an exceptional period for Solana's price, driven largely by the popularity of memecoins such as $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens. However, the introduction of numerous memecoins into Solana's ecosystem, many of which turned out to be rug pulls, may have shaken investor confidence in the project. This surge in activity might also pose unexpected risks, including potential congestion and performance issues on the Solana network. Based on data from CoinMarketCap, Solana hit an all-time high of $294.33 in January 2025. Nevertheless, its price has since experienced a sharp decline, currently trading at below $200. Source: CoinMarketMap With a bull run looming and the general market sentiment causing SOL prices to dip, savvy investors are reallocating their resources to projects with strong fundamentals and practical applications. DTX Exchange is one such project that has caught the attention of major Solana investors. Reasons Investors Prefer DTX Exchange Over Solana DTX Exchange is rapidly emerging as a significant player in the cryptocurrency arena, drawing the interest of investors looking for a platform backed by solid fundamentals. As Solana's price trends downward, investors are channeling their funds into DTX due to its forward-thinking features. A key highlight of DTX Exchange is its impressive speed. The platform utilizes a layer 1 blockchain known as VulcanX, which is capable of executing over 200,000 transactions per second. This remarkable speed ensures swift trade executions, even amidst high market volatility. Additionally, the platform offers a proprietary wallet named Phoenix, featuring quantum-proof technology to enhance security, potentially making it one of the safest crypto platforms available. This advanced wallet aims to safeguard users' assets from possible future cyber threats. DTX also plans to provide a suite of AI-driven trading tools, including trading bots, an automated investment manager, and leverage up to 1000x. Such leverage could significantly amplify trading positions for those aiming to achieve substantial profits with minimal investment. DTX Exchange's Remarkable Presale Achieving $13.5 Million While Solana's price struggles to regain its previous highs, DTX Exchange could provide more value to investors with faster transaction speeds and enhanced security features compared to traditional cryptocurrencies. These factors may explain why savvy investors are showing keen interest in DTX Exchange, contributing to its successful presale. DTX Exchange has raised over $13.5 million through 8 presale stages. The current token price is set at $0.16, with expectations of rising to $0.20 and beyond, according to experts. If DTX captures even 1% of Solana's market cap (1 billion), this would represent a 100% increase for DTX tokens, potentially driving its price to $2 swiftly.

Offering practical applications in the global payments sector, Remittix has been highlighted as a market disruptor for 2025. So will Cardano see a revival and how far could Remittix go this year? Cardano Posts 30% Dip In 30 Days Cardano has experienced monumental losses in the last month with a 29% decline on the whole and a 17% loss in the last week alone. Price movements aside, Cardano’s developer team continues to make strong progress. The recent Mithril upgrade brought a stake-based multi-signature scheme designed to boost Cardano’s network's scalability and security.

Remittix Creates a New Era for Global Payments For years, crypto has been touted as the future of finance but actually using it like real money? Still a nightmare. Bank restrictions, long processing times and unpredictable fees make it hard for the average person to spend or send crypto without hassle. That’s where Remittix (RTX) is shaking things up. It’s a bridge between digital assets and traditional banking, allowing users to convert crypto into FIAT instantly and send it directly to global bank accounts. So why are crypto transactions still a struggle? A freelance web designer in Nigeria gets paid in USDT, but converting it to local currency is a headache, slow exchanges, high fees and poor conversion rates. In this scenario, crypto should be the solution but if people can’t use it in the same way as cash, what’s the point? That’s what Remittix (RTX) is fixing. It lets users convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT and send money directly to bank accounts worldwide with no hidden fees, no waiting days for transfers to clear, just instant, easy transactions. It’s not just individuals who benefit from Remittix’s (RTX) payment solutions businesses are also integrating it to expand their revenue streams. The Remittix Pay API lets merchants accept crypto payments while automatically settling in FIAT. No volatility risk, no confusion with tax reporting, just smooth transactions. For e-commerce sites, global service providers and gig economy platforms, this means lower processing fees, fewer restrictions and faster payments from international clients. Remittix Closes In On $11 Million Raised $RTX tokens are currently available for $0.0539, having seen more than $10.7 million in investment already.

The token, originally intended as a demonstration asset on the BNB Chain, saw its market cap skyrocket as traders and influencers turned it into a fully functional cryptocurrency. Accidental Launch According to an X post from Zhao, the meme coin’s name was briefly visible in a single frame of the training video. After realizing it had been exposed, the team removed the video from the web. However, by then, it had already been spread across the internet. The video and the token soon caught the eye of several Chinese crypto influencers, with their endorsements creating further interest and attracting more traders. What had started as a simple test asset quickly transformed into a fully tradable coin. Zhao has since clarified that neither he nor Binance endorsed the coin, stating: “This is NOT an official token by the BNB Chain team, or anyone. It is a test token used just for that video tutorial. Nothing more.” He added that a team member had also deleted the private key for the creator address used in the tutorial, which contained 0.13% of the token supply. He further stated that no one on the training team or at Binance held any of the cryptocurrency. Despite this, the former executive suggested restoring the instruction video while also encouraging the community by commenting, “Happy trading.” TST’s Meteoric Rise According to DEX Screener data , TST, which initially held a valuation of just under $500,000, saw its fully diluted value surge beyond $25 million. Eager traders drove its market cap past $37 million, with its liquidity reaching $4.5 million. As the coin continued gaining traction, it was listed on PancakeSwap. Shortly after, it was also added to the MEXC exchange, where its price fluctuated between $0.02 and $0.04. Early investors also made substantial profits, with one trader reportedly earning $303,600 from sales and another securing $258,200. The rapid rise of the meme coin shows the intense demand for this asset class. However, despite their popularity, they have faced growing scrutiny in recent weeks. Pump.fun is currently the subject of a proposed class-action lawsuit from investors alleging it marketed and sold unregistered securities. Additionally, the launch of a Trump-themed meme coin in January also caused controversy within the industry. Mark Cuban criticized the initiative as a setback for crypto’s legitimacy, arguing that it weakens ownership and fuels speculation. Senator Elizabeth Warren also called for an investigation into the Trump token, citing concerns over ethics, foreign influence, and regulatory oversight.

Cardano is one of the affected, experiencing significant losses following a monthly decline. On the other hand, Remittix (RTX) is an emerging PayFi project that defies the trend by drawing substantial attention during its presale, amassing over $10.8 million in just a few weeks. With a focus on practical uses in global payments, Remittix is set to be a game-changer in 2025. Can Cardano make a comeback, and how far might Remittix advance this year? Cardano Faces a 30% Decline in a Month In the past month, Cardano has suffered a drastic 29% drop, including a 17% decrease just in the last week. Despite the price fluctuations, Cardano’s development team continues to make significant strides. The recent Mithril upgrade introduced a stake-based multi-signature scheme aimed at enhancing the scalability and security of Cardano’s network. By offering certified snapshots of the blockchain state, Mithril seeks to enable quicker node synchronization and support applications like secure voting and data sharing. Further exacerbating the situation, the overall crypto market has been impacted by new U.S. tariff announcements, which have led to a notable sell-off of Cardano, adding to its overall monthly downturn. Remittix Paves the Way for a New Era in Global Payments For years, crypto has been hailed as the future of finance, but using it like traditional money remains a challenge. Bank restrictions, lengthy processing times, and unpredictable fees make it difficult for the average user to spend or transfer crypto smoothly. This is where Remittix (RTX) comes into play, offering a seamless connection between digital assets and traditional banking. It enables users to instantly convert crypto into FIAT and transfer it directly to global bank accounts. But why are crypto transactions still so cumbersome? Consider a freelance web designer in Nigeria who receives payment in USDT. Converting it to local currency is a hassle due to slow exchanges, high fees, and poor conversion rates. Although crypto should provide a solution, if it cannot be used like cash, then what's the point? Remittix (RTX) addresses this issue by allowing users to convert more than 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT and send money directly to bank accounts worldwide, all without hidden fees or delays, ensuring instant and easy transactions. Not only individuals benefit from Remittix’s (RTX) payment solutions; businesses are also adopting it to increase their revenue streams. The Remittix Pay API enables merchants to accept crypto payments while automatically converting to FIAT, eliminating volatility risks and simplifying tax reporting. For e-commerce sites, global service providers, and gig economy platforms, this translates to reduced processing fees, fewer restrictions, and faster payments from international clients. Remittix Nears $11 Million in Funds Raised The $RTX tokens are currently priced at $0.0539, with investments already exceeding $10.7 million. Analysts anticipate an 800% increase in the token's value before the presale concludes, with the potential for further growth post-launch as adoption increases.

At this point, Pal, who expects Bitcoin to reach $350,000 by 2025, stated that BTC has the potential to exceed $500,000. Speaking on a podcast with James Connor of Blood Street Capital, Raoul Pal argued that Bitcoin could reach $350,000 by the end of 2025 in the base case scenario. Analyzing past trends and current market conditions, Pal said Bitcoin is headed for a strong rally in 2025, supported by global liquidity and a maturing market. Pal likened the current market to 2017 after Trump was first elected president, when Bitcoin surged due to steady liquidity inflows. At this point, Pal stated that he expects only minor pullbacks in Bitcoin from now on, predicting that it could drop to $90,000 before recovering. The famous name identified three possible price targets for Bitcoin that he expects by the end of 2025: “Worst case scenario: Bitcoin price reaches $200,000 – $250,000. Base case scenario: Bitcoin climbs to $350,000. Bull scenario: If the market sees a breakout like in 2017, Bitcoin could rise above $500,000.” *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Solana’s price rebounds, 1Fuel’s exchange model looks to deliver simple and profitable trades in 2025. Table of Contents Solana 1FUEL Conclusion Solana investors are breathing a sigh of relief thanks to the recent Solana price rebound, but a significant level of volatility remains. This could see gains capped in the short term, frustrating Solana’s efforts to gain the $100 and change it needs to ascend back to its all-time high. That’s not to say Solana is alone in surfing rocky waves. There’s a renewed sense of uncertainty in the air as rivals, including Ethereum and Bitcoin, also struggle. Investors seeking respite from rising tides have been looking toward newer options like 1FUEL for a dose of good news. 1FUEL’s one-click, cross-chain crypto transactions technology set it apart from the crowd. Having carved out a niche for itself as a crypto gamechanger, the new crypto wallet and exchange is lining up its chess pieces to potentially challenge the crypto giants. Solana Less than a month ago, Solana was riding high with a 38% price rally, but February trade tariff events quickly flipped that trajectory. Nothing if not resilient, Solana quickly shook off its 17% decline and began clawing back lost ground. However, ongoing volatility has it trading below the key $200 resistance level, with prices lingering around $192 at time of writing. Seasoned investors know to look beyond immediate price action. Analysis shows that Solana’s technical indicators are positive, suggesting that a new push upwards could be in the pipeline. Following the Solana ETF filing, there is strong buyer interest. Increased trading volume is a positive sign, and bulls buying the dip could propel Solana back above the sub-$200 level. However, there is no escaping the fact that for now, Solana could face a dip if the market declines further, with its next critical level at $180.

To read full editions, subscribe . What’s a good way to gauge how crypto’s faring without depending too much on price action? If you ask Kaiko, it’s L2s. So far, since the election, the research firm’s L2 index has traded higher, which is — admittedly — perhaps not a huge surprise, given that all of crypto took on an optimistic outlook starting in November. The index tracks five L2s across Bitcoin and Ethereum. It also tracks Polygon. As you can see above, we have Stacks, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon and Starknet in the same bucket. Keep in mind that L2s are making a comeback so far after falling behind the market last year. And there’s been plenty of discussion around whether we have too many L2s. That’s not to say that there isn’t still demand though. Take, for example, a Galaxy report from November that projects that $47 billion of bitcoin could be “bridged into bitcoins L2s by 2030” — or roughly 2% of bitcoin’s circulating supply. Anyway, back to the data: There might be some more positive catalysts in store for L2s, especially if bitcoin doesn’t dominate the narrative as much moving forward. “Sector rotation is another potential tailwind for L2 assets. BTC dominated the crypto market in 2024, setting record highs before and after the U.S. election as institutional investors poured billions into spot BTC exchange-traded funds. However, the rally hasn’t yet extended beyond BTC, as has historically been the case. While the crypto market structure has evolved, a rotation to smaller assets remains likely as investors seek higher upside potential via high-beta tokens,” Kaiko analyst Adam McCarthy wrote. Taking into account that the changing regulatory headwinds play a huge factor here — especially in Polygon’s case given that the SEC previously labeled MATIC a security — and perhaps the future’s looking a bit brighter. While investing in bitcoin is accessible to the masses, it’s hard to find opportunities beyond it, McCarthy wrote. “While the broader crypto bull market has yet to fully extend to altcoins, evolving regulatory dynamics could serve as a catalyst for renewed interest. As policy shifts in Washington and investors explore opportunities beyond Bitcoin,” L2s are “positioned for significant growth in 2025,” he continued.

While traders swamped Solana's distributed exchanges, driving daily transactions to $3.3 billion, apps like Pump. fun, and Photon brought in enormous income. Remittix ( RTX ) is a new rival, albeit Solana rules DeFi. Remittix is developed for actual payments, unlike Solana, which emphasises trading and staking. Fast, low-cost money transfers free from the complexity of conventional banking promise here. 2025 may be a fight between utility and innovation since Solana is expanding rapidly and Remittix provides workable crypto solutions. Tron (TRX) Faces Challenges—Can Remittix (RTX) Take the Spotlight? Although Tron ( TRX ) has long been a popular cryptocurrency, lately, it has faltered. Tron's price plummeted around eight per cent over last month, trading at $0.2278 . Since Tron does not demonstrate a significant increase, many investors are beginning to lose faith. Its coin price stays fixed even if its blockchain still supports popular apps. Some analysts think Tron's slow down results from insufficient interesting fresh updates. Should Tron fail to adapt, alternative blockchains providing faster transactions and better technology could cause Tron to tumble even further. While Tron faces challenges, Remittix (RTX) is getting a lot of attention as a potential game-changer. This new crypto project is designed to provide real-world solutions, making it more appealing to investors looking for long-term growth. Unlike Tron, which seems to have lost momentum, Remittix is attracting fresh interest with its promising features. Many traders are shifting their focus to newer projects like Remittix and Solana (SOL), which offer better performance and innovation. The crypto world is changing fast, and only the strongest projects will survive. If Tron doesn’t introduce big improvements soon, it may lose its place in newer, more exciting cryptocurrencies like Remittix. Why Remittix (RTX) Could Be the Best Investment of 2025 Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming a standout in the crypto world, and it’s no surprise. At its current price of $0.0539 , Remittix is breaking new ground by offering FIAT payment integration, making it easier for people worldwide to send and receive money through cryptocurrency. Given the 1.4 billion unbanked individuals worldwide who struggle with conventional financing, this is significant progress. Remittix is revolutionising the game by letting consumers send cryptocurrencies to Western Union, where they may be turned into cash. For financial inclusion, this is a huge advance since it lets people without bank accounts quickly move money. Remittix is also addressing a major issue that many cryptocurrencies present making real-world use simpler. People can now use cryptocurrencies for daily transactions, creating a new universe of opportunities instead of depending simply on crypto exchanges. The Remittix presale has already crossed $11 million, showing how much potential investors see in this project. As crypto adoption grows and Remittix solves real-world problems, this could be one of the best investments of 2025. With its strong future plans and user-focused approach, Remittix might just be the crypto to watch!

This development showcases the growing demand for blockchain-based financial solutions, fueling optimism for XRP’s future. However, while XRP focuses on asset tokenization, Lightchain AI is emerging as a blockchain powerhouse with massive potential. With its presale already raising over $15.3 million and the token priced at $0.006, investors are turning their attention to this next-generation crypto project, which could deliver even bigger gains than XRP. XRP’s Real-World Asset Expansion - What It Means for the Market Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL) is driving the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), turning physical assets like real estate and commodities into digital tokens. This innovation boosts transaction efficiency, security, and accessibility, making asset management more seamless. With its decentralized exchange (DEX) and compliance tools, XRPL supports smooth and secure RWA transactions. Recent partnerships, such as with Archax, aim to bring significant real assets into the XRPL ecosystem, connecting traditional finance with blockchain technology. These advancements increase liquidity and democratize access to various asset classes, offering new opportunities for investors. By merging blockchain with traditional markets, XRPL has the potential to revolutionize global financial systems and reshape how assets are traded and managed. Why Lightchain AI Could Outperform XRP in Growth Potential XRP is steadily expanding its tokenization capabilities, but Lightchain AI is quickly emerging as a leader in blockchain innovation. One of its standout features is the use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), enabling sensitive data to remain fully protected during computations. This builds trust among both developers and users by ensuring privacy and security. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s Presale Token Allocation Strategy is designed to promote long-term sustainability and fairness. By preventing excessive early dumping, this strategy helps maintain price stability and ensures an equitable distribution of tokens. As Lightchain AI continues to gain attention, its advanced technologies and thoughtful approaches are positioning it as a key player in the evolving blockchain landscape. Lightchain AI vs. XRP - Which Crypto Holds the Most Upside? Lightchain AI and XRP present distinct investment opportunities within the cryptocurrency landscape. Lightchain AI is an emerging platform that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, introducing innovations like the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. Currently in its presale phase at $0.005625 per token, it has garnered $15.3 million in funding, indicating strong early interest. In contrast, XRP is a well-established digital asset designed for efficient cross-border payments. Despite recent market volatility, XRP maintains a significant presence in the crypto market. While XRP offers a proven track record and established use cases, Lightchain AI's innovative approach to combining AI and blockchain positions it as a high-potential, albeit speculative, investment. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough research when evaluating these opportunities.

Remittix emerges as a promising new player, Solana is expanding rapidly, and Tron remains resilient. However, which of these will deliver the highest returns in the future? Let’s delve deeper to see which cryptocurrency might be the top choice by 2025! Solana's Surge and the Emerging Contender: Will Remittix Keep Up? Currently valued at $202.24 , Solana is gaining ground as the second-largest DeFi network. The total value locked (TVL) in Solana has skyrocketed to $8.6 billion in a short span, surpassing Tron (TRX). With traders flocking to Solana's decentralized exchanges, daily transactions have reached $3.3 billion, and applications like Pump.fun and Photon are generating significant revenue. While Solana dominates DeFi, Remittix ( RTX ) is stepping in as a new competitor. Unlike Solana, which focuses on trading and staking, Remittix is geared towards real-world payment solutions. It offers swift, low-cost money transfers, bypassing the complexities of traditional banking. As Solana rapidly grows and Remittix delivers practical crypto solutions, 2025 might see a contest between utility and innovation. Tron (TRX) Under Pressure—Can Remittix (RTX) Steal the Spotlight? Tron ( TRX ) has been a well-known cryptocurrency but has recently faced setbacks. Its price has dropped about eight percent over the past month, currently trading at $0.2278 . Without substantial growth, investor confidence is waning, even though its blockchain still supports widely-used apps. Some experts suggest that Tron's slowdown is due to a lack of exciting new developments. If Tron doesn’t innovate, other blockchains offering faster and more advanced technology could cause further declines. As Tron encounters difficulties, Remittix (RTX) is capturing attention as a potential game-changer. This new venture is focused on providing real-world solutions, appealing to investors seeking long-term growth. Unlike Tron, which seems to be losing steam, Remittix is drawing renewed interest with its attractive features. Many traders are now eyeing newer projects like Remittix and Solana (SOL) for better performance and innovation. The cryptocurrency landscape is evolving rapidly, and only the most robust projects will thrive. If Tron doesn't roll out significant improvements soon, it might be overshadowed by newer, more exciting cryptocurrencies like Remittix. Why Remittix (RTX) Might Be the Top Investment of 2025 Remittix (RTX) is quickly emerging as a standout in the crypto sector, and it's easy to see why. With a current price of $0.0539 , Remittix is pioneering FIAT payment integration, simplifying the process for people worldwide to send and receive money through cryptocurrency. This is a significant advancement for the 1.4 billion unbanked individuals who face challenges with traditional financial systems. Remittix is changing the landscape by enabling users to send cryptocurrencies to Western Union, where they can be converted into cash. This is a major step forward in financial inclusion, allowing those without bank accounts to transfer money with ease. Additionally, Remittix addresses a key challenge faced by many cryptocurrencies by making real-world applications more accessible. Users can now engage in everyday transactions with cryptocurrencies, opening up a new realm of possibilities beyond just crypto exchanges. The Remittix presale has already surpassed $11 million, reflecting the significant potential investors see in this project. As cryptocurrency adoption rises and Remittix continues to solve real-world challenges, it could become one of the most promising investments by 2025.

Investors were only adjusting to the shock from DogeCoin when Shiba Inu matched with a 1,250% October surge of the same year. Still, these coins rely on speculation and hype to acquire worth. Experts say a Shiba Inu drop and a dogecoin price crash will push them out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. Investors are looking for crypto assets that address practical financial concerns. With its creative financial design, Remittix (RTX) is the project most likely to replace these top meme coins. Analysts Prediction: Dogecoin Price Crash Is Imminent Originally a meme coin, dogecoin grew to be a billion-dollar asset thanks to social media and well-known figures. Still, Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks fresh ideas and broad acceptability to keep expanding despite all the hoopla. Though some stores let you pay with it, there is no limit on how much can exist therefore this online money has few actual uses and keeps losing value. As investors turn more toward utilities, especially with newer, more advanced projects, many predict a Dogecoin price collapse. Dogecoin price has also been erratic due in great part to speculation; its values have dropped significantly in weakening markets. Should it lack a strong basis in distributed finance (DeFi) or real-world use cases, its market position is under threat. Shiba Inu Price Struggles Due To A Fading Meme Hype With its amazing price rise in 2021, Shiba Inu caught the crypto scene by storm; but, its popularity depends too much on community enthusiasm that has since been fading. Unlike well-known existing big blockchain networks, the SHIB ecosystem lacks original, out of the box ideas to be able to separate out from others. Adoption problems still plague the initiative even with Shibarium advancement. The Shiba Inu fall is becoming more clear as market mood moves from meme currencies toward tokens with obvious real-world use applications. SHIB runs a danger for investors looking for stability and long-term development with its poor income approach. Since user interest is declining and its price is not recovering, many traders are looking for a top cryptocurrency that offers actual financial worth. Why Remittix (RTX) Is Set to Replace Meme Coins One of the primary issues with cryptocurrencies is not being able to straight translate digital assets into FIAT for daily usage. Millions of unbanked individuals all around the world own cryptocurrencies in digital wallets even without access to banking services. RTX's flawless crypto to FIAT transfers let customers send money overseas and withdraw in local currencies using banks, ATM machines or payment systems. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are declining, Remittix (RTX) is becoming more and more popular; pre-sale already draws great interest. Early participants can profit greatly and become involved before the coin is generally used. The security of the project is absolutely strong since liquidity is secured for three years and team tokens are locked to ensure stability. Since Dogecoin and Shiba Inu never provided this degree of openness and trust, remittix has a great edge in the bitcoin market. Remittix (RTX) is driven by great usefulness unlike meme currencies, which are vulnerable to speculative collapses and price manipulation. Maintaining the basic values of bitcoin privacy, decentralization and financial autonomy and closing the distance with FIAT empowers users. For long-term investors wishing to see past the hype, this is a great advantage and the finest choice available. Meme coin days count, and real blockchain projects are starting to take front stage. The fall in Shiba Inu and the price crash of Dogecoin reveal a more general swing in investor mood. Sharp investors are moving their attention from token chasing depending on no value to true value propositions like Remittix. Remittix would soon lead, as the rest of the earth moved toward one highly integrated bitcoin system in a big stride. Furthermore notable is the platform's clear flat-fee approach, which offers savings and clarity over large costs and inadequate exchange rates of established institutions. Remittix is a game-changer in the payments sector since this method ensures that the whole amount transmitted reaches the recipient, therefore addressing unethical behavior all too often. Currently at $0.0539 during its presale, the RTX coin is the best crypto to purchase right now because of its great investment value. Forecasts suggest a marked rise; demand for unique cross-border payment solutions is generating a 25x multiplier in the presale period and over 1,500% rises following launch. RTX comes out as among the best altcoins based on this.

One project that has caught the attention of Rexas Finance (RXS) investors is Coldware (COLD) , an IoT-powered blockchain platform that aims to revolutionize real-world asset tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi). Here are three reasons why Rexas Finance (RXS) holders are adding Coldware (COLD) to their portfolios. Coldware (COLD) Offers a Decentralized Approach to Asset Tokenization While Rexas Finance (RXS) has gained a solid reputation in the tokenization market, it still relies on Ethereum’s infrastructure, which can lead to high transaction costs and network congestion. In contrast, Coldware (COLD) operates on a next-generation IoT blockchain, providing scalable and low-cost transactions. This makes it faster and more affordable than Ethereum-based RXS tokens. Coldware (COLD) also integrates IoT technology for real-time asset tracking, enabling devices to interact with blockchain networks. This is particularly valuable for logistics, supply chain management, and financial applications. Additionally, Coldware’s distributed validator network enhances security and decentralization, reducing the risk of centralization and making the network more resilient to failures. For Rexas Finance (RXS) investors, Coldware (COLD) offers an innovative alternative, giving them the opportunity to diversify into a truly decentralized tokenization ecosystem. Coldware’s Staking Model Offers Higher Rewards and Accessibility One of the biggest attractions of Coldware (COLD) is its unique staking model, which sets it apart from traditional PoS networks like Ethereum. Unlike Ethereum, which requires expensive validator hardware, Coldware enables any user to participate in staking via mobile LiteNodes. This approach significantly lowers the barrier to entry and makes staking more accessible to a broader audience. Coldware offers multiple staking pools, allowing investors to select pools based on their desired risk level, lock-up period, and reward structure. Moreover, Coldware’s staking system features auto-compounding rewards, automatically reinvesting earnings to maximize long-term profits. The platform’s energy-efficient PoS architecture ensures sustainability, providing an eco-friendly alternative to high-power PoS systems. With higher staking rewards and lower entry barriers, Coldware (COLD) is becoming an increasingly attractive option for Rexas Finance (RXS) investors looking to maximize their passive income. Coldware’s Presale Provides Early Investment Opportunities As Rexas Finance (RXS) approaches its market launch, investors are actively seeking early-stage projects with significant growth potential. Coldware (COLD) ’s upcoming presale offers a unique opportunity for early backers to capitalize on its growth from the beginning. With low initial entry points, investors can enter at an early stage, unlike RXS, which has already surged 490%. Coldware’s PoS model and IoT integration have already attracted institutional and whale investors, signaling strong future demand for the platform. Furthermore, Coldware’s roadmap focuses on real-world applications, extending beyond tokenization to integrate with finance, logistics, and DeFi sectors. For long-term crypto holders, adding Coldware (COLD) to their portfolios alongside Rexas Finance (RXS) provides greater exposure to blockchain innovation and asset tokenization, positioning them well for future growth in the space. Final Thoughts: Rexas Finance (RXS) and Coldware (COLD) Complement Each Other While Rexas Finance (RXS) continues to dominate asset tokenization, Coldware (COLD) is introducing a next-generation approach that integrates IoT and decentralized staking. Rexas Finance (RXS) is ideal for traditional asset tokenization, targeting real estate, gold, and artwork investors. Coldware (COLD) focuses on scalable, real-time blockchain applications, providing faster, more decentralized solutions for tokenized assets. As the crypto market matures, investors are diversifying across multiple platforms, recognizing Coldware (COLD) as a long-term complement to their existing Rexas Finance (RXS) holdings. With Coldware’s presale launch approaching, early investors have a rare opportunity to enter a rapidly growing ecosystem before it reaches mainstream adoption.

Solana has lately increased by 20%, while XRP's price has skyrocketed by about 40%. However, another platform providing a fresh method for cross-border payments, Remittix is transforming the worldwide market. These coins are generating a buzz for both investors and crypto aficionados as Solana's expansion, XRP price prediction and Remittix's bright future show are the talk of the moment. Solana (SOL) Surges with Price Growth Solana (SOL) has been the top-performing cryptocurrencies recently, considering its price rising more than twenty percent in just one week. Solana's price rose from about $210 to more than $260 over the past seven days, claims CoinMarketCap. Many bitcoin aficionados have noticed this pricing change. Furthermore generating buzz in the Solana community is crypto analyst Jelle. He shared on X that Solana is deviating from a Pennant pattern, which might cause even further development to be sparked. Jelle thinks Solana must pass the $270 barrier if it is to hit fresh highs. Though Solana is still on many investors' radar, some are beginning to consider other coins such as DTX. With the testnet exceeding 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), the DTX Exchange VulcanX blockchain recently displayed outstanding performance; Solana is at 65,000 TPS. This could imply that demand for DTX might rise going forward. Ripple (XRP), Bullish Growth and Exciting Price Predictions for the Future Thanks to its robust price increase, another cryptocurrency that has been attracting a lot of attention lately is ripple (XRP). In just a few weeks, the price of XRP has changed from roughly $2.30 to over $3.20, approximately a forty-percent rise. Positive forecasts from analysts including The Moon Show are driving XRP into news headlines. Thanks to a bullish pattern known as a pennant developing on its 4-hour chart, the analyst noted in a recent post on XRP may reach $4.20. The crypto community is now really excited about this. Though not everyone is convinced, the XRP price prediction has drawn a lot of people debating. Examining the Year-To- Date (YTD) chart, XRP has already skyrocketed this year by more than 500%. Some traders are thus wary about diving in. Many investors are therefore concentrating on alternative coins, such as DTX. People are also watching the future of XRP since Ripple is so extensively discussed. Still a hot issue, the XRP price prediction begs many questions about whether it will keep increasing or encounter difficulties. Remittix (RTX) Is Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments and Blockchain Innovation8 RTX is a coin you should be looking at if you want blockchain technology used practically in whatever platform you want to invest in. It combines the speed of blockchain with the simplicity of traditional finance to provide a new platform altering the $183 trillion worldwide payment scene.

In such an environment, investors look for stability and clear support levels. Recent Solana news highlights have pointed out key support levels that could help the token weather the current downturn. Meanwhile, a new DeFi project stands out for its resilience: Remittix (RTX). While many assets struggle amid market crashes, Remittix has managed to hold up better than the rest by offering practical solutions for cross-border payments. Solana: Identifying Key Support Levels Amid Market Downturns According to the latest Solana news reports SOL has fallen by around 7-8% in recent days. Current trading data suggests that Solana is hovering around the low $210 range, with support levels identified near $208 and $225. These levels are crucial because they indicate where buyers may step in to prevent further declines. Market analysts stress the importance of these support levels in times of overall market stress. When a major token like Solana drops below these critical thresholds, it can signal deeper problems in investor sentiment. However, as long as these support levels hold, there is a chance for a rebound. Additionally, institutional investors are keeping a close eye on Solana's technical indicators. Some reports suggest that a rebound from these support levels could prompt renewed interest, potentially attracting fresh capital into the token. In the current climate, any sign of stability in a major blockchain like Solana could have broader implications for the crypto market as a whole. The stability of support levels can also affect the overall sentiment among retail investors, making it an important topic in recent Solana news discussions. Remittix: A Crypto That Is Holding Up Better Remittix (RTX) proves different from other tokens because it stands strong during the overall market downturn. Remittix stands apart from other speculative assets because it provides practical benefits to users. Through its active ICO campaign Remittix has collected more than $10.8 million worth of investment funds from enthusiastic participants. The DeFi coin RTX trades at $0.0539 today which enables investors both large and small to enter the market. The initial investors who bought into the ICO earned returns greater than 3x their investment. This has attracted market experts to notice the coin as a potential top altcoin. Several elements explain why Remittix remains strong. Millions of global users benefit from Remittix because it solves their biggest payment problems across international borders. The traditional ways to send money are slow and charge excessive fees. Remittix designs a modern system that connects crypto and FIAT without problems while meeting modern global business needs. The project has dedicated substantial resources to security and openness. A team of experts checks smart contracts while team members lock their tokens for three years to create lasting investor trust. Recent studies show that Remittix can expand its business operations. The global finance sector views efficient cross-border payments as an essential trend so projects like Remittix that take advantage of this growth will experience market appreciation. Remittix stands out from other tokens since it maintains strong market value which makes it appealing to investors seeking lasting returns. Remittix attracts investors because it connects blockchain technology to traditional financial systems. This strategy works with current market flaws while preparing the token to use potential regulatory and technology improvements. The need for better money transfer services will increase as more people use online payment methods across international trade activities. The current market situation let's Remittix take a large portion of the available business. Investors who follow recent Solana news have noted that while major tokens like Solana are battling headwinds, alternative projects such as Remittix are thriving. The clear advantage of Remittix lies in its real-world application—a feature that many of the so-called “hype” tokens fail to deliver. As more investors prioritize tokens with sustainable, practical use cases, Remittix has the potential to emerge as a leader in the DeFi sector!

40043112,https://coingape.com/?p=237744,1738944764,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Fed’s Neel Kashkari Gives Take On Interest Rate Cut In 2025,https://coingape.com/feds-neel-kashkari-gives-take-on-interest-rate-cut-in-2025/,"In a surprising development, Neel Kashkari, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, offered rare glimpses into the central bank’s potential future monetary policy decisions. Kashkari hinted that he would support further interest rate cuts if inflation remains under control and the labor market stays strong. Interest Rate May Be Lower at Year End: Neel Kashkari In a CNBC interview today, Fed Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari shared insights on future interest rate cuts. Kashkari expects inflation to continue its downward trend towards the bank’s target of 2%. This paves the way for a modest interest rate cut by year-end. He posited, “I would expect the federal funds rate to be modestly lower at the end of this year.” Notably, Kashkari expressed uncertainty over the potential impact of US President Donald Trump’s new policies on the economy and inflation. These policies include stricter immigration controls, tariffs, and tax cuts, which could have far-reaching consequences. Further, Kashkari underscored the need for caution, advocating a wait-and-see approach. This may allow the Fed to gather more information and assess the potential impact of the policies on inflation and economic growth. Minneapolis Fed Chief’s Labor Market Insights While his interview comes shortly after the release of the US job report , the central bank president highlighted the labor market’s solid position. The labor market is showing signs of cooling down, with nonfarm payrolls rising by a modest 143,000 and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4%. Reflecting on the cooler-than-expected labor report, Neel Kashkari stated, This is still a good labor market. It’s not as hot as it was a year or two ago, the economy is strong, businesses are optimistic. Recently, the Bank of England announced interest rate cuts, reducing it to 4.5%, the lowest level since June 2023. According to the Monetary Policy Committee, two additional interest rates may be enough to tackle inflation. Will Federal Reserve Reduce Interest Rates Further? Following the two-day FOMC meeting, the Fed announced its decision to keep interest rates unchanged at the 4.25% to 4.5% range. In the interview, the central bank president stated that if inflation data looks promising and the labor market stays robust, he would urge for further cuts. Moreover, Neel Kashkari believes that the economy’s resilience to high interest rates may indicate a higher neutral rate. The neutral rate is the point at which interest rates neither boost nor hinder economic growth. How Does Crypto Market React To Neel Kashkari’s Insights? Currently, the crypto market is exhibiting a slight recovery from the recent turmoil. The total market cap of $3.22 trillion has seen a marginal surge of 1.48% over the last day. The 24-hour trading volume has also seen a notable hike of 11%, at $132.64 billion. However, top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has experienced huge declines of 6.6% and 19.5%, respectively over the past week. XRP, Solana, and BNB have also dropped massively by 20.5%, 17.2%, and 14.8%, respectively, over the same period. It remains to be seen if the Fed will further reduce interest rate as Neel Kashkari stated, impacting the crypto market.
