Ethereum Could Be In Danger Of Falling Under Ascending Channel Support In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about where Ethereum could head next based on a pattern forming in its 12-hour price chart. The pattern in question is an Ascending Parallel Channel from TA, which, as its name implies, involves two parallel trendlines that are sloped upwards. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovers To $2,800 As Exchange Outflows Near $1 Billion When the asset is inside this channel, it goes through consolidation towards a net upside. The higher tops in its price trace the upper line of the pattern, while the higher lows draw the lower level. Like other TA patterns, the former line is assumed to act as a source of resistance in the near future and the latter as a point of support. Breaks out of either of these boundaries can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. The Ascending Parallel Channel isn’t the only parallel channel in TA. When parallel consolidation happens towards the downside instead, the formation is known as a Descending Parallel Channel. Neither of these are the most commonly observed type, though, as that title is held by the basic Parallel Channel, which has its trendlines parallel to the time-axis (that is, they have zero slope). Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Ascending Channel that the 12-hour price of Ethereum has been trading inside for the last few years: From the graph, it’s apparent that the Ethereum half-day price saw a very brief retest of the Ascending Channel’s lower level recently. The coin found support then, but its value is still floating quite close to the line, meaning that another retest could potentially happen soon. The level is currently situated at $2,500. During the last few years, this line has continuously held for the cryptocurrency, so it’s possible that it may do so again in the near future. “If Ethereum $ETH holds above $2,500, it could rebound toward $4,000 or even $6,000,” notes Martinez. The former target is around halfway through the channel from the current mark, while the latter corresponds to the upper level. The last time that ETH topped out was near the former line. Related Reading: Chainlink Witnesses Highest Whale Activity Since 2023, Price Reversal Coming? “However, if $2,500 fails as support, the next target shifts to $1,700!” warns the analyst. From the current price of the coin, a crash to this target would mean a decrease of more than 39%. It now remains to be seen whether Ethereum will retest the lower level of the Ascending Channel again in the coming days or not. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $2,800, down more than 6% over the last seven days.

In a new announcement, Binance says it will be adding support for Berachain ( BERA ), an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-identical layer-1 blockchain that uses a proof-of-liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism. “Binance is excited to announce that Berachain will be added to Binance Simple Earn, ‘Buy Crypto,’ Binance Convert, Binance Margin, Binance Auto-Invest, and Binance Futures.” A PoL consensus mechanism rewards validators for providing liquidity to a blockchain’s ecosystem rather than a traditional proof-of-stake (PoS) system, which incentivizes staking tokens. As stated on Berachain’s official webpage, “Proof-of-Liquidity radically changes the way L1 economics are structured, prioritizing users and applications over validator rewards at baseline. Network incentives go towards enriching ecosystem liquidity, contributing to efficient trading, price stability, securing the chain, and increasing the network/user growth. PoL strongly align the incentives of network participants (validators, protocols, users) and contributes to the overall long-term health of the chain.” News of the addition sent BERA flying, as the digital asset went from a February 5th low of $7.85 to a peak of $14.83 a day later, a gain of 89%. BERA has since retraced and is trading for $9.22 at time of writing.

That agency, part of the Indian Finance Ministry, had ordered Bybit’s website to be blocked in the country and imposed a fine after finding in January that the exchange violated anti-money laundering rules. The FIU-IND fined Bybit 92.7 rupees (around $1.1 million) on January 31, saying the exchange engaged in “persistent and continuous” violations of the 2005 Prevention of Money Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules. As a Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider (VDASP), the exchange had reporting obligations, but it had expanded its services in India without registering the new offerings with the FIU-IND. Bybit’s suspension is part of a larger crackdown Bybit suspended all services to Indian users except withdrawals on Jan. 12, citing new and continuing regulatory issues. The suspension even applied to Bybit payment cards in India. The exchange said the suspension would be temporary. The exchange announced its payment of the fine and FIU-IND registration on Feb. 6. It noted that it had applied to the agency to become a registered VDASP in India in June 2024. The FIU-IND cracked down on foreign crypto exchanges in December 2023, alleging they did not observe the agency’s regulations. The exchanges affected included Binance, which was shut out of the country until June, when it paid a $2.2 million fine to the FIU-IND. India’s approach to crypto is evolving The Indian government has shown little enthusiasm for cryptocurrency, imposing strict regulations on the industry and high taxes on profits from digital assets. Part of exchange’s reporting obligations involve taxation. Crypto exchanges themselves are liable to taxation as well. In December, the Finance Ministry declared that domestic and foreign crypto exchanges owe an aggregate 8.24 billion rupees in back taxes. Binance owed the lion’s share of back taxes. A rift within the government came to light in May, when the Securities and Exchange Board of India recommended that government agencies regulate crypto. That position contrasts with the central bank view that retail crypto is a macroeconomic risk. In a February interview with Reuters, Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth said India was reconsidering its stance on cryptocurrency in light of world trends. In any case, India led the world in cryptocurrency adoption in 2023 and 2024, according to the annual Chainalysis survey.

But not all cryptos are created equal. Some projects are proving to be standout picks, combining cutting-edge technology, massive adoption potential, and real-world use cases that could drive rapid growth. Three cryptos currently leading the pack? Qubetics ($TICS) , Astra (ASTR), and Celestia (TIA). Astra (ASTR) is making waves by integrating AI with blockchain, ensuring enhanced automation, compliance, and efficiency in decentralized finance. Celestia (TIA) is tackling blockchain scalability issues with its modular architecture, allowing developers to build high-performance applications on a flexible, independent execution layer. But if you’re looking for the best crypto to join for short-term profits this month, Qubetics ($TICS) takes the crown. With its revolutionary QubeQode IDE, it’s reshaping how developers create smart contracts and interact with blockchain networks. Let’s take a deep dive into why these three cryptos are catching investors’ eyes right now. Qubetics: The Game-Changer in Smart Contract Development For years, blockchain development has been complicated, time-consuming, and expensive. Smart contract coding required deep technical expertise, and interoperability between blockchains was a nightmare. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a project designed to streamline blockchain development through its QubeQode IDE. QubeQode IDE is an intuitive, AI-powered development environment that allows businesses and developers to write, test, and deploy smart contracts seamlessly. Instead of spending weeks or months coding, this tool allows developers to build blockchain applications with greater speed and efficiency, regardless of the network they want to use. For example, a financial platform looking to create cross-chain lending services can do so without struggling with different programming languages or complex integrations. Similarly, gaming platforms can build decentralized economies across multiple blockchains with ease, all thanks to QubeQode IDE’s compatibility and automation. With over 461 million tokens already sold, and more than 18,600 holders participating in the presale, Qubetics is proving to be a massive success before even hitting the open market. The current presale price of $0.0667 per $TICS token is set to increase by 10% in the 21st stage at the weekend, making now the ideal time to get involved. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem that’s removing barriers to blockchain development and adoption. For those looking for short-term profits and long-term growth, Qubetics stands at the top. Astra: AI-Powered Compliance & Automation Blockchain meets artificial intelligence with Astra (ASTR), a crypto that’s making waves for its ability to enhance DeFi automation, compliance, and security. The project is bringing AI-powered automation into finance, security, and risk management, ensuring that blockchain applications can operate more efficiently and comply with global regulations. One of Astra’s biggest breakthroughs is its KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) automation system. Regulatory compliance has been a major headache for blockchain companies, but Astra is solving this by using AI to automate identity verification and fraud detection, making transactions more secure and trustworthy. Picture a decentralized exchange that wants to comply with global regulations without burdening its users with long verification processes. Astra’s system automates these checks in real-time, keeping platforms both secure and user-friendly. With regulatory pressure mounting on the crypto industry, Astra’s ability to streamline compliance while maintaining decentralization makes it a must-watch project. Whether you’re looking at short-term gains or long-term adoption, Astra is proving itself as one of the best cryptos to join for short-term profits this month. Celestia: A Modular Blockchain Built for Scalability Scalability has been a major issue for blockchain networks. As more projects demand high-speed, low-cost transactions, older blockchains struggle to keep up. This is where Celestia (TIA) comes in—its modular blockchain architecture separates consensus from execution, allowing developers to build high-performance applications with maximum flexibility. Traditional blockchains like Ethereum handle everything on a single layer, making them slower and more expensive as traffic increases. Celestia fixes this by letting developers run their own execution environments, meaning they can process transactions and smart contracts without congestion from other applications. For example, a logistics company using blockchain for supply chain tracking can create a dedicated execution layer that processes thousands of transactions per second, independent of other applications. This ensures fast, scalable, and cost-effective blockchain adoption. With Celestia gaining traction as one of the most efficient and scalable blockchain solutions, it’s no surprise that investors are eyeing it for short-term profits and long-term innovation. Whether it’s used for DeFi, NFTs, or enterprise applications, Celestia is proving itself as one of the best cryptos to join for short-term profits this month. Conclusion Finding the best cryptos to join for short-term profits this month requires looking beyond hype and focusing on real-world applications, adoption potential, and innovation. Among the top contenders, Qubetics, Astra, and Celestia offer massive opportunities for both short-term traders and long-term investors. Qubetics ($TICS) is changing blockchain development with QubeQode IDE, simplifying smart contract creation and expanding cross-chain capabilities. Astra (ASTR) is leading AI-driven blockchain automation, ensuring fast, secure, and compliant decentralized transactions. Celestia (TIA) is revolutionizing blockchain scalability, offering a modular solution for high-performance applications. For those seeking short-term gains with long-term potential, Qubetics is the standout pick. Its strong presale numbers, cutting-edge technology, and growing ecosystem make it a must-watch crypto in February 2025.

Analyst Eye Potential 306X Surge,https://coingape.com/will-dogecoin-price-rally-to-20-analyst-eye-potential-306x-surge/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) price has gained attention following recent price analyses indicating a potential surge. Analysts suggest that if DOGE maintains a critical support level, it could see a significant rally. The cryptocurrency has shown resilience, remaining within an ascending channel, which could indicate further upward movement. Could Dogecoin Price Hit $20 in the Next Bull Run? Analyst Javon Marks has shared insights on Dogecoin price, suggesting that its historical market cycles indicate the potential for a substantial rally. Marks referenced previous cycles where DOGE experienced exponential growth, with a 90X increase in 2017 and a surge exceeding 306X in 2021. He noted that each bullish phase outperformed the previous one, supporting the possibility of an even larger price jump in the next cycle. His analysis projects that if DOGE follows the same pattern, it could experience another massive rally, surpassing its previous all-time high. Marks highlighted that DOGE demonstrated a repeating trend of accumulation and breakout phases. He suggested that if this trend holds, DOGE could achieve a crypto rally exceeding 306X, pushing its price beyond $20. Source: X More so, Marks’ analysis points to the possibility of continued expansion, with the cryptocurrency following its previous performance trajectory. Similarly, a recent CoinGape report highlighted the crypto rally, emphasizing Dogecoin price movements aligning with past market cycles. If the top meme coin price structure follows the 2017 trend, the DOGE price could be on track for a new all-time high. However, breaking through the key resistance level at $0.30 remains crucial for sustained upward momentum. DOGE Must Hold Above $0.19 to Sustain Momentum Analyst Ali Martinez provided a separate technical perspective on Dogecoin price, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a key support level. According to his analysis, DOGE must remain above $0.19 to retain its bullish setup. If this level holds, the meme coin could see a crypto rally targeting a potential rise toward $10. Martinez’s chart illustrates an ascending price channel, showing that DOGE has historically followed a structured upward trend. He identified multiple resistance and support zones, suggesting that the asset could continue its upward momentum. His analysis indicates that breaking below $0.19 could weaken the bullish outlook, while sustained price action above this level may drive further gains. Source: X Top Meme Coin Price Action Both analysts present scenarios where Dogecoin price could see notable gains. Marks’ projection points to the possibility of the meme coin surpassing $20 if it follows its historical market cycles. Meanwhile, Martinez’s technical analysis suggests that maintaining a key support level could lead to a parabolic rise toward $10. However, despite the bullish projections, Dogecoin (DOGE) price has experienced a 14% decline in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.002134. Market data shows that the meme coin trading volume surged by 64.53% to $6.37 million, indicating heightened activity. On the positive, DOGE whales have been buying aggressively, accumulating 750 million tokens amid the recent price drop to $0.2. This large-scale accumulation suggests strong investor confidence and a potential rebound in Dogecoin price. The post Will Dogecoin Price Rally To $20?

Pectra upgrade to enhance wallet functionality, staking limits, and network efficiency. Fusaka upgrade plans include encrypted mempools and improved transaction tracking tools. Ethereum appears ready for a major move, with analysts watching closely for a breakout above $4,000—a key level for further gains. Ali Martinez predicts that if Ethereum breaks through resistance, it might climb to $7,400, $10,000, or even $14,000. The price currently hovers around $2,705.34 , reflecting a 2.36% drop in the last 24 hours. Support is found at $1,850, while resistance at $4,000 stands as a major barrier.

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1.5 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1.5 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN.

The regulatory agency acknowledged the proposal in a Thursday filing, inviting public comments within 21 days of its publication in the Federal Register. BlackRock’s Proposal for Bitcoin ETF In-Kind Redemptions According to an X post by ETF Store President Nate Geraci, the US SEC is evaluating whether to approve in-kind redemptions for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF which recently expanded to Europe . The Nasdaq submitted an amended 19b-4 filing on behalf of BlackRock, requesting this change for the iShares Bitcoin Trust. The SEC had previously required cash redemptions for Bitcoin ETFs when it approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Under the current model, when an investor redeems shares, the issuer sells Bitcoin and distributes cash to the investor. BlackRock’s proposal would instead allow authorized participants (APs) to receive Bitcoin directly rather than cash. Potential Benefits of In-Kind Redemptions If approved, in-kind redemptions could provide advantages for institutional investors by reducing transaction costs and improving market liquidity. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that this change would not apply to retail investors, as only APs—typically large financial institutions—would be allowed to redeem shares in Bitcoin. Shifting from cash-based redemptions to in-kind transactions could also help avoid forced Bitcoin sales, which might reduce downward price pressure on the asset. This process would make Bitcoin ETFs function more like traditional commodity ETFs, such as those for gold. Regulatory Shift in Bitcoin ETF Policies The SEC’s decision to consider in-kind redemptions marks a shift from its earlier position. When the agency initially approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, it favored a cash model due to concerns about market manipulation and volatility. However, with growing institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs, the regulatory stance appears to be evolving. BlackRock’s request comes amid broader changes in the crypto investment landscape. In August 2023, Grayscale Investments won a lawsuit against the SEC, forcing the regulator to review its rejection of Grayscale’s attempt to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF. This legal victory contributed to the eventual approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Meanwhile, amid the cooling off of the crypto regulations, the CBOE BZX Exchange has also filed 19b-4 applications for XRP ETFs with the SEC on behalf of Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and WisdomTree.

The firms demand the immediate removal of tokens that misuse their names, logos, and intellectual property. Burwick Law Accuses Pump.Fun of Ignoring IP Violations In a statement released on social networking platform X, Burwick Law asserts that Pump.Fun has the technical ability to remove these tokens but has opted not to act despite the potential risks to the public. The law firms argue that Pump.Fun has allowed third parties to create these tokens to “intimidate” their clients and undermine ongoing legal actions. Unfortunately, hundreds of memecoins that mimic or mock Burwick and Wolf Popper remain active on the platform, raising concerns about Pump.Fun’s commitment to addressing intellectual property violations. Pump.Fun Faces Legal Heat Over Alleged Deceptive Practices It worth noting that the cease-and-desist letter follows a proposed class-action lawsuit filed by Burwick Law and Wolf Popper on January 30. The lawsuit, filed by memecoin investor Diego Aguilar in the Southern District of New York, alleges that Pump.Fun promotes tokens with Ponzi-like characteristics targeting younger, less affluent investors. The plaintiff alleges that he incurred significant losses after investing in three memecoins—FRED, FWOG, and GRIFFAIN—created via Pump.Fun, which he claims were marketed as having the potential for exponential returns. Dogshit2 Token Surges Amid Legal Drama Meanwhile, Dogshit2, one of the memecoins linked to the lawsuit, hit a $23 million market cap on Monday. Recent data from CoinGecko shows that Dogshit2 has seen a massive rise, with its trading volume increasing by over 1000 percent in the past 24 hours, pushing its market capitalization to $8.7 billion—a 242 percent increase. Despite its sudden popularity, Dogshit2 has not been absorbed in the linked lawsuit as it continues to face accusations of being part of a “high-risk pump-and-dump” scheme. Burwick Law has firmly denied any connection to the token to distance itself from further controversy, stating that neither it nor Wolf Popper has launched or endorsed any memecoins. The firm also dismissed claims that a blockchain address linked to Dogshit2 appears in their legal documents, calling such allegations “completely false.” Incidentally, these class actions come just days after Donald Trump’s self-named memecoin, TRUMP, experienced a sharp decline, losing 44% of its value since its peak of $73.43 in January.

Plot Twist: Investing Now Could Yield Massive Returns,https://thecoinrise.com/best-presale-crypto-projects-to-consider-now-plot-twist-investing-now-could-yield-massive-returns/,"Crypto presales are often a straightforward and lucrative investment route. You invest early at a low price and, if the project is successful, you could end up with an asset significantly more valuable than your initial payment. Historical data confirms this: numerous projects, like Ethereum during its early days, sold tokens at prices much lower than their later worth. However, not every presale is the same, and understanding a project’s vision and functionality is crucial for identifying true opportunities from potential flops. Here we present the top four ICOs currently on the market. While they all look promising, only one could be your ticket to substantial financial gains. Keep reading to discover which is the best crypto presale to consider now! 1. Web3Bay: Most Demanded Web3 Crypto! Ever hoped that online shopping could empower users instead of big companies? Web3Bay (3BAY) is turning this idea into reality. Moving away from traditional e-commerce giants, Web3Bay leverages blockchain technology for a decentralized marketplace that offers safer and more beneficial transactions. At the heart of Web3Bay’s approach are smart contracts—automated agreements that promote total fairness and remove the necessity for intermediaries. This eliminates hidden fees, privacy worries, and central control. Unique to Web3Bay is its community governance system, where 3BAY token holders can propose and vote on important decisions, directing the platform’s trajectory. The excitement around Web3Bay’s presale is noticeable, with over $1 million raised and more than 280 million tokens distributed. With the current price at $0.004562625 in Stage 4 and an expected launch price of $0.1959, early investors could see a return of approximately 4,200%. Web3Bay’s innovative vision for e-commerce and significant potential for returns makes it the best presale crypto project . 2. Dive into Gains with The Last Dwarfs Think crypto investment is just about holding tokens? The Last Dwarfs (TLD) is here to shake things up by merging gaming with investment opportunities in a thrilling and smart way. $TLD fuels a GameFi world where players can farm, battle, and devise strategies to earn crypto prizes. That is why it’s listed as one of the best presale crypto projects. This platform introduces a gamified launchpad, bringing a strategic twist to early blockchain investments. Players engage in an interactive game environment to unlock access to promising crypto assets, refreshing the typical presale approach. 3. Wall Street Pepe: Memes & Finance Collide While many meme coins thrive on buzz, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is setting a new standard by integrating viral charm with decentralized finance tools. WEPE offers users advanced DeFi trading tools, such as analytics, automated trading strategies, and unique market insights. This represents a savvy evolution in a sector often dismissed as merely speculative. Memecoins that provide actual value—like Shiba Inu with its staking features—tend to persist longer. If WEPE can successfully merge entertainment with utility, it might just be the top presale crypto project to consider now, amidst a sea of fleeting trends. 4. Meme Index: Top Meme Coin For those who are drawn to meme coins but wish to minimize risks, Meme Index (MEMEX) provides an ingenious solution. Rather than gambling on one token, MEMEX functions like an ETF for meme coins, encapsulating the performance of favorites like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin into a single index. This method simplifies enjoying the peaks of meme coin fluctuations without the pressure of selecting the next big winner. It’s an attractive option in a volatile market, where meme tokens can either soar or plummet unpredictably. By investing in MEMEX, enthusiasts can engage with the meme coin market broadly, balancing potential gains and losses. Wrapping Up: Best Presale Crypto Projects to Consider Now In summary, The Last Dwarfs innovates with its gamified investment model, Wall Street Pepe blends meme fun with financial tools, and the Meme Index allows for diversified meme coin investment. Yet, for those seeking practical utility coupled with substantial financial upside, Web3Bay stands out as the best presale crypto project to consider now. With a potential 4,200% ROI by its launch for early 3BAY token buyers, Web3Bay promises not only to redefine e-commerce but also to offer lucrative returns in the process!

40015366,https://timestabloid.com/?p=56499,1738886423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE’s Slide Continues While WallitIQ (WLTQ) Skyrockets 20,000%—Will DOGE Even Survive The 2025 Bull Market?",https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-price-prediction-doges-slide-continues-while-wallitiq/,"There is a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market even as the Dogecoin price continues its downward slide, and many investors are beginning to wonder if the once-celebrated DOGE can survive the upcoming bull market. Amid this uncertainty, a new powerhouse, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token , is emerging with the potential to deliver an astronomical 20,000% surge in the imminent bull market. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The DeFi Revolution Set To Outshine DOGE WallitIQ (WLTQ) is a groundbreaking DeFi platform that redefines the crypto wallet experience. This unique platform offers a robust and intuitive interface backed by cutting-edge AI-powered behavioral analysis. This technology adapts to user preferences, creating a smoother, more personalized experience that is far superior to traditional wallets. With a revolutionary security infrastructure , the platform provides a unique Push Protocol technology, which offers real-time on-chain notifications to keep users informed of wallet activity, adding an extra layer of transparency and security, unlike any other crypto wallet in the world. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform has also launched a cutting-edge MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App that sets new standards in DeFi utility. By integrating CoinGecko API , users can maximize live market data, real-time sentiment analysis, and advanced biometric security measures. The app delivers a modern and user-friendly experience that allows users to simulate the management of crypto wallets for ETH and USDT, display QR codes for easy payments , and even send tokens to external addresses. The platform’s native token is engineered for explosive growth in the bull market. With competitive staking rewards that allow investors to earn up to 180% APY , the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token not only provides an exceptional passive income opportunity but also removes the need to convert other cryptocurrencies to cover transaction fees. A crypto expert has confidently projected that WallitIQ (WLTQ) could surge by an eye-popping 20,000% in the 2025 bull market, a projection that dwarfs the modest recovery prospects of the Dogecoin price. Imagine the transformative power of this growth: if you invest $1,000 at the current presale price of $0.0420 , a 20,000% surge would turn that into $200,000. Similarly, a $10,000 investment could multiply to $2 million, and a $100,000 stake could yield an astonishing $20 million. These numbers make it abundantly clear why the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is capturing global attention. With its Beta platform close to launching and its CoinMarketCap listing and a SolidProof smart contract audit building confidence in investors, it’s no surprise that the ongoing presale is regarded as a pot of gold ahead of the crypto bull market in 2025. Dogecoin Price Continues To Fade In This New Era The Dogecoin price is facing persistent challenges. The decline in DOGE’s performance has led many seasoned investors to reconsider their strategies. While DOGE might have been a household name during the last bull market, the current Dogecoin price trajectory suggests that DOGE may not be able to withstand the rigorous demands of a new, more advanced bull market in 2025. As the Dogecoin price declines, investors are now looking for altcoins that offer actual utility and innovation, qualities that DOGE lacks. Crypto whales and institutional investors remain pessimistic about Dogecoin price volatility and are shifting their capital away from DOGE. Conclusion: Secure Your Future With WallitIQ (WLTQ) The upcoming bull market in 2025 is poised to reward early adopters, and the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is at the forefront of this revolution. While the Dogecoin price might show signs of recovery, it simply cannot compete with the massive 20,000% surge projected for the AI token. With its innovative technology , unmatched security features, and a presale opportunity that offers a chance to transform a modest investment into millions, this unique token stands as the ultimate altcoin for the next phase of crypto growth. Investors who seize the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale at $0.0420 are not merely buying a token; they are securing a future of financial independence and monumental wealth. Act now before the price skyrockets and the window of opportunity closes. Seize your chance to embrace the future of decentralized finance and quadruple your portfolio in this 2025 bull market.

Solana’s DEX Volume Soars",https://thecoinrise.com/hottest-crypto-updates-eth-price-jumps-traders-flock-to-blockdag-for-unlimited-usdt-rewards-solanas-dex-volume-soars/,"The blockchain world is witnessing exciting developments as platforms vie for prominence. Solana’s DEX volume surge demonstrates increased user activity, while Ethereum’s recent price rise signals growing institutional interest. These trends highlight shifting market dynamics. However, neither addresses blockchain scalability as effectively as BlockDAG . While Ethereum benefits from ETF inflows and Solana gains traction through high-volume trading, BlockDAG is built for efficiency and real-time transactions. Its affiliate program further boosts accessibility, giving users a direct path to benefit from adoption. As attention remains on market leaders, BlockDAG’s approach offers a compelling alternative for sustainable blockchain growth. Boost Your Earnings with BlockDAG’s Affiliate Program BlockDAG’s Affiliate Program offers a rewarding way to generate passive income by introducing new participants. With an instant 5% cashback in USDT (BEP-20) for both the referrer and the purchaser, participants can easily monetize their network. Getting started is simple. Connect your wallet to BlockDAG’s platform, and you’ll receive a unique affiliate link. Share this link with friends, communities, or followers. Every successful purchase made through your link triggers an immediate reward. Unlike many referral programs with delays or complex payout structures, BlockDAG ensures commissions are credited instantly. Another benefit is the dual reward system. When someone buys through your referral, both you and the buyer receive 5% cashback. This makes it an attractive incentive for new participants. The program requires minimal effort—once a qualifying purchase is made, the referral system activates automatically. To enhance user experience, BlockDAG provides a detailed dashboard. This dashboard offers insights into referral activity, earnings, and conversions. There’s no limit on the number of referrals. The more you promote, the greater your potential rewards. The presale has already raised over $192.5 million across 27 batches, selling over 18.3 billion BDAG coins to over 170,000 unique holders globally. The coin is currently priced at $0.0248, reflecting a 2380% surge since batch 1. Miner sales have generated over $6.2 million, with over 15,500 miners sold. Solana’s DEX Volume Surges Solana recently recorded $200 billion in monthly DEX trading volume. This figure surpasses trading on Ethereum and its Layer 2 networks. This remarkable growth was partly fueled by the recent launch of a Trump-themed coin on the Solana blockchain, which spurred significant user activity. Currently, Solana (SOL) is trading at $246, an 18% increase over the past week. Its market capitalization now stands at $120.05 billion, placing it fifth in the cryptocurrency market. In addition to the impressive DEX volume, Grayscale has applied to introduce a Solana ETF on the New York Stock Exchange. This move has generated considerable market interest and is considered a potential catalyst for future price growth. Analysts believe these developments could lead to increased institutional adoption, pushing SOL’s price closer to $300. Technical indicators also suggest a bullish outlook. The recent break of a bullish pennant formation indicates potential for continued upward momentum. If Solana maintains its current trajectory, supported by strong user engagement and institutional interest, reaching $300 in the future seems increasingly likely. What’s Driving Ethereum’s Price Rise? Ethereum’s price rose 7.5% to $3,421 on January 24, 2025. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, gained 2.6% and crossed $105,000, reflecting the overall market recovery. Positive sentiment was also boosted by Trump’s recent executive order supporting digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Significant inflows into ETH-focused ETFs also contributed to the rise. For example, BlackRock’s ETHA fund saw inflows of $287.7 million between January 13 and January 23, signalling growing institutional interest. Technically, Ethereum is trading above key support levels between $3,200 and $3,390, with resistance expected at $3,502 and $4,109. Analysts predict Ethereum could reach $7,000 in the first quarter of 2025, with nearer-term targets of $3,850 and $4,840. The combination of strong market sentiment and increased institutional involvement makes Ethereum’s outlook promising. Final Thoughts As Ethereum’s institutional support strengthens and Solana’s trading activity expands, the focus remains on scalability and real-world utility. While both networks demonstrate strong momentum, they still face challenges in transaction efficiency and accessibility. BlockDAG offers a structure designed for seamless transactions and user-driven rewards. Its affiliate program not only encourages adoption but also strengthens community participation. While traditional blockchain networks address scalability gradually, BlockDAG’s direct approach to efficiency and engagement provides a distinct advantage.

As the presale for FXGuys continues to exceed expectations, reaching over $3.4 million, it's clear that the project has the potential to achieve massive gains. Let’s explore the factors fueling $FXG’s rise! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Cardano’s New Hope: Is the New Initiative Enough to Save ADA? The Cardano Foundation (CF) has launched its Venture Hub pilot program . The initiative aims to provide personalized guidance and technical expertise to Cardano-based projects. Cardano’s educational arm, Cardano Academy, introduced the Venture Hub to refine the Foundation’s support structure. Despite the Foundation’s positive efforts, internal conflicts continue to affect ADA’s outlook. Founder Charles Hoskinson has expressed dissatisfaction with the Foundation’s governance. He criticized the Swiss authorities for appointing board members without user voting rights. Hoskinson described this process as unfavorable to transparency and accountability. While Cardano is working to address these issues, recent price movements show challenges. ADA dropped from $1.13 to $0.92 in January 2025. However, the Venture Hub is driving optimism, with price projections predicting a rise to $2 by the end of 2025. Even with this potential, experts suggest that ADA may face stiff competition from other leading tokens. Among these, $FXG stands out as an emerging top DeFi token. Its unique offerings and strong market presence could see it outperform ADA in the coming months. Grayscale’s Interest Boosts Hedera, But Will HBAR Keep Up as a Top DeFi Token? Hedera Hashgraph’s HBAR token has gained attention, with Grayscale Investments adding it to their “assets under consideration.” This move signals growing institutional interest in Hedera’s enterprise blockchain solutions. Grayscale’s potential investment in HBAR could provide a significant boost to the token’s adoption and market performance. As a leader in crypto asset management, Grayscale’s backing typically results in heightened exposure and confidence in a token. Despite this growing interest, HBAR has faced challenges. The token price dropped from $0.328 to $0.258 in January 2025. Analysts predict a potential recovery to $0.660 by year-end, though investor confidence remains cautious. Institutional investors are eyeing HBAR’s potential, but its place as a top DeFi token faces competition from other projects. Among these is the rising DeFi star $FXG. FXGuys vs. Cardano & Hedera: Which One is the Future of DeFi? Since its debut in Q4 of 2024, FXGuys has emerged as a top DeFi token, offering powerful solutions that outshine rivals like Cardano and Hedera. Experts believe $FXG has the potential to achieve massive gains, particularly when compared to other projects in the crypto space and here's why! One of FXGuys' standout features is its Trade2Earn program. This unique system allows traders to earn $FXG tokens with every trade, regardless of the outcome. By increasing trading activity, $FXG tokens help foster a dynamic and rewarding ecosystem, benefiting both traders and holders alike. This approach increases volume and solidifies the utility of the top DeFi token as it continues to grow in market presence. FXGuys’ staking program delivers up to a 20% APY, making it a tempting option for long-term investors. Designed to keep $FXG tokens active within the ecosystem, it stabilizes prices and benefits loyal holders. Additionally, the no-buy, no-sell tax facilitates smooth and fee-free transactions for every trader. When compared to other projects like Cardano and Hedera, the FX Guys platform stands out in terms of delivering real-world utility.

As FXGuys' presale continues to surpass expectations, having already accumulated over $3.4 million, the project shows significant potential for notable returns. Let's delve into the elements driving $FXG's ascension! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Cardano's Fresh Initiative: Can It Revitalize ADA? The Cardano Foundation (CF) has unveiled its Venture Hub pilot program . This new initiative is designed to offer tailored guidance and technical support to projects based on Cardano. The Cardano Academy, CF's educational division, launched the Venture Hub to enhance the Foundation's support framework. Despite these constructive moves, internal disputes continue to cloud ADA's prospects. Founder Charles Hoskinson has voiced his dissatisfaction with the Foundation's leadership, criticizing Swiss authorities for appointing board members without allowing user voting rights. He labeled this process as lacking in transparency and accountability. Even as Cardano strives to resolve these challenges, recent price trends indicate hurdles. ADA fell from $1.13 to $0.92 in January 2025. Yet, optimism from the Venture Hub could lead to price forecasts suggesting an increase to $2 by the end of 2025. Despite this potential, experts believe ADA may encounter tough competition from other leading tokens, with $FXG emerging as a prominent DeFi contender. Its distinct features and robust market stance might enable it to surpass ADA in the months to come. Grayscale's Interest Lifts Hedera, But Can HBAR Stay at the Top of DeFi? Hedera Hashgraph's HBAR token has caught attention as Grayscale Investments considers adding it to their ""assets under consideration."" This development indicates a rising institutional interest in Hedera's enterprise blockchain solutions. Grayscale's potential investment in HBAR could significantly enhance the token's adoption and market performance. As a prominent player in crypto asset management, Grayscale's support typically boosts a token's visibility and credibility. Despite this growing attention, HBAR has faced obstacles. The token's price decreased from $0.328 to $0.258 in January 2025. Analysts anticipate a possible rebound to $0.660 by year's end, though investor confidence remains tentative. Institutional investors are watching HBAR's potential, yet its position as a leading DeFi token is challenged by other projects, including the promising DeFi newcomer $FXG. FXGuys Against Cardano & Hedera: Who Leads the Future of DeFi? Since launching in the last quarter of 2024, FXGuys has established itself as a leading DeFi token, providing dynamic solutions that outshine competitors like Cardano and Hedera. Experts assert that $FXG is poised for substantial gains, especially when compared to other projects in the crypto sphere, and here's why! A standout feature of FXGuys is its Trade2Earn program. This innovative system rewards traders with $FXG tokens for every trade, regardless of the result. By boosting trading activity, $FXG tokens foster a vibrant and rewarding ecosystem, benefiting both traders and holders. This strategy enhances volume and reinforces the utility of this leading DeFi token as it continues to expand its market presence. FXGuys' staking program offers up to a 20% annual percentage yield (APY), making it an attractive option for long-term investors. It aims to keep $FXG tokens active within the ecosystem, stabilizing prices and benefiting loyal holders. Furthermore, the absence of a buy or sell tax ensures smooth and fee-free transactions for every trader. When stacked against projects like Cardano and Hedera, the FX Guys platform is exceptional in delivering practical utility. While Cardano and Hedera emphasize scalability and enterprise adoption, FXGuys is sharply focused on empowering individual traders with the tools for success. This makes $FXG the premier DeFi token for those aiming to engage in a decentralized ecosystem with a genuine sense of community and support. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG's Presale Reaches $3.4 Million: Anticipate Significant Returns as the Token Launches at $0.10!

The top three cryptos on their radar are Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and FXGuys ($FXG). These top altcoins have historically demonstrated impressive performance, and investors are now confused which coin should they pick for the best gains in 2025. Here, we will cover recent developments around these coins to highlight the best crypto to buy! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Experts Claim Ripple’s XRP Looks Fine Despite a Price Plunge The crypto market is going through a rough patch heading into February 2025, with Bitcoin crashing below $100,000 again and several altcoins following suit. Amid this development, CryptoInsightUK, a well-known commentator, has spotlighted XRP , assuring his followers that they have nothing to worry about. Taking to X on February 2, 2025, CryptoInsightUK noted that many people are panicking due to XRP plummeting, but the asset looks fine. In the last two months of the past year, XRP shot up the charts, breaking through several resistances and settling down very close to its all-time high. The market has become quieter, with the RSI cooling off nicely and the stochastic RSI flooring out. The RSI is slightly below the midpoint at 48.49, having descended from the overbought region at 70 during the upswing. He added that on the four-hour chart, XRP is coming out of the oversold region across the RSI and Stochastic RSI metrics, setting the tone for a potential rebound. If it happens, the anticipated rally could see the Ripple coin surpassing the $3.20 level, which would be a 24% increase in its current price of $2.68 after a 7% weekly loss. Solana Risks Slumping to $211 If SOL Doesn’t Scale a Key Resistance Zone Solana failed to break above its all-time high as the bears took control, with selling pressure climbing. Upside momentum is waning, leaving investors on the sidelines and watching how SOL behaves in the next few days. Carl Runefelt, a technical analyst, shared his two cents on SOL’s outlook and possible outcome in an X post on February 1, 2025. The analyst stated that Solana might retest the $222 resistance level from its current price, provided it breaks out of a daily bearish flag. This retest will likely be followed by a pullback towards $211, where the asset’s fate will be determined. However, if the bulls successfully defend current levels, SOL could push above the next supply zone and begin a price recovery. In this case, Solana could gather enough strength to challenge higher levels moving forward. SOL is currently down 5% this week to $214. FXGuys Prepares For a 100x Rally in 2025: The Best Crypto to Buy? FXGuys is becoming more popular because of the profit potential of its native token, $FXG. With over $3.83 million raised in its presale so far, $FXG is one of the most adopted DeFi projects today. But there’s more to it than meets the eye. Specifically, the FXGuys proprietary trading platform allows users to access several asset classes, from stocks to cryptocurrencies and commodities, and provides capital to trade these assets. This funding initiative is a part of its trader development programs geared toward helping traders achieve their financial goals. After passing a challenge phase set up by the firm, traders can access up to $500,000 in trading capital, with a chance to keep 80% of the profits made. To incentivize users of the prop trading firm, the FX Guys platform is introducing the Trade2Earn initiative. This initiative will allow traders to receive $FXG tokens for every trade they execute. So, when they buy or sell on the platform, $FXG is deposited into their wallets as a reward. Rather than holding the $FXG token and waiting for its price to increase before making a profit, holders can stake their token and earn up to a 20% APY. This can serve as an additional source of income for FXGuys users. $FXG has many use cases, making it a valuable asset with a bright future. Its presale performance mirrors that of some established altcoins, and experts predict it can rise 100x after its exchange debut. But the main question is, is it the best crypto to buy now? >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG Ranks as the Best Crypto to Invest in Among Top Altcoins Compared to XRP and SOL, $FXG is a relatively new crypto coin with a long way to go. If it were to reach the levels of these top altcoins, investors would realize more than a 100x return on their investment. $FXG currently sells for $0.05 in Stage 3 of its public presale. With its launch price set at $0.10, Stage 3 investors can secure 100% gains upon its exchange listing. Experts also believe that the token price will pump 100x right after its exchange debut. Based on its post-launch projection, $FXG would be the best crypto to buy after XRP and SOL. So, don’t hesitate to buy $FXG tokens now!

40013887,https://coingape.com/?p=237564,1738886801,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Gemini Exchange Mulling IPO Public Listing Route This Year: Report,https://coingape.com/gemini-exchange-mulling-ipo-public-listing-route-this-year/,"Backed by the popular Winklevoss brothers Cameron and Tyler, crypto exchange Gemini is allegedly mulling conducting an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the United States. As reported by Bloomberg, citing anonymous, the trading platform has a timeline for later this year. The Gemini IPO Plans Gemini hopes to go public this year via the Initial Public Offering route, showcasing the growing interest in the cryptocurrency market. In a recent interview, Cameron Winklevoss acknowledged that the company is open to an IPO. Furthermore, he noted that the ongoing internal discussions are centered around deciding on the timing and feasibility of the move. Per the Bloomberg report , the firm has commenced discussions with several entities, including financial advisors. However, no decision has been made on the key details relating to the IPO. Pending the push for this IPO, Gemini has stayed focused on expanding its business. Last month, it appointed three new executives to pilot its European Union expansion drive. It hopes to build on the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license it secured in France last November. Beyond Gemini, Growing IPO Clamor There is an ongoing trend among crypto firms to go public. This trend could be attributed to the crypto market’s growth over the past year. For example, Bitcoin hit a $108,000 all-time high earlier in January. The coin also has ETF products tracking its price and has now raked in over $50 billion in inflows On this premise, investors’ interest in the burgeoning sector has peaked in recent months. Several firms are now trying to meet the increasing demand for crypto solutions. On the Bitcoin ETF front, companies like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale are among the solution providers. As a thriving digital currency trading platform, Gemini believes an IPO move might help it scale its services. In addition, Bullish Global also has IPO plans , as per an earlier report from CoinGape. While no official announcement has been made yet, there are talks about the exchange operator mulling plans to go public in the US this year. In addition, firms like Circle, Kraken, and Chainalysis are projected to go public later this year. Favorable Crypto Regulation Fueling IPO Hype This hype among crypto firms to go public is connected mainly to the improved regulatory landscape in the United States. President Donald Trump’s administration is pulling resources and investing efforts in implementing favorable crypto policies. Under Mark Uyeda’s leadership, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched a Crypto Task Force. This crypto task force , headed by Hester Peirce, will recommend practical policy measures that encourage innovation and protect investors. Ultimately, the goal is to clarify the application of federal securities laws to the digital currency ecosystem market, which may benefit potential IPO candidates.

While Aave dominated the lending sector and Cardano earned its strong reputation through research-backed blockchain development, another player is on the scene that challenges this status quo: FXGuys. What happens at the heart is that this investor-friendly move, innovative features, and strong global marketing drive make FXGuys a budding force to reckon with in 2025. Let's look at how AAVE and ADA are performing and why $FXG might be the best cryptocurrency investment opportunity in DeFi today! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Aave: Pressure Mounts On This DeFi Giant AAVE has always spearheaded the DeFi space by allowing users to accrue deposit interest and obtain crypto loans without intermediaries. Most recently, AAVE traded at $237 , approximately 19% below its price a week ago. The latest trading range saw a high of $202 and a low of $315. This downturn is attributed to overall market volatility and intensified competition from emerging DeFi projects. However, a recent governance proposal introducing a fee switch and token buy-back program has generated optimism among investors, suggesting potential for future price recovery. Cardano: Strong Fundamentals, But Struggling for Momentum Cardano has long been recognized for its research-driven approach and robust technical foundation. However, despite its ambitious roadmap, ADA has failed to maintain an uptrend in the ongoing market cycle. It recently traded at $0.69 , dipping 20% over the past week. The latest trading range was $0.57 to $0.93. The volatility, coupled with the gradual adoption of its smart contract functionality, has affected investor confidence. While Cardano remains a significant player in cryptocurrency, emerging projects with innovative features are increasingly attracting retail and institutional investors. $FXG: The New DeFi Token Conquering 2025 While AAVE and Cardona are under market pressure, FXGuys is introducing a very rewarding ecosystem for traders and investors. Unlike the competition, FXGuys isn't just another DeFi project; it's a complete financial ecosystem designed to foster growth, innovation, and real utility. Here are a few ways $FXG is dominating the DeFi world: Major Global Marketing: Unlike most DeFi projects, which have relied on organic growth, FXGuys has embarked on an aggressive global marketing campaign. With top-tier influencers, institutional partnerships, and international visibility, this project is rapidly gaining traction.

While Aave has been a leader in the lending sector and Cardano has garnered respect through its research-focused blockchain innovations, a new contender is emerging to challenge these giants: FXGuys. The core of this shift lies in FXGuys' investor-friendly strategies, cutting-edge features, and robust global marketing efforts, positioning it as a formidable force in 2025. Let's delve into AAVE and ADA's current performance and explore why $FXG could be the most promising cryptocurrency investment in today's DeFi scene! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Aave: The DeFi Leader Under Strain AAVE has been at the forefront of the DeFi movement, enabling users to earn interest on deposits and secure crypto loans without intermediaries. Recently, AAVE was valued at $237 , approximately 19% lower than its price a week prior. Its recent trading range spanned from $202 to $315. This decline is largely due to market volatility and fierce competition from emerging DeFi initiatives. Nonetheless, a new governance proposal that includes a fee switch and token buy-back initiative has sparked hope among investors, indicating potential future price recovery. Cardano: Strong Foundations, Yet Lacking Momentum Cardano is known for its research-centric methodology and solid technical framework. Despite its ambitious plans, ADA has struggled to sustain an upward trend in the current market cycle. It recently traded at $0.69 , experiencing a 20% decline over the past week. The trading range spanned from $0.57 to $0.93. The volatility and the slow rollout of its smart contract capabilities have shaken investor confidence. While Cardano maintains its significant status in the crypto world, new projects with cutting-edge features are increasingly drawing the attention of both retail and institutional investors. $FXG: The Rising DeFi Token Dominating 2025 While AAVE and Cardano grapple with market pressures, FXGuys is launching a highly beneficial ecosystem for both traders and investors. Unlike its competitors, FXGuys isn't just another DeFi project; it offers a comprehensive financial ecosystem aimed at fostering growth, innovation, and practical utility. Here's how $FXG is making waves in the DeFi sector: Extensive Global Marketing: Unlike many DeFi projects that rely on organic growth, FXGuys has initiated an extensive global marketing strategy. Collaborating with top influencers, forming institutional partnerships, and increasing international exposure, this project is quickly gaining momentum. Advanced Analytics Subscription: FXGuys provides comprehensive analytics to assist traders and investors in making informed decisions. This subscription service offers users crucial insights to maximize their profits in the crypto sector. Prop Funding Program: FXGuys offers traders the opportunity to access up to $500,000 in prop funding, enabling them to expand their strategies without risking personal funds. This initiative supports talented traders in reaching their full potential. Affiliate and Trade2Earn Programs: FXGuys encourages user growth within its ecosystem through these programs. Uniquely in DeFi, the Trade2Earn model rewards users with FXG tokens based on trading activities, enhancing liquidity. Staking Rewards: FXGuys features a staking rewards program. Holders of $FXG can stake their tokens on the platform, earning up to 20% APY. FXGuys' Market Performance and Growth Prospects FXGuys stands out as a well-thought-out investment with significant growth potential, not just another hyped token. Currently, $FXG is valued at $0.05, offering an excellent early investment opportunity for those looking to benefit from its future rise. The project has secured millions in funding, reflecting strong investor confidence. Currently in its presale phase, investors can purchase before a major exchange listing potentially boosts the price.

The announcement was made by WLF co-founder Chase Herro at the Ondo Summit in New York, where Donald Trump Jr. also expressed strong support for the digital asset industry. Trump Jr. Calls Crypto the “Future of American Hegemony” Donald Trump Jr. made a surprise appearance at the Ondo Summit on Thursday, where he spoke about cryptocurrency’s role in global finance. Addressing industry leaders, he stated that he believes crypto will shape the future of the U.S. economy. “I think it’s perhaps the future of American hegemony, in terms of our economic status, our economic might,” Trump Jr. said at the event. His remarks were part of a broader discussion on the role of digital assets in financial markets and regulatory policies. WLF, which has been actively purchasing digital tokens in recent months, recently acquired $470,000 worth of ONDO, the native cryptocurrency of Ondo Finance. The company has also invested in Ethereum (ETH), wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), Tron’s TRX, AAVE, and Chainlink’s LINK, among other tokens. World Liberty Financial’s Strategic Reserve Plans Chase Herro, co-founder of WLF, revealed that the company is setting up a strategic crypto reserve but did not specify its intended purpose. “We are big builder fans,” he said, referring to WLF’s continued investment in digital assets. The idea of a cryptocurrency reserve has been a topic of discussion since Trump’s presidential campaign last year. In January, he signed an executive action to evaluate the feasibility of a digital asset stockpile. This has fueled speculation about the role WLF could play in shaping national policies on decentralized finance.

From ONDO’s $8.16 million whale move to Coinbase to Hedera's (HBAR) institutional spotlight with Coinbase Derivatives’ futures filing and the groundbreaking solutions of FXGuys ($FXG), the race is on to turn $1,000 into $10,000. While ONDO and Hedera draw attention, FXGuys is stealing the show with its bullish presale momentum and trading solutions. Equipped with zero fees, no-KYC policies, and the potential for 10x gains, $FXG is quickly becoming the go-to DeFi token for investors ready to capitalize on the presale momentum. Discover why these low-cap bets are gaining attention and how you can join the 10x journey today! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE A Whale Moves $8.16 Million Worth of ONDO to Coinbase ONDO experienced a huge volume of transactions over the past week. According to OnchainLens , a crypto whale deposited 5.76 million ONDO tokens, valued at $8.16 million, into Coinbase. This transaction happened after 4 months of inactivity. The whales strategically accumulated these tokens over the year in seven transactions, with the largest purchase of 4.18 million ONDO tokens worth $3.8 million occurring 313 days ago. The whale’s most recent transaction added $180,514 worth of ONDO tokens. ONDO tokens hit a high of $1.60 before plunging to $1.22 due to the market's downtrend. However, experts predict that ONDO could rise to $1.72 in the coming weeks. While the deposit raises concerns about a potential sell-off, it also highlights investors' growing interest in low-cap bets for high returns. A new DeFi token, $FXG, is preparing for a 10x gain rise in 2025, and ONDO holders are taking notice of that. Coinbase Derivatives Files to List Solana and Hedera Futures Coinbase Derivatives, a subsidiary of Coinbase, has submitted filings to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to launch futures contracts for Hedera and Solana, two prominent altcoins. The proposed products will be cash-settled and rolled out every month. Hedera futures will have a contract size of 5,000 HBAR tokens. Solana futures, on the other hand, will be offered in two sizes: 100 SOL and a nano contract of five SOL. Looking at the price performance, Hedera’s HJBAR has taken a bearish fall. Currently, HBAR is trading at $0.23. Experts are pessimistic that the price of HBAR could hit $0.50 in Q1 2025 if the bulls take over. The recent move by Coinbase highlights the growing institutional interest in the top 10 altcoins. While ONDO and Hedera continue to gain traction, smart investors are looking out for more low-cap DeFi tokens like $FXG. FXGuys Emerges as a Top Crypto Trading Platform with the Right Trading Solutions ONDO and Hedera continue to gain traction in the crypto market, but FXGuys is gearing up to become the low-cap investment option every investor needs.

Raza Zaidi, Scroll’s Head of Growth, highlighted the benefits, stating it lets developers build efficient dApps.

Although some investors are buying the dip, renowned crypto market experts say $FXG is the logical option to make higher returns than PEPE since it is not affected by the current market volatility.

40014589,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=691830,1738888233,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Why The Bitcoin Dominance Reaching 71% Is Important For Altcoin Season To Begin,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-dominance-reaching-71/,"Bitcoin continued dominance has remained a defining feature of the current market cycle, with the leading crypto asset receiving most of the inflows into the market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance over the entire market is at 60.3% after a 4% increase in the past 24 hours. Notably, crypto analyst Rekt Capital pointed to the 71% dominance level as an important threshold for crypto investors still awaiting an altcoin season. Reaching 71% Is Critical For An Altcoin Season The Bitcoin dominance chart, which tracks Bitcoin’s market capitalization in relation to the entire crypto market, has consistently risen throughout this cycle, even during periods of price corrections. Bitcoin’s dominance has been fueled by institutional demand after the introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and market dynamics favoring BTC as a potential reserve for countries. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Paused Forever? What The Rising Bitcoin Dominance Says Will Happen A direct consequence of this prolonged Bitcoin dominance has been the sluggish performance of the altcoin market. Although some altcoins like Solana and XRP have managed to outperform Bitcoin for brief periods, the capital has consistently rotated back into Bitcoin, preventing a sustained altcoin market breakout. However, some analysts believe a significant shift could be very close, with Bitcoin dominance now sitting at a multi-year high. One such analyst is an analyst known as Rekt Capital on social media platform X. His analysis reveals a historical pattern where altcoin seasons emerge whenever Bitcoin dominance reaches a key threshold and subsequently faces rejection. According to a Bitcoin dominance chart that accompanied his analysis, Bitcoin’s dominance has been rejected around the 71% level three successive times in the past. Interestingly, each rejection has been marked by Bitcoin’s dominance falling over multiple monthly candles, as altcoins outperformed Bitcoin throughout those months. The most recent occurrence of this pattern was during the 2021 bull market. At the time, Bitcoin dominance briefly spiked above 72% before reversing course. Once rejected, it entered a five-month downtrend, ultimately stabilizing around the 40% level as altcoins took control of the market. Will 71% Trigger A New Altcoin Season? Although Bitcoin’s dominance is not at 71% yet, it is still steadily inching upward towards this level. Particularly, Bitcoin’s dominance is at 60.3%, and there are no signs of slowing down. This means that investors banking on a repeat of rejection around 71% might have to wait longer for the dominance to even reach this level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms First Daily Death Cross On Dominance Chart In 4 Years, What To Expect Next If the 71% dominance level eventually becomes a local top again, historical patterns suggest altcoins could experience rapid gains. However, unlike in previous cycles, Ethereum may not take the lead in an altcoin season this time around. The leading altcoin has struggled to gain momentum this cycle as recent market dynamics have diminished its dominance in relation to other altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, which are witnessing more interest among crypto traders.

He continues to contest money laundering charges in the Netherlands. His release comes ahead of his appeal against a 64-month prison sentence handed down in May 2024. Tornado Cash, a decentralized coin-mixing service, allows users to obscure Ethereum transactions by blending them with others. Authorities have accused the platform of facilitating illicit financial activities, including money laundering. Tornado Cash Sanctions Overturned—Will This Help Pertsev’s Appeal? In a post on social media X, he confirmed his release, stating that returning home would give him “a chance to work on my appeal and fight for justice.” He acknowledged that electronic monitoring is not full freedom but said it is “better than prison.” Dear Friends, on Friday 7 February at 10 am I will be free! It is not real freedom, but it is better than prison. Today, a Dutch court suspended my pretrial detention under the condition of electronic monitoring. This will give me a chance to work on my appeal and fight for… — Alexey Pertsev (@alex_pertsev) February 6, 2025 The Dutch court’s decision follows months of failed bail petitions from Pertsev and increasing scrutiny over the legal treatment of privacy-focused crypto developers. His case has been a focal point for debates over financial privacy and the criminal liability of software developers. Pertsev’s appeal gained momentum after a U.S. federal appeals court ruled in November 2024 that sanctions against Tornado Cash were unlawful. The ruling strengthened arguments from privacy advocates who claim that developers should not be held responsible for how their code is used. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin previously expressed concern over Pertsev’s prosecution, calling it a troubling precedent for developers. Speaking at a conference in Berlin last year, Buterin remarked, “The Alexey thing is definitely really unfortunate. I think a lot of people have been going under the assumption that just building software is something that’s okay and is a totally legal and legit way to fight for privacy.” Also, Pertsev’s defense argues that he was merely developing open-source software and should not be held liable for its misuse. Did Tornado Cash Enable Money Laundering? The Legal Battle Continues The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, alleging that the crypto-mixing service facilitated the laundering of over $7 billion since its inception in 2019. The sanctions primarily focused on its alleged role in laundering $455 million in stolen assets for North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Following the sanctions, Dutch authorities arrested Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev in 2022, accusing him of aiding illicit financial activity. On May 14, 2024, Dutch judges at the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal found Pertsev guilty of money laundering. He was sentenced to five years and four months in prison for allegedly laundering $1.2 billion through the platform. Pertsev has since announced plans to appeal the verdict. During his trial in March, Pertsev argued that he could not be held responsible for how users engaged with Tornado Cash. However, the court rejected this defense, stating that he and the other co-founders should have implemented stronger safeguards to prevent illicit activity. In a suprising legal twist, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas has reversed OFAC’s sanctions against Tornado Cash. According to a January 21, 2025 court filing , the judgment has been overturned and sent back to the district court for further review.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $12.59. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $34.29 and $39.7, with an average value of $35.49. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, which contributes to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon?

TL; DR Breakdown Optimism (OP) has recorded some gains in the short term. Support iholds at $1.023. OP resistance stands at $1.214. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP sees some gains despite bearish dominance The 1-day OP price analysis for February 07 shows a strong downward trend. The digital asset exhibits a series of red candlesticks, indicating strong selling pressure over the past few days. However, a slight recovery is observed as the latest candle shows a small gain of about 1%. Despite this, the overall bearish sentiment remains intact as the price struggles to regain momentum. The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) and the MFI indicates deeply oversold conditions. This suggests that selling pressure is still dominant, although a reversal or at least a short-term recovery might follow if capital inflows increase. Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP is consolidating The 4-hour chart of Optimism (OP) shows consolidation and signs of renewed buyer interest, with the price currently up to $1.05. The recent price action reveals a bounce from the $1.023 support level, instigated by some cash inflow. OP is consolidating The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 39.97, indicating that OP is within the oversold region and could bounce back. The red MACD histogram bars are disappearing, indicating that selling momentum may be fading and a potential reversal could be in play. However, a sustained bullish move would require OP to break past 1.167.

The price is consolidating around $1.04 after a sharp decline. However, for a sustained recovery, OP needs to break above the $1.147 resistance level; otherwise, a drop toward $1.023 and lower remains likely. Is Optimism a good investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up on $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and would require an unprecedented level of growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

However, this is altcoin market cap’s way of producing a shallower retrace to show how $425 billion is weakening as a point of rejection.” Source: Rekt Capital/X The analyst believes the shallower retracement could give the altcoin market cap more firepower to hit new local highs. “Since rejecting from $425 billion resistance (black) altcoin market cap has retraced -51%. This is still shallower compared to the previous rejections from ~$425 billion resistance (-69% and -85%). Should altcoin market cap bottom in the near future, then altcoin market cap will have an easier time at breaking beyond the weakened $425 billion resistance over time.” Source: Rekt Capital/X The OTHERS chart is currently at $271.27 billion. The analyst also updates his outlook on Bitcoin ( BTC ), predicting the flagship crypto asset will trade sideways in the near term on the weekly chart. “Bitcoin revisited the $101,000 level (black). In fact, Bitcoin even daily closed above it, but failed the subsequent post-breakout retest of it into new support BTC is probably going to consolidate between $98,300 and $101,000 for the time being.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Bitcoin is trading for $96,860 at time of writing, down 1.1% in the last 24 hours.

33767162,[object Object],1738890026,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Coinbase Flow Pulse Shows Bullish Trend As Institutional Interest Surges – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-coinbase-flow-pulse-shows-bullish-trend-as-institutional-interest-surges-details/,"Bitcoin has been struggling to reclaim the $100K mark but remains resilient above the $96K level after a sharp market-wide selloff. Sunday night and early Monday saw a capitulation event, primarily affecting altcoins, leading to extreme volatility. BTC dropped over 9% in 24 hours, shaking investor confidence, only to recover more than 11% the same day, reinforcing its strength compared to the rest of the market. Despite the uncertainty, key metrics suggest that Bitcoin remains in a bullish phase. Top analyst Axel Adler shared insights revealing that the Bitcoin Coinbase Flow Pulse is currently signaling strong institutional interest. The absence of significant outflows typically seen in bear markets suggests that major players are still accumulating BTC rather than offloading it. With Bitcoin stabilizing above crucial support levels, the market is now watching whether bulls can reclaim $100K and sustain momentum. If BTC continues to attract institutional demand, a breakout above all-time highs could be on the horizon. However, if BTC loses the $96K level, another wave of selling pressure could emerge. The coming days will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s next major move as it navigates through high volatility and shifting market sentiment. Bitcoin Consolidates As Institutional Interest Grows Bitcoin remains in a consolidation phase, trading between crucial demand around $90K and strong supply near all-time highs. Market performance continues to be shaped by ongoing trade war fears, adding volatility to BTC’s price action. Despite this uncertainty, institutional demand remains strong, suggesting that Bitcoin’s long-term trend is still bullish. Top analyst Axel Adler shared key on-chain data on X , highlighting the Bitcoin Coinbase Flow Pulse. This metric tracks BTC inflows and outflows to and from Coinbase across all exchanges, offering insight into supply and demand dynamics, particularly among major U.S. players. Adler’s analysis shows that Bitcoin is currently in a bullish phase, largely driven by institutional accumulation. One of the most important takeaways from Adler’s findings is the absence of significant red zones on the Bitcoin Coinbase Flow Pulse. These red zones typically indicate large-scale outflows, which are common in bear markets when capital shifts from the spot market to futures. Since no such outflows have been observed, it suggests that major players are holding onto their BTC rather than selling into the market. As Bitcoin continues to consolidate, traders are watching for a breakout above ATH or a potential retest of lower support. If institutional demand remains strong, BTC could soon push into price discovery. Bitcoin Struggles Below $100K Bitcoin is trading at $98,500, showing signs of weakness as bears gain the upper hand in the short term. The price has struggled to reclaim the crucial $100K level, which has now become a major resistance point defining Bitcoin’s next move. With volatility increasing and uncertainty dominating the market, BTC remains in a tight range between key demand and all-time highs. If Bitcoin fails to break above $100K in the coming days, a deeper correction could be on the horizon. A drop below the $96K mark would likely trigger further selling pressure, bringing BTC closer to lower support levels around $92K-$94K. This would signal a potential extended consolidation phase before any attempt to push higher. On the other hand, a clean break and hold above $100K could reignite bullish momentum, allowing BTC to test the upper range near its all-time high of $109K. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether BTC can regain its bullish trend or if further downside is in store. Traders are closely watching for confirmation of either a breakout above $100K or a rejection that could send BTC into lower demand levels.

From political influence to adventurous narratives and community-driven growth, the latest meme coins deliver excitement, speculation, and jaw-dropping returns. Recent developments in the market have set the stage for an explosive rally, with projects like TRUMP meme coin and Bonk generating immense traction. The political narrative around the TRUMP token led to an initial meteoric rise, while Bonk’s resurgence as Solana’s premier meme token has captivated investors. However, a new contender, Arctic Pablo Coin, is shaking things up with a groundbreaking approach that blends mythology, adventure, and wealth generation. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is not just another meme token; it’s a thrilling expedition into Earth’s mysteries. With an unparalleled presale structure tied to unique locations, Arctic Pablo Coin invites investors to embark on an epic adventure. Arctic Pablo Coin – The Adventure That Pays Deep within the frozen tundras, where the unknown meets the mystical, Arctic Pablo embarks on an expedition unlike any other. From the icy cliffs of Frostburg to the fabled lands of Shangri-La, Arctic Pablo traverses through uncharted locations, uncovering hidden treasures. But this isn’t just an adventure; it’s an opportunity. Every investor who joins the Arctic Pablo Coin journey becomes part of an epic quest, where each presale phase represents a new chapter in an ongoing expedition. With each location, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is unveiling new opportunities for wealth generation. Unlike traditional meme coins, the presale structure isn’t based on arbitrary stages—it’s a literal journey through time and myth. Currently stationed in Frostburg, Arctic Pablo has already raised over $1 Million, and the momentum is snowballing. The anticipated launch price of $0.008 suggests a mind-blowing ROI potential of over 14,725.93%. Investors who jump in now could see a $500 investment turn into $74,148.12 by the time Arctic Pablo reaches its final destination. It is one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. Tokenomics are designed to benefit long-term holders. Weekly burns remove unsold tokens, ensuring scarcity. Staking opportunities offer a staggering 66% APY, allowing investors to earn passive income while being part of a groundbreaking expedition. With token transactions recorded on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), transparency and security are at the heart of Arctic Pablo Coin’s mission. Unlike meme coins that rely solely on hype, Arctic Pablo Coin is fusing narrative, innovation, and financial opportunity into one thrilling package. TRUMP Meme Coin – The Political Power Play The TRUMP meme coin took the crypto world by storm, riding the wave of political fervor and speculation. Initially marketed as a token of support rather than an investment, the coin skyrocketed to a peak market value of $14.5 billion before taking a two-thirds nosedive. Despite the drop, TRUMP meme coin remains a powerhouse in the meme coin sector, generating between $86 million and $100 million in trading fees by January 30. With over 50 investors bagging $10 million in profits and 200,000 wallets experiencing losses, the TRUMP coin is a high-risk, high-reward rollercoaster. Recent developments suggest a shift in its utility. Trump-branded products, including watches, sneakers, and fragrances, now accept the TRUMP token as payment. While its value plunged by 60% following Trump’s failure to mention digital assets in his inaugural address, efforts are being made to position the token as an online payment tool. With the political cycle heating up, the TRUMP meme coin could experience another wave of speculative mania, making it one of the top meme coins to invest in now. Bonk – Solana’s Meme Coin Revival Bonk ($BONK) has reclaimed its throne as the leading meme coin on the Solana network. Priced at $0.00002579, Bonk has surged by 9.06% in the last 24 hours, boasting a massive $317.9 million in trading volume. The token’s market cap has hit $2.5 billion, reflecting strong investor confidence. Bonk’s resurgence comes from a highly anticipated “BURNmas” event, where BonkDAO announced the incineration of 1.69 trillion tokens, tightening supply and driving up value. With an RSI of 44, Bonk is in neutral territory, slightly leaning toward oversold conditions—an indicator that an explosive move could be on the horizon. Bonk’s accessibility has skyrocketed following its listing on a major U.S. exchange, drawing in North American investors eager to capitalize on its growing ecosystem. Crypto analyst Jack.poor has projected a possible price of $0.11 in 2025, representing staggering gains for early believers. As one of the top meme coins to invest in now, Bonk’s combination of strong community backing and strategic supply reduction makes it a meme coin with massive potential. Conclusion Based on research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, TRUMP meme coin, and Bonk stand out as the top meme coins to invest in now. Arctic Pablo Coin offers an unparalleled adventure with astronomical ROI potential and a powerful burn mechanism ensuring long-term scarcity. TRUMP meme coin, despite its volatility, holds speculative allure tied to the political landscape. Meanwhile, Bonk’s strategic token burns and growing market cap make it a solid contender for future gains. As meme coins continue to captivate investors, now is the time to jump into the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale before it reaches its next mythical location. Don’t miss the chance to be part of this historic expedition—secure a spot before the launch price skyrockets.

This development means the SEC now has until October to decide whether to approve or reject the application. Previously, the SEC had rejected several applications for ETFs tracking Solana and had ordered Cboe to withdraw previously submitted 19b-4s for those ETFs. According to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, the move to recognize Grayscale’s filing is considered noteworthy. It is the first time the SEC has acknowledged an ETF filing for a cryptocurrency that was previously classified as a “security.” In an X post he noted: We are now in new territory, albeit just a baby step, but seemingly the direct result of leadership change. Eric Balchunas SEC acknowledges multiple crypto ETF filings as firms submit proposals On Thursday, the SEC also acknowledged several other crypto ETF applications, including Grayscale’s filing for a Litecoin (LTC) ETF and BlackRock’s proposal to enable in-kind creations and redemptions for its iShares Bitcoin ETF. Later in the US evening, Cboe submitted filings to list and trade shares of four ETFs designed to track the price of XRP (XRP). On Thursday, the exchange submitted four 19b-4 filings to the SEC for potential ETFs from Bitwise, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and WisdomTree. These issuers had already filed S-1s, the initial step in launching an ETF. The latest steps indicate that businesses feel more at ease with the current SEC administration expanding beyond Bitcoin and Ether ETF products, even if they do not necessarily mean that the SEC will approve all of these products. SEC opens public comment period on Grayscale’s Litecoin ETF proposal The SEC has also initiated a public comment period on Grayscale’s Litecoin Trust’s proposed conversion into an ETF. The agency has acknowledged NYSE Arca’s filing and is inviting comments to be submitted within 21 days of the proposal’s publication in the Federal Register. The agency could decide to approve, disapprove, or “institute proceedings.” NYSE Arca posted a 19b-4 filing a few weeks ago for the “Grayscale Litecoin Trust ” and a “Grayscale Solana Trust.” A 19b-4 filing is the second part of a two-step process for proposing a spot crypto ETF. Once the SEC acknowledges the filing, it will be published in the Federal Register, initiating the agency’s approval process. In recent weeks, firms have flooded the market with proposals for funds based on DOGE and other altcoins, likely hoping that the SEC’s leadership change would create a more favorable environment for approving crypto ETFs. After the former crypto-skeptic SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s exit last month, the agency’s acting Chair, Mark Uyeda, picked fellow Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce to lead a crypto task force. Peirce has stated that she intends to focus on clarifying which “crypto assets” qualify as securities. This could potentially change the ways firms register and work on providing clear statements when approving or disapproving exchange-traded products.

A proposed class action lawsuit alleges BofA promised to hand a trove of reward points to new credit card customers, as long as they spent $3,000 within 90 days. But according to plaintiff Jean-Baptiste Boyer-Gomez, the bank has routinely short changed customers who signed up for the Air France KLM World Elite Mastercard. BofA promised 70,000 bonus miles and 40 experience points when customers met the requirements. Instead, the bank allegedly executed a “bait and switch” by applying a different promotional offer without proper notice, handing over only 50,000 bonus miles and 60 experience points with a lower spending threshold. The difference in value between the two offers is estimated to be at least $200. Although BofA has not yet responded to the accusations, the suit says Boyer-Gomez sent a letter to the bank detailing what happened, and received a response from the lender that denied any wrongdoing. The lawsuit seeks damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and class certification to address and cease Bank of America’s alleged deceptive practices.

The proposed ETF, named the Franklin Templeton Digital Asset Index Fund, would track a mix of major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). According to the filing, the fund aims to provide investors with broad exposure to the crypto market by investing in BTC and ETH, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. If approved, the ETF would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange, a leading U.S. equities and derivatives exchange. The move comes amid growing acceptance of cryptocurrency-based investment products, with several financial institutions seeking regulatory approval for ETFs that track digital assets. Earlier this year, the SEC approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing investors to gain exposure to BTC without holding the asset directly. Franklin Templeton was among the firms that launched a spot Bitcoin ETF, joining competitors such as BlackRock and Fidelity. Industry analysts view the filing as another step toward the mainstream adoption of digital assets in traditional finance. Franklin Templeton’s decision to include both Bitcoin and Ethereum in a single index fund suggests confidence in the long-term viability of these assets. Despite the positive momentum, regulatory uncertainty remains a key challenge for crypto-related financial products. The SEC has historically been cautious in approving ETFs tied to cryptocurrencies, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. However, the recent wave of Bitcoin ETF approvals has set a precedent that could improve the chances of Ethereum and multi-asset crypto ETFs gaining regulatory approval. Franklin Templeton’s filing also highlights the growing competition among asset managers to bring crypto-based products to market. Firms like Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity have already established themselves in the space, with Ethereum-focused ETF applications currently under SEC review. If Franklin Templeton’s index fund receives approval, it could attract investors looking for diversified exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin has long been considered the dominant digital asset, Ethereum’s growing role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts has made it a key player in the crypto ecosystem. The inclusion of ETH in the fund suggests that Franklin Templeton recognizes the importance of Ethereum’s network beyond just price speculation. Franklin Templeton has been expanding its presence in the digital asset industry in recent years. The firm has explored blockchain technology for traditional financial services and previously launched blockchain-based tokenized funds. By filing for a crypto index ETF, the asset manager is doubling down on its commitment to integrating digital assets into mainstream investment portfolios. The SEC has yet to provide a timeline for its decision on Franklin Templeton’s latest ETF proposal. If approved, the fund could mark another milestone in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency, giving investors a regulated and familiar way to gain exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum through traditional financial markets.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-07 01:37:41

40019159,https://timestabloid.com/?p=56488,1738893601,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Former Shiba Inu Developer Says RCOF Is the Best Altcoin to Buy and Catch a 55,000% Upside",https://timestabloid.com/former-shiba-inu-developer-says-rcof-is-the-best-altcoin-to-buy/,"A seasoned developer from the early days of Shiba Inu now champions RCO Finance (RCOF) as the best altcoin to buy. He believes RCOF could surge by 55,000%, turning modest investments into staggering wealth. His journey from working on SHIB to endorsing RCOF speaks to the project’s potential for explosive growth. In this article, we explore his story and uncover why he believes RCO Finance is the best altcoin to buy. We’ll dive into his transition from Shiba Inu to RCOF and explain the innovative features driving its success. Learn why RCOF might be your ticket to the next crypto revolution. The Shiba Inu Developer’s Journey This developer began his career during Shiba Inu’s humble meme-coin days. Back then, few could imagine that Shiba Inu (SHIB) would transform from a dog-themed token into a major force in crypto. He played a role in early projects, contributing to key developments such as the launch of Shibarium. After helping drive SHIB’s initial success, he eventually moved on when the project shifted focus. Seeking more robust and sustainable opportunities, he discovered RCO Finance (RCOF). Captivated by its clear roadmap and tangible benefits, he now believes RCOF is the best altcoin to buy for anyone aiming for astronomical gains. His journey illustrates a shift from relying on viral memes to investing in platforms with real-world applications and advanced technology. His endorsement of RCOF isn’t mere hype—it’s grounded in firsthand experience and a deep understanding of what makes a project revolutionary. Why RCO Finance Could Skyrocket 55,000% RCO Finance is a next-generation DeFi platform combining cutting-edge AI with practical, real-world asset access. It allows users to buy stocks, bonds, and even real estate with cryptocurrency without lengthy KYC processes. This streamlined approach gives investors privacy and flexibility, keeping RCOF from traditional projects. At its core, RCO Finance is powered by an AI-driven Robo Advisor. This tool gathers real-time market data from top-tier sources like Reuters and Bloomberg, ensuring that up-to-the-minute insights back every trading decision. It tailors strategies to your financial goals, determining the best moments to enter a trade, mitigate risks, or secure profits. Consider the case of VidyCoin (VDY). Between November 2024 and February 2025, VidyCoin surged from approximately $0.00009 to $0.00115—a gain of roughly 1,152%. Imagine if the Robo Advisor had spotted those early signals in VidyCoin’s upward momentum. It would have alerted investors to buy in at a low price, capturing significant gains before the market caught on. This ability to find opportunities early is an essential factor in why experts now view RCO Finance as a game-changer. RCO Finance also provides its users with an interactive Beta Platform . Here, investors can test features like automated market making, staking, and liquidity pools. This early access fosters transparency and builds trust. With over 10,000 engaged users, RCOF is proving that its innovative tools are not just theoretical—they’re actively enhancing trading strategies. Security remains a cornerstone of the platform. A rigorous SolidProof audit confirms the solidity of RCOF’s smart contracts. This commitment to safety ensures that users’ funds are well-protected, a crucial factor for those investing significant sums in a rapidly evolving market. Harnessing the Power of AI in a Sluggish Market One key scenario where RCO Finance shines is during market downturns. When tokens dip, many investors panic-sell, often locking in losses. However, RCOF’s Robo Advisor actively monitors market conditions and can advise investors on the optimal moments to act. For example, suppose the market shows signs of a temporary dip. In that case, the Advisor might suggest increasing your position in a stable asset or even buying undervalued tokens—much like it could have identified the early surge in VidyCoin. This proactive strategy is vital in a world where rapid shifts in sentiment can quickly erode gains. Instead of reacting impulsively, the Robo Advisor uses real-time data to craft a strategy that balances risk and reward. This ability to make informed decisions in volatile conditions is why many experts now see RCO Finance as having the potential to achieve a 55,000% surge. Seize the Opportunity: Your Future in DeFi For investors tired of the moderate rallies seen in XRP and Ethereum, RCO Finance offers an alternative built for exponential growth. While XRP once surged several hundred percent and Ethereum enjoyed a 77% rally from January to March 2024, RCOF aims far higher. Its presale token is currently priced at $0.10, and with nearly $13 million raised so far, the momentum is undeniable. Analysts believe that a 55,000% increase isn’t out of reach if market conditions continue favorably. Imagine turning a $1,000 investment into over $500,000—this is the explosive potential that early adopters are eyeing. Early investments in RCO Finance might outperform traditional tokens like XRP and Ethereum and rewrite the rules of crypto wealth. If you’re ready to move beyond the modest returns of established projects and embrace a platform designed for massive growth, RCOF could be your gateway to the next big wave in crypto.

40017412,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=691825,1738893614,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/40017412.jpeg,Ethereum Outflows On Derivative Exchanges Hit Record Lows: What It Means for ETH,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-outflows-on-derivative-exchanges-hit-record-lows-what-it-means-for-eth/,"Ethereum has continued to face headwinds, mirroring the broader downward trend in the global cryptocurrency market. The persistent market slump has made it challenging for ETH to sustain upward momentum, even as it attempts to recover from recent losses. Interestingly, it appears there might be some notable factors behind the scenes influencing Ethereum’s price movements, particularly the exchange netflows on derivative platforms. Related Reading: Ethereum Leverage Elevated Despite Long Squeeze, Glassnode Says Ethereum Faces Record Outflow: Implications Amr Taha, a contributor on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, recently offered insights into the Ethereum market’s ongoing dynamics. In a detailed post on the QuickTake platform, Taha noted that Ethereum’s netflow on derivative exchanges dropped below -300,000 ETH for the first time since August 2023. This significant shift, according to Taha, holds potential implications for price direction and market structure. Taha outlined several key factors to consider when assessing the impact of ETH outflows on pricing. First, when large amounts of ETH leave derivative exchanges, it often signals that traders are either closing leveraged positions or transferring funds to cold storage. This reduction in available supply can alleviate selling pressure, creating conditions that are favorable for a price increase—provided demand remains stable or grows. However, the nature of these outflows can lead to short-term market volatility. If the withdrawals are driven by the liquidation of leveraged long positions, the market may experience a temporary reset. While this can dampen buying demand in the short term, it often results in a healthier and more balanced market structure over time. Current Liquidity Stance And Key Metrics to Watch Additionally, Taha highlighted the significance of liquidity conditions in the broader financial system. Using a metric known as Fed Net Liquidity—which subtracts the Treasury General Account (TGA) and Reverse Repo (RRP) from the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet—he pointed out that rising liquidity levels often have a bullish effect on risk assets. Recently, the metric increased from 5.85 trillion to 5.95 trillion, suggesting more capital is available to flow into markets such as cryptocurrency. Historically, higher net liquidity correlates with increased asset prices, potentially benefiting Ethereum’s outlook. Furthermore, one of the more immediate indicators to monitor according to Taha is Ethereum’s liquidation map. Taha observed that certain price levels might force short positions into capitulation if ETH continues to climb.

Additionally, the trajectory of net liquidity will remain an essential factor, as its direction often signals the broader sentiment toward risk assets.

Understand the DOGE Price Fall & Decline in ADA Whale Activity,https://thecoinrise.com/get-5-cashback-with-blockdags-affiliate-program-understand-the-doge-price-fall-decline-in-ada-whale-activity/,"The current trends in the crypto market are causing concern as the Dogecoin (DOGE) price experiences a significant 13% decrease within a day, landing at $0.2539. Observers are left questioning if the meme coin will stabilize above $0.25 or face further declines. At the same time, there’s a noticeable decrease in Cardano whale activity, sparking worries about ADA’s recovery chances after an 18% decrease. Big stakeholders are opting to wait, resulting in an uncertain market. Amid these challenges, BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing interest with its presale exceeding $192.5 million. The appeal is powered by a 5% USDT cashback offer through its straightforward affiliate program, which allows traders to benefit immediately without waiting for BDAG’s market introduction. DOGE Price Plummets Over 13% The DOGE price has declined sharply, over 13% in a single day to $0.2539, casting doubts on the meme coin’s short-term prospects. Despite previous hopes of a bullish pattern around $0.31, that optimism has waned. Market watchers are now assessing whether the DOGE price will find a new baseline above $0.25 or if it will retreat further. Market volatility is ongoing, and the continued sell-off indicates a cautious approach from buyers. For a recovery, the DOGE price might need an increase in trading volume or a shift in market sentiment to regain strength soon. Cardano Whale Activity Indicates Limited Buying Cardano whale activity is subdued, with ADA’s price at $0.7111 following an 18% fall recently. Observations suggest large holders are reluctant to increase their stakes, possibly showing a weak bullish sentiment. On-chain metrics report no significant change in the number of addresses holding between one million and ten million ADA, indicating stable but inactive whale participation. Should Cardano whale activity intensify, it could restore confidence in ADA’s market prospects. However, current indicators, like a falling ADX, suggest continued flat trading. Stakeholders remain watchful for any signs of increased Cardano whale activity that could potentially revive ADA’s market performance. BlockDAG’s 5% Cashback Strategy Nears $600M Target BlockDAG’s presale has amassed over $192.5 million by selling 18.3 billion coins at $0.0248 each. Early participants have enjoyed a remarkable 2,380% ROI, and BDAG is currently recognized as a top crypto to buy right now. The surge in interest is due to BlockDAG’s revamped Affiliate Program, which offers 5% cashback to both the referrer and the new buyer. Joining the program is easy: if a BlockDAG holder refers someone who then purchases $10,000 of BDAG, both parties receive $500 in USDT in their BEP-20 compatible wallets. This approach provides immediate benefits and has significantly boosted the presale, attracting new participants and rewarding existing ones. This initiative highlights BlockDAG’s commitment to its community. BlockDAG values the satisfaction and loyalty of its community, acknowledging their role in the project’s success. As the presale progresses, participants not only enjoy a 5% cashback but also contribute to reaching the ambitious $600 million target. With the mainnet launch anticipated this year, traders are eager to earn additional cash now, believing that early acquisition of BDAG coins could lead to more benefits as the presale amount rises in the challenging market. Despite Market Downturn, One Crypto Stands Out Recent market downturns have traders pondering the future direction. The DOGE price has fallen by more than 13% in a day, with little hope for a quick recovery. Concurrently, Cardano whale activity has diminished, indicating that major holders are wary of investing, leaving ADA’s price trajectory uncertain. In contrast, BlockDAG’s 5% cashback affiliate program continues to attract traders seeking immediate rewards. As BDAG moves closer to its $600 million crypto presale goal, it is highlighted as the top crypto to buy right now, with potential price hikes on the horizon. Those in search of stability and growth potential are advised not to delay, as such opportunities are rare.

LINK Ecosystem Expands,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-web3bays-6430-roi-4200-still-possible-but-times-running-out-to-join-this-web3-platform-link-ecosystem-expands/,"Some moments in markets are predictable—slow, steady, incremental shifts that barely move the needle. This isn’t one of them. Right now, some web3 blockchain projects are rewriting how industries operate, and those who understand what’s happening are already striking gold. LINK’s potential climb to $50—or its possible drop to $12.80—illustrates just how much the Chainlink ecosystem growth and broader market sentiment dictate success. AGII is proving that AI and smart contracts aren’t just a theoretical pairing—they’re already optimizing blockchain transactions for speed, security, and adaptability. But the most remarkable upside comes from Web3Bay (3BAY) , where early investors are securing returns that, frankly, don’t come around often. With three presale stages already gone, those who got in early are looking at a 6430% ROI by launch. Even those entering the ongoing Stage 4 will still see a 4200% gain! Chainlink Ecosystem Could See $50 LINK—Or Drop to $12.80 LINK’s future in 2025 could swing in either direction, depending on market sentiment and Chainlink ecosystem advancements. If optimism prevails, LINK could climb to $47.70—or even $50 if demand intensifies. However, if negative sentiment takes hold, the price may slip to $12.80. Much of this hinges on developments within the Chainlink ecosystem, which continues to expand its role in blockchain interoperability and smart contract security. With its previous all-time high at $52.88, investors are watching to see whether LINK can break past this level with upcoming upgrades. Web3 Platform AGII Deploys AI to Boost Smart Contracts Smart contracts have reshaped digital transactions, but they often struggle with efficiency and adaptability. AGII, an AI-driven Web3 platform, is tackling these challenges by integrating artificial intelligence directly into blockchain infrastructure. With AI-optimized smart contracts, transactions become faster, more secure, and capable of self-improvement over time. This advancement benefits industries like decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and supply chain management, where automation and accuracy are crucial. By merging AI with blockchain, AGII is helping businesses and developers build smarter, more reliable decentralized applications. Web3Bay Investors Secure ROIs Upto 6430%: Will You Be One of Them? Every major shift in technology creates two kinds of people—those who recognize it early and those who look back, wishing they had. Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace is proving that traditional e-commerce platforms are outdated, and those securing 3BAY now are positioning themselves ahead of the curve. Over $1 million has been raised in the presale, with 280 million 3BAY tokens already sold. Three stages have completely sold out, and Stage 4 is on the verge of closing at just $0.004562625 per token. But why is this web3 blockchain project gaining this level of success so early into its presale? Traditional e-commerce platforms hold too much power—setting fees, controlling algorithms, and collecting user data without consent. Web3Bay changes that by using blockchain to hand control back to buyers and sellers. With no middlemen, users own their data, set their terms, and transact securely. Holding 3BAY tokens gives users voting rights on key decisions, ensuring the community—not executives—shapes the platform’s future. The very fact that Web3Bay hands back control to its users makes it the leading Web3 blockchain project in the e-commerce space. Those who locked in 3BAY during Stage 1 at $0.003 are already looking at an estimated 6430% return on investment by launch. Even those joining at Stage 4 could see a 4200% gain—but only if they move fast before it sells out. Why Waiting Could Cost You Big Chainlink Ecosystem’s role in blockchain interoperability keeps it essential, but whether it surpasses its $52.88 all-time high will depend on whether demand aligns with development. Meanwhile, Web3 platform AGII is proving that AI-powered automation isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s becoming the new baseline. Coming to Web3Bay, its over $1 million presale has already positioned it as the leading web3 blockchain project in the online shopping space. Stage 1 3BAY investors have already locked in a potential 6430% ROI by launch, but there’s still room for major gains—if one acts fast. Right now, 3BAY is priced at just $0.004562625 in Stage 4, offering a projected 4200% return. But with each stage selling out, the price climbs and ROI shrinks. The chance to profit is fading fast—waiting could mean settling for far less!

As we move into 2025, investors are on the lookout for the next big thing in crypto. There are plenty of options, but three names stand out—Qubetics, Kaspa, and AAVE. These coins are not only showing promising growth, but they are reshaping the very foundation of blockchain technology and finance. If you’re asking, “What are the top crypto coins to buy now?” you’re in for a treat. Kaspa, in particular, has grabbed attention due to its blazing transaction speeds and unique architecture using the GHOSTDAG consensus protocol. Unlike older blockchains like Bitcoin, Kaspa processes transactions in parallel, offering impressive scalability and low fees. On the other hand, AAVE has shown its resilience in the face of market volatility, even managing to process massive liquidations without incurring bad debt. The DeFi protocol’s integration with emerging blockchains like Sonic is also fueling excitement, making AAVE a coin that could experience a serious rebound in 2025. But while Kaspa and AAVE are grabbing headlines, Qubetics is positioning itself as the project that will truly change the game. Through its innovative presale, Qubetics has raised over $12 million and is well on its way to becoming one of the top crypto coins to buy now. With an integration into the 1inch network, Qubetics is taking things to the next level by offering features no other blockchain project can currently match. Ready to find out why Qubetics is the project to watch? Qubetics: A Game Changer in Crypto As the crypto world continues to evolve, many projects promise decentralization, efficiency, and user-centric solutions—but few deliver on all fronts. Enter Qubetics. With its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet , Qubetics is set to offer a user experience that outshines its competitors. While Kaspa and AAVE have made their marks in scalability and DeFi, Qubetics brings something uniquely tailored for the needs of today’s crypto ecosystem. One of the biggest challenges in crypto today is managing multiple assets across different blockchains. You need multiple wallets, each with its own set of security protocols, which can become cumbersome, especially for businesses, professionals, or anyone who holds a diverse crypto portfolio. That’s where the Qubetics Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet comes in. It’s not just a wallet; it’s a revolution. Imagine having the ability to seamlessly manage your assets across Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and other networks all from one place—without relying on third-party custodians. For businesses dealing with cross-border payments or professionals handling client transactions, this feature can simplify daily operations. Take, for example, a freelancer who accepts payments in both ETH and BTC. With the Qubetics wallet, managing both currencies becomes a breeze, allowing the user to keep track of earnings across different chains without the hassle of maintaining separate wallets. Not only does this save time, but it also reduces the risk of errors, making it a safer and more efficient option. For larger businesses, the Qubetics wallet offers an added layer of security and control. Imagine a supply chain company needing to make payments to vendors across different countries, each operating on a different blockchain. The Qubetics wallet allows the business to execute transactions quickly, ensuring liquidity and cost efficiency without the delays and fees typically associated with traditional banking methods. With the wallet’s multi-chain functionality, this process becomes smoother, cheaper, and more secure. Qubetics x 1inch: A Strategic Partnership Redefining DeFi In another bold move, Qubetics has partnered with the 1inch network, a leader in decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregation. This collaboration positions Qubetics as a frontrunner in decentralized trading, offering users access to hundreds of DEXs for optimized pricing, better liquidity, and an overall smoother trading experience. This means that not only does the Qubetics wallet serve as a one-stop shop for asset management, but it also doubles as a powerhouse for trading. The integration with 1inch takes things a step further. With this partnership, Qubetics users can expect highly optimized trades, which are critical in the fast-moving world of DeFi. Advanced aggregation technology allows Qubetics to offer the best prices and lowest slippage by sourcing liquidity across multiple platforms. This means more efficiency and profitability for traders, no matter their experience level. For example, let’s say you’re a DeFi enthusiast looking to make a trade between Ethereum and Solana. Without 1inch, you’d have to navigate multiple DEXs, looking for the best price and hoping that slippage doesn’t eat into your profits. With the 1inch integration, the process becomes automated and simplified, ensuring you get the best deal possible without the headache. This is the future of trading—where complexity is minimized, and profits are maximized. The Qubetics wallet’s collaboration with 1inch sets it apart from other wallets in the market, and its seamless user experience is exactly what traders have been waiting for. Kaspa: The Speed King of Blockchain When people ask, “What are the top crypto coins to buy now?” Kaspa’s name should be at the top of the list. The cryptocurrency industry is all about speed and scalability, and Kaspa delivers on both fronts. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which process blocks sequentially, Kaspa uses the GHOSTDAG protocol to process multiple blocks simultaneously. This makes it capable of handling thousands of transactions per second, without bottlenecks. For businesses, the benefits of Kaspa’s high throughput are clear. Imagine a retail company using blockchain for supply chain management. With Kaspa’s lightning-fast transaction speeds, they can instantly verify product authenticity, track inventory, and even make real-time payments, all without worrying about delays or high fees. This is the kind of efficiency Kaspa brings to the table, and it’s why it’s being regarded as one of the top crypto coins to buy now. Kaspa’s innovative architecture doesn’t just address scalability issues; it also ensures decentralization and security. Unlike traditional blockchains where mining pools may centralize control, Kaspa’s blockDAG structure avoids this pitfall, ensuring that no single entity can dominate the network. This is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the network and keeping it truly decentralized. AAVE: DeFi Resilience at Its Best AAVE is no stranger to the spotlight. This DeFi powerhouse has weathered numerous market storms, showcasing its resilience and capacity to adapt. Recently, AAVE gained traction due to its potential integration with the Sonic blockchain, a move that could enhance its revenue potential and expand its user base. The decentralized lending protocol’s ability to withstand a market-wide flash crash and still process over $210 million in liquidations without incurring bad debt speaks volumes about its stability. AAVE’s innovative approach to DeFi lending has positioned it as a major player, and its community-driven initiatives make it one of the top crypto coins to buy now. As DeFi continues to grow, AAVE remains a key player, and analysts are optimistic about its future. Its innovative features and growing integration with emerging blockchains will likely drive further adoption, making it a solid investment for 2025. Conclusion As 2025 unfolds, the top crypto coins to buy now are clearly Qubetics, Kaspa, and AAVE. Each of these coins offers unique features and promising growth potential. Qubetics, with its revolutionary Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet and integration with 1inch, is ready to redefine how we interact with blockchain. Kaspa’s speed and scalability offer real-world solutions for businesses and developers. AAVE’s continued success in DeFi and its community-driven approach make it a safe bet in a volatile market. If you’re looking to make smart moves in the crypto space, these are the projects you need to be watching. Whether you’re new to crypto or a seasoned investor, now is the time to get involved. Don’t miss out on these incredible opportunities. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs 1. What makes Qubetics one of the top crypto coins to buy now? Qubetics stands out as one of the top crypto coins to buy now due to its groundbreaking Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, which allows users to manage multiple assets across different blockchains from one secure platform. This feature solves a major issue in the crypto world by eliminating the need for multiple wallets and reducing the complexity of managing diverse portfolios. 2. How does the Qubetics Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet work? The Qubetics Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet allows users to securely store, send, and receive assets across multiple blockchains, all within a single platform. Unlike custodial wallets, which require users to trust third-party services with their private keys, Qubetics provides a decentralized solution, meaning users have full control over their keys and assets. 3. Why is Kaspa considered one of the fastest blockchain networks? Kaspa’s unique use of the GHOSTDAG consensus protocol allows it to process multiple blocks simultaneously, as opposed to traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which process blocks sequentially. This parallel block processing enables Kaspa to handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS), making it one of the fastest blockchain networks. 4. How does AAVE continue to perform well in the DeFi market? AAVE continues to thrive in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market because of its resilience and innovation. It has proven its ability to manage extreme market volatility, like the February 2023 flash crash, by processing liquidations without incurring bad debt. AAVE also benefits from a community-driven approach, with ongoing developments such as the upcoming integration with the Sonic blockchain. 5.What is the potential ROI for Qubetics tokens after the presale? Qubetics analysts predict substantial returns for early investors. The token price currently sits at $0.0667 in the 20th stage of the presale, and analysts estimate it could reach up to $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a potential 274% ROI. After the presale, there’s significant optimism, with predictions ranging from $1 (1398% ROI) to $5 (7394% ROI) per token, and up to $15 (22382% ROI) after the mainnet launch.

Trump’s Rising Interest In ONDO Recently, a blockchain-based transaction tracker, Onchain Lens, shared a post on X (previously Twitter) revealing that Trump’s Liberty Finance has spent $4.7 million USDC to buy 342,000 ONDO tokens. Just In: Trump's World Liberty Finance has spent $4.7M $USDC to buy 342,000 $ONDO .

However, this substantial investment in ONDO is making waves in the cryptocurrency space, leading to a surge in its price while other major cryptocurrencies struggle to gain momentum. ONDO Current Price Momentum ONDO is currently trading near $1.35 and has surged over 3.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, heightened interest from traders and investors pushed its trading volume up by 15% compared to previous days. Bullish On-chain Metrics and Upcoming Level Despite this bullish outlook, investors have been found dumping their holdings onto exchanges, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have seen an outflow of over $11.54 million worth of ONDO coins, indicating potential accumulation by whales and long-term holders. This could create buying pressure and drive further upside momentum. According to expert technical analysis, ONDO appears bullish but is currently consolidating in a tight range between $1.175 and $1.65 over the past seven days. Based on recent price action, if the current market sentiment remains unchanged, it could soar by 22% to reach the $1.65 level in the coming days.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ONDO|TRADING|ZRX|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-07 02:25:01

Some of the metrics dropping as per DefiLlama data include total value locked, app revenue, Toncoin’s price, the project’s market cap, unique daily active addresses, and DEX trading volume. The blockchain, which is best known for its tap-to-earn Telegram games, reached an all-time peak after Hamster Kombat’s launch. The game attracted over 100 million new users to the blockchain, increasing its daily active addresses. TON had also urged its validators in September last year to brace for a massive user influx as the blockchain game expanded. TON attained its highest number of addresses in September 2024 at over 1.81 million active user addresses. The blockchain also received one of the highest monthly active users at the beginning of October last year, reaching over 11.8 million users. As of February 5, the chain’s daily active wallets have dropped to a little over 200,000 and monthly users to a little over 5.1 million. Toncoin, the blockchain’s native token, hit its all-time high after Hamster Kombat’s launch in June last year, hitting $8.24. The coin has currently dropped by over 54% from its ATH, trading at $3.75 at the time of writing. Toncoin is down over 1.7% in the past 24 hours, over 22% in the past 7 days, and over 31% in the past month. TON transaction volume and profitable addresses drop Over 240,000 #Toncoin $TON have been transferred to exchanges in the past week, potentially signaling increased selling pressure as shown by on-chain data from @santimentfeed ! pic.twitter.com/FF9BBEMJzL — Ali (@ali_charts) January 29, 2025 IntoTheBlock data revealed that about 96% (over 108 million addresses) of TON holders are in losses, while only about 4% (a little over 4.2 million addresses) are in profits. The data also indicated that most investors were mostly bearish about the token. Toncoin is also receiving a lot of selling pressure, especially after the recent 240,000 Toncoin transfer to exchanges. The speculated imminent selling pressure led to the coin’s price dropping by over 2% at the end of January. TON experienced a similar sell-off after the arrest of Telegram’s CEO Pavel Durov, leading to the sale of over 800,000 TON. The DEX trading volumes and daily transaction volumes on the network increased, sparking speculations that TON holders were moving to other coins. At the time, investor confidence also dropped significantly due to the issues experienced on Telegram and the TON blockchain. Current Tonstat and DefiLlama data also indicated that the blockchain’s transaction volume and DEX volume have reduced significantly over the past few months. Transaction volumes on February 5 stood at a little over 2.7 million compared to September 18’s 18.1 million. Transactions on two major DEXs on TON, DeDust and STON.fi, have dropped to 1.746 million and 4.108 million from 3.928 million and 9.634 million, respectively. Token Terminal data highlighted that the monthly fees received by TON currently stands at a little over $1.9 million, a 10% drop from the previous month. Latest TON blockchain updates contribute to the downward spiral Telegram and $TON are going exclusive! 💕 All mini-apps on Telegram will now exclusively use TON as their blockchain infrastructure.

The blockchain recently announced that it would be Telegram’s exclusive blockchain. TON demanded that all TG mini-apps would now have to use TON for their infrastructure. The developers explained that bridging apps would be exempted from the latest updates. The TON blockchain’s developers also declared TON a closed network instead of its previous open network status. TON has received backlash from users and projects on the blockchain, with some deciding to consider other networks. The TG game Frens Farm recently tweeted that it would delay its token launch after TON’s closed network update. The game further declared that it would conduct the token launch on Base instead of TON. TON blockchain has also demanded that all crypto users on TG leverage TON Connect instead of other wallets. A TON Foundation spokesperson allegedly mentioned that the messenger would not support third-party wallets after the migration. The director of Helika Ventures, Ilya Abugov, reportedly commented on the migration, saying that the change was sudden and delivered in a ‘strong protectionist way.’ Abugov mentioned that the latest blockchain updates would reduce TON’s desirability, further highlighting a reduced excitement among exchanges for TON projects. The Helika Ventures director gave an example of the recent partial HMSTR delisting on Bybit. Hamster Kombat has notably expressed interest in building its blockchain and branching from TON.

One project that is rapidly gaining attention is Lightchain AI , which has already raised $14 million in its presale at a price of $0.005625 per token. With its early success and growing investor interest, Lightchain AI is emerging as a strong contender for the next major market mover, offering a combination of cutting-edge technology and high-ROI potential. Why Low-Cap Cryptos Like Lightchain AI Offer High-Growth Potential Low-cap cryptocurrencies often offer excellent risk-reward potential, giving investors a chance to enter early before broader market adoption. Unlike well-established projects, these assets have the opportunity for exponential growth as liquidity builds and demand increases, making them an attractive option for those looking to maximize returns in the crypto space. Lightchain AI is gaining significant attention due to its strong presale momentum and growing investor interest. This early-stage project is positioning itself as a promising contender, with many speculating on its ability to deliver substantial returns. Such interest highlights the potential for rapid price appreciation as the project develops further. With the crypto market preparing for its next bullish cycle, projects like Lightchain AI could provide considerable upside. Early adoption remains key. Decentralized Governance – Lightchain AI Advantage Lightchain AI is rewriting the rules of blockchain governance with its community-first approach. Unlike Solana, which leans heavily on developer-focused tools, Lightchain AI puts power directly in the hands of its token holders. Decisions on network updates, partnerships, and the platform’s future direction are all shaped by the community—making inclusivity the core of its DNA. At the heart of this model is a cutting-edge quadratic voting system. This ensures smaller stakeholders have a louder voice while curbing the influence of large token holders, creating a fairer, more balanced power dynamic. It’s a system designed to promote transparency, diversity, and meaningful participation. But Lightchain AI doesn’t stop there. Through its governance framework, the platform actively funds community-driven initiatives like developer grants and AI projects. This not only fuels innovation but also aligns the platform’s progress with the shared vision of its users. By empowering its community, Lightchain AI offers a compelling, decentralized alternative to Solana’s more centralized strategy—one that’s built for collaboration, fairness, and a brighter future. Could Lightchain AI Be the Next Big Crypto? With $14 million raised in its presale and a strong foundation in AI-powered blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI is shaping up to be a major contender in the low-cap crypto space. As market sentiment shifts toward projects with real-world applications, Lightchain AI’s unique technology and early investor backing put it in a prime position to make significant moves once it enters the public market. For investors searching for the next high-growth opportunity, Lightchain AI’s rapid momentum suggests it could be one of the biggest success stories in the next crypto bull run. Keep an eye on this project as it continues to develop and see if it could be the market’s next major mover. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|SOL,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-07 03:00:00

He sold half of his $5 million DOGE holdings and committed $2 million to the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale , betting on a jaw-dropping 600x return in just two weeks. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Ultimate DeFi Innovation Set To Reward Investors WallitIQ (WLTQ) is not your run-of-the-mill altcoin. It is the native token of a revolutionary DeFi mega-platform that delivers superior security for crypto wallets. Using its state-of-the-art Escrow Connect feature, this trailblazing platform guarantees that every transaction is fully vetted and secure. This high level of security is further amplified by advanced biometric and facial recognition authentication , making it one of the most secure wallets in the crypto space today. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform has been meticulously designed with an intuitive interface that is modern and adaptive to individual user preferences through top-notch AI-powered behavioral analysis tools. The platform’s cutting-edge MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App integrates live market data from using the CoinGecko API, along with real-time sentiment analysis. The outstanding feature of the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform lies in its tokenomics. The platform’s native token delivers substantial utility. Investors can earn up to 180% APY by staking their tokens, making it one of the most lucrative staking opportunities in DeFi. Crypto experts predict that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token could surge by an astonishing 600x, propelling its price from the presale level of $0.0420 to $25. A $1,000 investment today could balloon to $600,000, a $10,000 investment could soar to $6 million, and a $100,000 stake might yield an eye-popping $60 million. Institutional investors and crypto whales are on alert and are already flooding the presale. With its CoinMarketCap listing , a SolidProof smart contract audit building confidence in investors, and a soon-to-launch Beta platform, the time for action is now . This is the moment to secure your stake in the token before the presale ends. The opportunity to invest at $0.0420 is fleeting, and once the market recognizes its true value, the price is expected to skyrocket. The potential for a 600x rally is too great to ignore. Snap up the tokens now and prepare for a remarkable ROI. Dogecoin: A Fading Legacy In The Face Of New Innovation Dogecoin (DOGE) once symbolized the wild, unpredictable spirit of the crypto market. Its meteoric rise during previous bull markets created countless millionaires and solidified its position as a household name. However, the current trajectory of Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of stagnation. Despite its iconic status, Dogecoin (DOGE) now appears to be a relic of a bygone era, unable to offer the robust, utility-driven benefits that modern investors demand in today’s market. While Dogecoin (DOGE) has a dedicated community and continues to generate buzz, its growth potential is limited compared to cutting-edge projects like WallitIQ (WLTQ). The trader’s decision to divest $2 million from Dogecoin (DOGE) is a clear indication that even seasoned investors recognize that DOGE may not survive the rigors of the upcoming bull market. Dogecoin’s reliance on fleeting hype and celebrity endorsements can only take it so far; without substantial technological innovation and real-world utility, its future remains uncertain. Conclusion: Seize The Opportunity With WallitIQ (WLTQ) As the 2025 bull market draws near, the window of opportunity for massive crypto gains is narrowing rapidly. While Dogecoin (DOGE) might have been the poster coin for explosive growth in the past, it’s the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token that is emerging as the leader in this new era. Investors looking to multiply their wealth cannot afford to miss the opportunity to buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token while it is selling at an affordable price of $0.0420 before it records a 600x price increase in two weeks. Institutional investors and crypto whales are already moving in, recognizing that the token is the best bet in a market where even Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are struggling to keep pace. Now is the time to act. Do not let this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity slip away.

OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM Is Gaining Momentum Fast!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-this-be-the-next-bitcoin-officialmagacoin-com-is-gaining-momentum-fast/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the cornerstone of cryptocurrency success stories, turning early adopters into millionaires. Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Kaspa (KAS) have also built strong reputations, while Arbitrum (ARB) has shown potential as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. However, a new coin, OFFICIALMAGACOIN, is now commanding the attention of savvy investors. OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Deliver 60,000% Returns OFFICIALMAGACOIN has emerged as a unique player, with a record-breaking presale raising over $1.5 million in minutes. The token is only available at officialmagacoin.com , adding an element of exclusivity that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its potential for 60,000% returns has investors speculating that it could mirror or even surpass Bitcoin’s early growth trajectory. Early-Stage Growth Potential: With its presale success, OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin poised for exponential growth. Exclusivity and Scarcity: Available only at its official website, the token creates urgency and a sense of premium access. Affordable Entry Point: At less than $0.20 per token, OFFICIALMAGACOIN provides a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. Comparing OFFICIALMAGACOIN to Competitors Bitcoin (BTC): Established but lacks the explosive growth of a new coin. Cardano (ADA): Reliable but maturing, leaving little room for exponential returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Focused on Web3 but cannot match OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s exclusivity. Kaspa (KAS): A promising blockchain but with a slower trajectory. Investors eager to secure their position in this promising token can do so exclusively at officialmagacoin.com . With market buzz intensifying, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming a top contender in the race for the next crypto millionaire-maker.

However, a potential newcomer has stepped in from the shadows of Remittix , a presale coin already making waves in the marketplace. This project has quickly crossed the $11 million mark in funding during its ICO, making one wonder whether Remittix could make a scene in the SOL and ADA dominion. Solana (SOL): A Speedy Blockchain That Continues to Impress SOL has earned a name for being one of the fastest blockchains, capable of processing about 65,000 transactions a second and having almost non-existent fees. This prowess of being fast and cheap makes SOL the favorite of dApp developers and NFT marketplace builders. But recently, Solana has been capturing increased attention from investors. Over the last three weeks, $674 million worth of SOL was bought, implying investors have returned to the scene. More importantly, SOL staking has seen an uptake; more than $62 million was staked recently. This shows that investors are buying and holding SOL over the long run a bullish indication. With the recovery of the crypto market toward maturity due to its speed and scalability, Solana is ready for the next period of acceleration. Cardano (ADA): Poised for Growth Aftermarket Liquidations Therefore, Cardano, on the other hand, is also witnessing good positive sentiment. Recently, the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, forecasted a bull run for the overall crypto market. This run is mainly triggered by the recent clearance of weak positions worth $710 billion in liquidations. According to Hoskinson, many over-leveraged positions in the market were eliminated in clearing these positions, leaving behind a stronger reservoir for future purposes. This positive sentiment is especially good news for Cardano (ADA), which has had its share of experiences down the competitive blockchain road. However, seeing new ecosystems being built upon the Cardano network, coupled with recent bullish predictions for the market, gives ADA investors some good incentive for optimism about the future. With ADA improving its strong fundamentals, it may be positioned to shine in the forthcoming crypto bull market. Remittix: A New ICO That’s Gaining Traction Seems like something new. Remittix has carved itself a path with its distinct selling point amid Solana’s dominance especially in that of Cardano. Altogether, Remittix is on the rise for cryptocurrency-to-FIAT transactions but mostly for its emphasis on financial inclusion. Fusing decentralized finance with real-life applications, Remittix attempts to fill gaps in the market not yet fully addressed by either SOL or ADA. Another noteworthy point will be the race at which Remittix is being adapted. With over $11 million already raised in the presale, 57% of the total tokens on offer have already been sold. Some degree of such confidence indicates high confidence on the part of investors in Remittix and its potential appeal in the future. The project’s interest in making blockchain solutions more mainstream and easily applicable to the real world is quite in tune with investors’ craving for the next big thing in the crypto space. As the ICO calendar pulsates with presale projects, Remittix distinguishes itself from the crowd. This is not just another meme token but a bona fide effort to bring crypto-to-FIAT solutions into the limelight. Whether Remittix becomes an alternative to Solana and Cardano is certainly yet to be seen; what is certain is that this new contender has the promise of leaving its mark. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Blockchain and Investment The Solana and Cardano war for blockchain supremacy is not quite done and now Remittix has injected some new energy into this ecosystem. SOL and ADA are existent and thriving, while Remittix has taken a new and interesting path by focusing on crypto-to-FIAT solutions and financial inclusion. With an initial coin offering of 11 million dollars already raised, Remittix shows there is still room for new entrants, even in giant-dominated markets. Will it develop its Remittix niche or become another hyped project that quietly disappears? Investors are surely watching closely while the ICO calendar keeps changing. It will likely become the next big thing.

ETH is now struggling to clear the $2,880 and $2,920 resistance levels. Ethereum started a decent upward move above the $2,620 zone. The price is trading below $2,750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,800 level. Ethereum Price Recovery Could Soon Fade Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $2,550 level, like Bitcoin . ETH was able to surpass the $2,600 and $2,620 resistance levels to move into a short-term positive zone. The price was able to surpass the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,400 swing high to the $2,120 swing low. However, the bears seem to be active below the $2,880 and $2,920 resistance levels. The price is again moving lower. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,770 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The first major resistance is near the $2,800 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,920 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,400 swing high to the $2,120 swing low. A clear move above the $2,920 resistance might send the price toward the $3,000 resistance. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,050 resistance zone or even $3,120 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,800 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,630 level. The first major support sits near the $2,600 zone. A clear move below the $2,600 support might push the price toward the $2,500 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term.

Bitcoin Network Activity Drops As Market Consolidates Data from CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Network Activity Index shows that activity has declined by 15% from its peak in November 2024. As of February 5, the Index stands at 3,760, marking its lowest level in the past year. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Hour RSI Hits Oversold Zone – Is A BTC Rebound Near? The decline in network activity is primarily attributed to a sharp drop in the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network. From an all-time high (ATH) of 734,000 transactions in September 2024, the total daily transaction count has fallen by 53% to 346,000. According to CryptoQuant, this downturn in BTC network activity is largely driven by a decline in the use of the Runes Protocol for minting tokens on the blockchain. The post explains: This is evident in the total daily number of OP RETURN codes in Bitcoin transactions, which the RUNES protocol uses to write data about token mints and transfers on the network. When the RUNES protocol emerged in April 2024, the daily number of OP RETURN codes spiked to 802K. However, the number of OP RETURN code has plummeted since, with only 10K OP RETURN codes used. For the uninitiated, The Runes Protocol is a new token standard for BTC, designed to enable fungible token creation directly on the network without requiring off-chain data or complex smart contracts. It aims to be more efficient and scalable than previous Bitcoin tokenization methods like Ordinals and BRC-20. Further evidence of reduced network activity is visible in Bitcoin mempool traffic. The total number of pending transactions waiting to be confirmed in a Bitcoin block has plummeted by 99%, from 287,000 in December 2024 to just 3,000 as of February 5, 2025. Notably, this is the lowest level of mempool traffic since March 2022. Is BTC Overvalued At Current Price? The analysis suggests that, based on network activity, Bitcoin’s fair value currently falls between $48,000 and $95,000. This implies that BTC’s current market price of around $98,000 may be overvalued. Related Reading: Bitcoin Withstands DeepSeek Dip And FOMC Volatility – How Close Is A New ATH? However, another CryptoQuant contributor argues that the current Bitcoin price presents a strong buying opportunity for investors looking to dollar-cost average their holdings. Similarly, another analyst suggests that BTC’s recent market performance indicates it is in the distribution phase of the market cycle. Despite short-term concerns, the long-term outlook for BTC remains bullish. A Standard Chartered executive recently predicted that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. At press time, BTC trades at $97,914, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

The summit saw the announcement from World Liberty Financial (WLF), a crypto project supported by the Trump family, which has recently invested in Ondo Finance’s native cryptocurrency. This move signals the Trump family’s commitment to expanding their presence in the cryptocurrency space. Additionally, WLF has recently made investments in various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, and others, and has purchased approximately $470,000 worth of ONDO tokens. As part of a broader strategy, the company is preparing to launch the “Ondo Chain,” a layer-one blockchain designed for tokenized assets. Chase Herro, co-founder of WLF, also shared exciting developments, including plans for the launch of a “strategic reserve” of crypto assets. The reserve will provide further liquidity and support for the crypto ecosystem, offering investors more diverse opportunities in a growing market.

Get Ready.,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/last-24-hours-this-next-100x-crypto-ends-its-ico-on-friday-get-ready/,"The post Last 24 Hours—This Next 100X Crypto Ends Its ICO on Friday. Get Ready. appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News There are just 24 hours left before the Dogizen ICO concludes this Friday, 7th February . Anticipating Dogizen as a future leader in the fast-growing Telegram gaming market, early investors have already poured $3.8m into its presale—the first-ever held on Telegram. Some think DOGIZ will be the next 100x crypto in 2025. Let’s find out why. Why Dogizen is primed for growth Dogizen is a new Telegram gaming project doing something no other project has ever done before: allowing investors to buy directly inside Telegram, tapping into a 950-million-strong user base that can invest in and claim tokens without ever leaving the app. First-movers tend to make history in this market, and Dogizen’s status as the first Telegram ICO could be key to becoming the next 100x crypto. Dogizen’s goal is to use the success of its revenue-generating game, launched last year to an audience of 1.4 million players, and build a full-fledged Telegram gaming ecosystem known as the Dogizen Universe, complete with developer tools, in-game economies, and a launchpad for new projects. Just as WeChat mini-games have dominated in China, regularly seeing over half a billion monthly users , Telegram games are increasingly popular. The network was home to 21% of all Web3 game launches last year, with titles like Hamster Kombat, Catizen, and Notcoin reaching mainstream fame. Hamster Kombat even angered Iranian authorities for disrupting an election. In the context of a GameFi market set to hit $200 billion by 2034 , Telegram is the next frontier. And while its competitors launched in the chop of Q2 and Q3 2024, Dogizen is set to ride the momentum of the 2025 bull run, just in time for the next explosion in Telegram gaming. Dogizen has plenty of room to climb post-ICO The numbers don’t lie: Dogizen’s presale has already raised $3.8m, indicating how bullish investors are in its vision. Many expect DOGIZ to be a prime target for a Binance listing, given the exchange listed several of Dogizen’s competitors in 2024. Importantly, Dogizen is laying the foundation for longevity. Unlike Catizen and Hamster Kombat, which relied on airdrops that tanked their prices at launch, Dogizen’s ICO model produces a community made up of actual investors, not just opportunists waiting to farm free airdrop money. Plus, Dogizen’s long-term incentive structure of 101% APY staking rewards and a revenue-sharing model further encourage token holding rather than dumping. Then there’s the market cap—Dogizen will go live shortly after 7th February with a market cap under $10 million. Considering other Telegram gaming projects have soared past $1 billion in the past , that means plenty of room for exponential growth as the market realizes what Dogizen is building. Even at $200 million, early backers could realize +20x gains; at $1 billion, DOGIZ will fulfill the next 100x crypto predictions. The clock is ticking: Dogizen’s ICO is about to close It’s clear that Telegram gaming is set to thrive in 2025. It nailed it in 2024 despite a relatively lackluster market compared to today. With crypto about to go fully mainstream under the new Trump administration, it could be the biggest growth market in mobile gaming. Launching at the perfect time with a low market cap and an ambition to become the go-to Telegram gaming hub, DOGIZ could well be the next 100x crypto. There are just 24 hours left in the presale—don’t miss the last chance to be an early adopter. The Dogizen presale is underway.

The price is moving lower and might struggle to stay above $2.250. XRP price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $2.80 level. The price is now trading below $2.60 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.60 resistance zone. XRP Price Moves Lower XRP price started a recovery wave above the $2.20 support zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price gained pace for a move above the $2.250 and $2.400 resistance levels. The bulls pumped the price above the $2.60 level. However, the bears remained active near the $2.75 level. A high was formed at $2.780 and the price is now moving lower. There was a move below the $2.560 level. The price dropped and tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1.750 swing low to the $2.780 high.

There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.60 level. The next resistance is $2.70. A clear move above the $2.70 resistance might send the price toward the $2.80 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.920 resistance or even $3.00 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.050. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.50 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.260 level. The next major support is near the $2.1450 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1.750 swing low to the $2.780 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.1450 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.00 support. The next major support sits near the $1.880 zone.

The filing, submitted under the 19B4 rule, is on behalf of WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, four firms aiming to launch exchange-traded products that track XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This filing represents the second part of a two-step process for launching a crypto ETF. Once acknowledged by the SEC, the proposal will be published in the Federal Register, officially starting the agency’s approval process. Industry experts predict that with a pro-crypto administration and the upcoming new SEC chair, the approval of XRP spot ETFs could happen as early as this year. “The Exchange believes that approving this proposal (and comparable proposals) provides the Commission with the opportunity to allow U.S. investors with access to XRP in a regulated and transparent exchange traded vehicle that would act to limit risk to U.S. investors,” the filing said. Unlike previous crypto ETFs, XRP lacks an established futures market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a key component in the SEC’s decision-making process for Bitcoin and Ethereum approvals. To increase the likelihood of approval, WisdomTree, one of the filing firms, is implementing safeguards such as sourcing XRP from secondary markets rather than Ripple Labs, avoiding any direct ties with the company at the center of the SEC’s legal battle. Firms Rely on Ripple’s Partial Victory Against SEC Interest in XRP ETFs has increased after Ripple Labs won a partial legal victory in July 2023, with a favorable ruling in its ongoing SEC lawsuit. This legal outcome has been referenced in ETF applications. As the approval process for these ETFs continues, there is growing anticipation that a wave of institutional investment could flood into the market. The launch of XRP ETFs, along with similar products targeting top cryptocurrencies like Solana, would offer investors greater exposure to the digital asset space.
