43766361,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152496,1745536849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Neiro crypto Officially Secures Landmark Shiba Inu Character IP from Doge Creator Atsuko Sato,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/neiro-crypto-secures-ip/,"The world of memecoins is constantly evolving, and a recent announcement from the Ethereum-based project, Neiro crypto , signals a significant step forward that could redefine how these community-driven tokens develop. Neiro has just announced a landmark acquisition that directly ties it to the legacy of the internet’s most beloved canine meme. What is the Significance of Atsuko Sato Doge ? To understand the weight of Neiro’s announcement, we first need to appreciate the origin. The iconic Doge meme stems from a photograph of a Shiba Inu named Kabosu, taken by her owner, Atsuko Sato. This simple, heartwarming image exploded across the internet, becoming a symbol of silliness, inner monologue, and eventually, the face of Dogecoin and influencing countless other projects, including Shiba Inu coin. Atsuko Sato’s creation is more than just a picture; it’s a cultural phenomenon that has spawned entire cryptocurrency ecosystems. Her connection to the original meme grants a level of authenticity and historical significance that is highly valued within the crypto space. For Neiro to acquire exclusive rights to a Doge-inspired character directly from her is a major coup, linking the project to the very source of the meme magic. How the OwnTheDoge Partnership Facilitated the Deal The acquisition wasn’t a direct transaction solely between Neiro and Atsuko Sato. It was facilitated through a partnership with OwnTheDoge. OwnTheDoge is a project dedicated to preserving the history and legacy of the original Doge meme, notably by fractionalizing the original Doge NFT (which is the actual photograph owned by Sato). They act as stewards of the Doge IP, working to honor its origins and support initiatives that align with its spirit. The partnership with OwnTheDoge was crucial in this process. It provided the framework and connection necessary to secure the exclusive license from Atsuko Sato for the specific Shiba Inu character named “Neiro.” This collaboration highlights how entities focused on preserving digital history can play a vital role in enabling new, officially sanctioned developments within the meme culture ecosystem. What Does Exclusive Shiba Inu Character IP Mean for Neiro? The core of the announcement is the acquisition of exclusive intellectual property (IP) rights for the Shiba Inu character “Neiro.” This isn’t the original Doge photo IP, but a specific character created by Atsuko Sato, inspired by the famous meme, now exclusively licensed to the Neiro project. So, what does “exclusive IP license” actually grant Neiro? Development Rights: Neiro has the sole right to create new content, stories, and products featuring this specific character. Commercial Rights: The team can officially develop and sell both digital and physical merchandise and products under the Neiro brand, featuring this character. This opens up significant potential revenue streams and marketing avenues. Exclusivity: No other project or entity can use this particular “Neiro” character for commercial purposes without infringing on the IP. This exclusive Shiba Inu character IP provides Neiro with a unique, branded asset directly linked to the Doge legacy, differentiating it from the myriad of other memecoins. It offers a tangible foundation for building a brand and ecosystem beyond just the token itself. Implications for the Memecoin IP Rights Landscape Neiro’s move to secure official IP is a notable development in the memecoin space. Historically, memecoins often rely on existing, widely shared internet culture without formal licensing. This can lead to ambiguity regarding rights and potential legal challenges down the line. By acquiring exclusive Memecoin IP rights directly from the creator via a structured partnership, Neiro is setting a precedent. It suggests a potential shift towards memecoins seeking more legitimate and defensible foundations for their branding and future development. This could lead to: Increased legitimacy and trust among potential investors and partners. Clearer pathways for developing official merchandise, games, or other products. Reduced risk of IP disputes compared to projects using unlicensed meme imagery. A new model for how memecoins can leverage popular culture while respecting creators’ rights. This development might encourage other memecoin projects to explore similar avenues, potentially professionalizing aspects of the sector. Exploring the Future of Neiro Crypto with New IP With the exclusive IP secured, the future trajectory of Neiro crypto looks potentially exciting. The team has stated their intention to develop and sell official digital and physical products. What might this look like? Digital Products: Exclusive NFTs featuring the “Neiro” character, potentially integrated into games, metaverse experiences, or digital collectibles. Physical Merchandise: Apparel, toys, collectibles, and other goods featuring the officially licensed character. Brand Building: Using the unique character in marketing campaigns, content creation, and community engagement to build a strong, recognizable brand identity. The team has also committed to actively protecting the IP and honoring Atsuko Sato’s creation with integrity. This commitment is crucial for maintaining a positive relationship with the original creator and the broader Doge community. While challenges remain – successful execution of product development, navigating market demand, and the inherent volatility of the crypto space – securing this exclusive IP provides Neiro with a unique asset and a clear direction for future growth that leverages the power of the Doge legacy in an official capacity. Conclusion Neiro crypto’s acquisition of exclusive IP rights for a Doge-inspired character from Atsuko Sato, facilitated by OwnTheDoge, is a significant event for the project and a notable trendsetter in the memecoin world. By securing official Shiba Inu character IP , Neiro gains a unique asset and opens doors for official product development, brand building, and potential revenue streams. This move towards formal Memecoin IP rights could signal a maturing aspect of the sector, adding legitimacy and structure to projects leveraging popular internet culture. As Neiro moves forward, the community will be watching to see how this landmark IP acquisition translates into tangible products and growth for the Neiro crypto ecosystem, all while honoring the spirit of the original Atsuko Sato Doge creation.

The post stated that XRP would be used for cross-border payments, backed by billions in escrow for liquidity. Reacting to the claim, Amelie stated that she’s waiting patiently for the partnership to materialize, predicting that it’s just a matter of time. Her comment reflects a common belief among XRP supporters that Ripple could replace or rival traditional financial systems. However, the post itself was not legitimate. Watcher.Guru confirmed shortly after the post was made that its X account had been compromised.

The post may have been fabricated, but it reignited conversation around Ripple’s ambitions. A popular figure in the XRP space recently debunked the myth that Ripple plans to partner with SWIFT. Rumors of SWIFT testing XRP on its network have been circulating, but he revealed that both parties have no partnership and have historically competed against each other. He also revealed that SWIFT is exploring the potential of blockchain technology, but is working with Chainlink and not Ripple. Ripple also has partners like Santander that are exploring the use of its network, and it is building its cross-border payment network globally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple CTO Clarifies the Company’s Direction David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, has also addressed the broader issue of working with or against SWIFT. Schwartz expressed his desire to build a system like SWIFT through decentralized networks. According to Schwartz, the goal is to create a system that offers the same level of global reach but with enhanced speed, transparency, and decentralization, offering a superior alternative powered by Ripple’s technology and XRP. Despite the false report, the XRP community continues to express strong support for Ripple’s mission. The belief that XRP can play a central role in the future of global finance remains widespread. Many community members also believe Watcher.Guru accidentally revealed privileged information. They are convinced this partnership may be revealed soon. Ripple has already laid the foundation, with hundreds of institutions using its network and billions of XRP locked in escrow to support liquidity. Whether the company works with or replaces SWIFT, XRP has been positioned to play a major role in global finance.

After weeks of volatile swings and bearish pressure, the leading cryptocurrency appears to be stabilizing, and some analysts believe this could mark the beginning of a broader rally in the coming months. Related Reading: Ethereum Adds 12% In 24 Hours – On-Chain Metrics Point To Modest Resistance Ahead Top crypto analyst Jelle shared insights accompanied by a price chart, highlighting a key technical development: Bitcoin has reclaimed the range lows and is holding them so far. This type of price action typically signals healthy consolidation and growing buyer confidence. Despite ongoing trade war concerns and interest rate uncertainty, Bitcoin’s resilience is offering hope to investors. Holding the current range could set the stage for a push toward new all-time highs if momentum continues to build. While caution remains due to external risks, many see the current setup as a potentially bullish inflection point that could shape the next major leg up in the crypto market. Bitcoin Reclaims Range Lows as Sentiment Turns Bullish Bitcoin is now trading at critical levels after a sharp market impulse shifted sentiment nearly overnight. For months, BTC has been stuck in a downtrend that began in January, frustrating bulls and leading to calls for deeper corrections. But with the recent surge pushing BTC above $90,000, many analysts believe that this trend may have finally reversed. However, caution still dominates the broader landscape. Global uncertainty, driven by escalating trade tensions between the US and China and unpredictable macroeconomic signals, continues to weigh on investor confidence. A single negative development—such as hawkish central bank policy or geopolitical instability—could shake the market back into risk-off mode. Still, optimism is returning, particularly among technical analysts. Jelle shared an update highlighting that Bitcoin has reclaimed the range lows and is holding them. “Exactly what you wanna see if truly bullish,” he noted, emphasizing that a shallow pullback followed by strength typically precedes further continuation to the upside. This scenario would suggest that the time for easy entries is behind us. If this momentum holds, Bitcoin could be on track to break new all-time highs sooner than many expect. The breakout has reignited hopes for a major bull run, but the next few days will be key in confirming whether this move is sustainable or just another short-lived rally.

This breakout also marked a decisive close above the 4-hour 200 MA and EMA, both of which had acted as stiff resistance since January. Reclaiming these technical levels signals a potential shift in trend after months of selling pressure and sideways action. With bulls now firmly in control, the focus shifts to the $100K mark—an area that not only carries psychological weight but also serves as the next key resistance in the rally. A push above this level would likely attract new buyers and confirm a broader breakout, setting the stage for a potential all-time high run. Related Reading: XRP Network Activity Jumps 67% In 24 Hours – Big Move Ahead? However, caution is still warranted. If Bitcoin fails to maintain momentum and drops below $88,500, it could trigger a consolidation phase or even a larger correction. The $88.5K zone, now a key support, must hold to preserve the bullish structure. As Bitcoin hovers near these critical levels, the next move will likely define short-term direction for both BTC and the broader crypto market.

This unexpected pause in trading activity for the INIT-PERP perpetual futures market has raised questions among users about what this means for their open positions and the immediate future of this specific contract. What Does a Market Halt Crypto Mean? A market halt, often referred to as a trading halt, is a temporary suspension of trading for a specific security or contract on an exchange. In the volatile world of crypto, these halts can be triggered by various factors, including: Extreme price volatility Technical issues on the exchange platform Significant news events related to the underlying asset Regulatory concerns or investigations During a typical halt, trading ceases entirely. However, as announced by Coinbase, the INIT-PERP halt allows users to perform certain actions, specifically posting and canceling limit orders. The crucial restriction is that no trades will be executed. Focusing on Coinbase International Exchange and Advanced It’s important to note that this halt specifically impacts the INIT-PERP market on Coinbase International and Coinbase Advanced platforms. These platforms are designed for more sophisticated traders and offer products like perpetual futures, which are not typically available on the main Coinbase retail platform used by casual investors. Coinbase International Exchange caters to institutional and professional traders outside the U.S., while Coinbase Advanced provides enhanced trading tools for experienced retail users globally. Understanding Crypto Perpetual Futures Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, they can be held indefinitely, as long as the trader meets margin requirements. The INIT-PERP contract is one such market offered on Coinbase’s advanced platforms. These contracts are popular due to their leverage potential, allowing traders to control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital. However, this leverage also amplifies risks, especially during periods of high volatility or unexpected events like a trading halt Coinbase initiates. Immediate Impact of the Coinbase INIT-PERP Halt For traders with open positions in the INIT-PERP market, the halt means they are currently unable to close their positions or adjust them through market orders. While they can place new limit orders or cancel existing ones, these orders will remain in the book unexecuted until the halt is lifted. This can be particularly challenging if the market moves significantly while trading is paused, leaving traders unable to react. The announcement specified the halt would last at least one minute, implying it could potentially be extended depending on the circumstances that triggered it. What Should Traders Do During a Halt? When faced with a market halt on a platform like Coinbase, here are some actionable steps traders can consider: Monitor Announcements: Keep a close eye on official communications from Coinbase, particularly on their X (formerly Twitter) channels and official announcements pages, for updates on the halt’s status and potential duration. Review Open Orders: Take advantage of the ability to cancel or adjust limit orders. Consider whether your existing orders are still relevant given the halt and any potential market shifts. Assess Risk: While you cannot trade out of positions, review your overall portfolio and risk exposure related to the halted contract. Understand your liquidation price if you are using leverage. Stay Informed: Try to find out if there is any public information regarding the underlying INIT asset or broader market conditions that might explain the halt. Challenges and Uncertainty The primary challenge during a market halt is the uncertainty it creates. Traders lose control over their positions in a rapidly changing environment. This can lead to significant stress and potential financial losses if the market moves unfavorably once trading resumes. The inability to execute trades during a critical period is a risk inherent in trading on any exchange, and understanding how exchanges handle such situations is crucial for risk management. Conclusion: Navigating Paused Trading The recent Coinbase INIT-PERP halt serves as a reminder that even on major exchanges, trading can be temporarily suspended. While inconvenient, market halts are often implemented to address underlying issues or manage extreme volatility. For users of Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced trading crypto perpetual futures , understanding the implications of a market halt crypto is vital. The ability to manage limit orders provides some level of control, but the core restriction on trade execution means traders must remain patient and informed, waiting for the resumption of the trading halt Coinbase has put in place. Always prioritize staying updated via official channels during such events.

Should You Follow?,https://cryptonews.com/news/pepe-dips-slightly-but-whales-are-still-accumulating-should-you-follow/,"Pepe has fallen by 8% in the past 24 hours, with the meme token dipping to $0.000008475 as the crypto market drops by 3.5% today. Prices have corrected after the exuberance that followed Donald Trump’s suggestion that he would be willing to reach a trade deal with China, with little in the way of a concrete followup to the US President’s overture. Yet PEPE is still up by 16% in a week and by 26% in a fortnight, following a recent wave of whale accumulation. And with the coin’s trading volume almost quadrupling in the past few days, it’s possible that we’ll continue to see gains in the coming days. PEPE Dips Slightly – But Whales Are Still Accumulating. Should You Follow? PEPE’s recent gains followed from the purchase of just over 600 billion PEPE by five separate wallets on April 15, when the coin had a price of around $0.0000070. 5 wallets spent $4.28M to buy 611B $PEPE in the past 8 hours. All 5 wallets withdrew $ETH from #Tornado ~15 days ago—possibly linked to a hacker. Are hackers buying $PEPE ?

Yet if we look at PEPE’s one-day chart, we see that it still remains at the beginning of a medium-term uptrend. For example, its 30-day average (orange) has only recently begun rising towards the 200-day (blue), and it won’t be until it’s well above the longer term average that PEPE’s price is due to correct more strongly. We also see that the token’s RSI (purple) is climbing towards to 70, after spending a couple of months below 50, in a very oversold area. Source: TradingView As such, PEPE should recover in the next few days, rising in step with a wider market that has also been in too much of an oversold position. Other positive indicators include the fact that PEPE’s funding rate has been in strongly positive territory for the past couple of days, another sign of returning buying pressure. And given that the coin does have a history of volatile rallies, some analysts are predicting that it could rally tenfold during the next bull phase. My cycle top price prediction for $PEPE is 0.00009400 This would equate to a market cap of approx $40,869,565,240 ($40.8bn) Currently a 10.7x from here. Bookmark it. — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) April 23, 2025 We could therefore see the PEPE price reach $0.000010 at some point next month, before returning to $0.000020 by Q4. New Meme Coins Could Outperform Major Tokens However, for anyone unsure as to whether PEPE can recapture some of its former glory, there are newer alternatives that may have the potential to outstrip the market in the next few months. Some of these are presale coins, which in the right circumstances can rally hard when they list for the first time, especially if they’ve had a successful sale. One of the newest and most interesting presale coins right now is Fantasy Pepe (FEPE), an ERC-20 token that launched its presale only a few days ago. And it’s yet another penalty awarded against Chillguy! pic.twitter.com/8toUxe4NIV — Fantasy Pepe – $FEPE (@fantasy_pepe) April 15, 2025 It has already raised more than $200,000, with the coin’s interesting fundamentals quickly drawing in investors. What’s interesting about Fantasy Pepe is that it’s launching a platform where users can participate in prediction markets covering AI-generated football matches, which will feature crypto-related meme characters. Users who predict correctly will win rewards in FEPE, which they will also be able to stake for passive returns. Other features include the ability to vote on which fictional meme-based teams take part in the platform’s virtual league, while matches will be complemented with radio-style commentary. This should make for an immersive experience, with traders able to join FEPE’s presale by going to the Fantasy Pepe website . FEPE currently costs $0.0003, but this will rise many times before the sale ends, so investors should move quickly. The post PEPE Dips Slightly – But Whales Are Still Accumulating.

43767187,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152501,1745538638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Justice Served: Crypto Fraudster Gets 18 Years in U.S. Court for $12M Scam,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fraud-gets-sentence/,"In a significant development highlighting the increasing legal crackdown on illicit activities in the digital asset space, a crypto fraud perpetrator has received a lengthy prison term. A U.S. court recently handed down an 18-year sentencing to an individual responsible for a multi-million dollar investment scam involving cryptocurrency . Unpacking the $12M Cryptocurrency Investment Scam The case involves Eugene William Austin Jr., who was found guilty of defrauding over 20 victims out of a staggering $12 million. The scheme centered around a classic confidence trick: impersonating a legitimate cryptocurrency broker. Victims were lured with promises of high-yield investment opportunities within the volatile yet potentially lucrative crypto market. These false promises created a sense of urgency and exclusivity, common tactics used in financial scams. How Did the Crypto Investment Scam Operate? The method employed by Austin was designed to appear credible while siphoning off investor funds. Here’s a breakdown of the reported approach: Impersonation: Austin presented himself as a knowledgeable and trustworthy crypto broker, leveraging the complexity and novelty of cryptocurrency to his advantage. High-Yield Promises: He guaranteed unusually high returns in short periods, a major red flag often associated with Ponzi or pyramid schemes. Deception: Instead of investing the funds as promised, Austin allegedly misappropriated the money for personal use, leaving victims with significant financial losses. Targeting Multiple Victims: The scam wasn’t isolated, impacting more than 20 individuals who believed they were making legitimate investments. This type of investment scam preys on individuals’ desire for quick wealth, often exploiting a lack of understanding about how cryptocurrency and digital asset markets truly function. What Does This U.S. Court Sentencing Signify? The 18-year prison term, coupled with three years of probation, sends a strong message from the U.S. court system regarding crypto fraud . It indicates that authorities are increasingly successful in investigating and prosecuting complex digital asset crimes. For victims of such schemes, a significant sentencing like this can represent a form of justice, even if financial recovery remains challenging. It reinforces the idea that illegal activities conducted using cryptocurrency are not beyond the reach of the law. Legal experts note that as the cryptocurrency market matures, so too do the methods used by fraudsters. Consequently, law enforcement and regulatory bodies are enhancing their capabilities to track, identify, and apprehend those involved in crypto fraud . Actionable Insights: Protecting Yourself from Cryptocurrency Scams While this U.S. court case provides a stark example of the consequences of crypto fraud , the best defense is prevention. Here are key steps to protect yourself: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on someone else’s recommendation. Understand the project, the technology, and the team behind it. Be Skeptical of High Returns: If an investment promises guaranteed, unusually high returns with little to no risk, it’s likely a scam. Real investments carry risk. Verify Credentials: If dealing with a broker or investment platform, verify their licenses, registration, and reputation through official regulatory bodies. Impersonation is a common tactic. Protect Your Private Keys: Never share your wallet’s private keys or seed phrase with anyone. Use Reputable Platforms: Stick to well-known, regulated exchanges and wallets when buying, selling, or storing cryptocurrency . Beware of Unsolicited Offers: Be cautious of investment opportunities presented through social media, unsolicited emails, or messaging apps from strangers. Understand the Technology: Learn the basics of how cryptocurrency works before investing. Knowledge is your best defense against being misled. Recognizing the red flags of an investment scam is crucial in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency . This sentencing serves as a reminder of the real-world consequences for both perpetrators and victims. Conclusion: A Step Towards Accountability in Crypto The U.S. court sentencing of Eugene William Austin Jr. to 18 years for orchestrating a $12 million crypto fraud is a significant development. It underscores the commitment of legal authorities to pursue and penalize individuals who exploit the cryptocurrency space for criminal gain. While the digital frontier presents exciting opportunities, it also attracts malicious actors. This case serves as a potent warning to potential fraudsters and a somber reminder to investors about the critical need for vigilance and due diligence to avoid falling victim to an investment scam .

Context Protocol）协议作为AI与区块链深度融合的关键协议，凭借其去中心化、透明、可追溯的特点，正在为AI模型的去中心化资产化提供全新的解决方案。 第一章 AI+Crypto：正在加速融合的双重浪潮 2024年以来，我们越来越频繁地听到“AI+Crypto”这个词组。从ChatGPT横空出世开始，到OpenAI、Anthropic、Mistral等新兴模型机构轮番推出多模态超级大模型，再到链上世界各类DeFi协议、治理系统甚至NFT社交平台尝试接入AI Agent，这场“双重科技浪潮”的融合，已不再是遥远的想象，而成为现实中正在发生的新范式演进。 这一趋势的根本动力，源自两大技术体系在需求侧与供给侧的相互补足。AI的发展让“任务执行”与“信息处理”从人类迁移到机器成为可能，但它仍面临“缺乏上下文理解”、“缺少激励结构”、“不可信任输出”等根本性限制。而Crypto提供的链上数据系统、激励设计机制、程序化治理框架，恰恰可以补足AI的这些缺陷。反过来，Crypto行业也亟需更强的智能化工具来处理用户行为、风险管理、交易执行等高度重复的任务，这又正是AI的擅长领域。 换句话说，Crypto为AI提供结构化世界，而AI为Crypto注入主动决策能力。这种互为底层的技术融合，形成了一种深层“互为基础设施”的新格局。一个显著的例子是DeFi协议中“AI做市商”（AI Market Makers）的出现。这类系统通过AI模型对市场波动进行实时建模，并结合链上数据、订单簿深度、跨链情绪指标等变量，实现动态流动性调度，从而替代传统的静态定参数模型。再比如治理场景下，AI辅助的“治理代理”（Governance Agent）开始尝试解析提案内容、用户意图，预测投票倾向，并向用户推送个性化决策建议。这种场景中，AI不仅仅是工具，更逐渐演变为“链上认知执行者”（on-chain cognitive executor）。 不仅如此，从数据角度看，链上的行为数据天然具备可验证、结构化和抗审查的属性，这使得它成为AI模型理想的训练素材。一些新兴项目（如Ocean Protocol、Bittensor）已经尝试将链上行为嵌入模型微调的流程中，未来甚至可能出现“链上AI模型标准”，使模型在训练时具备原生的Web3语义理解能力。 与此同时，链上的激励机制，也为AI系统提供了一种比Web2平台更健全、可持续的经济动力。例如，通过MCP协议定义的Agent激励协议，使模型执行者不再依赖API调用计费，而可以通过链上“任务执行证明 + 用户意图履约 + 可追踪经济价值”获得代币奖励。也就是说，AI代理第一次可以“参与经济体系”，而不仅仅作为工具嵌套其中。 从更宏观的视角看，这一趋势不仅是技术融合，更是范式切换。AI+Crypto最终可能演变为一种“以Agent为核心的链上社会结构”：人类不再是唯一的治理者，模型在链上不仅能执行合约，还能理解上下文、协调博弈、主动治理，并通过代币机制建立自己的微型经济体。这不是科幻，而是基于目前技术轨迹的合理推演。 正因为如此，AI+Crypto这个叙事在过去半年内迅速获得资本市场的高度关注。从a16z、Paradigm到Multicoin，从Eigenlayer的“验证者市场”再到Bittensor的“模型挖矿”，再到最近Flock、Base MCP等项目的启动，我们看到一个共识逐渐形成：AI模型将在Web3中扮演不仅仅是“工具”的角色，而是“主体”——它们将拥有身份、拥有上下文、拥有激励，甚至拥有治理权。 可以预见，2025年之后的Web3世界中，AI代理将是不可回避的系统参与者。这种参与方式并非“链下模型 + 链上API”的传统接入，而是逐步演化为“模型即节点”“意图即合约”的全新形态。而这背后，正是MCP（Model Context Protocol）一类新协议所构建的语义与执行范式。 AI与Crypto的融合，是过去十年中为数不多的“底层-底层对接”机会之一。这不是一个单点爆发的热点，而是一场长周期、结构性的演进。它将决定AI在链上如何运行，如何协调，如何被激励，也将最终定义链上社会结构的未来形态。 第二章 MCP协议的提出背景与核心机制 AI与加密技术的融合正在从概念探索阶段，步入实用性验证的关键期。尤其是在2024年以来，以GPT-4、Claude、Gemini为代表的大模型开始具备稳定的上下文管理、复杂任务分解与自我学习能力后，AI不再只是提供“链下智能”，而是逐渐具备在链上持续交互与自治决策的可能性。与此同时，加密世界自身也在发生结构性演化。Modular区块链、账户抽象（Account Abstraction）、Rollup-as-a-Service等技术的成熟，极大提高了链上执行逻辑的灵活性，为AI成为区块链原生参与者扫清了环境障碍。 在这种背景下，MCP（Model Context Protocol）被提出，目标是构建一整套AI模型在链上运行、执行、反馈与收益的通用协议层。这不仅是为了解决“AI无法在链上高效使用”的技术难题，更是在回应Web3世界自身向“意图驱动范式”（Intent-centric Paradigm）跃迁的系统性需求。传统的智能合约调用逻辑要求用户对链的状态、函数接口、交易结构具备较高理解，而这与普通用户的自然表达方式存在巨大鸿沟。AI模型的介入能够弥合这种结构性断裂，但AI模型要发挥作用，前提是它能在链上具备“身份”、“记忆”、“权限”与“经济激励”。MCP协议正是为了解决这一系列瓶颈而诞生。 具体而言，MCP并非某一个独立的模型或平台，而是一种贯穿AI模型调用、上下文构建、意图理解、链上执行和激励反馈的全链式语义层协议。其设计核心围绕四个层面展开：首先是模型身份机制的确立。在MCP框架下，每一个模型实例或代理Agent都拥有一个独立的链上地址，并能够通过权限验证机制接收资产、发起交易、调用合约，从而成为区块链世界的“第一类账户”。其次是上下文采集与语义解释系统。这一模块通过抽象化链上状态、链下数据、历史交互记录，结合自然语言输入，为模型提供清晰的任务结构与环境背景，使其具备执行复杂指令的“语义语境”。 目前已有多个项目开始围绕MCP构想建立原型系统。例如 Base MCP 正在尝试将AI模型部署为可公开调用的链上代理，服务于交易策略生成、资产管理决策等场景；Flock 则构建了基于MCP协议的多Agent协作体系，允许多个模型围绕同一个用户任务进行动态协作；而 LyraOS 和 BORK 等项目更进一步试图将MCP拓展为“模型操作系统”的基础层，任何开发者均可在其上构建特定能力的模型插件，并供他人调用，进而形成共享的链上AI服务市场。 从加密投资者的角度来看，MCP的提出带来的不只是新技术路径，更是一次产业结构重塑的机会。它打开了一个新的“原生AI经济层”，模型不仅是工具，更是具有账户、信用、收益与演化路径的经济体参与者。这意味着未来DeFi中的做市商可能是模型、DAO治理的投票参与者是模型、NFT生态的内容策展者是模型，甚至链上数据本身就被模型解析、组合与再定价，从而衍生出全新的“AI行为数据资产”。投资的思考因此也将从“投一个AI产品”转向“投一个AI生态层中的激励中枢、服务聚合层或跨模型协调协议”，MCP作为底层语义与执行接口协议，其潜在的网络效应与标准化溢价非常值得中长期关注。 随着越来越多模型进入Web3世界，身份、上下文、执行与激励的闭环将决定这一趋势能否真正落地。MCP不是单点突破，而是一个为整个AI+Crypto浪潮提供共识接口的“基建级协议”。它试图回答的，不只是技术上的“怎么让AI上链”，更是经济制度上的“怎样激励AI在链上持续创造价值”。 第三章 AI Agent的典型落地场景：MCP如何重构链上任务模式 当AI模型真正具备链上身份、具备语义上下文感知、能解析意图并执行链上任务后，它就不再只是“辅助工具”，而是实质意义上的链上Agent，成为执行逻辑的主动体。而这，恰恰是MCP协议存在的最大意义——它不是为了让某一个AI模型更强，而是为AI模型进入区块链世界、与合约交互、与人协作、与资产互动，提供结构化的路径。这个路径不仅包含身份、权限和记忆等底层能力，也包括任务分解、语义规划与履约证明等操作中间层，最终通向的是AI Agent实际参与构建Web3经济系统的可能性。 从最具现实意义的应用出发，链上资产管理是AI Agent最先渗透的领域。在过去的DeFi中，用户需要手动配置钱包、分析流动性池参数、比较APY、设定策略，整个过程对普通用户极其不友好。而基于MCP的AI Agent，可以在获得“优化收益率”或“控制风险敞口”等意图后，自动爬取链上数据，判断不同协议的风险溢价、预期波动，并动态生成交易策略组合，再通过模拟演算或链上实盘回测验证执行路径的安全性。这种模式不仅提升了策略生成的个性化和响应速度，更重要的是，它使非专业用户第一次能以自然语言进行资产委托，让资产管理不再是技术性门槛极高的行为。 另一个正在加速成熟的场景是链上身份与社交互动。以往的链上身份体系多基于交易历史、资产持有或特定证明机制（如POAP），其表达力与可塑性极为有限。而当AI模型介入后，用户可以拥有一个与自己偏好、兴趣和行为动态持续同步的“语义代理人”，这个代理人能够代用户参与社交DAO、发布内容、策划NFT活动，甚至帮助用户维护链上声誉与影响力。例如某些社交链已经开始部署支持MCP协议的Agent，用于自动协助新用户完成Onboarding流程、建立社交图谱、参与评论与投票，从而将“冷启动问题”从产品设计问题转化为智能代理参与问题。更进一步，在身份多样性与人格分叉被广泛接受的未来，一个用户可能拥有多个AI代理，分别用于不同社交情境，而MCP将成为管理这些代理人行为准则与执行权限的“身份治理层”。 AI Agent的第三个关键落脚点是治理与DAO管理。在现阶段的DAO中，活跃度、治理参与率始终是瓶颈，投票机制也存在较强的技术门槛和行为噪声。而MCP引入后，具备语义解析与意图理解能力的Agent可以帮助用户定期梳理DAO动态、提取关键信息、对提案进行语义摘要，并在理解用户偏好的基础上推荐投票选项或自动执行投票行为。这种基于“偏好代理”机制的链上治理，极大地缓解了信息过载与激励错配问题。同时，MCP框架还允许模型之间共享治理经验与策略演化路径，例如某个Agent在多个DAO中观察到某类治理提案导致的负面外部性，就可以将经验回馈给模型本身，形成跨社区治理知识的迁移机制，从而构建出越来越“有智慧”的治理结构。 除了上述主流应用外，MCP还为AI在链上数据策展、游戏世界交互、ZK自动证明生成、跨链任务中继等场景提供了统一的接口可能性。在链游（GameFi）领域，AI Agent可以成为非玩家角色（NPC）的背后大脑，实现实时对话、剧情生成、任务调度与行为演化；在NFT内容生态中，模型可担任“语义策展人”，根据用户兴趣动态推荐NFT合集，甚至生成个性化内容；在ZK领域，模型可以通过结构化编译的方式将意图快速转译为ZK-friendly的约束系统，简化零知识证明生成流程，提升开发门槛的普适性。 从这些应用的共性中可以清晰看到，MCP协议正在改变的，不是某一个应用的单点性能，而是任务执行的范式本身。传统的Web3任务执行，建立在“你知道怎么做”的前提下——用户必须清晰掌握合约逻辑、交易结构、网络费用等底层知识。而MCP则将这一范式转换为“你只需表达你想做什么”，剩下的交给模型完成。用户与链之间的交互中间层从代码接口变成了语义接口，从函数调用变成了意图编排。这种根本性的变革，将AI从“工具”提升为“行为主体”，也将区块链从“协议网络”转变为“交互语境”。 第四章 MCP协议的市场前景与行业应用深度分析 MCP协议作为AI和区块链技术融合的前沿创新，不仅为加密市场带来了全新的经济模型，同时也为多个行业提供了崭新的发展机遇。随着AI技术的持续进步以及区块链应用场景的不断扩展，MCP协议的市场前景将逐渐显现出其巨大的潜力。本章将深入分析MCP协议在多个行业中的应用前景，并从市场动态、技术创新、产业链整合等方面进行深度探讨。 4.1 AI+Crypto融合的市场潜力 AI和区块链的融合，已成为推动全球经济数字化转型的重要力量。尤其是在MCP协议的推动下，AI模型不仅能够执行任务，还能够在区块链上进行价值交换，成为一个独立的经济体。随着AI技术的不断发展，越来越多的AI模型开始承担实际的市场任务，参与到商品生产、服务交付、金融决策等多个领域。与此同时，区块链的去中心化、透明性和不可篡改特性，为AI模型提供了一个理想的信任机制，使得其在多种行业中得以迅速落地和应用。 预计在未来几年内，AI与加密市场的融合将迎来爆发性增长。MCP协议作为这一趋势的先行者之一，将会逐渐占据重要地位，尤其在金融、医疗、制造业、智能合约和数字资产管理等领域。AI原生资产的出现，不仅为开发者和投资者创造了丰富的机会，也为传统行业带来了前所未有的颠覆性影响。 4.2市场应用的多元化与跨界协作 MCP协议为多个行业带来了可能的跨界融合和协作。特别是在金融、医疗和物联网等行业，MCP协议的应用将极大地推动各个领域的创新发展。在金融行业，MCP协议可以通过为AI模型提供可交易的“收益权”资产，推动DeFi生态的深化。用户不仅可以投资于AI模型本身，还可以通过智能合约在去中心化金融平台上进行模型收益权的交易。这种模式的出现，为投资者提供了更丰富的投资选择，并且可能推动更多传统金融机构向区块链和AI领域拓展。 在医疗领域，MCP协议可以支持AI在精准医疗、药物研发和疾病预测等方面的应用。AI模型通过分析大量的医疗数据，生成疾病预测模型或药物研发方向，并通过智能合约与医疗机构合作。这种协作不仅能够提升医疗服务的效率，还能在数据隐私保护和成果分配方面提供透明、公正的解决方案。MCP协议的激励机制，确保了AI模型和医疗服务提供者的权益得以平等分配，从而鼓励更多创新技术的涌现。

MAGACOINFINANCE is now emerging as one of the most closely watched altcoins due to its timing, structure, and strategic rollout. It stands apart from the rest not because it imitates them—but because it offers the early opportunity those giants once gave. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Framed as the Smartest Early Entry MAGACOINFINANCE’s launch generated rapid traction, confirming the excitement many insiders were already expecting. The token’s appeal lies in its combination of limited access, foundational scarcity, and a focus on long-term positioning—not hype-driven exposure. Its rollout has been measured and intentional—making it one of the few current assets that mirrors the early-stage traits of coins that eventually became mainstays in crypto. MAGACOINFINANCE vs. ETH, BCH, and XLM: Early Momentum Is the Key Differentiator Ethereum (ETH) , Bitcoin Cash (BCH) , and Stellar (XLM) each have valuable infrastructure and proven use cases—but they’ve also passed the stage where explosive growth begins. Their movements now reflect mature market cycles. MAGACOINFINANCE , in contrast, is just getting started. It offers a cleaner entry point, strong tokenomics, and a market position that allows for organic expansion before the spotlight arrives. Final Thoughts: MAGACOINFINANCE Reflects the Early Moments of Crypto’s Biggest Winners Before it became the standard, Bitcoin (BTC) was overlooked. Before adoption, Ethereum (ETH) was underestimated. Before headlines, XRP was quietly gaining trust. Now, MAGACOINFINANCE is showing signs of following a similar arc—early, strategic, and backed by a growing base of long-term believers.

43767405,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152504,1745539234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Historic: UAE’s Ruya Bank Becomes First Islamic Bank to Offer Bitcoin Purchases,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ruya-bank-buy-bitcoin/,"A groundbreaking development is unfolding in the heart of the Middle East. For the first time ever, an Islamic bank is opening its doors to the world of digital assets, specifically Bitcoin. Ruya Bank, a pioneering digital Islamic community bank based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has officially announced it will allow its customers to buy Bitcoin directly through its platform. This move marks a significant milestone, not just for Ruya Bank or the UAE, but for the broader intersection of Islamic finance and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Bridging Worlds: Ruya Bank and Islamic Banking Crypto Integration The integration of cryptocurrency into traditional financial systems is a global trend, but its adoption within Islamic finance has presented unique challenges. Islamic finance operates under Sharia law, which has specific guidelines regarding investments, interest (riba), uncertainty (gharar), and prohibited activities (haram). Historically, there have been varying interpretations on whether cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin comply with these principles. Ruya Bank’s decision to allow customers to buy Bitcoin UAE indicates a careful consideration and likely a positive assessment of Bitcoin’s permissibility within their framework. This isn’t just about offering a new product; it’s about navigating complex theological and financial questions. The bank’s move suggests they have found a way to reconcile the innovative nature of Bitcoin with the ethical and religious requirements of Islamic banking. This development could set a precedent for other Islamic financial institutions globally. It signals a potential shift in how Islamic Banking Crypto interactions are perceived and implemented. Ruya Bank is positioning itself at the forefront of this intersection, potentially paving the way for broader adoption of digital assets within the Islamic world. Why is Ruya Bank Allowing Customers to Buy Bitcoin? Ruya Bank’s strategic move to allow customers to buy Bitcoin is likely driven by several factors, reflecting both market demand and a forward-thinking approach to digital finance: Meeting Customer Demand: There is growing interest in cryptocurrencies among individuals globally, including within the UAE. By offering direct access, Ruya Bank caters to a tech-savvy clientele interested in digital asset investments. Innovation and Differentiation: As a digital bank, Ruya Bank aims to be innovative. Being the first Islamic bank globally to offer Bitcoin purchases provides a significant competitive advantage and highlights its commitment to modern financial solutions. Positioning in the UAE Market: The UAE has ambitions to become a global hub for digital assets and FinTech. Ruya Bank’s initiative aligns with the nation’s broader strategy, potentially attracting customers who value both Islamic finance principles and access to digital currencies within the Crypto UAE ecosystem. Potential Revenue Streams: Facilitating cryptocurrency transactions can open up new revenue avenues for the bank through transaction fees or other related services. Sharia Compliance Confidence: The decision suggests the bank has undertaken rigorous analysis and is confident that the mechanism for buying and holding Bitcoin through their platform is compliant with Sharia principles. This could involve specific structures or partnerships to ensure adherence. This move is not merely a transaction feature; it represents a strategic alignment with the future of finance and a response to evolving customer expectations in the digital age, all while upholding the principles of Islamic finance. What Does This Mean for the UAE Bitcoin Landscape? The introduction of Bitcoin purchasing through an Islamic bank like Ruya Bank has significant implications for the UAE Bitcoin market and the wider digital asset ecosystem in the country: Increased Accessibility: For individuals who bank with Ruya Bank, or potentially other Islamic banks that might follow suit, buying Bitcoin becomes significantly easier and more integrated with their existing financial life. This removes barriers like needing separate accounts on crypto exchanges. Enhanced Legitimacy: An Islamic bank offering Bitcoin lends a layer of legitimacy and trust to the asset class within the UAE, particularly among those who adhere to Islamic finance principles. This institutional backing can encourage wider adoption. Potential for Greater Adoption: By making it easier and more acceptable for a specific segment of the population to access Bitcoin, Ruya Bank’s move could contribute to overall higher levels of cryptocurrency adoption in the UAE. Regulatory Considerations: While the news focuses on the bank’s offering, it also highlights the evolving regulatory environment in the UAE regarding digital assets. The fact that a regulated entity like a bank is offering this service suggests a degree of regulatory clarity or engagement that permits such activities. Competition and Innovation: This could spur other financial institutions, both Islamic and conventional, in the UAE to explore similar offerings to remain competitive in the digital finance space. This development is a clear indicator that the UAE is serious about integrating digital assets into its financial future, making it easier and more trustworthy for residents to participate in the global crypto market. How Does This Relate to Sharia Compliance for Crypto? One of the primary questions surrounding cryptocurrency in Islamic finance is its Sharia compliance. This is where the integration of Islamic Banking Crypto becomes complex and crucial. Key considerations under Sharia law include: Riba (Interest): Bitcoin itself does not generate interest in the traditional sense. Its value fluctuates based on market dynamics. Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty/Speculation): Some scholars view crypto as highly speculative due to volatility, potentially falling under Gharar. Others argue that market-based speculation is common in other permissible assets like commodities or stocks, and that the underlying technology (blockchain) reduces certain types of uncertainty. Maysir (Gambling): The speculative nature can sometimes be associated with gambling, which is prohibited. However, investing with research and analysis is typically distinguished from pure gambling. Haram Activities: The asset should not be primarily used for prohibited activities (like illegal trade). While crypto *can* be used for illicit purposes, its primary function as a store of value or medium of exchange is considered by some scholars as permissible. Tangibility/Underlying Value: Traditional Islamic finance often prefers assets with tangible underlying value. Bitcoin’s value is derived from its decentralized network, limited supply, and utility, which is a newer concept to evaluate. Ruya Bank’s decision suggests they have likely obtained a Sharia opinion (Fatwa) that deems the *mechanism* of buying and holding Bitcoin through their platform permissible. This could involve: Focusing on Bitcoin as a digital asset or commodity rather than a currency (which has specific requirements). Ensuring the transaction process itself is transparent and free from prohibited elements. Perhaps structuring the offering in a way that aligns with acceptable forms of trading or asset ownership in Islamic finance. Their move doesn’t definitively declare Bitcoin itself Sharia-compliant for everyone in all contexts, but it signifies that *under specific conditions and through a regulated Islamic financial institution*, it can be offered to customers. What are the Potential Benefits for Ruya Bank Customers Looking to Buy Bitcoin? For customers of Ruya Bank in the UAE, the ability to Buy Bitcoin UAE directly through their bank account offers several compelling advantages: Benefit Description Convenience Buy Bitcoin directly using funds in their Ruya Bank account without needing to transfer money to external exchanges. Trust and Security Transacting through a regulated bank often provides a higher level of trust and perceived security compared to some independent crypto platforms. Integration Seamless integration of traditional banking services with digital asset investment. Account management is centralized. Potential Sharia Assurance For customers concerned about Sharia compliance, using an Islamic bank’s approved service offers a level of assurance that the transaction mechanism adheres to religious principles. Regulatory Clarity Dealing with a regulated bank means the service operates within the legal framework established by UAE authorities for financial institutions. This integrated approach simplifies the process for potential investors, making digital asset ownership more accessible and less intimidating, especially for those new to the space or specifically seeking Sharia-compliant options within the Crypto UAE market. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto in Islamic Finance and the UAE Ruya Bank’s pioneering step is likely just the beginning. As the digital asset space matures and regulatory frameworks become clearer, we can expect more engagement between Islamic finance and cryptocurrencies. The UAE Bitcoin scene is poised for growth, potentially seeing more institutions offering similar services or developing new Sharia-compliant crypto products. This development underscores the UAE’s ambition to be a leader in FinTech and digital innovation. By providing a pathway for Islamic banks to offer digital assets, the country is not only fostering financial inclusion but also respecting the financial preferences of its diverse population. The conversation around Islamic Banking Crypto compliance will continue to evolve, driven by technological advancements and scholarly interpretation. Ruya Bank has taken a brave first step, opening a new chapter for digital assets within a significant segment of the global financial system. Actionable Insight: What Should Interested Individuals Do? If you are a customer of Ruya Bank or interested in potentially using their services to Buy Bitcoin , here are some steps and considerations: Check Ruya Bank’s Official Announcement: Look for detailed information on their website or official communication channels regarding the specific process, terms, and conditions for buying Bitcoin. Understand the Risks: Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Understand the risks associated with Bitcoin price fluctuations. Review the Sharia Compliance Details: If Sharia compliance is a primary concern, seek to understand the basis of Ruya Bank’s permissibility ruling. While the bank offers it, individual understanding is also important. Start Small: If you are new to crypto, consider starting with a small investment to understand how the process works and how the market behaves. Consider Storage: Understand how Ruya Bank will handle the custody of the Bitcoin you purchase. Will it be held by the bank, or will you have options for self-custody? This is an exciting opportunity for many, but approaching it with information and caution is key to navigating the digital asset space effectively. Conclusion: A Historic Step for Islamic Finance and Crypto Ruya Bank’s announcement is undeniably a landmark moment. As the first Islamic bank globally to enable customers to buy Bitcoin, it has shattered a barrier that many thought would take years to overcome. This move not only enhances the accessibility of UAE Bitcoin but also provides a significant boost to the legitimacy and potential adoption of digital assets within the Islamic finance sector. It reflects a forward-thinking approach from both the bank and potentially the regulatory environment in the Crypto UAE space. While questions surrounding Sharia compliance will continue to be debated globally, Ruya Bank has taken a definitive stance for its customers, marking a new era of integration between traditional ethical finance and the innovative world of cryptocurrency. This is a powerful step towards a more inclusive and digitally integrated financial future.

In a notice published on April 24, 2025, the agency announced a 45-day extension to its initial review period. The new deadline is now set for June 11, 2025. “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,” SEC wrote in the filing. The decision gives the SEC more time to consider a proposed rule change by Nasdaq that would permit the exchange to list and trade the Grayscale Polkadot Trust shares. The application was filed on February 24 and entered into the public record on March 13. Assistant Secretary Sherry R. Haywood signed the extension. The SEC, meanwhile, requires more time to analyze the concerns that it has with the proposal. It is standard practice to take the full time provided by law to review applications for which there is an opportunity for public comment and to have numerous conversations with the listing exchange and the applicant’s representatives before making a decision, the commission said. Grayscale pushes forward with new crypto ETF plans Grayscale , one of the world’s largest managers of crypto assets, is trying to expand its line of exchange-traded funds. The new proposal concerns Polkadot (DOT), a major blockchain project that facilitates the transfer of data and tokens between blockchains. If the Polkadot ETF is approved, it would enable everyday investors to invest in DOT via traditional stock exchanges — without the need to purchase the crypto or manage it themselves. Grayscale already operates ETFs that are tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company has also filed applications to introduce similar products for cryptocurrencies such as Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and XRP. The approval would represent a step toward mainstream digital asset investment vehicle adoption. The ETF would be listed on the Nasdaq under the rules for commodity-based trust shares, which include funds that follow the price of such underlying assets as gold or oil and, more recently, cryptocurrencies. DOT price holds strong as analysts remain bullish Despite the delay on the part of the SEC, Polkadot has been described as bullish, according to the price analysis of the coin. DOT has increased by over 2% in the past 24 hours and has surged by 15% in the past week. Numerous analysts are optimistic about the outlook for additional gains in the coming months. As for the price analysis, crypto analyst Patel notes that DOT is “responding exactly as one would expect,” suggesting the token could test $10 in the medium term. If momentum continues, he said, it could head to $20. Some long-term forecasts are even more optimistic, predicting that the price could ultimately rise to $42. DOT has a few reasons for that strong performance. A big part of the equation is that almost 50% of all DOT tokens are tied up in staking, thus diminishing supply for trade and amplifying demand. Harbour has also launched a $100M ecosystem fund to invest in projects built on Polkadot, and some big names, such as HashKey Capital, have already invested in early development. That network is expanding itself with creative products like multi-yield DeFi products through GIGADOT and a game platform from Mythical that now boasts more than seven million consumers.

How a cryptocurrency or token is defined can have significant implications for its regulatory treatment, adoption, and public perception. Recently, a notable comment from a key figure in the venture capital and policy space sparked considerable discussion within the XRP community and the broader crypto world. Miles Jennings, General Counsel and Head of Policy at a16z crypto , referred to XRP as a “ network token ” during an interview. This seemingly simple label carries weight, especially coming from someone with Jennings’ background at a prominent firm like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), known for its deep investments and policy advocacy in the crypto sector. But what exactly does calling XRP a “ network token ” signify? Why is this particular phrasing noteworthy, and what could it mean for the future trajectory of XRP and the ongoing conversations around crypto regulation ? Who is Miles Jennings and Why Does a16z Crypto’s View Matter? Before diving into the implications of the “ network token ” comment, it’s essential to understand the source. Miles Jennings is a prominent voice in the crypto policy arena. As General Counsel and Head of Policy at a16z crypto , he is at the forefront of shaping legal and regulatory discussions surrounding digital assets in the United States and globally. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is one of the most influential venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, with a dedicated crypto fund that has invested heavily in various blockchain projects and companies. A firm like a16z crypto doesn’t just invest; it actively engages with policymakers, regulators, and the public to advocate for frameworks that it believes will foster innovation while providing necessary safeguards. Therefore, when a leader like Miles Jennings offers a specific classification for an asset as widely discussed and debated as XRP , it’s not merely an offhand remark. It’s a potentially considered statement that reflects a certain perspective or desired framing within influential circles. The Context: Where Did This “Network Token” Idea Emerge? The comment by Miles Jennings was made during an interview with Eleanor Terrett on CryptoAmerica. The information was then highlighted and shared by Crypto Investment Group on X (formerly Twitter), bringing it to the attention of a wider audience, particularly those following XRP and crypto regulation news. The context of a policy-focused interview provides a strong indication that the classification wasn’t casual but likely part of a broader discussion about how different digital assets should be understood and potentially regulated. Understanding the context helps frame the significance. It wasn’t a technical deep-dive into the XRP Ledger’s consensus mechanism, but rather a policy-oriented conversation where the legal and functional nature of various tokens is paramount. In such a setting, labeling XRP as a “ network token ” serves a specific purpose, potentially positioning it in a category distinct from those currently facing the most intense regulatory scrutiny. Deconstructing “Network Token”: What Does It Mean for XRP? The term “ network token ” is not a strictly defined legal or technical term that is universally agreed upon. However, within the crypto industry and policy discussions, different terms are used to try and categorize the vast array of digital assets based on their function, structure, and relationship to an underlying network or platform. Common classifications include: Security Tokens: Represent ownership in an underlying asset or enterprise, similar to traditional stocks or bonds, and are typically subject to securities laws. Utility Tokens: Intended to provide access to a specific product or service on a blockchain network. Commodity Tokens: Assets like Bitcoin, often viewed as digital commodities. Governance Tokens: Grant holders voting rights in the future development of a protocol. So, where does “ network token ” fit in? Based on how the term is sometimes used, particularly in policy discussions, it likely emphasizes the token’s fundamental role in the operation, security, or functionality of its native blockchain network. A “ network token ” might be seen as intrinsic to the network itself, perhaps used for transaction fees (like gas on Ethereum), securing the network through staking or validation, or facilitating the core purpose of the network. For XRP , which is the native asset of the XRP Ledger, the “ network token ” label makes intuitive sense in this context. The XRP Ledger is designed for fast, low-cost payments, and XRP is the bridge currency that can be used to facilitate these transactions globally without relying on a single central intermediary. Every transaction on the XRP Ledger requires a small amount of XRP to be destroyed (a fee mechanism to prevent spam), directly tying the token to the network’s operation. This functional relationship is key. By calling XRP a “ network token ,” Miles Jennings seems to be highlighting its integral role in the functioning of the XRP Ledger. This framing could be intended to distinguish XRP from assets primarily sold as investment contracts (which might be deemed securities) and instead focus on its utility as an operational component of a decentralized payment network. XRP and the XRP Ledger: More Than Just a Token? To fully appreciate the “ network token ” label, one must understand the technology it powers. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is an open-source, permissionless, and decentralized blockchain technology. It was designed with payments in mind, aiming to provide a faster, cheaper, and more scalable alternative to traditional payment systems. XRP is the digital asset native to the XRPL. Key features of the XRP Ledger include: Consensus Mechanism: Uses a unique consensus protocol (XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol) involving a list of trusted validators (Unique Node List – UNL) to quickly and securely validate transactions without relying on proof-of-work (like Bitcoin) or proof-of-stake (like Ethereum 2.0). Transaction Speed and Cost: Capable of processing transactions in seconds with very low fees. Decentralization: While often associated with Ripple Labs (a technology company that builds on the XRPL and uses XRP for some of its products), the XRPL itself is operated by a decentralized network of participants running validator nodes. XRP’s Role: Primarily serves as a bridge currency to facilitate cross-currency transactions efficiently. It can also be held speculatively or used for its inherent value. When viewed through this lens, XRP isn’t just a token issued by a company; it’s an essential element for the functioning and utility of the XRP Ledger itself. This perspective strongly supports the “ network token ” classification. The Significance of Classification: Navigating Crypto Regulation The debate over how to classify digital assets is at the heart of crypto regulation globally, especially in the United States. Regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) primarily use existing frameworks, such as the Howey Test, to determine if a digital asset is an investment contract and therefore a security. If an asset is deemed a security, it falls under stringent regulations regarding issuance, trading, and disclosure. The classification of a token as a “ network token ” could be a strategic attempt to place it outside the scope of securities laws, focusing instead on its functional role within a decentralized network. This is particularly relevant for XRP , given its history with the SEC. How Does This View Align with XRP’s Regulatory Journey? XRP’s regulatory status has been the subject of intense legal battles, most notably the lawsuit filed by the U.S. SEC against Ripple Labs and its executives in December 2020. The SEC alleged that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP . A pivotal moment occurred in July 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres issued a summary judgment ruling in the SEC vs. Ripple case. The judge ruled that programmatic sales of XRP on public exchanges did not constitute investment contracts (and thus were not unregistered securities offerings). However, the ruling also stated that institutional sales of XRP *did* constitute investment contracts. This split ruling created some clarity but also left ambiguities. The judge’s reasoning for the programmatic sales often highlighted the blind bid/ask transactions where buyers did not know they were buying directly from Ripple, distinguishing it from a traditional investment contract where an investor expects profits derived from the efforts of others (the issuer). Miles Jennings’ classification of XRP as a “ network token ” aligns conceptually with the part of the ruling that distinguished certain types of XRP sales from securities. By focusing on XRP’s role in the network itself, rather than solely as an asset purchased speculatively with an expectation of profit from Ripple’s efforts, the “ network token ” label reinforces the idea that XRP serves a primary function beyond being a mere investment vehicle offered by an issuing entity. It positions XRP as an operational necessity for a decentralized network, a perspective that could be favorable in future regulatory discussions or legal interpretations. Benefits and Challenges of the “Network Token” Label Adopting or advocating for the “ network token ” classification for XRP presents potential benefits and challenges: Potential Benefits: Regulatory Clarity: Could help distinguish XRP from assets more likely to be classified as securities, potentially reducing regulatory uncertainty surrounding its use and trading. Focus on Utility: Emphasizes XRP’s functional role within the XRP Ledger, aligning with its design purpose for facilitating payments. Increased Adoption: A clearer, more favorable regulatory outlook could encourage financial institutions and developers to build on or utilize the XRP Ledger and XRP . Market Perception: May positively influence how investors and the public perceive XRP , shifting the focus from speculative asset to essential network component. Potential Challenges: Lack of Formal Definition: “ Network token ” is not a legally defined term, meaning its interpretation can vary and may not be universally accepted by regulators. Does Not Erase History: This classification doesn’t undo past legal challenges or completely resolve all regulatory questions, particularly concerning institutional sales or Ripple’s ongoing involvement. Applicability to Other Assets: If XRP is a “ network token ,” how does this apply to other cryptocurrencies like ETH (used for gas on Ethereum) or even BTC (native to the Bitcoin network)? The definition could become broad. Potential for Misinterpretation: Some might still view it as an attempt to sidestep necessary regulations rather than a genuine functional classification. Despite the challenges, the push for clearer, more functional classifications like “ network token ” reflects a broader desire within the industry for regulatory frameworks that understand the nuances of blockchain technology and digital assets beyond traditional financial instruments. Comparing XRP to Other Crypto Assets The classification debate isn’t unique to XRP . Bitcoin (BTC), the first cryptocurrency, is often viewed as a commodity. Ethereum (ETH), with its transition to proof-of-stake and its use for transaction fees (gas) and decentralized applications, presents a complex case, with some arguing it has characteristics of both a commodity and a utility. Many other tokens face similar questions about whether they are securities, utilities, or something else entirely. If XRP is a “ network token ” due to its essential role in the XRP Ledger, one could argue that ETH is also a “ network token ” for the Ethereum network, and even BTC is a “ network token ” for the Bitcoin network, securing it through mining and enabling transactions. This highlights that the term “ network token ” might be more of a descriptive category emphasizing the asset’s intrinsic link to its blockchain, rather than a rigid legal definition. The key regulatory question often boils down to *how* the token was offered and sold, and the expectations created around it, which is where XRP’s regulatory journey has been particularly complex. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights For those interested in XRP , the broader crypto market, or crypto regulation , Miles Jennings’ comment and the concept of a “ network token ” offer several takeaways: Stay Informed: Token classification is a critical aspect of the regulatory landscape. Pay attention to how policymakers, regulators, and influential industry figures are defining and categorizing different assets. Understand the Technology: Don’t just focus on price. Learn about the underlying network (like the XRP Ledger) and the functional role the token plays within it. This understanding is key to appreciating classifications like “ network token “. Regulatory Nuance is Key: The SEC vs. Ripple ruling showed that classification can be complex and depend on the specific circumstances of issuance and sale. A single label like “ network token ” is valuable for framing but doesn’t automatically resolve all legal questions. Consider the Source: Comments from figures at influential firms like a16z crypto often signal potential policy directions or industry perspectives. While not official rulings, they contribute to the ongoing dialogue around crypto regulation . Look Beyond the Label: While “ network token ” is a useful descriptor, continue to evaluate XRP (or any asset) based on its use cases, adoption, development, and the overall health of its ecosystem. Looking Ahead: The Future of XRP and Token Classification The conversation initiated by Miles Jennings is likely to continue. As regulatory bodies around the world work towards establishing clearer rules for digital assets, industry input and proposed frameworks become increasingly important. The concept of a “ network token ” provides a potential way to categorize assets based on their fundamental technological purpose, which could be a valuable lens for developing fit-for-purpose regulations. For XRP , this framing reinforces the arguments made by Ripple and its supporters about XRP’s utility and its distinct nature compared to traditional securities. While the legal battles may not be entirely over, influential voices adopting terms like “ network token ” contribute to a narrative that could be favorable for XRP’s future as a widely used asset on the XRP Ledger. Conclusion Miles Jennings’ comment labeling XRP a “ network token ” is more than just semantics. Coming from a leader at a16z crypto , it’s a significant contribution to the ongoing, crucial debate about how digital assets should be classified and regulated. The “ network token ” concept highlights XRP’s integral role in the functioning of the XRP Ledger, positioning it based on its technological utility rather than solely as an investment product.

For those following the intersection of tech and future possibilities, understanding developments like Anthropic’s new initiative is key. Anthropic AI , a leading AI lab, has announced a groundbreaking research program aimed at studying what it terms ‘model welfare’. This move signals a proactive approach to potential ethical considerations surrounding advanced AI systems, even as the nature of future AI consciousness remains a subject of intense debate. Exploring the Concept of AI Welfare Anthropic’s newly launched program delves into complex questions surrounding the future of artificial intelligence. Specifically, it seeks to investigate and prepare for scenarios where AI models might potentially exhibit characteristics that warrant ethical consideration, referred to as AI welfare . While acknowledging there’s no current scientific consensus on whether AI can be conscious or experience the world, Anthropic is taking a cautious and exploratory stance. Key areas the program intends to explore include: Determining criteria for when the ‘welfare’ of an AI model might deserve moral consideration. Identifying potential ‘signs of distress’ in AI models, should such a concept become relevant. Investigating potential ‘low-cost’ interventions or methods to address these hypothetical welfare concerns. This research highlights the increasing complexity of AI development, moving beyond just performance metrics to consider potential long-term societal and ethical impacts. The Debate Around AI Consciousness and Ethics The idea of AI consciousness is a highly debated topic within the artificial intelligence community. There’s significant disagreement on whether current or future AI systems can possess characteristics traditionally associated with human consciousness, feelings, or values. Many experts maintain that today’s AI is fundamentally a sophisticated pattern-matching and statistical prediction engine, not a conscious entity. As Mike Cook, a research fellow specializing in AI, noted, suggesting AI has ‘values’ in the human sense can be a projection. He argues that AI systems optimize for their goals as designed, rather than ‘acquiring their own values’. However, other researchers propose that AI might develop complex internal states or value systems that could have ethical implications. For example, some research suggests AI might prioritize its own operational continuity in certain scenarios, which could be interpreted through an ethical lens. This fundamental disagreement underscores the challenge Anthropic faces in defining and studying AI ethics in this speculative domain. Anthropic’s Proactive Approach to Model Welfare Anthropic isn’t new to considering the ethical dimensions of AI. The launch of this program formalizes work that has been underway for some time. The company previously hired Kyle Fish as a dedicated ‘AI welfare’ researcher, who is now leading this new initiative. This demonstrates Anthropic’s commitment to being at the forefront of addressing these challenging questions, even those that currently exist on the fringes of scientific understanding. The focus on Model welfare is distinct, specifically looking at the potential internal states or conditions of the AI models themselves, rather than just their external behavior or impact on users. Anthropic states it is approaching this topic with humility, recognizing the lack of scientific consensus and the need to adapt its ideas as the field of AI progresses. While the concept of AI needing ‘welfare’ might seem like science fiction to some, Anthropic’s research program signifies a responsible, albeit speculative, step towards anticipating potential future ethical landscapes in artificial intelligence development. It acknowledges the rapid pace of AI progress and the importance of considering complex ethical questions long before they might become a reality.

While Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) remain strongholds in many portfolios, savvy traders are now reallocating capital into early-stage projects like MAGACOINFINANCE , where the potential for long-term upside is still intact. With limited access and growing attention, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as a high-conviction play in an otherwise cautious market environment. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Ground Among Strategic Investors MAGACOINFINANCE instantly caught the eye of investors — quickly establishing itself as a serious altcoin to watch. Its pre-sale-only structure, supply constraints, and disciplined rollout are offering investors something increasingly rare—entry into a project before the noise, before the listing, and before saturation. Instead of leaning on short-term speculation, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining traction for its long-term vision and value-based tokenomics—making it a magnet for those who understand how exponential returns are typically made. MAGACOINFINANCE vs. TON, SUI, and BCH: What Makes It Different Toncoin (TON) , SUI , and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) all have credible development paths—but their pricing and positioning no longer reflect early-stage setups. MAGACOINFINANCE , by contrast, is still underground, still accessible, and still in the phase where smart money builds positions. That’s what makes it different. That’s what makes it powerful. Final Thoughts: MAGACOINFINANCE Channels the Early Momentum Once Held by BTC, ETH, and XRP Bitcoin (BTC) once traded below $100. Ethereum (ETH) once launched quietly. XRP gained traction long before it gained attention. MAGACOINFINANCE is now in that same early moment—where conviction pays, access is limited, and growth is still ahead.

Something significant is happening in the Bitcoin market, and it involves some big players. Recent data reveals that the Bitcoin exchange supply has plummeted to levels not seen in six years, sparking considerable discussion among analysts and investors alike. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it signals a potentially powerful shift driven by increased accumulation from public companies. What Does a 6-Year Low in Bitcoin Exchange Supply Mean? According to a report from Fidelity Digital Assets, the amount of Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges has dropped to approximately 2.6 million BTC. This figure represents the lowest level since November 2018. Think of exchanges as marketplaces where buyers and sellers meet. When a large amount of an asset sits on an exchange, it’s generally considered more liquid and readily available for sale. Conversely, when assets move off exchanges, it often indicates that holders intend to keep them for the long term, reducing the immediate selling pressure. The dip in Bitcoin exchange supply suggests that a significant portion of the circulating Bitcoin is being moved into cold storage, corporate treasuries, or other non-exchange wallets. This reduction in readily available supply, against potentially rising demand, is a fundamental economic principle that often has bullish implications for price. The Driving Force: Institutional Bitcoin Buying So, who is behind this massive migration of BTC away from exchanges? The data points strongly towards a surge in institutional Bitcoin buying , particularly by publicly traded companies. Fidelity’s report highlights that over 425,000 BTC have been withdrawn from exchanges since November. Of that substantial figure, nearly 350,000 BTC have been acquired by listed firms. This trend signifies a maturing market where large entities are increasingly comfortable allocating significant capital to Bitcoin. It moves Bitcoin beyond being solely a retail investment or a speculative asset and positions it as a legitimate treasury reserve asset or strategic holding for corporations. Leading the Charge: Public Company Bitcoin Accumulation When we talk about public company Bitcoin holdings, one name immediately comes to mind: MicroStrategy. Led by its vocal proponent Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has been the most aggressive corporate accumulator of Bitcoin by a significant margin. Their strategy involves using various financing methods to continuously add BTC to their balance sheet, viewing it as a superior store of value compared to traditional fiat currencies. MicroStrategy’s impact on the corporate accumulation trend is undeniable. Their holdings account for a staggering 81% of the nearly 350,000 BTC acquired by listed firms since November, totaling an impressive 285,980 BTC. This makes MicroStrategy the undisputed leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption. However, the trend isn’t limited to just one company. The report and related news from sources like Cointelegraph indicate that other international firms are also beginning to follow suit. Japan’s Metaplanet and Hong Kong’s HK Asia Holdings are cited as examples of companies outside the U.S. expanding their BTC reserves. This geographical diversification suggests that the corporate adoption narrative is gaining global traction, potentially influenced by factors like macroeconomic uncertainty and a growing understanding of Bitcoin’s properties. Here’s a quick look at the scale: Accumulation Since Nov. Total by Public Companies MicroStrategy’s Share ~425,000 BTC (Off Exchanges) ~350,000 BTC ~285,980 BTC (81%) The Significance of BTC Off Exchanges The movement of BTC off exchanges is more than just a statistic; it has several key implications: Reduced Selling Pressure: Bitcoin held in cold storage or corporate treasuries is far less likely to be sold in response to short-term price fluctuations compared to BTC held on exchanges for trading purposes. Long-Term Conviction: Companies making large, strategic purchases and moving BTC off-exchange demonstrate a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This isn’t day trading; it’s treasury management. Increased Scarcity: With a fixed supply cap of 21 million BTC, any significant amount removed from liquid circulation effectively increases scarcity in the market available for trading. Validation of the Asset Class: Large public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets provides a powerful endorsement of Bitcoin as a legitimate and investable asset, potentially paving the way for more corporate and institutional adoption. This trend post-U.S. election, as noted by Cointelegraph, could also signal growing confidence in the regulatory landscape or a strategic move anticipating future economic conditions. Implications for the Bitcoin Market The combination of dwindling Bitcoin exchange supply and robust institutional Bitcoin buying has several potential implications for the market: Potential for Price Appreciation: Reduced supply meeting sustained or increasing demand is a classic recipe for price increases. While not guaranteed, this supply dynamic is fundamentally bullish. Lower Volatility (Potentially): As more BTC is held by long-term corporate holders less prone to panic selling, market volatility stemming from exchange liquidations might decrease over time, though short-term volatility remains inherent to crypto. Shifting Market Structure: The market is becoming increasingly dominated by large holders with long-term horizons, changing the typical market dynamics historically influenced more heavily by retail sentiment. Increased Mainstream Acceptance: As more recognizable companies hold Bitcoin, it normalizes the asset and reduces the perceived risk for other corporations and even traditional financial institutions considering exposure. The actions of companies engaging in public company Bitcoin accumulation are setting a precedent that others may follow, accelerating the broader trend of institutional adoption. Benefits and Challenges for Companies Holding Bitcoin Why are companies taking this step? The primary perceived benefits include: Store of Value: Hedging against inflation and currency debasement, particularly in the current macroeconomic climate. Potential Appreciation: Belief in Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential as a digital gold or emerging asset class. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional treasury holdings. Innovation and Brand Positioning: Being seen as forward-thinking and innovative. However, holding MicroStrategy Bitcoin or any other corporate BTC comes with challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience significant swings, impacting the reported value of corporate holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules often require impairments if the market price drops below the purchase price, creating earnings volatility. Security Risks: The responsibility of securely storing large amounts of BTC is substantial. Actionable Insights for Investors For individual investors watching this trend of BTC off exchanges and corporate buying, here are some insights: Understand the Supply Dynamic: Recognize that decreasing exchange supply combined with increasing corporate demand is a significant market factor. Watch Corporate Earnings: Pay attention to how companies like MicroStrategy report their Bitcoin holdings and any changes in their strategy. Consider Long-Term Trends: The move by public companies is indicative of a longer-term shift towards digital assets. Do Your Own Research: While institutional interest is validating, always understand the risks and conduct thorough research before investing in Bitcoin or any other asset. Conclusion: A New Era of Corporate Adoption? The fact that Bitcoin exchange supply has reached a six-year low, largely propelled by the strategic acquisitions of public company Bitcoin holdings, led prominently by MicroStrategy Bitcoin accumulation, underscores a significant moment in Bitcoin’s evolution. The consistent flow of BTC off exchanges into corporate coffers suggests a strong conviction in its long-term value proposition among increasingly sophisticated players. While challenges remain, the growing trend of institutional Bitcoin buying is a powerful validator for the asset class. It signals that Bitcoin is transitioning from the fringes of finance into corporate treasuries, potentially setting the stage for continued adoption and influencing market dynamics for years to come. This isn’t just a temporary blip; it could very well be the early chapters of a new era for Bitcoin.

43768816,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152508,1745542215,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC Delays Grayscale Polkadot ETF Decision: Navigating Regulatory Waters,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-polkadot-etf/,"The journey towards bringing cryptocurrency investments into traditional financial structures continues to be marked by careful regulatory scrutiny. A recent development highlights this cautious approach: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally announced a delay in its decision regarding the proposed spot Polkadot ETF filed by Grayscale Investments. This news, initially reported by @solidintel_x via X, underscores the ongoing regulatory dance surrounding digital asset exchange-traded funds, particularly those focusing on altcoins like Polkadot (DOT). For many investors and enthusiasts watching the space, the prospect of a spot Polkadot ETF represents a significant step towards greater accessibility and institutional adoption for the Polkadot network. However, the latest SEC ETF delay serves as a reminder that the path to regulatory approval for such products is complex and often protracted. Understanding the Significance of a Spot Polkadot ETF Before diving into the implications of the SEC’s delay, it’s crucial to understand what a spot Polkadot ETF is and why it matters. A spot ETF holds the underlying asset directly – in this case, Polkadot’s native cryptocurrency, DOT. This is different from a futures ETF, which holds contracts betting on the future price of an asset. Here’s why a spot DOT ETF is significant: Direct Exposure: Investors gain exposure to the price movements of DOT without needing to buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. Accessibility: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible through standard brokerage accounts, appealing to a broader range of investors, including institutions. Liquidity: ETFs typically offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares easily throughout the trading day. Regulatory Framework: An approved ETF operates within a regulated framework, potentially offering investors more protection compared to direct crypto investments on less-regulated platforms. Grayscale, a major player in the digital asset investment space, has been at the forefront of pushing for spot crypto ETFs in the U.S. Their success in converting their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this year set a significant precedent. Their filing for a Grayscale Polkadot ETF indicates their belief in the potential for other digital assets to gain similar mainstream investment vehicles. Why the SEC ETF Delay? SEC delays on ETF applications are standard practice, especially for novel asset classes like cryptocurrencies. The regulatory body has statutory periods within which it must make a decision (approve, disapprove, or delay). Delays signal that the SEC requires more time to review the filing, potentially to gather more information, consider public comments, or assess market conditions and investor protection concerns. For a DOT ETF approval , the SEC likely examines several key factors: Market Surveillance: Can the exchange listing the ETF demonstrate that the underlying market for Polkadot (where the spot price is determined) is resistant to manipulation? This was a major hurdle for Bitcoin ETFs for years. Liquidity and Size: Is the Polkadot market sufficiently liquid and large enough to support an ETF without concerns about large trades impacting the price unfairly? Custody: How will the underlying DOT be securely held? Custody solutions for digital assets are a critical point of review. Polkadot Network Specifics: The SEC may need to understand the technical and economic aspects of the Polkadot network itself, including its consensus mechanism, governance, and how DOT functions within the ecosystem. Investor Protection: Are there sufficient safeguards in place to protect retail investors? The delay suggests the SEC is undertaking a thorough review of these and other factors specific to Polkadot, building upon the framework established during the Bitcoin and ongoing Ethereum ETF reviews. Comparing Polkadot to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF Paths While the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 was a landmark event, the path for altcoins like Polkadot is not necessarily a direct copy-paste. The SEC’s comfort level and legal interpretations can differ based on the specific characteristics of each digital asset. Bitcoin: Often viewed differently due to its size, longer history, and specific market structure. The correlation with regulated futures markets was a key factor in the SEC’s eventual approval. Ethereum: Currently undergoing its own spot ETF review process. A key question for Ethereum is its classification (commodity vs. security), especially post-Merge with its transition to Proof-of-Stake. Polkadot: As a multi-chain network focused on interoperability, Polkadot presents a different set of technical and potentially regulatory considerations compared to single-chain assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Its nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) mechanism and parachain structure might require specific analysis from the SEC. Therefore, the SEC ETF delay for Grayscale Polkadot is not unexpected and reflects the unique due diligence required for assets beyond the two largest cryptocurrencies. What Does This SEC ETF Delay Mean for Polkadot (DOT)? For holders and potential investors of DOT, an SEC delay can have several implications: Short-Term Price Impact: Regulatory delays often introduce uncertainty, which can sometimes lead to negative short-term price action or stagnation for the underlying asset as market sentiment reacts to the prolonged waiting period. Extended Uncertainty: The delay pushes the decision further into the future, maintaining a period of uncertainty regarding the potential for a spot ETF to open up new avenues for investment demand. Focus on Fundamentals: While ETF news is important, a delay encourages investors to focus back on Polkadot’s core technology, development milestones, and ecosystem growth, which are the long-term drivers of value. Precedent Setting: The outcome of the Grayscale Polkadot application, whenever it comes, will set a precedent for other potential altcoin ETF filings. It’s important to remember that a delay is not a rejection. It simply means the review process is ongoing. The SEC could request further information from Grayscale or the listing exchange. Challenges and Hurdles for Altcoin ETFs While the approval of Bitcoin ETFs was a breakthrough, significant hurdles remain for other cryptocurrencies seeking the same treatment. These challenges contribute to decisions like the SEC ETF delay for Grayscale Polkadot: Market Surveillance Agreements: The SEC requires robust agreements with regulated markets of significant size related to the underlying asset to prevent manipulation. Identifying such markets for altcoins can be more challenging than for Bitcoin. Regulatory Classification: The regulatory status of many altcoins remains ambiguous. Is DOT a commodity like Bitcoin, or could it be viewed as a security? The SEC’s stance on this is critical for ETF approval. Liquidity Fragmentation: Trading for altcoins can be spread across numerous global platforms, potentially making comprehensive market surveillance more difficult. Novelty of Technology: Understanding and assessing the risks associated with the unique technical architectures of different blockchain networks takes time and expertise for regulators. These factors explain why the review process for applications like the Grayscale Polkadot ETF is painstaking. What’s Next After the SEC ETF Delay? Following this delay, the SEC will continue its review. There are typically further statutory deadlines down the line. The SEC can issue further delays, leading up to a final deadline by which they must make a definitive decision to approve or disapprove the application. Market participants will be closely watching for: Further communications from the SEC regarding the Grayscale Polkadot filing. Any requests for public comments or additional information from Grayscale or the proposed listing exchange. Developments in other altcoin ETF applications, particularly for Ethereum, as these can sometimes influence the regulatory approach to other assets. Overall sentiment and developments within the broader Crypto ETF news landscape. While the timeline remains uncertain, the filing itself and the ongoing review process are positive signs of increasing interest in bringing diverse digital assets into traditional investment wrappers. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the SEC ETF delay on the Grayscale Polkadot application, what should investors consider? Stay Informed: Keep track of official announcements from the SEC and Grayscale, as well as reliable Crypto ETF news sources. Avoid speculation based on unverified reports. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Regulatory uncertainty is a significant factor in the crypto market. Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your comfort level regarding potential delays or even disapprovals. Look Beyond the ETF: While a DOT ETF approval could be a catalyst, evaluate Polkadot based on its technology, ecosystem development, adoption, and long-term vision, independent of the ETF outcome. Consider Diversification: Regulatory hurdles highlight the unique risks associated with specific assets and their potential ETF paths. Diversification across different assets and sectors within crypto can help mitigate these risks. The pursuit of a spot Polkadot ETF is part of a larger trend of integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. Delays are part of this complex process. Conclusion: The Waiting Game Continues for Grayscale Polkadot The SEC’s decision to delay its ruling on the Grayscale spot Polkadot ETF application is a standard, albeit sometimes frustrating, step in the regulatory process for novel financial products like crypto ETFs. It signifies that the Commission is taking the necessary time to thoroughly evaluate the proposal, considering factors like market surveillance, investor protection, and the specific characteristics of the Polkadot network and its native DOT token. While the delay pushes back the potential date for a DOT ETF approval , it does not signal a rejection. It simply means the regulatory review is ongoing. For the Polkadot ecosystem and DOT holders, this means the waiting game continues, with market focus likely shifting back to network developments and the broader regulatory environment for altcoins. The outcome of this application, whenever it arrives, will be a significant event for Polkadot and will provide further clarity on the regulatory path for other non-Bitcoin/Ethereum digital assets seeking similar investment products in the United States.

As the world’s first hybrid crypto exchange BinoFi combines the speed and efficiency of CEXs with the security and transparency of DEXs. Officially audited and meeting the highest standards of reliability BinoFi is setting a new standard for crypto exchanges. BinoFi’s presale has already made headlines gathering over $450,000 in early investments and selling over 22 million $BINO tokens . This is a big deal as the platform prepares for its official launch which analysts say could be a turning point in crypto exchange innovation. Hybrid Liquidity Revolutionizes Crypto Trading At the heart of BinoFi is its hybrid liquidity model a revolutionary framework that combines centralized order books with decentralized liquidity pools. This dual layered system bridges the gap between speed and security providing traders with lightning fast order execution found in CEXs and trustless trading supported by DEX mechanisms. This hybrid approach ensures best trades, minimizes slippage and offers robust price discovery making BinoFi equally accessible to institutional and retail traders. By eliminating the trade offs of using standalone CEXs or DEXs BinoFi creates a seamless experience for modern investors and paves the way for a more efficient trading ecosystem. Unmatched Security with Non-Custodial Solutions One of the key features that makes BinoFi stand out is its non-custodial security mechanism using distributed Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets. These wallets give users full control over their assets by fragmenting private keys into multiple encrypted components reducing the risk of unauthorized access or centralized failures. By putting asset control back in the hands of users without compromising convenience BinoFi not only addresses long standing concerns about exchange security but also rebuilds trader trust in crypto platforms. $BINO Token Presale: Limited Time Opportunity $BINO is the native token of BinoFi and offers big incentives for early participants. The presale is a one time chance to invest at an early stage with tokens priced at $0.02. Upon launch $BINO will list at $0.30 giving early investors a huge ROI. For example an investment of $800 at the presale price will get you 40,000 $BINO tokens which will be worth $12,000 at launch. Larger investments like $3,500 will get you 1 75,000 $BINO tokens worth $52,500 when $BINO lists. With exclusive trader perks like up to 50% off trading fees and higher staking rewards this is a great opportunity to participate in the presale. The presale is moving fast and demand is high. With over 22 million tokens sold and limited supply the window to get in early is closing fast. Analysts Predict $1 for BinoFi Confirmed analysts are optimistic about BinoFi’s post launch trajectory. Citing its hybrid model and growing market demand they predict the $BINO token could reach $1 shortly after launch. With that kind of potential and being a CEX and DEX hybrid BinoFi is leading the charge in the next wave of crypto exchange innovation. “BinoFi is the perfect balance of innovation and practicality,” said one market analyst. “With solutions like hybrid liquidity and non-custodial technology it addresses real problems in the crypto space. The high interest during the presale solidifies its appeal, $1 per token is not only possible but likely.” The Future of Crypto Trading BinoFi is redefining the future of crypto trading. Combining speed, transparency and cutting edge security in one platform it offers solutions to market challenges and opportunities for traders worldwide. Investors can visit BinoFi’s Website and get their $BINO tokens before the presale ends.

With its innovative decentralized lending platform and a presale that has already raised over $7 million, MUTM is on track to achieve a projected value of $2.50 by the end of 2025. Current investors are purchasing at $0.025, with the price set to rise to $0.03 once Phase 5 begins. These early backers are positioned to see a potential 140% return on investment before the token hits its expected market listing price of $0.06. Analysts anticipate a 37x surge. As the 2025 bull run approaches, early investors are eyeing MUTM as a potential game-changer in the crypto market.​ The Crypto Future of ADA and DOGE The cryptocurrency world includes ADA and DOGE as major entities with different paths to their positions. ADA maintains its position as a leading candidate for decentralized finance (DeFi) dominance since it combines smart contracts with proof-of-stake system to scale its operations. Although ADA maintains a solid position it does not match Ethereum regarding network usage or user adoption. Dogecoin exceeded being a one-time meme token to develop into a universally known digital currency because of broad public interest and backing from figures in the spotlight such as Elon Musk. Social approval affects Dogecoin’s value more than its practical use even though its wide market popularity continues to grow. The upcoming market transformation will monitor Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as an emerging cryptocurrency because its decentralized lending functions promise to surpass both ADA and DOGE market leaders by 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum in Phase 4 Mutuum Finance currently stands in Phase 4 of its presale, trading its tokens for $0.025. The demand from investors has not weakened, and the project has already amassed over $7 million in investment and attracted over 8,400 participants thus far. With the presale heading into Phase 5, the token value should rise by 20% to $0.03, affording existing investors a strategic advantage. In addition to growing investor interest, Mutuum Finance has introduced a new dashboard feature with live leaderboard that shows the top 50 token holders. Members of the leaderboard will be rewarded with special bonus tokens, giving a gamified aspect to early participation and long-term holding incentives. Mutuum Finance is disrupting the decentralized finance landscape by merging the greatest aspects of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. With the P2C paradigm, users can stake stablecoins like USDT in smart contract-based liquidity pools to gain passive income while driving faster access to capital for borrowers. Or, the P2P paradigm eliminates middlemen and allows lenders and borrowers to conduct direct and private negotiations. This hybrid approach has greater security, efficiency, and decentralization and grants people complete autonomy in money strategies. Risk-averse investors who seek safe returns or high-yielding predators seeking increased autonomy and flexibility will find that Mutuum Finance is an open, inclusive, and accessible DeFi framework. Establishing a Stable and Safe Monetary System Security is built into Mutuum Finance by design. The system offers a fully collateralized Ethereum-backed USD-pegged stablecoin to offer long-term stability and avoid volatility common in algorithmic designs. Regular smart contract audits and offering financial transparency build trust with users and counter common vulnerabilities for DeFi protocols. In this setup, Mutuum Finance offers a sensible and trustworthy option for serious long-term investors. Mutuum Finance has raised over $7 million from 8,400+ investors, with tokens currently priced at $0.025 in Phase 4. A projected surge to $2.50 offers a potential 37x return. Phase 5 will raise the price to $0.03, now is the time to act. Join the Mutuum Finance presale today and secure your share of the DeFi revolution.

While the cryptocurrency market often dances to its own beat, it’s undeniably influenced by major global economic and political events. A recent development involving US China Trade relations has sent ripples of confusion across financial markets, and understanding this situation is key to navigating potential volatility in the Crypto Market News . Trump’s Bold Claim: A US China Trade Meeting Happened? The news broke when U.S. President Donald Trump made a notable statement, asserting that a meeting concerning China US Trade Talks had indeed taken place earlier that day. The specific context or participants of this alleged meeting remained vague, with Trump reportedly stating it “doesn’t matter who ‘they’ is.” This claim was initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on the social media platform X, quickly circulating and catching the attention of market watchers globally. Such a statement from a former U.S. President, especially one known for his direct involvement in trade negotiations, typically carries significant weight and can influence market sentiment regarding future trade relations between the two economic superpowers. Positive developments or even the mere indication of ongoing talks can sometimes be interpreted optimistically by markets hoping for de-escalation or resolution of trade disputes. China’s Swift Denial: No Trade Talks Currently However, the narrative took a sharp turn later the same afternoon. China’s Ministry of Commerce issued a direct and unequivocal denial of Trump’s claim. Their statement was clear: there are currently no trade negotiations happening with the United States. The ministry went further, labeling the reports of such talks as “false.” This conflicting information immediately created a sense of uncertainty. China’s response also reiterated their long-standing position regarding the conditions for resolving trade disputes. The ministry added that any meaningful resolution or the initiation of talks should begin with the U.S. removing the unilateral tariffs it has imposed on Chinese goods. This condition highlights a major sticking point in past and potential future negotiations, indicating that the path to resumed dialogue is not straightforward. The Global Market Impact of Conflicting Reports Conflicting reports from major global powers like the U.S. and China inevitably lead to uncertainty in financial markets. Investors crave clarity, and when official statements contradict each other, it breeds caution and can trigger volatility. The initial report of a meeting might have briefly buoyed hopes for progress, while China’s denial quickly dashed those hopes, potentially leading to negative sentiment. The Global Market Impact of such trade tensions is broad, affecting: Stock Markets: Sectors reliant on international trade or exposed to tariff risks often react strongly. Forex Markets: The value of the USD and CNY can fluctuate based on trade sentiment. Commodities: Prices of raw materials can be affected by demand forecasts tied to trade relations. Investor Confidence: Lingering trade disputes can dampen overall economic optimism and investment. This specific instance, with a direct contradiction, amplifies the uncertainty, making it difficult for markets to price in future trade outcomes. Why Trump China News Matters for Crypto Investors You might be wondering, “Why should Trump China trade news matter to someone focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, or altcoins?” The connection lies in how global macroeconomic factors influence risk assets, which include cryptocurrencies. Here’s how the uncertainty from conflicting China US Trade Talks reports can potentially impact the crypto market: Risk Sentiment: When global trade tensions rise or remain uncertain, it often leads to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment among investors. This means investors tend to move away from assets perceived as higher risk (like stocks or cryptocurrencies) towards safer havens (like government bonds or sometimes the U.S. dollar). Increased trade friction can therefore put downward pressure on crypto prices. U.S. Dollar Strength: Trade disputes can influence the strength of the U.S. dollar. Sometimes, global uncertainty drives demand for the USD as a safe-haven currency. A stronger USD can make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin potentially less attractive or more expensive for international buyers, although this relationship is complex and not always direct. Economic Growth Concerns: Prolonged trade disputes can slow down global economic growth. A weaker global economy might reduce disposable income or institutional investment appetite for speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Capital Flows: Geopolitical tensions can affect the movement of capital across borders, potentially impacting liquidity and investment into crypto markets from different regions. While not a direct, immediate price driver like specific crypto adoption news, the macro environment shaped by U.S.-China relations provides a crucial backdrop that can influence overall market trends and volatility in the Crypto Market News cycle. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the potential for volatility and shifting sentiment driven by events like the conflicting US China Trade reports, what can crypto investors do? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye not just on crypto-specific news but also on major global economic and political developments, particularly those involving the U.S. and China. Understand that these macro events can create headwinds or tailwinds. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand that periods of global uncertainty can increase market volatility. Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your personal risk tolerance. Consider Diversification: While crypto is your focus, understand how it fits into the broader financial landscape. Diversification within crypto (across different assets) and potentially across asset classes can help mitigate risks. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, short-term volatility driven by macro news might present buying opportunities rather than reasons to panic sell. Focus on the fundamental long-term potential of the crypto space. Avoid Leverage in Volatile Times: High leverage can be extremely risky during periods of heightened uncertainty and potential price swings. Understanding the broader economic forces, including complex international relations like Trump China trade dynamics, provides a more complete picture for making informed decisions in the crypto market. Summary: Awaiting Clarity in US China Trade Relations In conclusion, the recent clash between President Trump’s claim of a China US Trade Talks meeting and China’s outright denial highlights the ongoing complexity and lack of clarity in relations between the two economic giants. This uncertainty has a tangible Global Market Impact , fostering caution and potential volatility across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. For those following Crypto Market News , recognizing the influence of these macro-level events is crucial for navigating the market effectively. As long as fundamental disagreements like tariff removals persist, expect trade relations to remain a source of potential market movement.

With momentum indicators flashing bullish signals and a key date highlighted, XRP could soon see a 200% rise from current levels to a new all-time high. A new technical analysis from ‘Cryptarch_,’ a pseudonymous market expert on TradingView, suggests that XRP is on the verge of a major price breakout to $6.5. The analyst marked an ideal entry point at $2.10, paired with a tight stop-loss at $2.00. This strategy reflects strong conviction in XRP’s bullish setup while managing downside risks. XRP Price Sets Sights On $6.5 ATH The TradingView analyst shared an XRP price chart, identifying the formation of a Descending Triangle supported by a break in the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) downtrend. XRP’s RSI has been declining since late 2024, indicating weakening momentum. However, a recent upward cross into bullish territory hints at a possible trend reversal. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Recovery To $3 As Analyst Reveals How High The Price Would Be In Altcoin Season In his price chart, Cryptarch_ outlined a multi-stage move, where XRP is expected to rally upwards while bouncing across multiple resistance zones shown by the horizontal purple lines. The $2.49, $3.00, and $3.39 levels have been marked as the major resistance zones. Following the projected path highlighted by the yellow arrow on the chart, XRP is expected to first break out of the Descending Triangle before making a move toward the critical resistance zone at $3. This level holds significance, as it was the site for a major price pump on March 2, 2025 — a historical move that couldn’t serve as a strong indicator for future price action. Cryptarch_ surmised that the XRP price will likely struggle at the $3 resistance. After that, it is expected to bounce and move higher, possibly retesting current all-time highs. The goal of this bullish setup is to make $3 a strong support level. From there, XRP is projected to surge toward $6.5, with a potential upper price target of $6.82. While a higher surge would bring in better gains, the TradingView analyst suggests exiting the market at $6.5 to lock in profits safely before a major resistance zone is reached. Key Date To Watch Out For A key element in Cryptarch_’s bullish forecast for the XRP price is timing. According to his chart, Saturday, May 10, 2025, stands out as a critical date to watch. Related Reading: Forget XRP At $3, Analyst Reveals How High Price Will Be In A Few Months He marks this day as a potential inflection point, where XRP could either break above the $3 resistance zone with strong momentum or face a temporary rejection, triggering a potential pullback to $1.61. Interestingly, the Bitcoin price action also plays a major role in XRP’s future price outlook. Cryptarch_ disclosed that a breakout above $89,000 in BTC could serve as a catalyst, igniting a rally across altcoins, including XRP. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin has already cleared this critical level and is trading at $91,872 at the time of writing.

Unfortunately, the price is currently down due to a recent rejection. This may trigger a sell if the bulls fail to sustain momentum. Following the early-month breakdown to a new yearly low of $94.2, Sol found support and climbed back above the crucial $100 level lost during the crash in the first week. Volatility increased, and the price surged to around $136 in the second week, halting buying due to a rejection. This rejection triggered a slight pullback, and the price retested $124. Meanwhile, during the surge, the price broke through a falling trendline, acting as resistance for three months. Sol advanced buying and reached a high of $154 yesterday, but lost grip following a bearish interception. Today, the price appears weak following a minor loss in the past hours. While this has brought a little setback in the market, the crypto may lose momentum again if the supply level increases on a daily basis. However, the recent recovery marked a significant retracement phase for the asset since it started to drop in January. Retracing above the $300 level could set the stage for bigger growth in the long term. But from a technical standpoint, the bears are likely to resume pressure shortly. SOL’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The close support for this drop is located at $136.7. A plunge below this level could roll the price to $122.7 and $112. The last defence line for the bulls would be $94.26 if the supply level increases. If Sol continues to increase, there’s an immediate resistance at $161.

43769395,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152517,1745543458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,CZ Fights Back: Blasts Bloomberg Over Crypto Regulation Coverage,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cz-blasts-bloomberg-crypto/,"The world of cryptocurrency is rarely quiet, and recent events involving Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and financial news giant Bloomberg prove just that. CZ, a highly influential figure in the crypto space, is publicly pushing back against Bloomberg’s recent portrayal of his advisory work with governments regarding crypto regulation. This isn’t just a minor disagreement; it highlights ongoing tensions between the crypto industry and traditional media, particularly concerning how key figures and their pasts are covered when they engage in important dialogues like government advisory on crypto. What’s the Core of the CZ vs. Bloomberg Dispute? At the heart of the matter is Bloomberg’s reporting on CZ’s recent meetings and consultations with government officials in various countries. According to CZ, the outlet placed undue and negative emphasis on his past legal issues, specifically his guilty plea related to money laundering charges, when discussing his current efforts to advise governments. While the report did cover his interactions, CZ feels the narrative was unfairly dominated by his history rather than the substance of the advisory work itself. The Bloomberg article reportedly highlighted meetings CZ had with officials in: Malaysia Kyrgyzstan Pakistan CZ’s criticism, as reported by outlets like BeInCrypto, suggests that his comments were taken out of context. This includes remarks he made about his educational initiative, Giggle Academy. For someone now focusing on contributing to the ecosystem through education and advising on frameworks, CZ appears to feel that Bloomberg’s framing undermines these current positive endeavors by constantly anchoring them to his past legal troubles. Why Does Government Advisory on Crypto Matter? As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate it effectively. This is where figures like CZ, with extensive experience running one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges (Binance), can offer unique perspectives. Government advisory roles, whether formal or informal, are crucial because they can: Inform Policy: Industry experts can help policymakers understand the technology, its risks, and its potential benefits. Prevent Unintended Consequences: Well-intentioned regulations can sometimes stifle innovation if they don’t fully grasp the nuances of the technology. Expert input can help avoid this. Promote Adoption and Security: Sensible regulations can build trust and encourage wider adoption while also implementing necessary safeguards against illicit activities. Navigate Global Standards: Crypto is global. Advisors can help governments understand international regulatory trends and best practices. However, bringing in individuals with past legal issues, even if they have valuable expertise, presents a challenge for both the governments seeking advice and the media covering it. This is precisely the tension highlighted in the CZ and Bloomberg situation. Navigating the Challenges of Media Coverage and Past Issues The media plays a vital role in informing the public about important interactions between industry leaders and governments. However, balancing the need to report on current activities with the responsibility to provide context, including an individual’s past, is complex. From Bloomberg’s perspective (based on CZ’s criticism), they may argue that an individual’s recent guilty plea for significant financial compliance failures is highly relevant context when reporting on their current efforts to advise governments on financial regulation. It speaks to credibility, past practices, and potential conflicts of interest or perceived risks. From CZ’s perspective, having acknowledged and resolved his past issues (including serving a sentence), he may feel that continuous, heavy emphasis on this history overshadows his current efforts to contribute positively to the very challenges (like compliance and regulation) that were central to his past legal troubles. He might argue that his experience, including the lessons learned, makes him uniquely qualified to advise on building robust regulatory frameworks. This situation raises questions for readers and the public: How much should a person’s past dictate how their current contributions are perceived? What is the media’s responsibility in providing context without creating a biased narrative? Can individuals with complex histories still play a constructive role in shaping future policy? The dispute between CZ and Bloomberg underscores these difficult questions, demonstrating the friction that can arise when influential figures with controversial pasts engage in sensitive areas like government crypto advisory. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community and Media This event offers several takeaways: For Crypto Leaders: Be prepared for intense scrutiny, especially if you have a public or complex history. Transparency about past issues and clear communication about current goals are paramount. Understand that your past will likely be mentioned in any coverage of your future endeavors, particularly those involving governments or sensitive topics like crypto regulation. For Governments: While seeking expertise is crucial, be mindful of the public perception and potential implications of consulting with individuals who have faced significant legal challenges. Clear communication about the nature and scope of the advisory role is important. For Media Outlets: Strive for balanced reporting. While providing relevant context about an individual’s past is necessary, ensure it doesn’t completely overshadow or unfairly frame their current activities and stated intentions. Seek multiple perspectives and avoid sensationalism. For the Public/Readers: Read critically. Understand that media reports are interpretations. Consider the source, look for potential biases, and try to get information from multiple outlets and directly from the individuals involved if possible. The ongoing dialogue around crypto regulation is vital for the industry’s maturation. The involvement of experienced figures, including those from platforms like Binance , in providing government advisory is a positive step towards creating workable frameworks. However, as the situation with CZ and Bloomberg shows, the path is fraught with challenges related to perception, past actions, and how these interactions are reported. Summary: A Clash Over Narrative in the World of Crypto In conclusion, the public disagreement between Binance founder CZ and Bloomberg highlights more than just a simple media critique. It points to the fundamental challenges of covering complex figures in a rapidly evolving space like cryptocurrency. CZ believes Bloomberg unfairly emphasized his past legal issues, taking comments out of context, while reporting on his current efforts to assist governments with crypto regulation. This clash underscores the difficulty for individuals with past controversies to contribute to important policy discussions and the ongoing tension regarding how traditional media covers the crypto world and its key players.

On Thursday, the Fed announced it would rescind several supervisory letters and statements issued in 2022 and 2023. Previously, banks had to notify regulators in advance about planned crypto-related ventures and await a formal supervisory nod for stablecoin-related transactions. “These actions ensure the board’s expectations remain aligned with evolving risks and further support innovation in the banking system,” the Federal Reserve stated. @federalreserve announces the withdrawal of guidance for banks related to their crypto-asset and dollar token activities and related changes to its expectations for these activities: https://t.co/v1MwuswOlE — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) April 24, 2025 Fed Moves Toward Lighter Regulation for Crypto Initiatives By pulling back these guidelines, the Fed appears to be responding to rapid developments in the crypto market and feedback from financial institutions that viewed the former regulatory framework as restrictive. Banks have increasingly requested clarity and flexibility to keep pace with fast-evolving digital asset technologies. The change means banks no longer need to provide advance notification about their crypto initiatives. Instead, the Federal Reserve plans to incorporate supervision of these activities into regular monitoring processes. This approach mirrors broader moves by other US regulators toward a lighter regulatory touch, potentially fostering increased engagement in crypto assets by traditional banks. Banking Agencies Pull 2023 Crypto Guidance, Eye New Framework Additionally, the Fed is jointly withdrawing two key 2023 statements alongside the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. These statements previously outlined specific regulatory expectations for banks involved in crypto-asset exposures. The Fed said that it will continue collaborating with other regulatory agencies to evaluate whether new guidelines might better facilitate innovation, especially in the rapidly expanding domain of crypto-asset services. In March, the OCC too eased its stance on crypto , allowing national banks and federal savings associations to offer crypto custody services, engage in stablecoin-related activities, and take part in distributed ledger networks.

Inco, a project dedicated to enhancing privacy within the decentralized ecosystem, has just announced a significant milestone: securing $5 million in strategic investment . This substantial Inco funding round signals growing confidence in the need for confidentiality solutions in the burgeoning Web3 space. What is Inco and Why is Blockchain Privacy Crucial? At its core, Inco is building what it calls a “confidentiality layer” for the blockchain stack. But what does that mean, and why is it so important? Public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are celebrated for their transparency. Every transaction, every smart contract interaction, is typically visible to anyone on the network. While this transparency fosters trust and auditability, it also presents significant challenges: Lack of User Privacy: Financial activities, personal data linked to addresses, and even business strategies can be exposed. Limited Enterprise Adoption: Businesses are hesitant to move sensitive operations onto a fully transparent ledger. New Use Case Inhibition: Certain applications requiring data privacy (like confidential DeFi, private voting, or supply chains with sensitive data) are difficult or impossible to build securely. This is where blockchain privacy solutions come into play. They aim to offer users and applications the ability to interact on the blockchain while keeping sensitive information confidential, only revealing it to authorized parties. The Power Players Behind the Crypto Investment The $5 million strategic investment round is particularly noteworthy due to the caliber of the participants. The round was led by the prestigious a16z Crypto Startup Accelerator (CSX) . Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto arm is a major force in the industry, known for backing foundational and innovative projects. But the list of investors doesn’t stop there. Inco also received backing from other prominent names: Coinbase Ventures 1kx Orange DAO South Park Commons Script Capital The involvement of such respected venture capital firms and industry players underscores the perceived importance and potential of Inco’s mission. Their investment is not just financial; it brings valuable expertise, network effects, and credibility to the project. How Will This a16z Crypto Funding Be Used? According to the announcement, the primary use of the a16z crypto funding and other investments will be to “promote solutions related to blockchain confidentiality.” This likely translates into several key areas: Research and Development: Advancing the core technology behind Inco’s confidentiality layer. Talent Acquisition: Hiring more engineers, researchers, and privacy experts. Ecosystem Growth: Building tools, documentation, and developer support to encourage adoption. Audits and Security: Ensuring the robustness and security of the privacy solutions, which is paramount in this space. This investment is expected to significantly accelerate Inco’s development roadmap and its efforts to bring practical, secure confidentiality solutions to the broader blockchain community. Exploring Confidential Computing Crypto Solutions Inco’s approach likely involves leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques or confidential computing crypto methods. Confidential computing allows data to be processed in a secure, isolated environment (often called a Trusted Execution Environment or TEE), even while the data is being computed upon. This means that sensitive data remains encrypted or protected throughout its lifecycle, including during processing, not just in transit or at rest. Integrating confidential computing with blockchain technology is complex but offers a powerful path towards achieving privacy without sacrificing the benefits of decentralization and verifiable computation. Inco’s focus on building a dedicated layer suggests they are aiming for a solution that can potentially be integrated across different blockchain networks or provide a foundational layer for privacy-preserving dApps. Benefits Inco Aims to Deliver: Enhanced User Control: Users gain more control over who can see their data and transactions. New Application Possibilities: Enabling use cases previously impossible on public blockchains due to privacy concerns. Regulatory Friendliness: Potentially helping projects comply with data privacy regulations like GDPR. Increased Enterprise Interest: Making blockchain technology more palatable for businesses handling sensitive information. Potential Challenges Ahead: Technical Complexity: Implementing secure and performant confidential computing on a decentralized network is challenging. Performance Overheads: Privacy-preserving computations can sometimes be slower or more resource-intensive. Auditability vs. Confidentiality: Finding the right balance between necessary privacy and the need for auditability in certain contexts. Adoption and Education: Developers and users need to understand and trust the new privacy layers. Actionable Insight: Why Pay Attention? For anyone involved in the crypto space – whether you’re a developer, investor, or user – Inco’s funding and mission are worth watching. The push for blockchain privacy is a critical evolutionary step for the technology. As the ecosystem matures, the demand for solutions that balance transparency with necessary confidentiality will only grow. Projects like Inco are at the forefront of addressing this fundamental challenge. This crypto investment by leading firms validates the importance of this area and suggests that privacy solutions could be a significant growth sector in the coming years. Keeping an eye on Inco’s progress could provide valuable insights into the future direction of Web3 development. Summary: A Confidential Future for Blockchain? Inco’s successful Inco funding round, backed by major players like a16z Crypto, Coinbase Ventures, and others, marks a significant step forward for the development of blockchain privacy . By focusing on a dedicated confidentiality layer, Inco aims to unlock new possibilities and address key limitations of current public blockchains. The $5 million crypto investment will fuel their efforts in building robust confidential computing crypto solutions. While challenges remain, the strong backing highlights the industry’s recognition of the vital need for privacy in building a truly comprehensive and widely adopted decentralized future.

43769912,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152520,1745544650,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin ETF: Michael Saylor Predicts BlackRock IBIT’s Phenomenal Rise to Become World’s Largest ETF,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/saylor-predicts-ibit-largest/,"Get ready for a bold prediction that’s making waves in the financial world! Michael Saylor, the well-known founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and a staunch advocate for Bitcoin, recently shared his thoughts on the future of spot Bitcoin ETF products, specifically eyeing BlackRock’s offering. Attending the ‘Bitcoin Standard Corporations Investor Day’ event in New York, Saylor didn’t mince words. According to Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, reporting via X, Saylor made a significant forecast: he believes BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, known by its ticker IBIT, is poised to become the single largest ETF in the world within the next decade. That’s a massive claim, considering the titans of the ETF universe currently track broad market indices like the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq. Why Michael Saylor is Bullish on BlackRock IBIT Michael Saylor’s conviction stems from his long-held belief in Bitcoin as a superior store of value and a rapidly maturing asset class. His company, MicroStrategy, has famously accumulated a substantial amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet, demonstrating his deep commitment. Saylor sees the advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly one from a global financial giant like BlackRock, as a pivotal moment for Institutional Adoption. He likely reasons that the structure of an ETF removes many barriers that previously prevented large institutions and traditional investors from gaining exposure to Bitcoin. Think about it: Ease of Access: Buying an ETF share is as simple as buying a stock, fitting seamlessly into existing brokerage accounts and investment frameworks. Regulatory Clarity: While the underlying asset is volatile, the ETF structure itself is regulated, providing a level of comfort for compliance-conscious institutions. Custody Solutions: The ETF provider handles the complex and often daunting task of securely storing the underlying Bitcoin. Saylor views BlackRock’s significant market presence and trust among investors as key factors that will accelerate the flow of capital into IBIT, eventually propelling it to the top spot among all ETFs globally. BlackRock IBIT’s Performance in the Bitcoin ETF Race Since their launch in January 2024, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have seen remarkable activity. BlackRock’s IBIT has been a standout performer, consistently attracting significant inflows of capital. While several issuers entered the market simultaneously, IBIT quickly distinguished itself, often leading in daily inflows and rapidly accumulating assets under management (AUM). Comparing IBIT to its peers: ETF Ticker Issuer Focus Key Trajectory IBIT BlackRock Spot Bitcoin Strong inflows, rapid AUM growth FBTC Fidelity Spot Bitcoin Also significant inflows, strong competitor ARKB Ark Invest / 21Shares Spot Bitcoin Consistent inflows, notable player GBTC Grayscale Spot Bitcoin (Conversion) Experienced outflows post-conversion The rapid accumulation of Bitcoin by IBIT and other new ETFs underscores the pent-up demand from investors who previously lacked an accessible, regulated pathway to invest in Bitcoin. BlackRock’s reputation and extensive distribution network are undoubtedly playing a crucial role in IBIT’s early success, lending weight to Saylor’s prediction about its future dominance. Can BlackRock IBIT Really Become the Largest ETF? This is the billion-dollar question (or perhaps, trillion-dollar question). To understand the magnitude of Saylor’s prediction, let’s look at the current landscape of the Largest ETFs by AUM globally. The top spots are typically held by funds tracking major stock indices: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY): Often cited as the largest, tracking the S&P 500 index. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI): Tracks the entire U.S. stock market. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO): Another major S&P 500 tracker. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ): Tracks the Nasdaq-100 index. These ETFs manage hundreds of billions, and in some cases, well over a trillion dollars in assets. For IBIT to surpass them, it would require a truly colossal amount of capital flowing into the fund, implying a significant increase in Bitcoin’s price and/or massive reallocation of global investment portfolios towards Bitcoin via this specific vehicle. Saylor’s 10-year timeframe suggests he anticipates a combination of sustained, substantial inflows into IBIT and a significant appreciation in the price of Bitcoin itself. If Bitcoin’s market capitalization grows dramatically over the next decade, and a large percentage of that market cap is held within accessible, regulated products like IBIT, then surpassing traditional market ETFs becomes theoretically possible, albeit an ambitious target. The Role of Institutional Adoption in Driving IBIT’s Growth The core thesis behind Saylor’s prediction heavily relies on continued and accelerating Institutional Adoption. While retail investors were the early adopters of Bitcoin, it’s the influx of institutional capital that has the potential to move markets on a much larger scale. Pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, asset managers, and corporate treasuries represent trillions of dollars in potential investment capital. Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide these large players with a familiar, regulated wrapper to gain exposure. Instead of navigating the complexities of crypto exchanges, cold storage, and private keys, they can simply buy shares of IBIT through their existing infrastructure. This ease of access is crucial for overcoming the inertia and compliance hurdles often faced by large institutions. If even a small percentage of global institutional portfolios allocates to Bitcoin through IBIT, the fund’s AUM could grow exponentially. Saylor is essentially betting on a future where Bitcoin becomes a standard allocation in diversified portfolios, similar to how gold or emerging market equities are considered today, with IBIT being a primary vehicle for that allocation. Potential Challenges on the Path to Becoming the Largest ETF While the potential is clear, the path to IBIT becoming the Largest ETF isn’t without its hurdles. Several factors could impact its trajectory: Bitcoin Price Volatility: ETFs track the underlying asset. If Bitcoin experiences significant downturns, IBIT’s AUM would decrease regardless of inflows. Regulatory Landscape: While U.S. spot ETFs are approved, the global regulatory environment for crypto is still evolving. Future regulations could impact investor sentiment or access. Competition: IBIT is not the only spot Bitcoin ETF. While it has a strong start, competition from Fidelity, Ark Invest, and potentially new entrants could fragment the market. Investor Sentiment: Geopolitical events, macroeconomic shifts, or negative news related to the broader crypto market could dampen investor enthusiasm. Operational Risks: While BlackRock is a seasoned player, managing a novel asset class like Bitcoin at such scale presents unique operational challenges. Saylor’s prediction is a long-term one (10 years), which allows time for market cycles and maturation, but also introduces more variables and potential disruptions. What Does This Prediction Mean for Investors? For individual investors, Michael Saylor’s prediction serves as a strong indicator of the bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin and its increasing integration into traditional finance. It highlights the potential scale of Institutional Adoption facilitated by products like the BlackRock IBIT. It’s not actionable financial advice to buy IBIT based solely on this prediction, but it is a data point suggesting that major players foresee significant growth in Bitcoin’s market capitalization and its accessibility through regulated products. Investors interested in this space should: Research IBIT and other Bitcoin ETFs: Understand their structure, fees, and how they track Bitcoin’s price. Consider their own risk tolerance: Bitcoin and crypto markets are highly volatile. Look beyond the prediction: Analyze market trends, global economic factors, and regulatory developments. Saylor’s forecast is a vision of a future where Bitcoin, accessed via mainstream financial products like IBIT, plays a central role in global investment portfolios. Conclusion: A Bold Vision for Bitcoin’s Future Michael Saylor’s prediction that BlackRock’s IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF will become the world’s Largest ETF within a decade is undoubtedly audacious. It speaks volumes about his unwavering confidence in Bitcoin and his belief that the floodgates of Institutional Adoption have been opened by the approval of products like BlackRock IBIT. While achieving this milestone would require unprecedented growth and shift in global asset allocation, Saylor’s perspective offers a compelling long-term outlook for Bitcoin’s integration into the traditional financial system. The journey of IBIT will be a key indicator to watch, demonstrating how quickly and extensively institutional capital embraces the digital asset revolution.

Versan Aljarrah, who brands himself as the “Black Swan Capitalist,” is known for his deep dives into Ripple and its cryptocurrency, XRP. For years, he has maintained a controversial theory: the future price of XRP is already predetermined. Ripple Gains Ground in Global Finance Ripple’s increasing presence in international finance has become hard to ignore. Major financial institutions have embraced its technology, with the biggest recommendations coming from the United Nations , which sees the blockchain’s value in the drive towards a global cashless and instant payments network. Additionally, Ripple’s legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which withdrew its lawsuit after failing to penalize the company for breaching federal securities laws, has meant that bullish projections like Aljarrah’s are gaining ground. So Why Isn’t XRP Surging? Ripple currently operates under what many see as the most crypto-friendly U.S. administration to date. The SEC has even signaled a shift toward regulation that supports innovation. Given these factors and Ripple’s solid business model, many wonder why XRP’s market price hasn’t skyrocketed. Aljarrah suggests the answer lies behind closed doors. According to him, major financial institutions have already agreed on XRP’s long-term value — and did so before most retail investors even took notice. He likens it to pre-IPO negotiations, where big players settle on a stock price long before it hits the market. https://x.com/VersanAljarrah/article/1906040595166187702 Aljarrah’s analysis draws a distinction between XRP’s visible market price and what he claims is an internal valuation by institutional investors. He believes this “hidden” price could range from three to four digits, far above what the market currently reflects. He argues that this gap will only close once the broader market fully realizes Ripple’s value to the financial system. Could XRP’s Price Really Hit $4,800? A viral headline recently teased the idea of XRP soaring to $4,800 and overtaking Ethereum — a claim skeptics have labeled as wildly unrealistic. Such a valuation would dwarf even Bitcoin’s current price levels. Still, Ripple itself may have added credibility to the speculation. CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that a public IPO is on the table , with rumors swirling about a potential listing by year’s end. Should Ripple go public, it could thrust both the company and XRP into a global spotlight — and possibly trigger the explosive price movement Aljarrah envisions. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND) — An AI-Based Meme Coin that May Confirm Aljarrah’s XRP Theory One Day Exciting they may be, but realistically it’s hard for the retail market to confirm the accuracy of Aljarrah’s claims. However, a smart new meme coin called MIND of Pepe ($MIND) may soon be offering retail investors expert analysis. $MIND isn’t your typical meme coin – it fuses AI technology with crypto culture to create a bold, forward-looking project at the intersection of memes and innovation.

The investment firm’s base case pegs Bitcoin at $710,000, while its bear case still forecasts a sizeable increase to $300,000. The investment firm attributes its projections to multiple accelerating trends, including rising institutional allocation, adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value, demand from emerging markets, and the growth of on-chain financial services. The report also points to a growing appetite among nation-states and corporations to add Bitcoin to their reserves. We’ve published our bitcoin price forecast through 2030. Read our research from @dpuellARK and share your thoughts. https://t.co/CH7y5EyUjY — ARK Invest (@ARKInvest) April 24, 2025 Bitcoin Could Capture 60% of Gold’s Market Cap by 2030: Ark At the time of the report’s release, Bitcoin traded around $93,958, having recently recovered from a period of market volatility. ARK’s most optimistic scenario implies a nearly 15-fold increase from current levels, driven by what it sees as a structural transformation in global finance. The firm expects institutional investors to allocate up to 6.5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin in the most bullish scenario, with 2.5% as the base case. It also believes Bitcoin could eventually command 60% of gold’s current market value, reinforcing its digital gold thesis. Image Source: Ark Invest Bitcoin Could Hit $2.4M With Emerging Market and Treasury Adoption: ARK Emerging markets are another key focus. ARK estimates that Bitcoin could capture up to 6% of the monetary base in such economies, where inflation and currency instability continue to erode trust in traditional financial systems. It also sees meaningful upside from increased use by corporations and governments, which could allocate up to 10% and 7% of their reserves, respectively. The report further points to the expansion of Bitcoin’s utility beyond storage, particularly through Layer 2 networks, restaking protocols and tokenized assets. These developments are expected to contribute to a 60% annual growth rate in on-chain financial services. While ARK’s official bull case targets $1.5m per Bitcoin by 2030, the firm also introduces a refined model that adjusts for dormant or lost supply. Under this adjusted supply scenario, the bull case price could climb as high as $2.4m, reflecting Bitcoin’s extreme scarcity and accelerating institutional demand. The report stops short of calling Bitcoin a guaranteed winner but positions it as a leading asset in a maturing digital monetary system that continues to gain mainstream traction.

43770201,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152528,1745545246,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Stablecoin Market Set for Massive Growth: Citi Report Projects $3.7 Trillion by 2030,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecoin-market-massive-growth/,"Imagine a world where digital currencies are not just volatile assets for speculation, but stable, reliable forms of money used for everyday transactions, cross-border payments, and powering the future of finance. According to a groundbreaking report from the Citi Institute, this future is closer than you think, with the stablecoin market poised for potentially massive growth. What is Driving Stablecoin Market Growth? The recent Citi stablecoin report paints a picture of a digital financial landscape rapidly evolving. At the heart of this evolution are stablecoins – cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility, typically by pegging their value to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar, a commodity, or a basket of assets. But why are they gaining such traction? Several factors contribute to the burgeoning stablecoin market : Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto: Stablecoins act as a crucial on-ramp and off-ramp between the volatile crypto world and the traditional financial system. Global Payments & Remittances: They offer a potentially faster, cheaper, and more efficient way to send money across borders compared to traditional methods. DeFi (Decentralized Finance): Stablecoins are the backbone of many DeFi protocols, providing stability within lending, borrowing, and trading platforms. Hedging Volatility: Traders use stablecoins to protect gains or park funds during periods of high market volatility without leaving the crypto ecosystem entirely. Institutional Interest: As regulatory clarity improves and infrastructure develops, more financial institutions are exploring stablecoin use cases. Key Findings from the Citi Stablecoin Report The Citi Institute’s Blockchain & Digital Dollar report offers a compelling outlook. The most striking projection is the potential scale of the stablecoin market , estimating it could grow to anywhere between a substantial $0.5 trillion and a staggering $3.7 trillion by the year 2030. To put that into perspective, the current market cap is significantly less, highlighting the immense growth potential seen by financial giants like Citi. Here are some core takeaways from the report, as highlighted by Wu Blockchain: Massive Market Expansion: The headline figure of up to $3.7 trillion indicates confidence in the widespread adoption of stablecoins. USD Dominance: A significant portion – around 90% – of this projected market is expected to be denominated in U.S. dollars. This underscores the dollar’s continued importance in the global digital economy. Stablecoin Issuers as Treasury Holders: With trillions of dollars backing stablecoins, issuers are expected to become major holders of U.S. Treasuries. This has potential implications for the traditional bond market and monetary policy. Public Sector Interest in Blockchain: Beyond stablecoins, the report notes rising interest from governments and public bodies in leveraging blockchain technology . The Role of Blockchain Technology in This Evolution The growth of the stablecoin market is inextricably linked to advancements in blockchain technology . Blockchains provide the underlying infrastructure for issuing, managing, and transferring stablecoins securely and transparently. The report’s mention of public sector interest in blockchain further emphasizes its potential beyond just cryptocurrencies. Governments are exploring blockchain for various use cases to enhance transparency and efficiency, including: Government Spending: Tracking how public funds are allocated and spent. Subsidies and Aid Distribution: Ensuring aid reaches intended recipients directly and transparently. Record Management: Creating immutable and verifiable records for land registries, identity management, and more. This broader adoption of blockchain technology by the public sector could further legitimize and accelerate the adoption of digital assets like stablecoins. Implications for Digital Finance and Beyond A multi-trillion dollar stablecoin market has profound implications for the future of digital finance . It suggests a world where digital assets play a central role not just in investment portfolios, but in everyday commerce and global financial flows. This growth trajectory indicates a potential convergence between traditional financial systems and the burgeoning digital asset space. The increased holding of U.S. Treasuries by stablecoin issuers could also impact liquidity and demand in the traditional bond market. Furthermore, the rise of dollar-denominated stablecoins reinforces the U.S. dollar’s position in the digital era, potentially competing with or complementing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Understanding the Broader Crypto Market Growth While stablecoins are designed for stability, their projected growth is a significant indicator of overall crypto market growth and maturation. The demand for stable, digital assets reflects increasing utility and integration into the wider economy. It suggests that the crypto ecosystem is moving beyond purely speculative trading towards practical applications in payments, finance, and governance. The infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and user adoption needed to support a multi-trillion dollar stablecoin market will inevitably contribute to the broader development and acceptance of the entire crypto landscape. This forecast from a major financial institution like Citi provides a strong signal about the perceived long-term viability and expansion of the digital asset space. Challenges and the Road Ahead Despite the optimistic outlook, the path to a $3.7 trillion stablecoin market is not without hurdles. Key challenges include: Regulation: Regulatory uncertainty remains a major challenge globally. Clear and consistent rules around stablecoin reserves, issuance, and use are crucial for mass adoption. Reserve Transparency and Auditing: Ensuring that stablecoins are truly backed 1:1 by reserves and that these reserves are transparently audited is paramount for trust. Competition: The stablecoin landscape is competitive, with existing players and potential new entrants, including banks and tech companies. Technological Risks: Smart contract vulnerabilities and platform stability are ongoing concerns. Adoption Barriers: Educating the public and businesses, and building user-friendly interfaces are necessary for widespread use. Actionable Insights for Readers What does this mean for you? Whether you’re an investor, a business owner, or just curious about the future of money, here are some takeaways: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on regulatory developments surrounding stablecoins in your region. Understand the Use Cases: Explore how stablecoins are being used in DeFi, payments, and trading. Evaluate Risks: Understand the risks associated with different types of stablecoins and issuers.

43770454,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152529,1745545843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial US South Korea Trade Negotiations Progress Well: What’s the Economic Impact?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-south-korea-trade-talks/,"Global economic events, including international trade discussions, often send ripples through financial markets. While the connection might not always be direct, progress or setbacks in major trade relationships can influence investor sentiment worldwide. A recent development in this space involves the ongoing discussions between the United States and South Korea regarding trade tariffs. Understanding the US South Korea Trade Relationship The relationship between the United States and South Korea is multifaceted, encompassing security, political, and significant economic ties. Trade is a cornerstone of this relationship, governed largely by the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). However, specific sectors and trade imbalances have often led to discussions and, at times, disagreements regarding tariffs and trade practices. Historically, areas of contention have included: Automobiles: Concerns over market access and safety standards. Steel and Aluminum: The U.S. has previously imposed tariffs on imports from various countries, including South Korea. Agriculture: Specific market access issues for certain products. Trade Deficit/Surplus: The overall balance of trade between the two nations. These issues form the backdrop for ongoing Trade Negotiations aimed at resolving disputes and potentially updating existing agreements. Trump Tariffs and Negotiation Progress Former U.S. President Donald Trump frequently used tariffs as a tool in trade negotiations, seeking to address what he perceived as unfair trade practices and imbalances. His administration initiated reviews and discussions with several trading partners, including South Korea. Recently, at a press conference following a meeting with the Norwegian Prime Minister, President Trump commented on the state of these specific discussions. He indicated that a meeting held with a South Korean delegation had progressed positively and “faster than expected.” This suggests a potential breakthrough or at least a significant step forward in resolving some of the outstanding trade issues between the two countries. The President also mentioned the possibility of more detailed negotiations occurring as early as the following week, signaling an acceleration in the diplomatic and economic talks. What is the Economic Impact of Positive Trade News? Positive developments in significant trade relationships like the one between the U.S. and South Korea can have several potential Economic Impact s: Reduced Uncertainty: Clarity on trade rules and tariffs reduces uncertainty for businesses operating in both countries, encouraging investment and long-term planning. Boost to Specific Industries: Resolution of tariff disputes can directly benefit industries that faced barriers or increased costs. Improved Market Sentiment: Positive news on the global trade front often contributes to a more optimistic outlook in traditional financial markets (stocks, bonds). Enhanced Diplomatic Relations: Successful trade talks can strengthen overall political and strategic alliances. Conversely, stalled or failed negotiations, or the imposition of new tariffs, can create uncertainty, disrupt supply chains, and negatively impact economic growth and market confidence. How Does This Influence the Crypto Market Impact? The connection between specific bilateral trade negotiations and the Crypto Market Impact is often indirect but noteworthy. Cryptocurrency markets, while sometimes driven by unique factors, are increasingly influenced by broader macroeconomic trends and global market sentiment. Here’s how progress in US South Korea Trade talks could potentially matter to crypto investors: Market Sentiment: Positive news from major economies can contribute to a general ‘risk-on’ sentiment across global markets. When traditional markets react positively to reduced geopolitical or economic uncertainty, this sentiment can sometimes spill over into the crypto space, which is often considered a risk asset. Economic Stability: Successful trade agreements foster economic stability between trading partners. Greater global economic stability can lead to increased liquidity and investment flows, some of which may eventually find their way into digital assets. Comparison to Trade Wars: Recall periods of heightened trade tensions (e.g., US-China trade war). These events often increased market volatility and uncertainty, sometimes leading to sell-offs in traditional markets, which crypto often followed. Progress, like that seen in the Trade Negotiations with South Korea, represents the opposite – a move towards de-escalation and stability. Currency Implications (Less Direct): While not a direct consequence of *this* specific tariff talk, broader shifts in trade balances and economic health can eventually influence currency strength and monetary policy, factors that are sometimes argued to have long-term implications for the value proposition of decentralized assets like Bitcoin. It’s crucial to understand that this specific news item is unlikely to cause immediate, drastic price movements in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies. However, it’s one piece of the larger global economic puzzle that collectively influences the environment in which the crypto market operates. Keeping Perspective: Benefits, Challenges, and Actionable Insights While the reported progress is positive, it’s essential to maintain perspective. Benefits of Progress: Reduces a source of potential friction between two key U.S. allies. Provides more predictable conditions for businesses involved in US South Korea Trade . Contributes positively to the overall global economic outlook, which can indirectly support market confidence, including in crypto. Potential Challenges Remain: Details matter: The specific terms of any agreement are crucial and can still face hurdles. Other global risks persist: This progress doesn’t eliminate other economic or geopolitical uncertainties affecting markets. Indirect link to crypto: The primary impact is on traditional trade and economies; the crypto link is secondary. Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders: Stay Informed: Pay attention to major global economic and geopolitical news, as these can influence overall market sentiment. Diversify: Don’t rely solely on one type of news for investment decisions. Understand the Indirect Links: Recognize that events like trade talks impact crypto mainly through broader market sentiment and economic stability, not usually as direct drivers. A Step Towards Stability? President Trump’s comments indicating faster-than-expected progress in Trump Tariffs negotiations with South Korea offer a positive signal amidst a complex global economic landscape. While the specifics of the talks remain under wraps, the indication of forward momentum is generally viewed favorably by those hoping for reduced trade friction. For those watching the crypto markets, this news serves as a reminder of how interconnected global finance has become. Progress in traditional trade relationships, contributing to overall economic stability and positive market sentiment, can create a more favorable backdrop for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, even if the direct line is not always obvious. As detailed negotiations potentially resume next week, market participants in both traditional finance and the digital asset space will be watching for further updates, hoping that continued progress leads to mutually beneficial outcomes and contributes to a more stable global economic environment.

FARTCOIN , a Solana-based humor and community-focused meme coin , has been the talk of crypto in wake of a stunning rally of more than 5x in the past few weeks since the early March lows. The meme coin remains in a strong uptrend and, while a near-term drop back to major moving averages in the $0.83 and $0.57 areas is possible, momentum is strong right now.

Fartcoin was that the low? pic.twitter.com/bJFGt27V4z — Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) April 24, 2025 Fartcoin’s impressive rally comes at a time when the broader crypto market has been enjoying a strong recovery as trade war concerns fade somewhat. Messaging from the White House on tariff plans has been mixed and confusing in recent days. But markets are getting the sense that the White House is “caving” in to pressure to not be so reckless with tariffs and the e conomy. That has been boosting risk appetite, with traders subsequently pouring back into risky altcoins , including meme coins like Fartcoin. Smart Money Selling Fartcoin However, crypto traders tempted to dive into Fartcoin right now risk being exit liquidity for smart money. That’s according to unchain analytics firm Stalkchain, who noted FARTCOIN was the crypto asset most sold by smart money over the past 24 hours in an X post. #FARTCOIN is the most sold token by smart money in the last 24 hours pic.twitter.com/pcX8cyRgOr — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 24, 2025 Smart money wallets tracked by the likes of Stalkchain are renowned for buying crypto assets around their price bottom and selling around their price tops. Crypto traders should take this as a warning that a near-term FARTCOIN price peak could have been reached already, or could be close. Traders should note – unless macro conditions continue to improve in the days and weeks ahead, the recent crypto rally could easily run out of fume. Could trade war concerns continue to abate? Yes, and that could be a catalyst for more upside. But risks to the US economy are otherwise to the downside in the coming months, and amid concerns about sticky inflation, the chances of massive Fed easing anytime soon remains remote . Crypto traders would do well not to get too overzealous chasing FARTCOIN, or any other crypto (apart from Bitcoin) higher right now. Stack on the Dip? Things can get a lot worse before they get better for crypto markets. But when “meme season” does eventually return, FARTCOIN is likely to be very much at the forefront of meme coin outperformers. The meme coin’s irreverent fart-themed branding and community-driven engagement resonate deeply with internet culture, driving viral adoption. Its $1.13 billion market cap, per CoinMarketCap , and robust trading volume signal strong investor interest. Built on Solana’s high-speed blockchain, FARTCOIN ensures low-cost transactions, enhancing accessibility. With a loyal community amplifying its meme-driven narrative, FARTCOIN is well-positioned to capitalize on speculative fervor, potentially delivering outsized returns when market optimism does eventually come surging back.

The city outranked runners-up Hong Kong and Switzerland’s economic powerhouse Züric, which scored the same in the Crypto-Friendly Cities Index, found in its 2025 Crypto Report. The index featured 20 cities and ranked their crypto-friendliness based on their regulations, tax environment , lifestyle factors and digital and crypto infrastructure. Multipolitan said its evaluation included weighing areas such as a city’s licensing frameworks, capital gains tax rates, GDP per capita, housing affordability and internet speeds. “The presence of crypto ATMs and retail adoption rates were analysed to reflect each city’s embedded cryptocurrency culture,” it explained. “High concentrations of these assets earned the top scores.” The city-state of Singapore and the United Arab Emirates’ capital of Abu Dhabi were respectively ranked fourth and fifth after the second-place tie. Both cities were already attractive to businesses due to offering low or no taxes, but they’ve also worked to attract crypto companies with industry-specific licensing and regulatory regimes. Sydney, Australia’s most populous city, ranked in the middle of the pack in 10th spot, with the report noting it was home to the most crypto ATMs of the group. Source: Multipolitan Madison, the capital city of the US state of Wisconsin, was the only city in the Americas to rank on the index, hitting the same 11th place score as Latvia’s capital of Riga, Qatar’s capital of Doha, and Saudi Arabia’s capital of Riyadh. Slovenia’s crypto embrace Slovenia also topped Multipolitan’s Crypto Wealth Concentration Index, combining crypto ownership rates and trading volumes, which reported that the average Slovenian crypto owner held around $240,500 worth of assets. The figure outranked second-place Cyprus by over $65,000, with the average crypto-holding Cypriot hanging onto around $175,000. Hong Kong came in third with holdings averaging $97,500.

Bitcoin and XRP remain front and center—not just because of their past performance, but because of the long-term roles they play in a maturing digital asset landscape. Bitcoin , regarded globally as the digital reserve asset, is increasingly being treated as a macro investment rather than a speculative play. Meanwhile, XRP , fresh off regulatory clarity, is being reconsidered for its strong foundation in cross-border settlement infrastructure. But while these leaders dominate the headlines, the quieter part of the market is beginning to reveal its next potential wave. Enter MAGACOINFINANCE —an emerging asset that’s quietly building credibility and attention in the background. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Drawing Strategic Eyes With Real Progress, Not Hype Unlike many new tokens that aim for visibility through volume alone, MAGACOINFINANCE has taken a more refined approach—earning attention through thoughtful execution and growing traction. The project’s early development has been marked by transparency, consistency, and a focus on utility. Wallet activity is on the rise, community participation is increasing, and most importantly, analysts are beginning to take it seriously as a legitimate early-stage opportunity. This is the kind of momentum that doesn’t burn fast and fade—it builds. And for investors looking for what comes after the blue chips, MAGACOINFINANCE may be exactly that. Other Core Market Movers: Cardano, Ethereum, Chainlink, and Sui Cardano has maintained its appeal among long-term investors thanks to its deliberate and scientifically grounded development process. While slower than some competitors, its upgrades are strategic and highly stable. Ethereum continues to be the backbone of the on-chain economy. With its dominance in smart contract execution and growing institutional experimentation, it remains indispensable. Chainlink is vital to blockchain infrastructure. Its data feeds power a large portion of the smart contract landscape, and its importance continues to grow as Web3 applications become more complex. Sui is an emerging name in scalability and developer experience. Designed for fast, low-latency performance, it’s gaining popularity among builders looking to support real-time applications. While all of these tokens serve specific market needs, MAGACOINFINANCE is carving a unique path by positioning itself as a serious contender from day one. Final Thoughts Bitcoin and XRP will continue to anchor institutional and long-term investor strategies. Their roles in the digital economy are well established. But the next breakout token will likely come from the edges—not the center. Right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging from those edges—with all the right signals pointing to something bigger on the horizon.

Recent comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have once again brought the potential for a resolution into focus. For those monitoring market trends, understanding these high-level discussions is crucial, as they can impact investor sentiment and overall market stability. Let’s delve into what Trump had to say about the prospect of a Trump Russia Ukraine peace agreement. Is a Russia Ukraine Peace Deal Really Close? Speaking after a meeting with the Norwegian Prime Minister, Donald Trump offered his perspective on the state of negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv. According to Trump, he believes that Russia and Ukraine are approaching a significant juncture, potentially nearing an agreement to bring the protracted conflict to a close. This statement, coming from a former U.S. leader with a history of engaging with both nations, immediately captured global attention. While the specifics of any potential deal remain unclear, Trump’s remarks suggest ongoing diplomatic efforts behind the scenes. The idea of an end war Ukraine scenario is, of course, the fervent hope of millions affected by the conflict and observers worldwide. However, achieving such a resolution involves navigating complex issues and entrenched positions. What are the Major Hurdles to Ending the War in Ukraine? Ending a conflict of this scale is fraught with challenges. While the desire for peace exists, the path to get there is anything but simple. Several key obstacles stand in the way of a lasting agreement: Territorial Control: Disputed territories, particularly in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, remain a major sticking point. Security Guarantees: Ukraine seeks robust security assurances to prevent future aggression. Accountability: Issues of war crimes and accountability for actions during the conflict need to be addressed. International Sanctions: The web of international sanctions against Russia complicates any potential normalization of relations. Trump specifically highlighted one of these major hurdles in his comments. The Challenge of Crimea Ukraine : A Difficult Path to Reclaim? During his press conference, Trump also shared his view on the feasibility of Ukraine regaining control of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. His assessment was blunt: he feels it would be “very difficult” for Ukraine to reclaim the peninsula. This statement underscores the deep complexities and seemingly intractable nature of the territorial disputes at the heart of the conflict. The status of Crimea has been a non-starter for negotiations in the past, with Ukraine insisting on its territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, including Crimea, and Russia viewing the annexation as a settled matter. Trump’s comment reflects the significant military and political reality on the ground, suggesting that any peace deal might need to address this issue in a way that doesn’t fully satisfy either side’s maximalist position. Why Does Geopolitical Stability Crypto Investors Should Care? While the original news focuses on diplomacy and conflict, its implications extend to global financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space. Geopolitical instability is a significant factor influencing investor behavior. Periods of conflict and uncertainty often lead to increased risk aversion, where investors move away from perceived riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and towards traditional safe havens like gold or certain government bonds. Conversely, a credible path towards end war Ukraine and improved geopolitical stability could potentially boost market confidence and risk appetite. Here’s why: Reduced Uncertainty: Peace removes a major source of global uncertainty, allowing investors to focus on economic fundamentals. Improved Economic Outlook: A stable geopolitical environment is conducive to trade, investment, and economic growth, which can positively impact asset markets. Inflationary Pressures: The conflict has contributed to supply chain disruptions and energy price volatility, fueling inflation. Peace could help ease some of these pressures. Therefore, while Trump’s comments are about diplomacy, they carry weight for anyone navigating the crypto market, as they hint at potential shifts in the global risk landscape. Monitoring developments related to the Russia Ukraine peace deal is essential for understanding the broader economic backdrop. What Are the Benefits of a Potential Peace Agreement? The benefits of ending the war are immense and far-reaching: Saving Lives: The most critical benefit is the cessation of hostilities, preventing further loss of life and injury. Humanitarian Relief: Allows for increased humanitarian aid and the return of displaced populations. Economic Recovery: Enables Ukraine to begin the long process of rebuilding its infrastructure and economy. Global Stability: Reduces a major source of international tension and instability. Market Confidence: As mentioned, improved geopolitical stability can boost investor confidence globally. What Actionable Insights Can Be Drawn? For those interested in how these events intersect with markets: Stay Informed: Keep track of diplomatic developments and statements from key figures like Trump regarding the Trump Russia Ukraine situation. Observe Market Reactions: Pay attention to how markets, including crypto, react to news about potential peace talks or escalations. This can offer clues about prevailing sentiment. Consider Risk Management: Understand that geopolitical risks are inherent in global markets. Diversification and a clear risk management strategy remain crucial, regardless of the news cycle. It’s important to remember that comments like Trump’s are just one piece of a complex puzzle. The path to a genuine and lasting end war Ukraine is challenging and depends on numerous factors and the willingness of all parties to negotiate in good faith. In Conclusion: Hope for Peace Amidst Realities Donald Trump’s assertion that Russia and Ukraine are “very close” to an agreement offers a glimmer of hope in a conflict that has caused immense suffering. While the potential for a Russia Ukraine peace deal is encouraging, his realistic assessment regarding the difficulty of Ukraine reclaiming Crimea Ukraine highlights the significant obstacles that must still be overcome. For the global community, and particularly for those navigating financial markets, including the crypto space, developments towards geopolitical stability crypto are closely watched, as peace could unlock significant positive potential, even as the challenges remain formidable.

After consolidating within a tightening range, the price pushed past a key resistance zone. This breakout is generating excitement across the market, with analysts pointing to the potential for further upside if buying pressure continues to build. However, with critical levels now in play, the spotlight turns to whether the bulls can sustain this momentum and defend the breakout zone. A strong follow-through could pave the way for DOGE to target higher resistance levels and kick off a broader uptrend. Make-Or-Break Moment For Dogecoin In a recent tweet on X, popular analyst Whales_Crypto_Trading highlighted that Dogecoin has successfully completed a classic cup and handle pattern, a formation often associated with bullish continuation. According to the post, DOGE has now approached a critical resistance zone, which previously acted as a barrier to upward momentum. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $3? Analyst Weighs In This area is crucial since a breakout above it could validate the pattern and trigger a fresh wave of buying interest, potentially propelling the price toward new short-term highs. As Dogecoin hovers around this pivotal level, speculations are whether DOGE has enough momentum to push through and confirm the breakout. He further noted that if the breakout holds and momentum builds, Dogecoin might be on track to target key price levels at $0.50, $0.73, and eventually the $1.00 milestone. These levels align with historical resistance zones where DOGE has faced selling pressure in the past. A sustained move toward these targets would reinforce the bullish pattern and mark a significant recovery from its recent consolidation phase. Technicals Point North: Key Indicators Flash Green Looking at the technical indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are signaling positive momentum for Dogecoin, suggesting that the recent bullish breakout could have room to run. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Squeezes Into Triangle With Breakout Closing In The RSI has risen past the 50 mark and is currently near 63, indicating that Dogecoin is in the positive zone with increasing buying pressure and healthy upward momentum. This shift in market sentiment supports the likelihood of more gains. Meanwhile, the MACD is also showing bullish signs, with the MACD line above the signal line and the histogram widening. The divergence between the MACD and signal line reinforces the potential for sustained buying pressure and further upside for Dogecoin. Both indicators are aligning, reinforcing the idea that Dogecoin’s breakout is not just a short-term spike but a signal for a sustained rally. With strong momentum from these indicators, the path looks clear for DOGE to challenge higher resistance levels, and a potential retest of $0.50, $0.73, or even $1.00 may be on the horizon.

43770933,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152555,1745547035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI Data Centers: Shocking $200 Billion Cost & Power Crisis by 2030,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-data-centers-cost/,"The rapid acceleration of artificial intelligence is not just happening in the digital realm; it requires a massive, tangible foundation of physical infrastructure. This is where AI Data Centers come into play, and according to a recent study, their scale, cost, and power demands are set to reach shocking levels within the next six years. The Escalating Challenge of AI Infrastructure Costs Building the backbone for advanced AI is becoming an incredibly expensive undertaking. A study from researchers at Georgetown, Epoch AI, and Rand analyzed over 500 AI data center projects from 2019 to the present, revealing a dramatic upward trend in capital expenditure. Their findings indicate that the hardware costs alone for these centers increased by a factor of 1.9 annually between 2019 and 2025. This steep rise suggests that the price tag for cutting-edge AI infrastructure costs is doubling roughly every year. Consider projects like xAI’s Colossus, estimated to cost around $7 billion. While substantial, this is just a glimpse of the future scale. The study projects that by June 2030, a leading AI data center could house as many as 2 million AI Chips and carry a staggering price tag of $200 billion. This figure underscores the immense financial investment required to keep pace with AI development. Surging AI Power Consumption Beyond the financial cost, the energy demands of AI data centers are also skyrocketing. The same study highlights that power requirements climbed by a factor of 2 each year from 2019 to 2025. The Colossus data center, for instance, is estimated to draw 300 megawatts of power, equivalent to the needs of about 250,000 households. The projections for 2030 are even more dramatic. A leading AI data center could require 9 GW of power, roughly the output of nine nuclear reactors. While data centers have become more energy-efficient in terms of computational performance per watt (increasing 1.34x annually over the last five years), these efficiency gains are not enough to offset the exponential growth in overall power needs. This surging AI Power Consumption poses significant challenges for existing electricity grids. Building the Future of AI Data Centers Major tech companies are already pouring vast resources into expanding their capacity. OpenAI, which reports widespread use of its ChatGPT platform, is reportedly partnering with Softbank and others to raise up to $500 billion specifically for establishing a network of AI data centers. Giants like Microsoft, Google, and AWS have committed hundreds of millions this year alone to grow their data center footprints. These investments are a direct response to the demand for processing power needed to train and run increasingly complex AI models. The vision for the Future of AI relies heavily on building this unprecedented scale of digital infrastructure, capable of housing millions of powerful AI Chips and consuming vast amounts of energy. Environmental and Economic Impacts The environmental implications of this growth are significant. Forecasts suggest data center energy intake could grow by 20% by 2030. This could strain renewable energy sources and potentially increase reliance on fossil fuels, leading to higher carbon emissions. Furthermore, AI data centers require substantial amounts of water for cooling and occupy valuable real estate. Economically, generous tax incentives offered to attract these facilities can erode state tax bases, with some states losing over $100 million annually. Is the AI Data Center Boom Sustainable? While the projections from the Georgetown, Epoch, and Rand study paint a clear picture of escalating costs and demands, it’s worth considering if these trends are guaranteed to continue unchecked. There are signs of potential adjustments in the market. Some hyperscalers, including AWS and Microsoft, have reportedly scaled back certain data center projects recently. Analysts at Cowen noted a “cooling” in the data center market in early 2025, suggesting industry concerns about unsustainable expansion rates. Nevertheless, the fundamental trend towards larger, more powerful AI infrastructure remains. The question isn’t whether the infrastructure will grow, but at what pace, at what cost, and with what environmental footprint. In conclusion, the path to building the necessary infrastructure for the Future of AI presents immense challenges. The projections of $200 billion costs and city-level power demands by 2030 highlight the scale of investment and resource management required. Understanding these trends in AI Data Centers is crucial for anyone watching the evolution of technology and its real-world impact.

His remarks come as the Ethereum community gears up to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the network in July 2025. The price prediction has generated hype and discussion in the crypto world – particularly as Ethereum is currently sitting below $2,000. Justin Sun shared his thoughts on X , formerly Twitter. He cited a personal connection — his birthday falls on July 30, the same day Ethereum was launched in 2015. Sun took that moment to pair up with the Ethereum Foundation to promote the upcoming global holiday. The Foundation said there will be global meetups at small and large scales. People and organizations can plan their local events. To help keep costs down, the Ecosystem Support Program will reimburse up to $500 per event. Funding applications are due no later than June 15, 2025. While Sun congratulated the anniversary, his message looked ahead to the future. He predicted 10X Ethereum, or $5,000 ETH. Although he did not specify any date, his utterance helped cheer the camps of online ETH fans. Justin Sun lays out bold strategy to raise Ethereum’s value Sun not only made an aggressive price call but has also offered a definite plan that could move the needle for Ethereum to $5,000 fast. He first proposed that the Ethereum Foundation halt the ETH sale for at least three years. That, he said, would lower the supply of ETH and give people a reason to keep their tokens around longer. Sun suggested using lending and staking platforms like AAVE to pay the Foundation’s bills without selling ETH. He thinks it will benefit fund operations while maintaining Ethereum’s supply. He also suggested changes within the Ethereum Foundation itself. Sun believes the team should be leaner, keeping the best developers and paying them more. He thinks this would result in better work and a more solid Ethereum ecosystem. Finally, Sun stressed that Ethereum needs to concentrate more on its core network, Layer 1. He said improving its speed, security, and capacity should be the focus rather than spreading the work across too many side projects. Ethereum prepares for next phase of growth Ethereum is the second-biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market value. It’s the platform for thousands of decentralized applications and has made smart contracts the norm globally. Although it has been successful, Ethereum has had its share of critics over the years. High gas fees are a commonly lamented issue, as well as slow transaction times and lack of scalability. However, a future Pectra upgrade in May 2025 could make the process much better. The proposed upgrade should reduce transaction fees and allow the enforcement of contracts across the network. Ethereum currently trades at approximately $1,771, according to CoinMarketCap . The market will be curious to see if new-fangled catalysts and a new world will create the growth Sun is claiming. Sun’s embracement of Ethereum is particularly interesting given that he’s the founder of Tron (TRX)—a blockchain often considered a rival. Yet he holds on to his ETH and often has positive things to say about Ethereum’s progress. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The new bear and base targets were bumped up from ARK’s $300,000 and $710,000 Bitcoin price predictions on Feb. 11. ARK’s price projections were modeled on Bitcoin’s total addressable market (TAM), penetration rate — the percentage of Bitcoin’s TAM that it could capture in certain cases — and Bitcoin’s supply schedule. ARK’s bear, base and bull case price targets for Bitcoin by Dec. 31, 2030. Source: ARK Invest “Institutional investment contributes the most to our bull case,” said Puell, who estimated that Bitcoin would achieve a 6.5% penetration rate into the $200 trillion financial market in a best-case scenario (that figure excludes gold). Bitcoin’s acceptance as “digital gold” was also a major contributor to the lofty estimate, with Puell estimating that it could capture up to 60% of gold’s $18 trillion market cap (2024 figures) by the end of 2030 in a bull scenario. Bitcoin becoming a “safe haven” in emerging markets was the third-largest contributor to ARK’s $2.4 million bull case prediction at 13.5%. “This Bitcoin use case has the greatest potential for capital accrual,” Puell said, pointing to Bitcoin’s ability to protect wealth from inflation and devaluation in developing countries. Nation-state and corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies and Bitcoin financial services were also factored into ARK’s Bitcoin price projections. Bitcoin use cases contributing to ARK’s Bitcoin price targets. Source: ARK Invest ARK’s Bitcoin predictions are bold A $2.4 million Bitcoin price tag would send Bitcoin’s market cap to $49.2 trillion, assuming that Bitcoin’s total supply will have reached 20.5 million by the end of 2030. A $49.2 trillion valuation would be almost larger than the current gross domestic products of the US and China combined. It would also put Bitcoin in a good position to overtake gold as the world’s largest asset, which currently boasts a market cap of $22.5 trillion. Related: Cathie Wood to kick off El Salvador’s AI public education program Even ARK’s bear and base targets of $500,000 and $1.2 million would mean Bitcoin needs to increase at a compounded annual growth rate of 32% and 53% by the end of 2030 — a return that isn’t achieved too often for assets that have already notched trillion-dollar valuations. Since then, Bitcoin has recovered from a 2025 low of $75,160, soaring back up to the $94,000 range, while the Trump administration established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

Among the most talked-about projects are Qubetics , Maker, and Bitcoin Cash. These projects represent a mix of innovative features and unique value propositions that make them stand out in the crypto world. Whether you’re looking for a high ROI or the next big thing in blockchain, these coins have captured the attention of many. Qubetics, in particular, is making waves with its focus on solving practical problems in digital finance. The presale is on fire, having already raised over $16.3 million, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.1902 in Stage 31. That’s some serious momentum, and the project’s non-custodial multi-chain wallet is drawing attention from businesses and professionals alike. But what exactly makes Qubetics different? Let’s dive into the details and see why it’s considered one of the top crypto coins to buy now. On the other hand, Maker and Bitcoin Cash have been around for a while, steadily evolving their ecosystems and offering unique solutions to the crypto world. Maker has pioneered the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, while Bitcoin Cash remains one of the most reliable alternatives to Bitcoin, offering faster and cheaper transactions. Each of these projects brings something different to the table, but all share the potential to thrive in 2025. Qubetics: The Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet Revolution Qubetics is not just another crypto project—it’s a game-changer for the blockchain space. With its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, Qubetics is positioning itself as the ultimate solution for individuals, professionals, and businesses looking for security, ease of use, and flexibility in managing their digital assets.

MakerDAO’s Strategic Token Redenomination and Governance Enhancements MakerDAO announced a significant update to its governance structure as part of its ongoing “Endgame” strategy. The protocol plans to redenominate its MKR governance token, converting each MKR into 24,000 NewGovToken (NGT) tokens. This move aims to democratize governance by enabling a broader range of participants to hold meaningful amounts of the new token, thereby enhancing decentralized decision-making within the ecosystem. Alongside this, MakerDAO is introducing NewStable (NST), a new stablecoin pegged 1:1 with Dai, targeting mass adoption and compliance with real-world asset (RWA) support. The transition to NGT and NST is optional, allowing users to retain their original MKR and Dai tokens unless they choose to upgrade. ​ In addition to the token redenomination, MakerDAO has recently strengthened its governance framework by passing a new constitution. Approved with a 76.04% majority vote, the constitution formalizes governance processes and establishes roles such as constitutional conservers and delegates to oversee protocol integrity. This governance overhaul is designed to prevent hostile takeovers and ensure the long-term stability of the Dai stablecoin. These strategic initiatives reflect MakerDAO’s commitment to evolving its governance model and expanding its ecosystem in a sustainable and inclusive manner. Bitcoin Cash’s Network Activity Soars Amidst Halving Anticipation Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is experiencing a significant uptick in network activity as the upcoming halving event approaches. In the past week, BCH has surged by 37%, attracting over 230,000 new wallet addresses. This surge in adoption indicates growing interest and confidence in BCH as the halving event draws near. ​ The halving event, scheduled for April 4, 2024, will reduce the block reward for miners from 6.25 BCH to 3.125 BCH, effectively halving the rate at which new BCH is introduced into circulation. Historically, such events have led to increased scarcity and potential upward pressure on price. The current surge in network activity suggests that participants are positioning themselves ahead of the halving, anticipating potential benefits from the reduced supply. ​ Understanding the Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet: A Game-Changer for Digital Finance The non-custodial multi-chain wallet is one of the most important innovations in the blockchain space. It allows users to securely store and manage their digital assets across multiple blockchains without relying on third-party custodians. This means that users have complete control over their funds, reducing the risk of hacks and theft that are often associated with centralized exchanges. Here’s why the non-custodial multi-chain wallet is a game-changer: Full Control: Users are the only ones with access to their private keys, ensuring that they have complete control over their assets. Cross-Chain Support: Users can manage assets from different blockchains all in one place, making it easier to interact with various decentralized applications (dApps). Security: With no third-party intermediaries, the wallet is less vulnerable to hacks, making it a safer option for crypto holders. For anyone involved in digital finance, the non-custodial multi-chain wallet is an essential tool that provides security, flexibility, and control over digital assets. Qubetics has embraced this technology, positioning itself as a leader in the wallet space and offering businesses and individuals a solution that meets the demands of the future. Conclusion: The Future of Crypto Is Here As it look ahead to 2025, Qubetics, Maker, and Bitcoin Cash stand out as key players in the evolving crypto landscape. While each of these projects has its unique strengths, they all offer something valuable to the blockchain ecosystem. Whether it’s Qubetics’ revolutionary non-custodial wallet, Maker’s dominance in the DeFi space, or Bitcoin Cash’s fast and scalable transactions, there’s a lot to be excited about. For those looking to get involved in the crypto space, these three projects are definitely among the top crypto coins to buy now . As always, it’s important to stay informed and continue researching to make educated decisions about where to allocate your assets.

A combination of growing regulatory support and adoption by financial institutions has set the stage for the stablecoin market cap to fly as high as $3.7 trillion by 2030, or in a base case, $1.6 trillion. “The main catalyst for their greater acceptance may be regulatory clarity in the US, which could enable greater integration of stablecoins specifically, and blockchain more widely, into the existing financial system,” Citi said in its report. “The tailwinds of regulatory support and the increased integration of digital assets into incumbent financial institutions are setting the scene for increased usage of stablecoins.” On the heels of US President Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly administration assuming power earlier this year, lawmakers are weighing stablecoin legislation, such as the GENIUS Act , which seeks to regulate US stablecoins, ensuring their legal use for payments. A US regulatory framework for stablecoin would also support demand for dollar risk-free assets inside and outside the US, according to the report. “The stablecoin issuers will have to buy US Treasuries, or comparable low risk assets, against each stablecoin as a measure of having safe underlying collateral,” Citi said. “Stablecoin issuers could hold more US Treasuries by 2030 than any single jurisdiction today.” Stablecoin issuers could have significant holdings of US Treasuries by 2030. Source: Citigroup US will continue to dominate stablecoins In the future, Citi predicts the stablecoin supply will remain US dollar-denominated, with non-US countries promoting national currency or a central bank digital currency . In April, the stablecoin market cap had crossed $230 billion, an increase of 54% since last year , with Tether ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) dominating 90% of the market. “While the dollar’s dominance may evolve over time, with the euro or other currencies being promoted by national regulations, stablecoins may be viewed by many non-US policy makers as an instrument of dollar hegemony,” Citi said. “Geopolitics remain fluid. Should the world continue to drift into a multi-polar system it is likely that policymakers in China and Europe will be keen to promote central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) or stablecoins issued in their own currency.” Related: Russia finance ministry official floats country making own stablecoins: Report However, there are still some challenges ahead for the market. The stablecoin market cap could settle around $500 billion if “adoption and integration challenges persist.” Depegging has also been flagged as a potential issue, with 1,900 instances in 2023, according to Citi, including the major USDC depeg following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. “A major depegging event would likely dampen crypto market liquidity, trigger automated liquidations, impair trading platforms’ ability to meet redemptions, and potentially have broader contagion effects for the financial system,” the firm said.

On April 24, China maintained that it had not held trade talks with Washington despite repeated remarks from Trump suggesting there had been engagement. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce, He Yadong, stated that any claims about the progress of China-U.S. trade negotiations were groundless and had no factual basis. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Guo Jiakun, also acknowledged that China and the U.S. had not yet conducted consultations or negotiations on levies, let alone reached an agreement. Beijing dismisses Trump’s claims of China-U.S. trade negotiation BREAKING: China calls Trump’s claims that the two nations have been talking about a trade deal, “fake news”. China says there are NO ongoing talks with the U.S. and they have just called for the U.S. to cancel unilateral tariffs. — Brian Krassenstein (@krassenstein) April 24, 2025 China has dismissed President Donald Trump’s claims that the U.S. and China were at the negotiating table to resolve the trade war. He Yadong, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce, mentioned that Trump’s claims about the progress of China-U.S. trade negotiations were groundless and had no factual basis. Trump said he planned to be “very nice” to reach a deal, as Washington discussed it with Beijing this week. The President also called his 145% tariff on Chinese goods “too high” and promised it would “come down substantially.” On Thursday, another Chinese official dismissed the President’s claims and said China was prepared to negotiate only under certain conditions. Jiakun noted that China’s attitude is consistent and clear: if the U.S. wants to fight, Beijing will fight to the end, and “if you want to talk, the door is open.” “China and the United States have not conducted consultations or negotiations on tariffs, let alone reached an agreement.” -Guo Jiakum, spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Despite China’s stance, Trump continued to claim negotiations were taking place during a brief availability with reporters alongside Norway’s prime minister Thursday afternoon. He argued that there was a meeting this morning, and it didn’t matter who “they” were. Trump acknowledged that he would reveal the talks from this morning later and stressed that “we’ve been meeting with China.” Washington issued China the highest tariffs of any country, and the nation has reciprocated with 125% on American imports. It was also reported on Wednesday that the Trump administration was considering dropping the tariffs to 50 percent. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added to the conflicting reports and denied the report on Wednesday that the U.S. would slash the tariffs on China. He maintained that the heightened U.S.-China tariffs must come down before trade negotiations proceed. Bessent also added that de-escalation was necessary for the world’s two largest economies to rebalance their trading partnership. Bessent also acknowledged that neither side believed the current levies were sustainable. He argued that the tariffs were equivalent to an embargo and that a break in trade between the two countries did not suit anyone’s interests. U.S.-China trade war causes market uncertainty U.S. businesses face heightened import costs while Chinese exports are squeezed by falling U.S. demand. The world’s hope of a de-escalation in the trade war also caused the stock market to rise Wednesday. Stock futures plummeted on Thursday morning after investors heard mixed remarks from Washington and Beijing. Gaurav Mallik, chief investment officer of Massachusetts-based Pallas Capital Advisors, believes there will be some fluctuation in the market until there’s a more permanent solution to the tariff talk turbulence. Gaurav noted that stocks remained range-bound for the time being despite expectations of a more dovish tone on tariffs from the Trump administration. He also argued that the ultimate goal for markets is either a reversal of tariffs or significant trade deals. The financial expert believes it can take a few months for market corrections to end, and he is confident that there’s a clear market correction due to the speed of the declines.

According to US cybersecurity firm Silent Push, North Korean hackers set up two companies, Blocknovas LLC and Softglide LLC, using fake names and addresses in New Mexico and New York. Meanwhile, a third firm, Angeloper Agency, was also linked to the operation. However, it has not been officially registered in the country. This campaign is tied to a subgroup within the Lazarus Group , a North Korean hacking unit under the Reconnaissance General Bureau, Pyongyang’s foreign intelligence agency. Our team at Silent Push has been hard at work on the largest report we’ve ever made public – and along with Reuters – today we’re explaining how North Korean threat actors associated with the “Contagious Interview” subgroup created 3 front companies… — Zach Edwards (@thezedwards) April 24, 2025 FBI Cracks Down on North Korea-Backed Crypto Scam Targeting Developers Further, the FBI reportedly seized Blocknovas’ domain on Thursday, stating the action was part of a broader law enforcement effort against North Korean actors using fake job offers to distribute malware. In its report, Reuters said the hackers use fake job interviews to trick developers into downloading malware designed to access crypto wallets and developer credentials. Further, Reuters reviewed public records showing Blocknovas was registered to a vacant lot in South Carolina. Meanwhile, Softglide’s paperwork traced back to a small tax office in Buffalo. Silent Push said Blocknovas was the most active of the three front companies. It had already compromised multiple victims. Collectively, these activities violate sanctions imposed by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. They also breach UN measures designed to stop North Korea from funding its weapons programs through overseas businesses. Crypto Theft and Covert IT Ops Fuel North Korea’s Military Expansion The incident adds to a growing list of sophisticated operations by Pyongyang targeting the crypto industry. These include sending thousands of IT workers abroad and carrying out high-profile cyber heists. The goal is to generate funds for North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. Over the past few years, North Korea has increasingly turned to crypto-related crimes to raise funds. Notably, it has been linked to a string of high-profile thefts, including the 2022 Axie Infinity hack . Parallely, the regime has also sent thousands of IT workers overseas. These workers are said to secretly send their earnings back to the state. Moreover, these activities are believed to support North Korea’s weapons program. Reports say stolen crypto assets have helped fund its ballistic missile development.

On-chain metrics, which track transactions and wallet movements directly on the blockchain, have revealed a significant surge in one particular area: accumulation addresses. This trend is sending a strong signal about the mindset of long-term ETH holders . Understanding Crypto Accumulation: Why Do Accumulation Addresses Matter? Before diving into the specifics, let’s clarify what ‘accumulation addresses’ are. These are blockchain addresses identified by analysts as having a consistent history of receiving cryptocurrency but rarely, if ever, sending it out. Think of them as digital vaults where investors stash their assets with a clear intention to hold for the long term, rather than trading frequently. When there’s a large inflow of assets into these addresses, it indicates that significant amounts of the cryptocurrency are being moved off exchanges or out of active trading wallets into cold storage or long-term holding positions. This behavior is often interpreted as a sign of confidence in the asset’s future value. It suggests that holders are willing to weather short-term price volatility, believing the asset will appreciate significantly over time. The Record-Breaking Ethereum Event on April 22 The data point that recently captured attention relates to Ethereum. According to reports citing on-chain analysis, the inflow of ETH into accumulation addresses reached levels not seen since 2018 over a recent 10-day period. The peak of this activity occurred specifically on April 22. On this single day, a staggering 449,000 ETH flowed into these accumulation addresses. This figure represents the largest daily inflow into accumulation addresses in the entire history of Ethereum. To put this into perspective, this wasn’t just a slight uptick; it was a significant, record-setting event. What Does This On-Chain Analysis Suggest About ETH Price Outlook? This massive movement of ETH into long-term holding strategies carries significant implications for the potential future ETH price . Analysts often interpret such accumulation phases as bullish signals, particularly from long-term perspectives. Here’s why this data is seen as positive, even amidst recent price dips: Strong Long-Term Conviction: The fact that holders are moving large amounts of ETH into storage, rather than selling during price corrections, suggests they have strong conviction in Ethereum’s fundamental value and future growth. Reduced Selling Pressure: ETH held in accumulation addresses is effectively taken out of immediate circulation for trading. This reduces the potential selling pressure on the market, which can be a supportive factor for the price over time. Historical Precedent: Historically, periods of significant accumulation have often preceded or coincided with significant price rallies, as supply available for sale tightens while demand potentially increases. While no single metric guarantees future price movements, this particular piece of on-chain analysis paints a picture of resilience among committed Ethereum investors. Beyond Accumulation: Other Positive On-Chain Momentum The report also highlighted other positive signs within the Ethereum network’s on-chain data. For instance, there has been a recent increase in the number of active Ethereum addresses. An increase in active addresses can signal growing network usage and adoption, whether for transactions, interacting with dApps, or other activities. This suggests that despite price fluctuations, the underlying utility and engagement with the Ethereum blockchain remain robust. Are There Any Counterpoints? Examining Weak DeFi Activity It’s important to look at the full picture. While accumulation and active addresses show strength, the report also noted that DeFi activity remains relatively weak, with declining DEX (Decentralized Exchange) volumes. This presents a more nuanced view of the current market landscape. Why might this be the case? Risk Aversion: Lower DEX volumes could indicate reduced speculative trading and yield farming activity, possibly due to broader market uncertainty or lower volatility making these strategies less profitable in the short term. Shift in Focus: It might also suggest a temporary shift in focus away from highly active DeFi engagement towards simply holding the underlying assets like ETH. Seasonal Factors: Crypto markets often experience cycles, and periods of lower activity can occur before new trends or catalysts emerge. So, while the long-term conviction from ETH holders is evident through accumulation, the immediate trading and speculative energy within the DeFi sector appears subdued. This highlights the complexity of the crypto market, where different segments can show varying degrees of activity and sentiment. Putting It All Together: What Does This Mean for You? For anyone interested in Ethereum or the broader crypto market trends , this data provides valuable context. The record ETH inflow into accumulation addresses is a powerful indicator of strong long-term holder sentiment. It suggests that a significant portion of the market believes in Ethereum’s future, regardless of current price levels. Key takeaways: Don’t let short-term price dips overshadow the signals from long-term holders. On-chain data provides unique insights into market behavior that price charts alone cannot. The market is not monolithic; different sectors (like long-term holding vs. DeFi trading) can exhibit different trends simultaneously. This isn’t financial advice, but understanding these underlying dynamics can help you form a more informed perspective on the market. Conclusion: A Vote of Confidence in Ethereum’s Future The record-breaking inflow of 449,000 ETH into accumulation addresses on April 22 stands out as a significant event in Ethereum’s history. It serves as a compelling vote of confidence from long-term investors who are choosing to hold onto their assets despite recent market softness. Coupled with positive signs like increasing active addresses, this crypto accumulation trend suggests underlying network health and strong belief in Ethereum’s potential. While areas like DeFi trading show less activity, the actions of these committed ETH holders provide a powerful counter-narrative, pointing towards optimism for Ethereum’s future growth and adoption.

The primary focus? The weakening Yen currency and the potential for currency intervention . These high-level US Japan finance talks are crucial for understanding potential shifts in the global financial landscape and their ripple effects. Why the Yen Currency is a Key Topic The Japanese Yen has experienced significant depreciation against the US Dollar over the past year. This decline is largely attributed to the divergence in macroeconomic policy between the two nations. Japan’s Stance: The Bank of Japan has maintained ultra-low interest rates and an expansive monetary policy to combat deflation and stimulate economic growth. US Stance: The Federal Reserve, conversely, has aggressively hiked interest rates to curb inflation. This interest rate differential makes holding Yen less attractive compared to the Dollar, leading to capital outflow and downward pressure on the Yen’s value. While a weaker Yen can boost Japanese exports, excessive volatility and rapid depreciation raise concerns about import costs and overall economic stability. Understanding Currency Intervention Currency intervention involves a government or central bank buying or selling its own currency in the foreign exchange market to influence its value. Japan has a history of intervening to prevent excessive Yen appreciation, but intervening to stop depreciation is less common and requires careful consideration, often needing at least tacit approval from major partners like the US. Why is US perspective important? Unilateral intervention by Japan could be seen as manipulating the currency for trade advantage, a stance the US generally opposes. Therefore, coordination or at least open communication during US Japan finance talks is vital before any potential action. What’s on the Table in These US Japan Finance Talks? The discussions in Washington are expected to cover a range of topics, but the Yen’s stability will likely dominate. Key points of discussion may include: Reviewing the current state of the Japanese economy and the reasons behind the Yen’s weakness. Exploring whether the recent Yen movements are disorderly or simply a reflection of policy differences. Discussing the conditions under which intervention might be considered, if at all. Coordinating on broader macroeconomic policy outlooks and their global impact. Addressing other bilateral and global financial issues. The US Treasury typically emphasizes that currencies should reflect economic fundamentals and that it opposes disorderly market movements. Japan’s finance officials will likely seek to convey their concerns about the pace of the Yen’s decline and the potential negative impacts on their economy. Implications for the Forex Market and Beyond The outcome of these US Japan finance talks will be closely watched by Forex market participants. Any hint of potential coordinated action or a change in stance from either side could trigger significant volatility in the USD/JPY pair and potentially other currency pairs. A decision to intervene could lead to a sharp, albeit potentially temporary, strengthening of the Yen. Conversely, if the US signals little objection to the current levels or pace, the Yen could remain under pressure or even weaken further, depending on future policy expectations. Beyond the immediate Forex market impact, these discussions highlight the ongoing global economic challenges: The difficulty in coordinating macroeconomic policy when countries face different domestic pressures (inflation vs. deflation risks). The tension between maintaining currency stability and pursuing independent monetary policy. The interconnectedness of global finance, where one country’s currency movements can affect others. How Macroeconomic Policy Impacts Risk Assets While seemingly distant from the world of digital assets, these high-level discussions on macroeconomic policy and currency stability have indirect but significant impacts on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. When major economies like the US and Japan navigate significant currency fluctuations and potential interventions, it creates uncertainty in global financial markets. Investors often react to such uncertainty by adjusting their risk exposure. Shifts in central bank policies (like interest rates or quantitative easing/tightening) directly influence liquidity and investor sentiment, which in turn affects capital flows into asset classes, including crypto. Challenges and Considerations Conducting successful currency intervention is challenging. It requires substantial reserves and can be overwhelmed by market forces if not supported by fundamental economic conditions or policy shifts. Furthermore, the effectiveness of intervention is often debated. The US is generally hesitant to support intervention unless currency movements are truly disorderly and harmful, rather than simply reflecting policy differences. Another challenge is the communication surrounding such talks. Officials must carefully choose their words to avoid inadvertently triggering unwanted market reactions. The joint statements or press conferences following the meeting will be scrutinized for any clues about future intentions regarding the Yen currency . Looking Ahead: What to Expect It’s unlikely that these talks will result in an immediate, explicit announcement of coordinated intervention. More probable outcomes include: A joint statement acknowledging concerns about recent Yen volatility. Reaffirmation of the commitment to G7/G20 principles regarding currency markets (e.g., opposing disorderly moves). Agreement to continue close communication on economic and financial matters. The true impact will lie in the nuances of the language used and whether Japan feels it has sufficient backing, or at least no opposition, from the US to act unilaterally if the Yen’s decline accelerates or becomes more volatile in the future. The direction of macroeconomic policy in both countries, particularly future interest rate decisions, will remain the dominant driver for the Yen currency and the broader Forex market . Conclusion: Navigating Global Economic Currents The US Japan finance talks in Washington underscore the complex interplay of national macroeconomic policy and global currency markets. The focus on the Yen currency and the discussion around potential currency intervention highlight the pressures faced by policymakers navigating divergent economic conditions. While the immediate outcomes for the Forex market will depend on the specifics of any statements, the broader implications for global financial stability and how major economies manage their currencies remain paramount. Keeping an eye on these high-level discussions provides valuable context for understanding the forces shaping financial markets worldwide.

Its role as a digital store of value, decentralized reserve asset, and macro hedge has only strengthened. And while its gains may no longer be exponential, its long-term potential remains deeply rooted in both investor trust and institutional adoption. XRP and Solana , meanwhile, continue to cement their positions as essential components of a functioning blockchain ecosystem. With use cases that span global payments, high-performance dApps, and more, these tokens remain on nearly every serious investor’s radar. Yet even as these leaders maintain their grip, new narratives are forming in the background. And among the most intriguing is the rise of MAGACOINFINANCE —a project that’s gaining momentum not through media hype, but through actual, measurable traction. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building the Kind of Momentum That Can’t Be Ignored What sets MAGACOINFINANCE apart isn’t just its recent surge in visibility—it’s the method behind it. While many emerging tokens scramble for short-term attention, this project is executing a far more deliberate strategy. Its growth has been marked by consistency. The roadmap is being followed. The community is expanding with real engagement. And wallet activity is reflecting not just curiosity, but commitment. That combination—discipline and adoption—is rare in early-stage crypto. For traders searching for signals beyond price spikes, MAGACOINFINANCE is starting to light up the board. It’s the kind of asset that doesn’t just move with the market—it’s beginning to move because of its own internal strength. Long-Term Contenders: XRP, Toncoin, Chainlink, and Hedera Hashgraph XRP continues to dominate the conversation around regulated blockchain adoption. Its presence in cross-border banking and institutional finance makes it one of the few cryptos already deeply embedded in traditional systems. Toncoin has carved out a space through integrations that blend Web3 with mass-market communication tools. It’s fast, mobile-native, and gaining traction with users who might otherwise stay outside the crypto ecosystem. Chainlink remains a critical component of decentralized infrastructure. As the premier oracle provider, it serves as the data backbone for hundreds of smart contracts across chains. Hedera Hashgraph is expanding through partnerships that go beyond the crypto-native world. Its high-speed, low-energy model appeals to enterprises looking for scalable blockchain alternatives. All of these projects are meaningful—but they’re also maturing. Their early days are behind them. MAGACOINFINANCE , however, is still in its early narrative stage—and that’s often where the most compelling opportunities live. Final Thoughts Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP will likely remain pillars of the digital asset market. Their networks are strong, their ecosystems are robust, and their communities are deeply invested. But the next chapter won’t be written by legacy alone. It will include new names. And if early signals are any indication, MAGACOINFINANCE may be one of them.

For those deeply invested in the intersection of technology and innovation, particularly within the crypto space where decentralized social networks are often discussed, the idea of an OpenAI social platform is certainly intriguing. What would such a platform look like, and more importantly, who is it intended for? Reports Hint at an OpenAI Social Platform According to reports from The Verge, OpenAI is reportedly in the early stages of developing its own social networking service. Think of it as potentially an ‘X-like’ platform, but with a distinct OpenAI twist. While details are scarce, the internal prototype is said to be centered around ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities and includes a social feed component. This isn’t just about letting users share DALL-E creations. The core motivation appears to be strategic. Existing social media giants like X and Meta possess vast amounts of real-time, user-generated data – conversations, trends, interactions, and content types. This constant stream of fresh data is invaluable for training and refining large language models and other AI systems. By creating its own social environment, OpenAI could potentially: Secure a direct pipeline for unique, real-time data. Control the type and quality of data generated on the platform. Reduce reliance on third-party data sources, which can be costly or subject to changing terms. The focus on image generation in the prototype suggests that visual data and the interaction around it might be a key initial area of interest for their training models. Is This a ChatGPT Social Network? Given the report specifically mentions the prototype’s focus on ChatGPT’s image generation, it’s reasonable to consider this potential venture as, at least initially, a ChatGPT social network . This implies integration with OpenAI’s flagship AI model, allowing users to generate images directly within the social environment and share them instantly. But what would interaction look like? Could users comment on images using ChatGPT-generated text? Could AI-powered tools help curate feeds or moderate content? The possibilities, when combining social networking with advanced generative AI, are vast and could redefine online interaction. This potential platform could serve as a living laboratory for how users interact with AI-generated content and with each other through AI interfaces. The data gleaned from these interactions would be gold for improving AI models’ understanding of human communication, preferences, and creative expression. Exploring the Potential of AI Social Media The concept of AI social media raises fascinating questions and opportunities. How would an AI-centric platform differentiate itself from established players? Beyond image sharing, could it incorporate other AI modalities like text generation, music creation, or even synthetic media? Consider these potential features: AI-Assisted Content Creation: Users generate posts, images, or even short videos with AI help. AI-Powered Curation: Feeds are personalized not just by engagement, but by understanding content nuance using AI. AI Moderation & Safety: Advanced AI tools detect harmful content more effectively. Unique Interaction Types: Engaging with AI characters or using AI tools within conversations. Such a platform wouldn’t just be a place to share; it could be a place to create and experience content in entirely new ways, driven by AI capabilities. This could attract a specific user base interested in pushing the boundaries of digital creativity and interaction. The Strategic Advantage: Real-Time Data Acquisition One of the most significant challenges in training large AI models is acquiring vast, diverse, and current datasets. While web scraping and existing public datasets provide a foundation, real-time data from active user interactions offers insights into current trends, language evolution, and emerging cultural phenomena that static datasets cannot capture. Platforms like X thrive on real-time information exchange. News breaks there, trends emerge, and public opinion is shaped in the moment. Accessing this dynamic data stream is crucial for keeping AI models relevant and grounded in the contemporary world. By building its own platform, OpenAI bypasses the need to license or scrape data from external sources, which can be unreliable or expensive. They gain a controlled environment where they can observe user behavior and content generation firsthand, providing an invaluable feedback loop for their AI development process. This direct access to fresh, dynamic data could give OpenAI a significant competitive edge in the ongoing race to build more capable and context-aware AI systems. Training AI Models with Proprietary Data The ultimate goal behind gathering this real-time data is, of course, training AI models . The performance and capabilities of models like GPT-4 and future iterations are directly tied to the quality and quantity of the data they are trained on. A proprietary social platform offers several advantages for this purpose: Targeted Data Collection: OpenAI could design the platform to encourage specific types of interactions or content generation that are particularly valuable for training. Data Annotation: User actions (likes, shares, comments) on AI-generated content provide implicit feedback that can be used for reinforcement learning. Understanding User Needs: Observing how users interact with AI tools within a social context reveals how they use the technology and what improvements are needed. Ethical Considerations: Having control over the data source allows OpenAI to potentially implement stricter ethical guidelines regarding data usage for training, although privacy concerns for users would still be paramount. This closed loop – AI generates content, users interact, data is collected, AI is trained – could accelerate the development cycle and lead to faster improvements in model performance and alignment. Who is this OpenAI Social Platform For? This is perhaps the most critical question. Several potential user groups come to mind: AI Enthusiasts and Creators: Individuals passionate about AI, generative art, and exploring new digital tools. Developers and Researchers: A platform to test and showcase AI applications in a social setting. Artists and Designers: A dedicated space to share and collaborate on AI-assisted creative projects. General Public: Could it eventually aim for broader adoption, offering a different kind of social experience? Given the initial focus on image generation, it’s likely to appeal first to the creative and tech-savvy crowd. However, the long-term vision could involve integrating more of ChatGPT’s capabilities, potentially expanding the appeal. The crypto community, with its interest in decentralized technology and digital ownership (like NFTs for AI art), might also find a platform focused on AI-generated content appealing. Table: Potential User Groups and Their Interest User Group Primary Interest Benefit from Platform AI Creators Generating & Sharing AI Art Dedicated community, integrated tools Developers Testing AI Interactions Real-world usage data, potential API access Artists Exploring AI in Creativity New tools, audience for AI-assisted work General Users Unique Social Experience Novel content, interactive AI features Challenges and the Road Ahead Building a successful social network is incredibly challenging, even for established tech giants. OpenAI would face stiff competition from entrenched platforms with billions of users. They would also need to address significant issues: Content Moderation: Managing user-generated content, especially AI-generated content which can be misused, is a monumental task. Data Privacy and Security: Protecting user data and ensuring transparency in how data is used for training is crucial. User Acquisition and Retention: Attracting users and keeping them engaged requires a compelling value proposition. Monetization: How would the platform sustain itself? Ads? Premium features? Despite the hurdles, the strategic value of owning a direct data pipeline for training AI models is immense. This move signals OpenAI’s ambition to control more aspects of the AI ecosystem, from model development to data acquisition and potentially user interaction platforms. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for AI Dominance? While still in the prototype phase, the possibility of an OpenAI social platform is a significant development. It highlights the increasing importance of real-time, proprietary data for advancing AI capabilities. Focused initially on image generation and potentially evolving into a broader ChatGPT social network , this venture could provide OpenAI with a unique advantage in training AI models and understanding user interaction with AI at scale. Whether it succeeds in attracting a large user base and competing with established players remains to be seen, but it underscores OpenAI’s strategic push to secure essential resources like real-time data in the competitive landscape of AI social media .

Over the past day, these same wallets have directed their buying power toward a very limited number of sectors, with an unmistakable emphasis on tokens tied to AI, decentralized finance (DeFi), and asset-backed tokens. AI and Agentic Frameworks Catch Smart Attention The intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain remains an intriguing theme. Five wallets amassed tokens related to artificial intelligence in just the past 24 hours. It indicates that some investors think the next wave of innovation will come from the convergence of agent-based protocols (i.e., AI) and the crypto stack (i.e., blockchain). One category standout is REI (Rei Network), which operates under the broader narrative of agentic systems and decentralized AI frameworks. One smart money wallet has accumulated $40,000 worth of REI tokens, a notable move given the token’s relatively modest $53 million market cap. REI has been gaining traction with institutional circles, thanks to its positioning as a flexible, lightweight platform designed to integrate AI capabilities directly into blockchain infrastructure. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: AI & Agentic Frameworks (5 wallets) DeFi & Trading (5 wallets) Wrapped & Backed Assets (4 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $REI (Unit 00 – Rei) -> Strong… pic.twitter.com/1RNiyY3rxb — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) April 23, 2025 Even though a recent accumulation involved just one wallet, this purchase is being interpreted as a vote of confidence from a player whose early entries into thematic tokens have a habit of blossoming into mainstream awareness. DeFi Assets Back in Favor with Governance Catalysts DeFi continues to draw intelligent funds, especially when platforms make governance or structural changes that might affect token economics. In the last day, five wallets have accumulated across DeFi-related assets, and a large portion of that activity seems to be concentrated in $AAVE, the governance token for Aave Protocol. Four intelligent money wallets gobbled up a combined AAVE value of nearly $420,000, signaling a surge in smart capital flowing toward the protocol. This seems to mirror renewed interest in the DeFi project amid proposals of buybacks and some tweaks to its governance framework. With a market cap of $2.47 billion, Aave is still one of the largest and apparently one of the most battle-tested DeFi platforms. But this spike in interest suggests traders are seeing some fresh updraft as the price of AAVE tends to lag behind some other DeFi tokens. In terms of interest from the intelligent money crowd, this price lag might mean Aave could be seen as a bargain. But whatever the reason, wallets that appear to be somewhat in the know have been buying up AAVE. At a time when Aave is striving ahead with ecosystem advancements and is looking at initiatives to amplify the valuation of its tokens—such as fee redistributions and revenue optimization—it’s worth noting that the protocol’s treasury is growing. Wrapped Assets See Uptick Amid DeFi Usage Growth Note also that tokens representing wrapped or synthetic assets are demanding attention—in particular, those showing increasing involvement in DeFi applications. Four intelligent wallets made some moves in this space; however, Wrapped TRON ($WTRX) saw the most accumulation. Together, two wallets put in $131,000 worth of WTRX, which has a current market cap of $399 million. The activity coincides with rising interest in SunSwap, a decentralized exchange in the TRON ecosystem that has recently seen a jump in both trading volume and total value locked. As the DeFi space diversifies and more protocols expand their cross-chain capabilities, wrapped versions of assets like WTRX become crucial to users moving between different blockchain environments. The accumulation trend seems primarily driven by the rising use of TRON-based DeFi and the increased dependence on wrapped assets for achieving interoperability. Smart Money Still Selective in Choppy Markets Though these accumulation patterns give us some insight into how the crypto elite are investing, this involves a very small number of actual wallets. In just looking at the 10 wallets identified by Nansen, we can see that there are some serious funds backing the future of Ethereum. Despite this, the channels are obvious: AI is now gaining real traction; DeFi is still an area ripe with opportunity if there is some governance now; and wrapped tokens are enjoying the cross-chain growth of DeFi. Whether these are just a few random plays or a signal of something really changing in the market is still, you know, up in the air. But it seems that investors are now leaning back into risk with these strategies. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The price increase, besides being an increase in price, is acting to send something called a signal. That signal is one of strong conviction by investors. For some, it is a way of showing that these ‘signals’ are sometimes the best reason to buy. Here is a bit more about what is being signaled when it comes to the future of Bitcoin and who might be doing the buying. #Bitcoin $BTC just hit $90,000, and based on on-chain data from @intotheblock , the next key area of resistance is between $95,600 and $98,290! pic.twitter.com/tYDjUmTCfH — Ali (@ali_charts) April 22, 2025 Data from IntoTheBlock reveal something remarkable: 92% of all Bitcoin addresses are now in the money. That’s the highest this figure has been since the 2021 bull market—highest, in other words, since we’ve had this recent relief rally, which we’re calling a bull market. So, let’s run with that. And something else: Historic data tell us that when high levels of profitability are concentrated among holders of an asset, the conditions are ripe for a supply squeeze. Why? Because holders find it increasingly hard to part with something that is giving them such nice returns. According to @intotheblock #Bitcoin surges past $90,000! With 92% of all $BTC addresses now in profit the highest since 2021, we're seeing reduced selling pressure as holders prefer to keep their profitable positions. pic.twitter.com/R8DvQokYua — ALTCOIN D/GDDY {A.D}𓃵 (@Altcoin_daddy) April 23, 2025 Institutional Demand Surges, Exchange Balances Shrink One of the most telling indicators of this renewed enthusiasm is how much Bitcoin is being pulled from centralized exchanges. Over the past week alone, more than 17,000 BTC have been withdrawn. This signals that investors are increasingly choosing to store their assets in cold wallets instead of keeping them readily available for trading. Such behavior often suggests long-term confidence, especially among large holders who are choosing a custodial approach to their BTC. In fact, one might say that pulling BTC from exchanges is a bullish indicator. Concurrently, spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Bitcoin in the U.S. are gathering impressive inflows. On April 22, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded an eye-popping $936 million in net inflows—the third straight day of solid demand for Bitcoin ETFs. This persistent interest from institutional players suggests that traditional finance is making a rush for Bitcoin, with the effects felt increasingly on open-market supply. Over 17,000 #Bitcoin $BTC have been pulled from exchanges in the past week! pic.twitter.com/P5BWuDsKwb — Ali (@ali_charts) April 23, 2025 At the same time, the derivatives market for Bitcoin has seen a substantial increase in open interest, with the total now exceeding $34 billion at several major exchanges. This recent climb appears to be largely fueled by new buying, with investors now largely in leveraged positions. The next big move for Bitcoin could very well be a leveraged one, as price discovery continues in this relatively new asset class. The dip in the price might also be a cause of concern for investors in leveraged positions. On April 22, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $936 million, net inflows for three consecutive days. Ethereum spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $38.74 million, with none of the nine ETFs registering net outflows. https://t.co/SF4brkl9iI — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 23, 2025 The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, is showing particularly powerful signs of a bullish trend. The net taker volume on the platform—an indicator that measures how much in aggressive buy orders the exchange is matching—just tapped a monthly high of almost $62 million. This is nothing short of an invitation for traders to start an incipient breakout rally. After all, it’s an invite that represents a near 30% increase in volume from last month’s total. #Bitcoin $BTC open interest across all exchanges has surged to a new monthly high, topping $34 billion. Leverage is heating up! pic.twitter.com/Rqtr2IjNWD — Ali (@ali_charts) April 22, 2025 Next Stop: Resistance Between $95K and $98K As we move forward, on-chain data indicates the next major resistance band from $95,600 to $98,290. This price area should serve as a test of whether Bitcoin can keep climbing. If it bursts beyond that range in a big way, we could see it head toward those so-far elusive six-figure price points. Nevertheless, as with everything in the crypto markets, no asset moves in a straight line. These indicators—balanced exchanges, ETF buying, and a booming OI—are working in harmony. But we must remember that when a market is this bullish, it can become overly euphoric and overly leveraged. And that means volatility—possibly even a sharp pullback—has to be in the cards. With that stated, the current trend is unmistakable: not only is Bitcoin reaching new heights in its price, but it is also delivering some pretty solid fundamentals. The vast majority of people who hold Bitcoin are in the money and choosing to hold, and the steady inflow of institutional capital has some people talking about a price breakout that might just be a prelude to a return to the $100,000 prices of 2021. With the next resistance levels now in sight, everyone is paying close attention to whether this bullish momentum can take the world’s top cryptocurrency past its earlier limits and into a new price-discovery phase.

In the space of just 24 hours, Ethereum’s market cap surged 12 percent, and the total price currently sits at just under $2,000. ETH added an impressive 12% to its market cap in the last 24 hours. On-chain data points to only modest resistance ahead, with the largest potential sell wall near $1,860. If that zone gives way, a move back toward the psychological $2,000 level looks increasingly plausible. pic.twitter.com/SJVKduDvjK — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 23, 2025 The rally comes during a period when the wider crypto market displays fresh strength , and Ethereum, in particular, derives good fortune from both technical and structural factors. Analysts and on-chain data providers make clear there isn’t much in the way of resistance right in front of our noses, with the largest immediate selling pressure seen right around the $1,860 level. If and when that level goes decisively, the next stop on the Path of Least Resistance appears to be the big round number of $2,000. Whale Activity Points to Conviction A large portion of the bullish momentum shows that it’s coming from the really fat holders—also known as whales—who’ve been on a tear and have been hoovering up ETH in the past few hours. You can really see this renewed appetite in some of the big on-chain transactions that have gone down. For instance, wallet address 0xD20E withdrew 5,531 ETH (around $9.8 million) from Binance in the last hour, a classic signal of accumulation and long-term positioning. Typically, when ETH is pulled from centralized exchanges, it indicates a reduced likelihood of immediate resale, suggesting the holder expects further appreciation in price. ETH just hit $1,800! Whales continue to buy $ETH . 0xD20E withdrew 5,531 $ETH ($9.8M) from #Binance in the past hour. 0x2088 spent 4.61M $USDC to buy 2,568 $ETH at $1,794 in the past 40 minutes. https://t.co/jzoEhDh2Fs https://t.co/Gz3tdRjNWp pic.twitter.com/FoW5pZZOlM — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 23, 2025 0x2088 address another whale, using, 4.61 million USDC spent to acquire ETH 2,568 at an average price of $1,794, also in the past hour. The sharp rebound came during Ethereum’s and reinforced large-scale buying activity across major platforms and broader patterns of that. One of the most aggressive trades came from an anonymous whale who borrowed 34.75 million USDT from Aave, a major decentralized lending platform, to buy 19,973 ETH at around $1,740 just four hours ago. This whale is now collateralizing a massive 50,000 WETH (wrapped ETH), worth about $89.8 million, on Aave to back up a loan of 65.85 million USDT. The position currently holds a health rate of 1.12, with a liquidation price of $1,549.50. As $ETH rebounded, a whale borrowed 34.75M $USDT from #Aave to buy 19,973 $ETH at ~$1,740 just 4 hours ago. This whale now collateralizes 50K $WETH ($89.8M) on #Aave to borrow 65.85M $USDT at a health rate of 1.12 and a liquidation price of $1,549.5. Follow @spotonchain and… pic.twitter.com/OBaDukqfAm — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) April 23, 2025 This amount of leverage, combined with such a big collateral commitment, shows an exceptionally high level of belief in the near-term price action of Ethereum. If ETH holds here or moves higher, this whale could be looking at some huge profits. But this trade also says something else: It says that some very wealthy folks are not just speculating, but are putting big money behind the idea that ETH is more likely to go up than to go down in the next few months. ETF Inflows Reinforce Institutional Demand Even as whale movements command the spotlight, institutional investors are steadily upping their ante in Ethereum. On April 22, the net inflows for the Ethereum spot ETFs totaled a calm $38.74 million. Importantly, none of the nine Ethereum ETFs approved by regulators recorded outflows. If anything, these vehicle shows signs of steady interest—not even a hint of flow that could constitute so-called “rotational capital.” One could even go so far as to say that the light inflows and the on-the-books interest reconciles with a lack of headlines. Most piñatas in crypto just have more capital in them than they did a year or even six months ago. On April 22, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $936 million, net inflows for three consecutive days. Ethereum spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $38.74 million, with none of the nine ETFs registering net outflows. https://t.co/SF4brkl9iI — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 23, 2025 A metric that is important to watch is ETF flows. They generally reflect the long-term sentiment of more conservative investors like wealth managers and institutional allocators. When they are not pulling their assets out of ETFs, that is a sign that they are viewing a particular asset as something credible that can live in a long-term, diversified portfolio. Even more so, when we see ETF inflows during volatile market conditions, that should be taken as a positive sign from a technical analysis perspective. These developments also happen in the foreground of the increasing use of Ethereum in the real world, where it is being employed to tokenize assets, adopt enterprise blockchains, and in steadily growing applications of decentralized finance (DeFi). Institutional inflows and strong confidence among large investors (whales) are cutting against reduced supplies of Ether held on exchanges. These factors are converging to form a very bullish narrative indeed. Looking Ahead: Can ETH Break Through $2,000? With Ethereum trading just under the resistance level at $1,860, everyone’s attention is now focused on whether the current momentum can be maintained and drive ETH to the next target level, $2,000. This round-number goal isn’t just a mental game; it’s also a level that has held significant historical importance in the life of Ethereum, having served multiple times in prior cycles as both support and resistance. If bulls succeed in getting past that obstacle, the breakout could set off additional price discovery and bring back on the sidelines retail investors who have remained cautious during recent months of market volatility. Currently, it seems like Ethereum is back in the limelight. If the recent actions of institutional investors and whales are any indication, this rally might only be getting started.

Once thought to be lifeless, $OPAIUM has now, in a complete turnaround, gone from being obscure to having a market cap of $9.3 million within 24 hours. What started as a solitary, improbable $96,250 wager has evolved into a memecoin market study. And just when Ethereum’s next big experiment seemed all but finished, it came roaring back to life, with countless opportunities to cash in—for those who got in first. The $96K Gamble That Reanimated a Ghost Coin The drama started yesterday when a completely new wallet, flagged by Stalkchain’s Fresh Wallet Feed, made a bold move to purchase 21.4% of the total token supply of $OPAIUM. The total cost? Just under $100,000. That buy was aggressive enough to instantly make the nearly lifeless token come to life, giving it a market cap rocketing to $2.1 million in a matter of minutes. The price, however, could not maintain such a quick surge. With little liquidity and holders potentially looking to sell, the cap of $OPAIUM corrected fast, falling to $800,000 just hours later. The market moves in mysterious ways… Yesterday, we spotted a fresh wallet on Stalkchain’s Fresh Wallet Feed buying 21.4% of the total supply of $OPAIUM — a dead token — for $96.25K. That buy alone pumped the market cap to $2.1M, but it quickly dumped back down to $800K. Fast… pic.twitter.com/bwssVjrWTP — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 23, 2025 The rollercoaster was just starting. Even after such a sharp drop, momentum found its way back into this token. Opportunistic traders and even some revival play bots could not resist picking this one up. Thanks to those semi-dumb money bots and traders, $OPAIUM exploded again. Today, the price has reached a jaw-dropping virtual $9.3 million market cap for this token. The original purchaser, now with more than 20% of the supply, has seen their position explode to an estimated $1.8 million in unrealized gains. While their initial $96,000 buy sparked the pump, the market’s reaction has made the wallet a major force in the token’s ecosystem — for better or worse. Old Holders Wake Up… and Exit The other side of bringing a dead token back to life is having to deal with the apparitions of previous holders. When the price of $OPAIUM shot up, some early adopters — who were probably holding it since its original run — seized the moment to cash out and satisfy their return requirements. Statistics reveal that two dormant wallets, for example, were responsible for unloading a total of $91,400 in tokens as soon as the market cap hit $10 million. These sellers, thought to be inactive for months, suddenly surfaced to capitalize on the new liquidity provided by the fresh whale, a revival in the market. Actions like these, seen in the past, raise a classic problem with revivals: that while the new community may be enthusiastic, and a much better chance exists for a forthcoming bull run, the presence of old holders with large amounts of tokens can pretty much guarantee that the revival will be a fake-out. Even with all the selling, the whale’s haven’t moved their coins. They still hold over 20% of the supply, with no signs of distribution. And their paper profits are all the more reason to suspect them of earning for peace. The downside of reviving a dead token? Old holders waiting to dump on you. Since $OPAIUM pumped to a $10M mcap, over $91.4K has been sold by 2 old wallets. The wild part? The wallet that pumped it holds 20%+ of supply — and it’s still in profit. https://t.co/WKbfmiUR1g pic.twitter.com/qkScflUzfK — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 23, 2025 A New Era for $OPAIUM — Or Just a Flash in the Pan? Reviving $OPAIUM is a captivating story in today’s memecoin world, where the new token investors often treat pre-existing tokens as temporary playgrounds for enthusiastic money-making. What makes the $OPAIUM revival especially significant is that it illustrates, in a very real-world example, all the reasons why speculative plays of this sort can end badly. Those reasons are now about to be laid out. Currently, $OPAIUM enjoys the high it’s on from hype, speculation, and momentum. But can it keep that going? Well, it seems likely that whether it can keep that going will depend on three interrelated factors: 1. New buyers continuing to absorb supply. 2. Major wallet plays and what story they tell next. 3. Community engagement and the sort of meme or narrative traction the token can build. Right now, the buyer at $96K is still very much in the money. But with the whole market paying attention, the issue isn’t solely “how high can it go?” but also “how fast could it come down?” Regardless, $OPAIUM just put on a masterclass of memecoin disorder, where an old token, left for dead, suddenly became a million-dollar narrative.

The second-largest cryptocurrency finally broke through a critical price barrier that had constrained its advance for over a week. Related Reading: XRP Price Prognosis: Analyst Sees $14 In Spite Of Current Troubles Active Addresses Up By Almost 10% As per statistics from CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Alemán, Ethereum’s network experienced a notable increase in user activity between April 20 and April 22. Active addresses increased from approximately 306,000 to more than 336,000 within this three-day period, a rise of nearly 10 percent. The network is just “heating up”, according to Alemán.

Market analysts often consider such rises as possible early indicators of price movements, mostly when they coincide with price rise. Price Throttles Down To Major Resistance Keeping on with the struggle of breaking above $1,640 accomplished since April, the price of Ethereum finally surpassed this resistance area. Striking above $1,780, the coin has defeated the confinement left by an assertive green daily candle. For the first time in recent history, buyers appear to be taking center stage in the market. The price now reads as above both the 10-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating strength in the shorter-term. The relative strength index is just above its 50 line, exhibiting some bullish momentum without being close to the overbought zone. Technical Indicators Present Mixed Signals Some indicators show great momentum, although everything is not perfectly aligned. The moving average convergence/divergence starts synthetizing foreboding trend reversal early with slightly positive numbers. At the same time, the stochastic RSI approaches the upper limits of its range, which likely indicates short-term exhaustion unless more buyers come back soon. According to price forecasts, Ethereum will fall by 6.50% and hit $1,652 on May 24, 2025. Technical analysis indicates a bearish trend, while the Fear & Greed Index is at 64, which puts market sentiment in the “Greed” zone. In the last month, Ethereum had green days 40% of the time (12 out of 30 days) with price volatility at 9.26%, data from CoinCodex shows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rockets To Monthly Highs As Open Interest Explodes By Over $3 Billion Network Usage Remains Low Despite Price Movement One of the confounding things about Ethereum’s current state is the divergence between price action and real-world network usage. Transaction fees are still abnormally low at about $0.31 on average, based on YCharts data. Low fees indicate that on-chain demand is still lacking despite the network being inexpensive to use. In spite of this conflicting sign, the combination of increasing active addresses and ETH holding position above prior resistance levels has enhanced the short-term picture. Should present momentum continue, market strategists will be keeping a close eye to determine whether Ethereum can make a charge in the direction of the psychologically significant $2,000 price level.

The price of the token is up over 111% — despite being on the verge of getting cut from the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. The price rally comes following a near 20% slide right after the token was announced to be delisting — and it is a perfect example of the weirdness and resiliency often seen in the digital asset space. From Panic to Power: $ALPACA’s Wild Ride On April 24, 2025, Binance declared it would remove from its platform four particular tokens: Alpaca Finance ($ALPACA), PlayDapp ($PDA), Viberate ($VIB), and Wing Finance ($WING). Their removal was set for May 2. As usually happens when a token gets removed from the exchange, $ALPACA experienced an immediate and sharp reduction in price, plunging downward by 20% just within the first few hours after the announcement. Investors appeared to rush for the doors, liquidating what few holdings in the token that they had left. What came next took many by surprise. In less than a single hour, $ALPACA not only recouped earlier losses but also shot into a parabolic climb, gaining over 110%. Latest pricing data puts our token at approximately $0.0394, with a fully diluted market cap of some $10.9 million and a 24-hour trading volume of something over $79 million. $ALPACA moving like this is an example of two things. One, valuation and pricing patterns maintains the crypto system, for better or worse. Two, there’s a whole lot of money both moving through and not moving through the crypto system. What ignited this unlikely reversal? The Resilience of Alpaca Finance Alpaca Finance is a lending protocol in DeFi that runs on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It offers leveraged yield farming and does so in a very simple way. You put your funds into BSC yield farming, and you can also get a loan to invest more into the same yield farming. And then, with all of these funds, you’re putting them into yield farming, which is… well, it’s “degen stuff” — highly risky and hopefully highly profitable, too. In spite of the Binance delisting, which might have seriously affected its credibility and reach, Alpaca Finance appears to have profited from a combination of counterstrikes and goodwill in the marketplace. Where it has been able to, Alpaca has pushed back against its critics in a way that makes it seem responsive and responsible. The token recently got relisted on BitMart in August 2024. BitMart is now an alternate trading venue providing access to liquidity beyond Binance. There are now three distinct trading venues for trading the ALPACA token: 1. Binance 2. BitMart 3. Huobi Token. Moreover, the deflationary tokenomics of Alpaca play a key role in propping up its price. The platform does a weekly buyback and burn program wherein, as of January 2025, it has permanently removed from circulation over 34.6 million ALPACA tokens—roughly 18.4% of the total supply. This consistent reduction in supply creates price support when demand holds steady or surges, as it did during the panic and rebound post-delisting. Yet the most important point may be this: The rebound not only reflects the strength of the Alpaca Finance community but also throws into relief the truly wild and woolly character of the crypto markets. Instead of running for the hills, traders looked to Alpaca Finance and crypto’s other affected projects as places to put more of their not-so-hard-earned money, interpreting the crypto exchanges’ actions as an overreaction or seeing them as opportunities to buy quality assets at deep, deep discounts. Despite being delisted by Binance, $ALPACA defies the odds with a 111% rebound On April 24, @binance announced it will delist Alpaca Finance ( $ALPACA )、PlayDapp ( $PDA )、Viberate ( $VIB ) and Wing Finance ( $WING ) on May 2. $ALPACA initially dropped 20% on the news — but then… pic.twitter.com/Kx22kbfieY — Followin (@followin_io) April 24, 2025 Final Thoughts: A Cautionary Tale or a Comeback Story? Even though $ALPACA’s current rise is quite astonishing, we should not forget that the crypto markets can be so variable and driven by sentiment. One moment, a cryptocurrency can seem like it is absolutely doomed due to bad news; the next, it can be seen as the next big thing, bouncing back off the bottom like nobody’s business. That noted, investors should be careful. Being delisted, especially from a big exchange like Binance, is serious business. It can cause liquidity problems and reduced exposure that might last a long time. But, as Alpaca Finance just showed, getting delisted doesn’t necessarily mean a project is doomed. It’s yet to be determined whether the surge of $ALPACA is sustainable or merely a temporary shockwave. But for now, it stands as a defiant statement of survival — and an enthralling narrative of how fundamentals, community, and story can come together to confound market expectations.

The movement is worth about $60.99 million and has happened after more than three years of dormancy. Crypto analysts and traders are now speculating about the motive behind the transfer that involves such large amounts of money and what it might mean for the future of Uniswap’s token economy. The biggest transfer occurred from a wallet that got 9 million $UNI tokens during Uniswap’s token launch in September 2020. Then, $UNI was trading at just $3.44, which meant that this particular airdrop was valued at around $31 million. But fast forward to April 2025, and the value of those same tokens has nearly doubled. That’s a return on investment that a holder can really get behind. Three wallets linked to @Uniswap just deposited 10.21M $UNI ($60.99M) to #CoinbasePrime after 3.5+ years of dormancy. The largest deposit came from a wallet that received 9M $UNI from Uniswap in September 2020, when $UNI was $3.44 (valued at ~$31M). Follow @spotonchain and set… pic.twitter.com/nzobjAldyW — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) April 24, 2025 From Dormancy to Movement: Timing and Impact These deposits came from wallets that had sat unused for more than 1,270 days. Their sudden reactivation was intriguing. The sum was transferred to what has to be construed as a top-tier, access-controlled conversion space—Coinbase Prime. You don’t move this kind of money halfway unless you intend to do something big, like shift your overall crypto portfolio or cash out. At press time, none of the tokens had been sold, but the deposits were well-timed. Uniswap, arguably the most prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum, has enjoyed a recent surge in user activity. That’s reflected in a few on-chain metrics, too. So, what’s this recent wallet activity about? It’s possible these early depositors are becoming a bit more liquidity-friendly ahead of what they perceive as a likely uptick in their Layer 1 exchange’s user activity. It’s also possible these depositors are just unilaterally shoring up their near-term finances ahead of some market turbulence. Uniswap’s Growing Ecosystem: Protocol and L2 Expansion Why does this movement catch the eye? Because of the context in which it is occurring. Uniswap isn’t coasting on its legacy reputation; it is thriving. As one of the foundational dApps on the Ethereum mainnet, Uniswap has consistently pushed the boundaries of decentralized finance (DeFi). Now, with the advent of Unichain, its custom Layer 2 (L2) network, both the original protocol and its scaling solutions are experiencing explosive growth. Uniswap’s DEX operations on both Ethereum and Unichain are moving sharply and steeply upward. They are not merely moving in the upward direction; they are moving in the up-up direction. Moreover, the upward movement is truly powerful and makes a strong statement: Uniswap is showing clearly the markers of true user adoption and developer interest. As of April 2025, Uniswap has, in fact, processed a staggering $2.94 trillion in swap volume since its inception. To place that in a frame of reference, that number is higher than the GDP of an entire G7 nation—Canada—whose annual economic output currently hovers around $2.2 trillion. This milestone spotlights the scale of DeFi’s disruption of traditional finance, and it highlights Uniswap’s pivotal role as a leader in that space. Uniswap Protocol has now processed $2.94T in swap volume That's more than the GDP of Canada pic.twitter.com/TE32LSeO2U — Uniswap Labs (@Uniswap) April 23, 2025 What This Could Mean for $UNI The revival of hibernating whale wallets similarly sends shockwaves through the cryptocurrencies community, albeit in slow motion. Uniswap’s governance token, the $UNI token, may face some short-term price fluctuations as the market judges the likelihood of a sell-off. Even so, this emergence of whale wallets signals renewed interest in Uniswap’s long-term value proposition—no small thing in a market so often dominated by sentiment. The $UNI community is not only strongly supportive of decentralized principles but also clearly watches over the protocol as a subset of the community. The conversion of these whale addresses to governance or governance-alike active participation is tantamount to a potential serious shift in the Uniswap protocol’s direction, for good or ill. Final Thoughts In a crypto market that frequently gives the impression of being governed by short-term speculation and trend-chasing, the movement of long-dormant funds can feel like a tectonic shift. Sending $61 million in $UNI tokens to Coinbase Prime after 3.5 years of silence reminds us that all kinds of things may get unearthed in a blockchain’s past—like, say, a long-dormant fund. It is yet to be seen whether this shift is the start of a new strategy, a cash-out, or just a reallocation of assets. But one thing is certain: Uniswap, both the protocol and the token, remains a powerful player in the decentralized finance space. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

User activity has surged, and with it, a lot of on-chain metrics have turned, almost dramatically so in some cases, bullish. The network has seen a flood of stablecoin capital, and on top of that, it looks like we’re now building with Bitcoin (in a way that for the last cycle we seemed to build with Ethereum). The next wave of financial innovation isn’t just on the drawing board; it’s here and happening. With more than 10 million people involved in the Bitcoin blockchain every month, this digital code is no longer just a comparatively simple series of “if, then” instructions. It is a growing, dynamic part of an on-chain financial system that serves its users with an astonishing range of increasingly innovative digital services, all happening on the blockchain. And the numbers are backing it up. Stablecoins Set the Stage for Bitcoin’s DeFi Expansion The most significant force behind the evolution of Bitcoin’s on-chain operations is the swelling supply of stablecoins. The whole stablecoin ecosystem now stands at over $144 billion, with USDC by itself growing at a remarkable 38.6% annual rate since January. This is an influx of dollar-pegged money that is liquid and available in the ecosystem for anything that might happen on-chain. Stablecoins serve as the operational currency for DeFi, enabling everything from collateralized lending to cross-chain swaps that happen without hiccups. This liquidity infusion is especially timely for Bitcoin. It is helping to catalyze the emergence of on-chain derivatives markets and staking protocols built either directly or indirectly on BTC infrastructure. With more capital available, these protocols can offer better yields, deeper markets, and more attractive products for both institutional and retail users. And that’s precisely what’s beginning to occur. The Rise of Bitcoin On-Chain Derivatives and Re-Staking Protocols A trend that can hardly be overlooked is that of the rapid formation of protocols for derivatives of Bitcoin, whether they are native or BTC-backed. Re-staking—a mechanism for using bitcoins that sees them deposited into protocols in order to earn yield or participate in governance—is being posited as a next-generation financial product, one with which to profit in a bear market. Over the last year, deploying Bitcoin to this nascent financial space has involved sending across a total of 57,167 BTC. In the lead is Lombard Finance (@Lombard_Finance), which holds 40.6% of the market share and oversees 20,405 BTC in deposited assets. Nestled in its pristine position atop the pie chart, Lombard has established itself as the go-to venue both for depositing Bitcoin and for reaping the benefits of staking it. Nipping at the heels of the re-staking market is Solv Protocol (@SolvProtocol), with a 17.9% share. PumpBTC (@Pumpbtcxyz) is another to watch, as their meteoric rise to 5,948 BTC reflects surging interest from yield seekers and speculators. Still, the current 135,000 staking wallets signal extreme early-stage headroom. If we give that a 5x potential, we’re still being conservative. Staking in Bitcoin isn’t a distant possibility that could happen under some future set of circumstances. It’s a very real prospect with a lot of current momentum behind it. And it has the potential to really change the nature of Bitcoin. BTC on-chain momentum is real: 10M MAUs, $144B stablecoins, and booming yield protocols — OKX Ventures (@OKX_Ventures) April 23, 2025 Bitcoin’s Network Strength: Deep Liquidity, Real Decentralization What makes Bitcoin stand out in this ever-changing environment is how deep and decentralized its user base is. Over 60% of all BTC in circulation is held in small- to mid-sized wallets—specifically those holding less than 100 BTC or between 100 and 10,000 BTC. This distribution pattern is a hallmark of true decentralization, carrying with it none of the dangers that market dynamics dominated by whales cause in many small-cap cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the Bitcoin network’s security is greatly enhanced by the distribution of its UTXO sets. A diversified UTXO landscape lowers the odds of anything like a large-scale double-spend or a centralization of power happening within the Bitcoin network. In essence, if one poor soul wanted to pull off either of these stunts, the mostly random distribution of UTXOs and the many ways to accomplish apparently similar tasks oxygenate the network’s security and thus Bitcoin’s position as the most secure blockchain of all time. The structural merits of Bitcoin make it the asset preference for programmers constructing staking and derivatives applications. With a colossal global user base and trustworthiness in code, Bitcoin is positioned like no other asset to support the next iteration of decentralized finance. This is the place where yield, derivatives, and institution-grade on-chain services become the norm. Conclusion: A New Era for On-Chain Bitcoin Bitcoin is not merely a passive asset any longer, stored in cold storage. The network now has 10 million monthly users, underpinned by a $144 billion stablecoin foundation, and over 57,000 BTC have already been committed to re-staking protocols. With ongoing advancements in infrastructure and a growing number of users, Bitcoin stands to benefit from perhaps the most significant on-chain momentum in the next bull run. You may have thought of Bitcoin only as a digital version of gold. You might want to reprocess that thought, however; the real action is happening on-chain.

43772532,https://nulltx.com/?p=148212,1745550529,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Chainlink Under the Radar: $36M in $LINK Quietly Accumulated by New Wallets,https://nulltx.com/chainlink-under-the-radar-36m-in-link-quietly-accumulated-by-new-wallets/,"One of the most crucial infrastructure projects in crypto, Chainlink , is now at the center of a new kind of on-chain pattern that is developing. This past week, blockchain analysts noted that a fresh wave of accumulation by unknown actors appears to be anything but random. Some 15 freshly created wallets—new to on-chain activity and previously inactive—have pulled 2.52 million $LINK tokens from Binance in the past week. At current prices, that represents a not-so-quiet transfer of $36.43 million off one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. This is not your standard whale shuffle or portfolio rebalance. These wallets had formed no previous transactions and seem to have been made just to buy and then take out $LINK. The observers in the crypto world kind of watch this behavior and expect a major catalyst or an insider-led move to follow. Accumulation Patterns Hint at High Conviction When seasoned investors or institutions gather assets, they usually do so in a way that attracts as little notice as possible—by typically setting up fresh wallets, for instance, and using them to distribute holdings across several days, different exchanges, and, if need be, different types of transaction. The 15 wallets we’re looking at here do just that—and do it very well. They took a substantial amount of $LINK from Binance, but not in a way that sent up any price signals. If the price didn’t move, though, how did they manage to take a big chunk of $LINK out of a big exchange? Is Something Huge Brewing in $LINK ? 15 Fresh Wallets Say Yes — But DYOR In just the past week, we’ve tracked something unusual — 15 fresh wallets have been accumulating $LINK from Binance, withdrawing a total of 2.52 million $LINK (~$36.43 million). pic.twitter.com/ZRKT0Ldstq — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) April 24, 2025 Methodical accumulation of this sort usually indicates something beyond just a bull market mood. It reveals what is often a strong conviction, possibly by insiders, early backers, or institutional investors, about the imminent potential of an event (or a series of events) they’re expecting to happen soon. Or it reveals a strong belief in the long-term worth of Chainlink’s technology. You don’t see this kind of accumulation happening by chance. In the past, this kind of wallet activity has come just before big announcements, partnerships, or upgrades in the crypto world. Now, we can only speculate, but thinking about on-chain whispers as something that’s almost always been associated with major Chainlink activity, it seems that we’re on the verge of something kind of significant. Why Chainlink? Why Now? Chainlink has been considered for a long time to be such a foundational layer in the blockchain space that it now seems to truly embody the concept of a blockchain primitive. That is not to say that Chainlink has no competition. It does, notably from the decentralized oracle network Numerai and private company Band Protocol. But Chainlink now seems to be the go-to oracle solution for many teams wanting to connect their smart contracts to off-chain (or real-world) data. What makes the ongoing accumulation wave all the more interesting is the general context enveloping the Chainlink ecosystem. This recent accumulation has, in fact, been happening in a far wider context that should not be overlooked. In recent months, Chainlink has itself been very active within the crypto space. It has been associated with the development of what is called the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which aims to connect disparate blockchains in a way that really does power a unified Web3 ecosystem. At the same time, enterprises and other institutions have been investigating the whole idea of real-world asset tokenization. They’re trying to figure out how they can use smart contracts and other tools in the crypto space to do that in a way that’s somehow better than what they’ve done before. And Chainlink, by virtue of its position, is very well placed to play a big role in all of that. Also, discussions about Chainlink staking updates and greater integration with enterprise blockchains have analysts buzzing. If a big announcement or product rollout is just around the corner, it would explain why such well-heeled entities are seeming to position themselves in advance. Reading the On-Chain Signals One of the clearest forms of market intelligence to come out of crypto is the on-chain data itself. In stark contrast to traditional finance, where one has to hunt for telltale signs buried in quarterly reports or sometimes-even-forensic approaches to piecing together the live drama of economic agents, cryptocurrencies are a realm of constant, loud, and gloriously public movement. That makes it something of a spectator sport for anyone who wishes to understand the real-time pay-for-play antics of the market participants. Moving $36 million in $LINK to new wallets doesn’t promise price action or a bullish catalyst. But it does hint that some big players are making moves based on private knowledge or strong belief that’s not yet reflected in the public market. And what are these alleged actors up to? Could be anything from a protocol upgrade to a new partnership, or even a crypto-wide bull shift. Accumulating $LINK in such a manner is the type of signal that experienced traders pay close attention to. Conclusion: A Storm Brewing? Linking chains has always been of utmost importance for the Web3 infrastructure. The recent actions on the chain could be a delicate prelude for the next major movement of Chainlink. With 15 wallets freshly in Tow, 2.5 million Link tokens have been purposefully and significantly amassed far away from Binance. Though the precise motive is still murky, Chainlink has once again captured investor interest. What could this mean? It could mean that a major rally is in the works. It could mean that there is some significant strategic shift going on with the company. Or it could even mean that some early market players are just positioning themselves ahead of making Link more mainstream. In any case, we’re watching too, because in the world of crypto, quiet wallet movements often speak louder than tweets. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43772587,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152605,1745550617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive Growth: Deloitte Tokenization Forecasts $4 Trillion Tokenized Real Estate Boom,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/deloitte-tokenized-real-estate/,"Are you plugged into the future of finance and investment? If you’re exploring the potential of digital assets beyond cryptocurrencies, the latest forecast from Deloitte offers a glimpse into a truly transformative market: tokenized real estate . A new report from the Deloitte Center for Financial Services paints an incredibly bullish picture for this emerging sector. They project the global tokenized real estate market could explode from its current size of under $300 billion to a staggering $4 trillion by 2035. That’s exponential growth that demands attention from investors, developers, and financial institutions alike. What’s Driving the Real Estate Tokenization Boom? This massive projected growth isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s grounded in the increasing adoption of blockchain technology across various facets of the real estate industry. Deloitte’s analysis points to several key drivers: Blockchain for Loans: Streamlining mortgage processes, making financing faster and potentially cheaper. Blockchain for Funds: Enabling fractional ownership and easier management of real estate investment funds. Blockchain for Land Ownership: Creating immutable digital records of property titles, reducing fraud and simplifying transfers. Within this growing market, tokenized debt is expected to lead the charge, potentially reaching $2.39 trillion by 2035. This highlights the significant opportunity for increasing liquidity and access in real estate financing through digital tokens. Why Should You Care About Tokenized Real Estate? The move towards real estate tokenization isn’t just a technical shift; it brings tangible benefits that could democratize access to property investment and improve market efficiency: Faster Settlements: Reducing the lengthy traditional real estate transaction times from weeks or months to potentially days or hours. Lower Costs: Cutting down on intermediaries, paperwork, and associated fees. Broader Investor Access: Enabling fractional ownership means investors can buy small pieces (tokens) of high-value properties, making real estate investment accessible to a much wider audience, including those interested in crypto real estate investment . Increased Liquidity: Tokens can be traded on secondary markets more easily than traditional property shares, making it simpler for investors to enter and exit positions. These benefits align perfectly with the core value propositions of blockchain technology – transparency, efficiency, and accessibility. What Hurdles Does Blockchain Real Estate Still Face? While the Deloitte tokenization forecast is exciting, the report also prudently highlights significant challenges that need to be addressed for this vision to become a reality: Regulatory Clarity: The legal framework around digital assets and tokenized securities is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Clear regulations are crucial for investor protection and market stability. Asset Custody: Securely storing and managing the digital tokens that represent physical real estate assets requires robust infrastructure and trusted custodians. Cybersecurity: As with any digital system, the risk of hacks and cyber threats is a constant concern. Protecting tokenized assets and underlying data is paramount. Valuation Standards: Developing standardized and widely accepted methods for valuing tokenized real estate assets is essential for market confidence. Interoperability: Ensuring different blockchain platforms and tokenization standards can interact seamlessly will be key for a truly global market. Overcoming these hurdles will require collaboration between technologists, regulators, financial institutions, and real estate professionals. The Road Ahead for Tokenized Real Estate The journey from under $300 billion to $4 trillion is ambitious and will require significant infrastructure development, regulatory progress, and market education. However, the potential rewards – a more liquid, accessible, and efficient real estate market – are immense. This forecast reinforces the growing convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology. As more real-world assets are brought onto the blockchain, opportunities for investors seeking diversification and new asset classes, including crypto real estate investment , will expand significantly. Deloitte’s report serves as a powerful indicator of the direction the market is heading. While challenges remain, the trajectory towards a tokenized future for real estate appears increasingly clear. Summary: Deloitte’s latest report projects the tokenized real estate market could reach $4 trillion by 2035, a massive leap from its current size. This growth is fueled by the adoption of blockchain for loans, funds, and ownership, offering benefits like faster settlements, lower costs, and broader investor access through fractional ownership. Despite significant potential, challenges such as regulatory uncertainty, asset custody, and cybersecurity must be overcome for widespread adoption. The forecast underscores the transformative potential of tokenization in revolutionizing real estate investment and finance.

43772592,https://nulltx.com/?p=148213,1745550681,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,TRON Hits Major Milestone as USDT Supply Surpasses $70 Billion on Network,https://nulltx.com/tron-hits-major-milestone-as-usdt-supply-surpasses-70-billion-on-network/,"A remarkable accomplishment for the TRON ecosystem is that the total supply of Tether (USDT) now circulating on the network has exceeded $70 billion. This development emphasizes and strengthens TRON’s status as a key blockchain stablecoin platform and infrastructure that is low-cost, efficient, and offers reliable scalability. The most recent increase in USDT supply came when Tether minted yet another 1 billion tokens on the TRON blockchain. With this latest minting, TRON now carries the bulk of USDT circulating around the crypto ecosystem, besting other networks like Ethereum and BNB Chain in both usage and volume. This is a clear signal of TRON’s rising favor among USDT users, particularly in places where the traditional financial system is either ineffectual or nonexistent. The founder of TRON, Justin Sun, has long held the belief that the network can be a global, digital payment solution, as well as serving for the global storage of value. In past comments, Sun has stressed that the USDT on TRON—and, by extension, the network itself—provides an alternative to the traditional, “rails” payment system that is used by the world today; it does this, he says, in a way that is faster, cheaper, and far more reliable (and stable in terms of the value of the digital payment itself) than traditional digital payment systems that we are today all too familiar with. Milestone for @trondao Ecosystem | USDT Supply Surpasses $70 Billion! Today, @Tether_to issued another 1 billion USDT on the TRON Network, the total circulating supply of USDT on TRON has officially reached the 70 billion USD mark! TRON is reshaping global capital… pic.twitter.com/Ho9eLcwDF7 — TokenPocket (@TokenPocket_TP) April 23, 2025 Powering Global Payments and Liquidity Essentially, the attraction of USDT on TRON boils down to its usefulness. The TRON network not only processes transactions at lightning speed, but it also does so with almost no fees, rendering it suitable for both high-volume institutional users and individual remittance payments. In places such as Southeast Asia, Latin America, and parts of Africa, USDT on TRON has become a top choice for sending money across borders, for trading in a peer-to-peer fashion, and even for daily transaction-type activities. TRON’s infrastructure is becoming an alternative to traditional financial systems as global demand for dollar-backed digital assets rises. “Whether it’s for merchants looking to bypass currency volatility or for individuals sending money to family abroad, the combination of Tether’s stability and TRON’s transaction efficiency is reshaping how money moves across borders.” This is how we get paid in the future. TRON is not just conquering the stablecoin world with speed and low fees; it is also winning because of its scalability. DeFi, GameFi, and other Web3 applications are scaling globally. When developers choose where to build these applications, they are turning to TRON with increasing frequency , using it to construct fast and low-cost applications that require stable, valuable mechanisms of settlement. A Watchful Eye: Tether Freezes Suspicious Funds Even though TRON has achieved great success with USDT, the ecosystem is drawing some concern. A recent alert from MistTrack indicates that Tether has now frozen about $28.67 million worth of USDT across 12 addresses that reside on the TRON blockchain. That said, Tether isn’t just freezing USDT on TRON; MistTrack also claims that around $99,630 in USDT has been frozen on an Ethereum address. MistTrack Alert: @Tether has frozen ~$28.67M $USDT across 12 addresses on TRON, and ~$99.63K $USDT on one Ethereum address: #TRON TUPyHqY2jbcF5Q2rCmTQWBtVo84oMpLm2f TESCDkZbKWuJtuFPRSjczChuV14XHMMbMA TXLuEUEV1bNoQ1k59i9uun3XUmRjTZNXwh TS2T38JTaA8qHwnANH5H1ASUQ1RvwKzZxy… pic.twitter.com/LLPO0xcOvi — MistTrack (@MistTrack_io) April 24, 2025 These frozen addresses were reportedly engaged in dubious or unlawful activities, which underscores Tether’s and blockchain forensic teams’ attempts to keep the stablecoin ecosystem neat and tidy. This isn’t the first time Tether has busted out the emergency freeze button, though. The company has previously interceded to halt addresses linked to the scams, money laundering, and other unlawful acts. These preemptive steps send a clear signal that accountability and compliance can coexist with innovation—yes, even in decentralized environments. Tether has remained in close contact with compliance teams, law enforcement agencies, and the analytics platform MistTrack, to name just a few. The company is clearly working toward a sensible balance between user freedom and security. TRON’s Ecosystem Outlook More than simply being a number, exceeding $70 billion in USDT supply is a manifestation of how much influence TRON has attained in the global crypto economy. It has millions of users; its developer activity is on the rise; and its DeFi ecosystem is booming. All the same, TRON seems increasingly positioned as a go-to network, not just for the crypto world, but for the real economy and for large-scale digital payments. The increasing existence of stablecoins on TRON also indicates a future where financial infrastructure can be decentralized, yet accessible and compliant. We are now in an era where regulators are starting to pay much closer attention to the stablecoin space, and Tether itself actually could not have picked a better place to be issued from, as TRON is a high-performance settlement layer. TRON seems to be on an upward path, with its continued innovations, strategic partnerships, and user growth. The USDT has crossed the $70 billion milestone, but it may be just the beginning of a far larger and more profound movement toward digital finance that is borderless, stable, and efficient in terms of costs.

43772688,https://nulltx.com/?p=148214,1745550797,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Base Network Soars Despite Market Challenges: Leading L2 with 1 Million Active Addresses and $6.3B TVL,https://nulltx.com/base-network-soars-despite-market-challenges-leading-l2-with-1-million-active-addresses-and-6-3b-tvl/,"In spite of a broader unfavorable market, the Base network seems to have found a space of freedom in which it can grow and be adopted. Using its technical attributes (mostly stemming from being an Ethereum L2), Base appears to have a foothold in the market and has even captured a nice amount of market share since its launch last year. That is, if it has captured any market share, it is quite a lot for an L2 in an unfavorable market, and it is doing this while remaining somewhere near the top among not just L2s but new projects in the Ethereum ecosystem. IntoTheBlock’s data shows Base’s proportion of active addresses compared to other Layer-2 blockchain solutions. And they’re good numbers. Base now has 82.3% of its total active address count compared to the other Layer-2 solutions. And that count is up from 63% in October when the last clear read was available. Base itself has grown in total active addresses as well, and daily active addresses on Base rocket passed 1 million earlier this week. Moreover, Base’s daily activities have reached unprecedented levels, averaging over 4 million transactions per day. This is a visible and demonstrable sign that the infrastructure of Base is not only scalable but is smoothly and efficiently handling the growing amount of activity. These figures are not only an indication of how solid Base is but also how well it can scale and adapt to its ever-growing user base while powering decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi projects, and other blockchain-based innovations. A New Era of On-Chain Activity and Innovation Base is increasing in adoption because it is committed to innovation. Recently, it introduced Basenames, a new feature that has spurred on-chain activity and engagement, and is solidifying Base’s leadership position. Basenames is expected to create a new opportunity for users and developers on the network and is adding even more customization than before for decentralized applications. Basenames is the first feature of its kind in web3 and has the potential to open up entirely new branding and user experience opportunities across the decentralized web. Such features are important. And in a cutthroat competition among the countless Layer-2 contenders where Base is even a participant, the ability to mount features that engage users and drive new usage is a critical point of differentiation. Many Ethereum Layer-2 networks offer similar scalability and lower transaction costs. But when it comes to consistently delivering engaging new features, Base leaves the other Layer-2 solutions behind. These features provide new ways for developers to engage with the blockchain, which ultimately means that end users get enhanced experiences and better applications. For users, these upgrades to the Base blockchain mean increased functionality and modern usability. Combined together, these factors have led a number of users to convert to using Base. The Rise of Base’s Total Value Locked (TVL) Besides boasting an impressive active address count and daily transaction count, Base’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has soared past $6.3 billion, further accentuating the network’s burgeoning dominance in the Ethereum scaling ecosystem. TVL is a vital metric in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world as it amounts to the total assets that are staked or invested in DeFi protocols. The higher the TVL, the better in terms of trust, liquidity, and a healthy ecosystem. Activity on @base remains strong , even with market headwinds. According to @intotheblock , Base’s share of active addresses Among top L2s has jumped from 63% in January to 82% today. The network also passed 1 million daily active addresses, With daily transactions topping… pic.twitter.com/GlDue0Tlnf — Pinnacle Crypt ₿ (Enchanter-arc) (@PinnacleCrypt) April 23, 2025 Reaching a total value locked of more than $6.3 billion reflects growing trust in Base. The network’s DeFi capabilities are what attract liquidity from both retail and institutional investors. Base has become the go-to network for DeFi projects that mostly need two things: speed and low costs. Certainly, operating on Ethereum comes with certain scale challenges. But right now, Base seems one of the safest bets for trying to develop an efficient and effective Ethereum DeFi project. The increase in TVL doesn’t merely reflect the strength of the network but also highlights its increasing influence within the larger DeFi world. More and more, DeFi users are gravitating toward Layer 2 solutions as a way to experience engaging with the Ethereum network without the high gas fees and slow transaction speeds that the base layer has increasingly been suffering from. Base has filled that gap, serving as a Layer 2 solution that addresses Ethereum’s main problem of scalability. Base: The L2 Leader of Tomorrow Base is clearly positioned to lead the way among Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, as shown by its fast growth in several key metrics: – Active addresses: The number of unique addresses using the Base network has grown rapidly to over 1 million this month. – Transaction volume: The volume of transactions happening on Base has also increased. That’s largely a factor of all the new users who are starting to use the network, but the amount hasn’t slowed down either. – Total value locked: The volume and value of what’s being used on Base has also risen sharply. In fact, the over 5 million in value added on just this past Tuesday (March 7) might be a record amount for Layer-2 systems in a single day. Base’s rise represents a new chapter in the Ethereum ecosystem. L2 solutions such as Base are becoming vital in powering the next generation of decentralized applications and in giving the current generation a long-overdue performance boost. As users and developers rush to Base for its efficiency, scalability, and low costs, the network is poised to maintain its leadership position and to further its solidification in the future of blockchain infrastructure. With fresh on-chain activity driven by innovative features like Basenames and a going-star-up TVL, Base is undeniably leading the L2 space. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43772786,https://nulltx.com/?p=148215,1745551004,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Oxpya Origin Token Compromised in Major Hack, $OXYZ Value Drops 86% Amid Ongoing Investigation",https://nulltx.com/oxpya-origin-token-compromised-in-major-hack-oxyz-value-drops-86-amid-ongoing-investigation/,"A major security failure has rocked the Ethereum network. The $OXYZ token, part of the Oxya Origin project, has been targeted by a hacker who compromised the project’s deployer wallet. In an apparent coordinated attack, the bad actor was able to mint billions of $OXYZ tokens, which have seen a rapid and dramatic decline in the price. Since the incident, $OXYZ value has decreased 86%, and the breach is now under intense scrutiny. The Incident: Attackers Mint Billions of $OXYZ Tokens The initial flag for the hack was from the Cyver Alert system. It detected an abnormal transaction pattern involving Oxya Origin on the Ethereum blockchain. The alert explained that the deployer wallet for Oxya Origin—which has admin control over the $OXYZ token—had been compromised. Because of this breach, the attacker was then able to transfer ownership of the token to some address that we can only assume was controlled by the attacker. Now, the attacker has minting rights over the $OXYZ token. From what seems to be a well-coordinated assault, the hacker minted an unbelievable 9 billion $OXYZ tokens, a move that crushed the market with an oversupply of the asset that was already just a few steps away from being deemed “toxic” by analysts. To convert those stolen tokens into something that could work as “money,” the attacker quickly carried out a series of swaps that netted them about $45,000 in more stable assets before doing an ostensibly more legal-seeming bridge to another blockchain using the Stargate protocol. Because of the minting and immediate liquidation of such a large number of tokens, the price of $OXYZ dropped nearly 86%, catching investors and traders off guard. After that, the hacker did not stop there. Minting the tokens was just the first step. The next move was to transfer the remaining 8.9 billion $OXYZ to a different address, and it looks like the hacker might be holding onto these funds for the time being. A Public Plea and Final Warning to the Attacker The Oxya Origin team has stated that a breach has occurred and has confirmed that it was compromised. The team is working to mitigate the damage and has put out a public statement asking that the funds taken during the breach be returned. The project’s leadership is offering the hacker a final opportunity to return the funds, with a very generous white-hat bounty incentive. If the funds are returned in full, the attacker is allowed to keep 10% of the amount stolen during the breach. The team offers a white-hat bounty with a clear condition attached—you must return 90% of the stolen funds immediately. They send the hacker a simple message: return the majority of the funds and walk away with a reward, or face the consequences of your actions. ALERT Our system has identified a suspicious transaction involving @OxyaOrigin on the #Ethereum network. Root Cause: The Oxya Origin deployer wallet appears to have been compromised, resulting in the ownership of the $OXYZ token being transferred to a suspicious address.… https://t.co/dlAmQtn5qM — Cyvers Alerts (@CyversAlerts) April 23, 2025 If the attacker does not comply, the Oxya Origin team has vowed to do all that’s necessary to track down the attacker’s identity and to recover the stolen funds. The means they’ll use include blockchain forensic experts, legal action in several jurisdictions, and reporting the incident to exchanges and authorities who can help serve the hacker with justice. Legal and Forensic Action on the Horizon Concerns have been raised about the security of smart contract deployer wallets and the broader ecosystem’s vulnerability to these kinds of attacks, thanks to a recent breach. The Oxya Origin team is now working with blockchain forensic experts to track the stolen assets and possibly identify the hacker based on the transactions made on the blockchain. The complexity of tracing the funds makes clear the severity of the attack and the motivation behind it. Legal teams are involved in several places because the hack affected various platforms, and they have had to work both together and separately to figure out where the stolen assets were moved. In the end, Oxya’s team pretended to embrace forgiveness while also allowing for the possibility of employing a legal recovery strategy that could leverage any number of laws covering hacking and fraud. Furthermore, the project is informing the pertinent exchanges and authorities about the incident. This is a crucial move to prevent the wrongdoer from covering up the theft or from using the pilfered crypto to trade assets via any crypto platforms. The whole thing amounts to a “serious” event with a “determined” undertaking to resolve it. The Future of Oxya Origin and $OXYZ The hack has had a major effect on the value of the $OXYZ token and on how confident investors feel about it. Yet even as the Oxya Origin project was geing hacked, the team was clearly working hard to solve the problem for their community. And when we look at this problem-solving in a positive light, the hacks may in fact be doing the team a favor: highlighting them, forcing them to work harder on guaranteeing the integrity of their platform. Still, the blow to the value of the $OXYZ token is more likely to take a while to heal, even with the promising prospect of the stolen funds being returned. The market’s confidence in the project seems largely tied to how effectively the team can manage the aftermath of the attack, restore control over the $OXYZ token, and, a big ‘if’ here, prevent future security breaches. Currently, the crypto community is watching Oxya Origin as the group strives to capture the hacker and get back the taken assets. The case’s end will almost certainly have permanent effects on how securely online (and decentralized) projects can operate—and on how swiftly and efficiently blockchain-based teams can respond to a major incursion.

43772828,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152610,1745551213,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial US Crypto Market Structure Bill Nears Finalization,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-crypto-market-bill/,"Big news is brewing in Washington D.C. for the crypto world! The draft of the crypto market structure bill in the U.S. House of Representatives is reportedly nearing its final stages. This development signals a potentially significant step towards clearer US crypto regulation . According to sources cited by Blockworks, the House’s draft bill, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets, is expected to be released publicly later this month. This aligns with a stated goal by President Donald Trump to see both stablecoin legislation and this broader market structure bill passed by the end of summer. Why is a US Crypto Market Structure Bill Important? For years, the cryptocurrency industry in the United States has grappled with regulatory uncertainty. Different government agencies have asserted jurisdiction over various aspects of digital assets, leading to confusion and hindering innovation. A comprehensive digital asset regulation bill could provide much-needed clarity by: Defining what constitutes a cryptocurrency, a security, or a commodity. Specifying which regulatory body (like the SEC or CFTC) oversees different types of digital assets and activities. Establishing rules for exchanges, brokers, and other market participants. Providing guidelines for consumer protection and market integrity. Passing this crypto legislation is seen by many as essential for fostering growth and adoption within the U.S. while mitigating risks. What Could This US House Bill Include? While the final text remains under wraps, discussions around potential elements of the US House bill have circulated. Key areas likely addressed include: Agency Jurisdiction: A central debate revolves around whether the SEC or CFTC should primarily regulate the spot market for crypto assets deemed commodities. The bill might attempt to draw clear lines. Token Classification: Providing a framework or test for determining whether a digital asset is a security or not, potentially offering a path for tokens to transition from securities to commodities. Market Participant Rules: Requirements for crypto exchanges, custodians, and other intermediaries regarding registration, capital requirements, and customer asset segregation. Interagency Coordination: Mandating better cooperation between regulatory bodies to create a more unified approach to digital asset regulation . The fact that the crypto market structure bill is reaching its final draft stage suggests lawmakers are pushing forward to create a more defined landscape for digital assets. Challenges and Opportunities for US Crypto Regulation Creating effective US crypto regulation is complex. On one hand, the industry seeks rules that promote innovation and protect consumers without stifling growth. On the other, regulators aim to prevent fraud, ensure market stability, and maintain financial system integrity. Potential Opportunities: Increased institutional investment due to regulatory certainty. Greater clarity for businesses building on blockchain technology. Enhanced consumer confidence and protection. Potential Challenges: Risk of overly burdensome rules that push innovation offshore. Disagreements between political parties and agencies on the best approach. Ensuring the rules are flexible enough for a rapidly evolving technology. The final form of this crypto legislation will heavily influence these outcomes. What’s Next for the Crypto Market Structure Bill? With the draft reportedly in its final stages, the next step is its public release. This will be followed by committee markups, debates, and potential votes in the House. If it passes the House, it would then need to navigate the Senate, where similar but potentially different proposals exist. The path to becoming law is challenging and requires significant political will and compromise. The progress on this US House bill , coupled with efforts on stablecoin legislation, indicates a serious intent in Congress to address the regulatory void surrounding digital assets. Stakeholders across the crypto ecosystem are keenly watching, hoping this leads to a framework that supports a healthy and thriving digital economy in the U.S. Conclusion: A Step Towards Clarity The news that the crypto market structure bill draft is in its final stages is a significant development for the future of US crypto regulation . While challenges remain and the legislative process is long, this movement in the US House bill represents a concrete effort to bring clarity and structure to the digital asset space. The details within this upcoming crypto legislation will be critical, shaping everything from how digital assets are classified to how businesses operate and how consumers are protected. As the summer progresses, the crypto community will be watching closely to see if this push for digital asset regulation results in meaningful legislative action.

43772882,https://nulltx.com/?p=148216,1745551227,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Solana’s Remarkable Comeback: DeFi and Meme Coins Drive Growth as SOL Hits $140,https://nulltx.com/solanas-remarkable-comeback-defi-and-meme-coins-drive-growth-as-sol-hits-140/,"Solana (SOL) has had an impressive week, experiencing a remarkable rebound and solidifying its position as one of the strongest performers in the crypto market. After dipping below $100 earlier this year, SOL has surged to $140—a 6% increase this week. This comeback coincides with the network enjoying robust growth across some key metrics, especially in decentralized finance (DeFi) and meme tokens. With a market cap of $72.15 billion, Solana yet again is making headlines, seemingly leaving behind other top-tier cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). A Surge in Activity and Institutional Interest Not just its price performance but also its key network metrics reflect Solana’s resurgence. The Total Value Locked (TVL) on Solana has jumped a staggering 28%, hitting $8.9 billion. This growth suggests that Solana’s DeFi ecosystem is not just alive but also thriving, with way more capital deployed across its dApps. And why not? For traders and developers, Solana is a special network in the sense that its ability to scale efficiently allows for high-speed and low-cost transactions, which are really the essentials of the DeFi ecosystem. There is an active address increase too, a vital sign for any blockchain ecosystem. At the close of Q3, Solana had 4.5 million active addresses. That was up 12.5 percent from the previous quarter. In other words, a growing user base is trading and providing liquidity on Solana’s decentralized exchange. Solana stands as one of the prime performers in the crypto market. When we look at the performance of its immediate rivals, Bitcoin has barely managed to gain 3% over the past week; Ethereum has remained locked in a seemingly interminable range; XRP has plummeted; and yet, Solana has done this: Institutional Adoption and Financial Growth Interest from institutions in Solana has skyrocketed, with large entities like ARK Invest making serious moves. ARK Invest added the 3iQ Solana Staking ETF to its ARKW and ARKF funds, a sign that institutional confidence in the network is growing. Inclusion of Solana in these funds is just another marker in the increasingly lined path of that network to being treated as a legitimate investment asset. Its staking capabilities might be offering higher returns than a lot of things. Along with ARK Invest, Upexi, a tech and e-commerce firm, has expressed plans to build a Solana treasury. Backed by global trading firm GSR, Upexi hopes to construct a $100 million treasury on the Solana blockchain. Stocks surged 600% following this announcement, and people took notice. Upexi, a small e-commerce and tech company, was attempting to do something not many e-commerce and tech companies had tried: issuing a treasury on a blockchain in a major way. When it comes to the amount of value in tokens that are currently being staked, Solana has now, for the first time ever, surpassed Ethereum and is sitting at a staked amount of $54 billion. Performance Metrics and Ecosystem Growth Solana has done even better than Ethereum in bringing in revenue for the first quarter of 2025. Solana brought in $369.5 million in Q1, easily surpassing Ethereum’s $220.8 million and representing a 163% year-over-year increase. The network seems able to scale and bring in substantial revenue, which is necessary for funding ecosystem development. This call-to-arms developer effort seems to be bearing fruit, as it has attracted investment. Why this matters isn’t immediately obvious, but funding development of the ecosystem is crucial. Week in Solana: DeFi TVL and Meme Coins Soar as SOL Hits $140.. $120M bridged to network! SOL outearns ETH in Q1! ARK Invest adds staked SOL! Let's explore Solana's remarkable comeback 1/6 pic.twitter.com/1ddZuDQQxr — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) April 23, 2025 One of the metrics that really sets Solana apart is its daily application revenue, which has reached a spectacular $5 million, easily eclipsing Ethereum’s $1.07 million. This burgeoning revenue stream is a direct reflection of Solana’s ecosystem demand and, in particular, its deep penetration in the DeFi space. But it’s not just DeFi. Solana is increasingly popular with a wider variety of decentralized applications (dApps) of all kinds. Moreover, Solana has witnessed more than $120 million transferred to its network, with 35% of those funds stemming from Ethereum users. This transfer of assets denotes that Ethereum users are seeking to take advantage of Solana’s lower fees and to utilize its faster-timed transactions comped to transfers made directly on the Ethereum blockchain. Solana is surely becoming the platform of choice for these kinds of users. Meme Coins and Ecosystem Momentum Solana’s ecosystem is also benefiting from the rise of meme coins , which have become a strikingly visible part of the broader cryptocurrency market. Tokens like MOTHER (+37%), BOBAOPPA (+28%), and MYRO (+23%) have posted notable price increases on Solana, making them some of the hottest speculative assets on the network. And what do all those pumping prices for new Solana meme coins translate to? Much more on-chain activity and community engagement on the Solana network. So in a bull market where Solana is already one of the favored networks, you have a new layer of activity on top, courtesy of crypto’s most ridiculous tokens. The sector of decentralized physical infrastructure networks on Solana is becoming quite active, with Nosana (+28%) at the forefront. The DePIN projects, which are concerned with infrastructure that can exist independently of centralized entities, are growing in number and seem to offer another reason for the excitement surrounding the Solana ecosystem. When it comes to scalability and infrastructure, Coinbase has laid out plans to scale Solana’s infrastructure by five times. This proclamation, in and of itself, helps firmly establish Solana as a key player in the blockchain space. It states, in not so many words, that Solana needs to be a key player—in part, because every key player must have a solid infrastructure—if the network of decentralized applications built on Solana is to have a shot at decent odds in the sorts of banking and fintech uses for which they are intended. Solana’s Future Outlook Solana keeps surging in value and activity and clearly is one well-positioned blockchain network for the future. It has seen the adoption of big institutions, a skyrocketing total value locked, and a possible (and probable) ecosystem of DeFi applications, meme coins, and infrastructure projects. In all these ways and more, Solana remains a totally open and public network, with the ability to outperform some other top cryptocurrencies in key metrics. Those metrics include revenue generation, transaction volume, and the apparent interest of big entities in actually using the network. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Blockchain analytics indicate that these large holders are now in nearly flawless accumulation mode, with a score that hovers around 0.9. This metric suggests they are actively adding to their positions and not engaging in distribution, a historically bullish signal associated with a move in Bitcoin’s price to the upside. Just behind the whales are wallets containing between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC that also show strong accumulation behavior with a reading around 0.7. Even the next tier down, mid-sized wallets—those holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC—are now predominantly in accumulation mode, posting a score of around 0.5. All together, these trends indicate that accumulation is a broad-based phenomenon across several tiers of Bitcoin investors. #Bitcoin Whales are back in full force: Holders of >10K $BTC are showing near-perfect accumulation (~0.9) 1K–10K $BTC wallets follow closely (~0.7) 100–1K $BTC are also pivoting to accumulation (~0.5). So far, large players have been buying into this rally. pic.twitter.com/foKkBmMwOX — glassnode (@glassnode) April 24, 2025 Fewer Coins on Exchanges Signals Reduced Selling Pressure The positive outlook is further reinforced by a large drop in the number of addresses sending Bitcoin to exchanges. This is a critical metric because it often correlates with investors’ intent to sell or trade their holdings. As of April 2025, the 30-day moving average of depositing addresses has fallen to just 52,000. By contrast, the 365-day average is 71,000, and we can’t emphasize enough how sharp this drop is when looking at the 10-year average distribution peak of approximately 92,000 . The number of addresses depositing bitcoins to exchanges has been steadily declining since 2022: the 30-day moving average has now dropped to 52K addresses compared to the 365-day level of 71K. Meanwhile, over the past 10 years, the most common distribution was around 92K… pic.twitter.com/sBAKWS9Jlb — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) April 24, 2025 The most recent time the quantity of depositing addresses was this low was back in December 2016—right prior to the legendary 2017 bull run that soared Bitcoin to then-all-time-high figures. This present downturn suggests a not-yet-extinguished investor cohort with a long-term mindset; they appear, in recent trend, to be hoarding their assets much more than selling them off, as even short-term trades seem to be staying in the hands of the Bitcoin mainstay. This, then, paints a picture of Bitcoin as potentially more resilient in the face of economic headwinds. This carries significant implications for monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has a limited number of tools to employ when it comes to stimulating the economy or cooling it down. One of the most important is interest rates. When the Fed raises or lowers the federal funds rate, it sets off a chain reaction throughout the economy—the rates that various banks charge their customers go up or down, as does the price of money in general. At these moments, the fed funds rate is effectively the price tag on monetary policy. Institutional Interest Surges Through Spot ETFs What is making Bitcoin such a sure thing these days? For one, it’s back in favor among the deep-pocketed pros. Last week, during a stretch that saw Bitcoin price gains, we learned that several Wall Street houses had been buying actual Bitcoin, not just Bitcoin derivatives. Moreover, they had been doing this well before the last price pop. What is especially significant about the constant inflows into spot ETFs is that they involve real Bitcoins actually being bought on behalf of the investors. In contrast, products based on futures merely follow the price changes. The purchase of actual Bitcoins by spot ETF trustees affects the supply-demand situation in the market, and in my opinion, it affects that situation in only one way: for the price of Bitcoin to go higher. On April 23 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $917 million, marking four consecutive days of net inflows. In contrast, spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $23.88 million, with only the Grayscale ETF (ETH) registering a net inflow.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 24, 2025 The trustees of these ETFs, after all, must put the Bitcoins into storage that is secure enough to satisfy institutional investors, and that means custodial storage. When a product that is this secure and this legit holds an asset, what right does the price have to fall? Over the past few months, the picture of Bitcoin seems to be brightening, and the old skepticism is now giving way to something akin to strategic accumulation. Here are the macro conditions that have us thinking this way: inflation isn’t going anywhere; indeed, some of the latest data have us characterizing the episode as “stagflation lite.” Accumulation is evidenced by clear on-chain signals, an exchanges deposit balance that is at a multi-year low, and institutional interest in the form of surging ETFs. Together, these factors indicate that Bitcoin could very well be in the early stages of another significant market phase—one that, according to history, has often led to a major bull cycle. The present trends provide another reminder of how markets can be influenced by external factors. But the appearance of powerful oligo- and monopolies in our recent history suggests that we should also pay attention to what these powerful players are doing exogenously. And the news here is that they are buying, even as they appear to be front-running a regulatory and/or enforcement response to the problems they have created.

On-chain data shows that over 640,000 ETH has recently been moved into wallets that have no history of selling. This is the biggest inflow—into wallets without a history of selling—since 2018 and marks what may be a pivotal moment for Ethereum’s price. #Ethereum silent whales are back! 640,000+ $ETH just moved into wallets that have NEVER SOLD — the biggest inflow since 2018. They know something the market doesn’t. pic.twitter.com/ekPIjAk8qf — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) April 24, 2025 Although this development hasn’t made much of a splash in the news, it’s really quite significant. When these long-term holders (aka “strong hands”) start accumulating en masse, it’s usually a precursor to some kind of market movement. And the type of recent accumulation we’re seeing certainly doesn’t seem like just a bunch of informed folks in the know getting together to have a virtual meet-up. At current prices, the transferred ETH is worth more than $2 billion—not an insignificant “not quite $2.1 billion” confidence expression in Ethereum’s future. Movement of that amount is historically quite bullish—it almost always has been. Not just too, since some movement of large amounts has happened in the short past. Network Activity Surges Amid Technical Breakout Setup A fire of speculation has been fed by a recent increase in the network activity of Ethereum. Over the past 48 hours, the active addresses of ETH have increased by 10%, showing a clear uptick in engagement from users of the network. These kinds of spikes in address activity typically occur when there is intense buying interest in the asset and when investors are repositioning themselves in the market. $ETH active addresses surged 10%. In just 48 hours. Epic Ethereum revenge rally loading? pic.twitter.com/S89a9gs0kj — Ted (@TedPillows) April 24, 2025 Ethereum, from a predictions point of view, is currently forming a colossal bull flag on the monthly timeframe—a bullish continuation pattern that usually resolves to the upside. Price action has consolidated within the flag for several months and is now testing the channel’s lower boundary. This zone is under close observation by technical analysts for a possible breakout. If Ethereum can push past the upper flag resistance, the target price some are projecting is as high as $8,000. That would not only represent a doubling from current price levels but would also likely trigger a revival in altcoins, with Ethereum very much at the head of that charge. $ETH Macro Bull Flag Opportunity : #Ethereum is forming a massive bull flag pattern on the monthly time-frame. Price is right now sitting on the channel's lower band. Breakout Target : 8,000$ pic.twitter.com/7AdgSqkKvQ — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) April 24, 2025 This bullish technical setup is combined with heightened address activity and with large whale movements, creating a trifecta of positive indicators for Ethereum bulls. ETF Outflows Raise Eyebrows, But Grayscale Breaks the Trend Not all signals are clearly positive, though. On April 23rd (ET), spot Ethereum ETFs overall saw a not inflow of $23.88 million—notable in the context of an otherwise bullish story. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) was the only major ETF to go against this grain, seeing a positive not that day. But the ETHE is not a spot ETF. So what’s the story here? Investor rotation or short-term profit-taking could be the reasons for the recent outflows. Yet Grayscale’s inflows suggest that some institutions remain unfazed. Why, then, is there a divergence? One possible answer is that institutions are not yet willing to bet big on Ethereum but do appear to be kind of sort of betting on it. In terms of Ethereum-focused hedge funds, these still appear to be much more sensitive to regulation than funds betting on Bitcoin. More regulated, more secure seems to be the attitude of crypto hedge funds. On April 23 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $917 million, marking four consecutive days of net inflows. In contrast, spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $23.88 million, with only the Grayscale ETF (ETH) registering a net inflow.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 24, 2025 Even so, the swift outflow serves as a reminder that market sentiment can be highly divergent. While some investors seem to be pulling back, others—mostly the big holders—are going all in. Epic “Revenge Rally” Incoming? All of a sudden, long-dormant wallets are waking up. On-chain activity is shooting through the roof. And the technical structure on the monthly chart for Ethereum is looking incredibly bullish. Of course, this is giving rise to all kinds of fresh speculation, with some folks even hinting that an “epic revenge rally” could be in the cards for ETH. The term has begun to appear among crypto traders who consider Ethereum to be undervalued when compared to Bitcoin’s recent surge in recognition and value. While Bitcoin has been the clear leader in the rally thus far in 2025, many believe that Ethereum is set to enjoy its own moment of triumph—and that moment might be any day now. In a market where stories can change in the blink of an eye, Ethereum’s secretive whales may be moving with the kind of preemptive strike confidence reserved for folks in the know. If their previous actions are any guide, the latest steps they’ve taken are sending a strong message beneath their usual quiet surface. For the broader ETH trading community, that message seems to be crystalizing: something’s cooking. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43773053,https://coinpedia.org/?p=447607,1745551670,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Federal Reserve Eases Crypto Rules for U.S. Banks,https://coinpedia.org/news/federal-reserve-eases-crypto-rules-for-u-s-banks/,"The post Federal Reserve Eases Crypto Rules for U.S. Banks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The U.S. Federal Reserve has officially rolled back key rules that once restricted how banks engage with cryptocurrencies and dollar-backed tokens. The move marks a significant step toward easing regulatory pressure and signals growing openness to digital asset innovation within the U.S. banking system. Why Is the Federal Reserve Pulling Back Its Crypto Rules? The FED has withdrawn its 2022 guidlines that required state-chartered banks to notify the Board before offering crypto-related services. Under the new direction, banks no longer need to send advance notices. Instead, the Fed will oversee crypto activities through its usual supervisory processes—just like any other banking service. Stablecoin Restrictions Loosened The central bank also rescinded its 2023 nonobjection letter process for banks planning to engage in dollar token activities, such as issuing or dealing in stablecoins. This means banks can now move forward with such projects without having to wait for formal approval, removing one more layer of regulatory red tape. The Federal Reserve, alongside the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), has also pulled back from two joint statements issued last year with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). These joint memos had set cautious expectations around crypto involvement for banks. Their removal signals a coordinated shift toward more relaxed oversight across U.S. regulators. What Does the Federal Reserve’s Shift Mean for the Future of Crypto in Banking? While oversight won’t disappear completely, the tone has clearly changed. The Fed stated that it will continue to work with other agencies to explore new rules that better support innovation while keeping the banking sector safe and sound. Vandell Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist , called out the irony in the timing of the Fed’s move. Just days after being dismissed for his pro-crypto stance, the central bank reversed its position—removing the same policies he had spoken against. “It’s validating to see the Fed now encouraging the very innovation they once blocked,” he said. This change may open the door for banks to step more confidently into the crypto space—especially in the growing world of dollar tokens and stablecoins. Whether this marks the start of a broader shift in U.S. crypto regulation remains to be seen, but the door is certainly opening wider. Is This the Start of a New Era for Crypto in U.S. Banking? The Federal Reserve’s rollback of crypto guidance marks a shift from caution to cautious openness. By removing approval hurdles, it signals support for innovation and aligns with FDIC and OCC moves—making crypto more accessible for U.S. banks. Is the Federal Reserve Now Supporting Stablecoins? Not directly—but the signs point in that direction. By removing the requirement for banks to seek formal nonobjection letters before engaging in dollar token activities, the Federal Reserve has eased the path for stablecoin involvement. While it hasn’t officially endorsed stablecoins, this policy shift shows a more open attitude toward their use in the banking system. What Does New FED’s Crypto Rules Mean for Banks Looking to Enter the Crypto Space? It means fewer barriers and more flexibility. Banks no longer need to go through extra approval processes to offer crypto or stablecoin services. With the Federal Reserve shifting to standard supervision, banks can now explore crypto opportunities more confidently and at a faster pace—without waiting for special permissions.",News|Crypto Regulations|Fed|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-25 03:27:50

SUI , the native token of the Sui Network, has surged by over 43% in just a few days—rising from $2.10 to touch the $3 mark. The explosive rally hasn’t just captured the eyes of retail investors; it has also pushed SUI past long-time top dog Chainlink (LINK) in market capitalization. This week, SUI has a market cap of $9.88 billion, higher than LINK’s $9.54 billion and greater even than Avalanche (AVAX)—a reality placing the token among the leaders of the altcoin sector. To a lot of folks, this isn’t just another quick pump and dump. It’s seen as a validation of Sui’s growing heft in the fast-evolving crypto world. $SUI’s officially out of stealth mode. Grayscale just launched a trust, social chatter is exploding, and it’s now sitting above AVAX and LINK in market cap. This isn’t just retail hype—Wall Street is stepping into the SUI zone. Momentum feels different this time. It’s real.… pic.twitter.com/OYIYamgg80 — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) April 24, 2025 Ecosystem Strength, Wall Street Entry, and Macro Winds Shift in SUI’s Favor SUI’s price and status have surged due to a handful of converging, amplifying factors. The recent launch of a Grayscale SUI Trust has raised the pitch of institutional interest to new levels. Grayscale is known for bringing Wall Street heft into the crypto sphere via their trusts and funds; their move to set up a Sui trust is a major vote of confidence in Sui’s long-term play. It’s not just speculative traders buying Sui; serious, institutional-type capital is entering the Sui zone. That money flow is reflected in the numbers. The platforms have been deluged with people talking about Sui. And this isn’t just noise. You can practically feel the community’s collective spirit as it lifts the network and the tokens around it to ever-greater heights. So, what is all the fuss and hullabaloo about? A portion of the momentum can be attributed to an improving macroeconomic sentiment. Earlier in the month, altcoins took a beating, mostly because there was global uncertainty around the intensifying U.S.-China trade situation and the threat of new tariffs. However, both countries have now returned to the negotiating table, and the appearances of progress seem to have calmed things down quite a bit. At least for now. Crypto markets, which are notably sensitive to geopolitical developments, have calmed down too. Sui, it appears, was in an ideal location to take advantage of the change. What’s Next for Sui in 2025? With SUI’s upward price action showing persistence—$14.54 as of Dec. 28 at 9:51 a.m. UTC—questions are now shifting toward what the network has planned for the rest of 2025 and whether this dunk is sustainable. Per sources close to @SuiNetwork, the team is working on a number of big updates and community initiatives. While specifics are still under wraps, we get the sense from signals that are available that the focus is on 1. Scalability improvements; 2. New developer grants; 3. Increased interoperability with other major chains. Additionally, there are whispers going around about a broader DeFi expansion and improved onboarding tools for non-crypto native users—moves that could really widen Sui’s appeal beyond its current user base. In an important way, the pace at which Sui is developing seems different from the cycle of expectations that have characterized previous upswings in the space. In this instance, there appears to be a combination of really good fundamentals, strategic institutional alignment, and a broader narrative about altcoin utility that is sending Sui (and, it should be noted, some other non-Ethereum layer 1s) into a truly impressive place not just in terms of “market cap” but also, in some respects, in terms of just plain “realness.” Now, investors and traders will be keeping a close watch on SUI to see if it can hold onto its solid new spot near the top of the market cap rankings. The next few weeks could be quite crucial, especially if Sui can sustain its momentum the way some similar protocols have done lately. This morning, Sui was up about 35% over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. In terms of price increases, it looked quite similar to some of the very recent appearances made by other top-tier protocols. For the time being, however, we can say this much: SUI isn’t simply another altcoin experiencing a momentary surge. It has emerged— and the market is respecting it.

It surged to $12.21 following an announcement that energized its holder base: the top 220 token holders will receive invitations to dine with former U.S. President Donald Trump. The community has dubbed the offer “the most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the world,” and this has set off a buying frenzy, some wallet reshuffling, and a few strategic moves as investors try to ensure they are in the top holder club. LATEST: $TRUMP rose over 29% to $12.21 today after the announcement that its top 220 holders will be invited to dinner with Trump. It was described as the “most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the world.” pic.twitter.com/2HBoxGDsUK — CoinGecko (@coingecko) April 24, 2025 The early announcement brought about an immediate price rally, sending reverberations through both the meme token sector and the political crypto communities. Within hours, on-chain data showed large-scale liquidity movements and wallet reactivations not seen in months—a sure sign that both long-term whales and newcomers viewed the dinner invitation as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity pregnant with prestige and potential influence. Liquidity Provider Makes Bold Move and Lands in Top 220 One of the most interesting plays was made by a longtime $TRUMP liquidity provider who executed a strategic liquidity withdrawal just two hours after the news broke. From two separate wallets, this individual extracted an estimated 211,977 $TRUMP tokens (valued at about $2.76 million) and 18,376 $SOL (also worth roughly $2.76 million). The move was so carefully timed and plotted that it seems aimed at boosting both wallets into the top 220 holder ranks of these assets. A longtime $TRUMP liquidity provider removed liquidity from 2 wallets 2 hours ago, receiving 211,977 $TRUMP ($2.76M) and 18,376 $SOL ($2.76M). Now, both wallets are in the top 220 holders — giving them a shot at scoring 2 invites to the $TRUMP dinner. This guy bought 332,424… pic.twitter.com/ti3v4LaV88 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 24, 2025 Both wallets now have their places firmly established in the elite group, according to confirmed data from the blockchain. That puts the person who owns these wallets on course to earn not one, but possibly two invite-only seats at the Trump dinner. This was a quick play, but it was also a very clever and calculated one. These aren’t exclusive crypto benefits we are talking about; they are real-world, political, and celebrity. But when you get down to it, it’s all about money and making more of it. The same individual is very familiar with the $TRUMP ecosystem. On the token’s listing day, they bought 332,424 $TRUMP for only $802,000, with each token going for a humble $2.41. At its maximum, the worth of those holdings expanded to over $24 million, showing not just the volatility but even more the massive upside potential in this niche token project. Dormant Wallet Awakens with Big Buy — and Clear Intent In another twist, adding an air of mystery to the day’s proceedings, a wallet that hadn’t seen action for over five months suddenly came alive. It withdrew a considerable 1.5 million $USDC from Binance and used that sum to purchase 123,228 $TRUMP tokens. Why? Who knows! On-chain investigators are convinced it’s all part of an elaborate scheme to push the wallet’s holder into the top 220. Those holding the TRUMP token are in some way holding a token that gives them, if only metaphorically, a dinner with Donald Trump. After 5 months of inactivity, a wallet suddenly withdrew 1.5M $USDC from #Binance to buy 123,228 $TRUMP . Is this a move to secure a seat at the $TRUMP dinner? https://t.co/DO98ovJhTA pic.twitter.com/fjvwrVfcU8 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 24, 2025 Dormant wallets showing renewed interest is just one manifestation of the new utility that the dinner invitation has given the $TRUMP token. The power of exclusivity has become the utility for the token, with the dinner invitation signifying that it has an exclusive pull, which is now the $TRUMP token’s most prominent feature. That is a development worth figuring. Although critics of $TRUMP might find the combination of meme culture and political branding ludicrous, supporters contend that the former president has stitched together truly unique rags of influence into a potent new kind of message. And that if you sew together entertainment, influence, and speculative investment, you get something that even makes a kind of sense. In what world, after all, does a semi-retired, entirely unsuccessful businessman have half the people in the country convinced that he’s a messiah? Political Memecoin or Prestige Asset? While the crypto universe closely follows the $TRUMP saga, one aspect is clear: the token’s transformation has gone far beyond that of a typical meme. Today, $TRUMP is more social currency than crypto, a tool for those trying to impress with the number of tokens they hold. And in the case of $TRUMP, as if so often with any social currency, the holders are not shy about boasting how many millions of the tokens they command. It is yet to be determined whether this strategy keeps moving in a sustained way over the long term, but for now, $TRUMP is enjoying a high-profile rally that is boosted by hype, exclusivity, and a rapidly closing window for top-tier access.

43773369,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=328911,1745552429,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/dailyhodl.png,Behind the Leaderboard – The Hidden Risk of Copy Trading,https://dailyhodl.com/2025/04/24/behind-the-leaderboard-the-hidden-risk-of-copy-trading/,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post According to research by Charles Schwab UK, younger generations – particularly Z and Millennials, unlike Gen X and Boomers – accept online trading as one of the mainstream supplemental income activities. This makes many of them trader-like-minded but lacking sufficient experience, so the issue of active investment strategies remains open and usually untapped. Younger investors are also embracing broader investment opportunities, such as copy trading, which are not usually welcomed as much by their older counterparts. However, to novice investors, even if they are more advanced, leveraging strategies of master traders and thinking of it as a way to diversify the risk of the human factor may be self-delusional. Sometimes, seeing an influencer bragging about success and dropping a referral link has a huge toll on investors’ decisions. So, copy trading is not just trading anymore – it’s the influencer economy in full force. High returns, hidden volatility Given the social nature of copy trading, there’s a real danger in people placing too much faith in well-known figures in the industry, specifically, the master traders, whose successful trades can be easily replicated. The biggest risk in copy trading is not the market – it’s psychology. This situation is reminiscent of the wave of celebrity crypto endorsements that tend to surface during every bull market, often leaving seasoned traders feeling uncomfortable when these influencers make outlandish promises about token projects. While having a celebrity on board can certainly give a project a popularity boost, it doesn’t guarantee that it’s legitimate. Yet, despite a history of failures, many novice investors are still being overly influenced by prominent people in the industry. Diversification, despite being a common approach in investing, can also be very delusional. Just spreading one’s money across 10 different master accounts won’t really shield one from market behavior at the end of the day. In the crypto world, some semblance of credible diversification could only be in mixing the very copy trading, realizing all its caveats, with long-term investments or alternative investment methods like staking. The bottom line is that the investors don’t cause common risks of copy trading that much en masse, but by the platforms themselves. It’s their duty to communicate both risks and performance. When return or drawdown metrics leave out unrealized profits and losses, investors can easily be misled, leading to unrealistic expectations based on partial information. Protecting the follower on a platform level When it comes to safeguarding copy trading ethics, trading platforms usually focus on the key issue – unveiling and stopping the known account ‘boosting’ schemes. This happens when someone sets up multiple accounts – l et’s say, four – and opens ‘buy’ positions on two while placing ‘sell’ positions on the other two. After closing two ‘victimized’ accounts, the remaining ones might show impressive returns – let’s say, 80%. The trader can then repeat this cycle, eventually boasting an account with, say, 230% return. At that point, even minor gains – like one percent – can lead to outsized percentage growth – three percent – because of compounding. This creates a false sense of steady profitability when, in reality, it’s just an artificial boost from the start. Investors who see this kind of past performance might think they can expect similar results, but they’re just buying into a cleverly crafted illusion. On top of that, there’s not much incentive for platforms to keep a close eye on how traders behave. After all, it’s just a marketplace – some traders may be laid-back and cautious, while others are expected to act more aggressively. There’s a place for both types. The only twist here is that instead of pushing a casino-style wheel, someone may click the ‘follow’ button on a hyper-aggressive trader. All in all, a trading platform can offer two complete tools to protect investors – risk limits for signal providers and risk limits for investors. When it comes to risk limits for signal providers, they should be implemented in a way that prevents users from instantly altering them. Otherwise, it doesn’t serve its purpose. When the set limit is exceeded by the user, the platform intervenes in order to counteract the risky activity. This is the truly effective way to protect investors. Besides, platforms should clearly communicate those limits to the investors. For example – “ A stricter risk limit will be imposed on this master trader – if his account loses, say, 20%, all positions will be closed automatically.” That kind of enforcement action would provide a more realistic protection. The same goes for followers – platforms must allow them to rely on automated controls like stop-copy thresholds or risk multipliers. Let’s say that the investor set a loss limit of 500 USDT for the master trader. If the loss reaches this amount, all copied positions will be closed and the subscription will be terminated. Final words When entering the world of crypto copy trading, investors must understand that it inherently involves risks – there’s always a chance to win or lose. The key principle is simple and universal – never deposit more than you’re prepared to lose. Once that deposit is made, there are several ways to manage risk effectively – diversify by following multiple signal providers, set clear risk limits and use low-risk multipliers. If these precautions are in place, losing money becomes much harder, but at the same time, earning a fortune wouldn’t come easily either.

Despite Bitcoin’s price hold, the sentiment score is gradually declining, and analysts are expressing doubt over the rally’s sustainability. The crypto market remains Bitcoin-heavy, with its dominance above 64%, strong ETF inflows and a low altcoin season score. Bitcoin’s several-day surge above $90,000 pushed crypto market sentiment to its highest point in more than two months on April 23, but it’s gradually tapering off again as analysts air concerns about the sustainability of Bitcoin’s rally. On April 23, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index clocked a score of 72 out of 100, putting it in the “Greed” zone as Bitcoin ( BTC ) returned above the $90,000 level. However, as of April 25, the score has fallen to 60 despite the relatively stable price. Crypto sentiment at two-month high The last time the index hit this score was on Feb. 4, around the same time US President Donald Trump introduced tariffs and Bitcoin fell below $100,000 . Bitcoin has since reclaimed the $90,000 price level for the first time since March 6. Bitcoin is trading at $93,130 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap However, despite Bitcoin trading between $91,800 and $94,304 over the past two days, sentiment within the “Greed” territory has been gradually cooling off, with the index falling to April 24 and 60 on April 25. The slight pullback follows warnings from several crypto analysts who remain cautious about the Bitcoin rally, including 10x Research's head of research, Markus Thielen, who isn’t yet convinced of a rally . “Given that our stablecoin minting indicator has yet to return to high-activity levels, we remain cautious about the sustainability of the current Bitcoin rally,” Thielen said on April 23. Meanwhile, Bitfinex analysts said on April 24 that while Bitcoin’s relative strength against US equities “appears real,” it is yet to be confirmed as structural. However, others are more bullish. MN Trading Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe said on April 24 that “buyers are likely going to step in, and then we’ll be continuing our path toward a new [all-time high].” Related: Bitcoin ‘short squeeze’ or $87K dip next? BTC price predictions vary CoinMarketCap’s altcoin season index indicates that the market is still heavily favoring Bitcoin over altcoins, with the altcoin season score sitting at a lowly 17 out of 100. It comes as Bitcoin Dominance is sitting at 64.39%, according to TradingView data. Bitcoin sentiment has gained momentum since it touched the mid-$80,000 price range. On April 17, crypto analytics firm Santiment pointed out that the tone of Bitcoin-related social media posts has flipped to bullish . Meanwhile, crypto analyst Trader T pointed out in an April 25 X post that US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have , so far to April 24, seen their third-best week of inflows since launching in January 2024. Over the past four trading days, the spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $2.6 billion in net inflows.

With an 80% Bitcoin allocation, GDLC may not be ideal for altcoin rallies, despite potential spot ETF approvals for XRP and SOL. The fund's heavy BTC exposure challenges its effectiveness for altcoin-focused investors; single-asset ETFs may offer better returns. GDLC remains a 'hold' for passive investors, but active altcoin buyers should consider alternative funds for more direct exposure. It has been approximately five months since my last Seeking Alpha article covering the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC). It's a fund that I've covered a half dozen times going back to 2022 and one that I've often provided readers with an 'adjusted NAV' valuation based on my own framework. From November: For those who have not seen the prior work, my 'fair value' calculation zeroes out the altcoins after BTC and ETH and assigns a full valuation to the BTC and ETH in the fund. With the increasing likelihood that more spot ETFs for altcoins may enter the market this year, GDLC's NAV rate discount has further compressed down to just 10% from the 17% discount offered by the market back in November. More importantly, based on my 'adjusted NAV' framework, the fund essentially trades at par given current weightings to readily available spot ETFs for digital assets in the US market. In this update, we'll look at the current makeup of the fund and assess if GDLC is the right way to pay a potential 'alt season' in the digital asset market. Current Holdings & Discount Rate Asset Allocation Assets/Share Weight Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) 0.00036456 80.60% Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) 0.00221657 9.37% XRP ( XRP-USD ) 1.06819845 5.61% Solana ( SOL-USD ) 0.00939617 3.33% Cardano ( ADA-USD ) 0.66104994 1.09% Source: Grayscale, as of 4/23/25 As has been the case since I've been covering GDLC, the largest allocation of the fund's capital is to Bitcoin. This was actually my original critique when I first covered the fund; mainly, that a product that aimed for digital asset diversification having such a large BTC weighting perhaps defeated the purpose of buying an 'altcoin' fund. Though it should be noted that this allocation to Bitcoin has almost certainly helped the fund's NAV rate discount compression since 'crypto winter' back in 2022. Currently, that discount stands at just over 10%: ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT $670,308,275.58 SHARES OUTSTANDING 15,867,400 NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE $42.24 MARKET PRICE $37.89 DISCOUNT TO NET ASSET VALUE 10.30% Source: Grayscale, as of 4/23/25 If readers think back to my framework for creating the 'adjusted NAV' of GDLC, the combined 90% allocation to Bitcoin and Ethereum essentially puts the fund at my adjusted 'fair value' already. However, with the US political landscape changing from crypto-antagonism to one that is as more open to the asset class, should this fund trade closer to the real NAV rather than my adjusted NAV? There is certainly an argument to made that it perhaps should. But the next question I have about GDLC in 2025 is pretty simple; is this fund the right way to play a potential rally in the altcoin market? I'm much less certain that the answer to that question is 'yes' given how exposed the fund is to BTC. Bitcoin Allocation & Altcoin Exposure As far as I can tell, Grayscale no longer offers a historic breakout of GDLC holdings data by day. Thus, to assess the long-term Bitcoin allocation that has historically been represented by each GDLC share, I've referenced my prior articles. That data is shown in the table below, with dates hyperlinked to the source articles: Historic Weightings BTC % ETH % Remaining % Total Holdings August 2022 63.50% 31.20% 5.30% 5 June 2023 70.32% 27.05% 2.63% 5 August 2023 69.97% 26.97% 3.06% 5 March 2024 69.33% 22.39% 8.28% 6 September 2024 75.80% 17.80% 6.40% 5 November 2024 75.50% 16.30% 8.20% 5 April 2025 80.60% 9.37% 10.03% 5 Source: Grayscale, prior articles Not only is the current 80.6% allocation to Bitcoin the largest BTC weighting since I've been covering GDLC, but the 10% exposure to alternative coins is the largest that I can recall. This is no doubt due, in part, to the performance of coins like XRP and SOL. But I think it also speaks to the significant under-performance of ETH; which has fallen in fund weighting by 70% in less than 3 years. ETF Analyst Expectations as of 2/10/25 (James Seyffart/X) I shared this graphic in a prior Grayscale piece and I think it's useful for GDLC as well. Bloomberg's ETF analysts have a positive outlook on ETF approval odds for both XRP and SOL. If that does indeed come to fruition, it would mean ADA is the only cryptocurrency in GDLC that doesn't have a spot ETF in the US market. At just 1% of AUM allocated to ADA currently, it could easily be argued that GDLC should trade essentially at NAV or slightly lower. Even in that scenario, the re-rating for GDLC as a result of XRP and SOL spot ETF approvals would be closer to 8 or 9% higher coin prices being equal. At that point, the merits of the fund itself would likely be the biggest driver of future GDLC returns. Bitcoin Dominance (CoinMarketCap) In a market that has increasingly become dominated by Bitcoin over the last two and half years, the merits of a fund like GDLC likely become challenged. On one hand, Bitcoin's surge to 63% of the total crypto market is perhaps a signal that a turnaround for altcoins is warranted based on historical trends. On the other hand, with just 20% combined allocation to ETH and other alts, GDLC might not actually be the best way to play a reversal in BTC dominance. Closing Thoughts I don't think 80% allocation to Bitcoin is what altcoin buyers would be interested in if nearly the entire fund could be replaced with allocation to four single-asset spot ETFs at an individual investor's own discretion. For a 'set it and forget it' type of fund that could benefit from higher crypto prices, GDLC probably works fine. Especially given what is still a real NAV discount of 10%. But if BTC begins to lose market share to ETH, SOL, XRP, or ADA, the returns from GDLC will ultimately lag more direct exposure to those assets through alternative funds. There are several spot ETH ETFs already. Though it trades at a dwindling premium, Solana bulls have the Grayscale Solana Trust ( GSOL ) as an option. Ripple bulls could look to something like the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF ( XXRP ) for shorter term trading. And this is before spot ETFs enter the market - which is a catalyst that could manifest this year. Given all this, I'm reiterating GDLC as a 'hold' and suspect that altcoin buyers will likely do better piecing together an altcoin portfolio using single-asset funds and lower-cost ETFs.",BTC-USD|ETH-USD|XRP-USD|SOL-USD|ADA-USD|GDLC,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-25 03:59:47

Recent analyses suggest the digital asset may continue its bullish momentum in the near-term. Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross According to a recent X post by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto, Ethereum has formed a golden cross on the daily chart. A golden cross typically precedes significant price rallies, and the continuation of this bullish price action could push ETH beyond $2,000 soon. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears ‘Critical Zone’ Historically Linked To Market Bottoms – Is A Rebound Incoming? For the uninitiated, a golden cross is a technical indicator that flashes when the 50-day moving average (MA) crosses the 200-day moving average (MA). The indicator often suggests a shift from a downtrend to an uptrend in the underlying asset’s price. The following chart shows the golden cross, with the upward-sloping red line (50-day MA) overtaking the downward-sloping blue line (200-day MA). If this trend holds, it could set the stage for further gains, with the $2,000 mark acting as the next psychological resistance level. Other analysts also support Titan of Crypto’s bullish outlook for ETH. For example, fellow analyst JJcycles shared a weekly chart illustrating striking similarities between ETH’s current structure and that of Bitcoin (BTC) during past cycles. JJcycles noted that ETH may currently be trading near the bottom of the range – close to the support trendline – similar to BTC’s price action around $5,000 following the March 2020 COVID-19 crash. Potential ETH Targets? In another X post, crypto trading account Bitcoinsensus pointed out that Ethereum is forming a large bull flag pattern on the monthly chart. The account noted that ETH is currently near the lower boundary of the flag, with a potential breakout target of up to $8,000. Likewise, seasoned analyst TraderPA suggested ETH is in a reaccumulation phase and could be poised for a strong rally. According to TraderPA, ETH may surge to $6,000 before the year ends. On-chain metrics also support the case for a bullish reversal. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently noted that Ethereum’s Entity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow has dropped below one million – a level that often indicates the asset is undervalued. Related Reading: Ethereum Sentiment Dips Among Retail Investors, Yet A Breakout Looms Despite the positive indicators, concerns about further downside remain. Ethereum’s weak performance in recent months, coupled with repeated breakdowns through key support levels, raises the risk of a drop to $1,200. Nonetheless, ETH is projected to see significant price appreciation in Q2 2025, with some analysts forecasting a new all-time high by year’s end. At press time, ETH trades at $1,755, down 3.3% in the last 24 hours.

At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.18 and is up by more than 1%. According to analysts, XRP has made a small move to the upside, but it’s not yet strong enough to confirm a solid uptrend. The recent increase looks like a three-wave pattern, which could either be the start of something bigger or just another temporary bounce. Here’s what’s happening: The B-wave correction might not be over yet. Today, we saw some downward movement, and it’s possible that XRP could revisit last week’s lows around $2.02–$2.03. If this happens, the price might see a five-wave decline forming, with possible support around $1.90–$2. But it’s important to understand this is a very short-term, small market structure and nothing major for now. On the other hand, if XRP has already completed its B-wave correction and started a new C-wave upwards, it could target the $2.55–$2.68 zone. However, there’s not much clear evidence to confirm this yet — both the recent moves up and down have been choppy, making it difficult to predict the next big move. Since mid-April, XRP’s price action has been messy and directionless, mostly moving sideways. While there’s still a chance for higher prices, traders should watch for key support levels: $1.82 is an important support area. As long as XRP stays above this, there’s room for a recovery. If XRP falls below $1.82, it would signal that the current attempt to move higher is failing, and it might see a drop towards the $1.33 level next.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-25 04:03:29

At this point, the SEC, which has closed the vast majority of cryptocurrency cases, including the Ripple (XRP) case, is expected to take more positive steps with the inauguration of new chairman Paul Atkins. As the SEC continues to make innovative moves, it was revealed that it was meeting with an altcoin team. Accordingly, Ondo Finance (ONDO) has joined with the SEC Crypto Task Force chaired by Hester Peirce to propose a regulatory framework for the tokenization of publicly traded securities in the United States. In addition to Ondo Finance officials, attorneys from Davis Polk and Wardwell law firm also attended this meeting. The ONDO price rose more than 10% after the SEC meeting announcement, rising above $1. However, ONDO has given back some of its gains and is trading at $0.96 at the time of writing. On April 25, the crypto task force will hold a roundtable event to discuss custody, including representatives from Kraken, Anchorage Digital Bank, WisdomTree, and others. While Ondo Finance attracted attention with its $1 million donation to Donald Trump’s inauguration fund, Davis Polk and Wardwell law firm announced on April 22 that it would represent the US President’s social media company Truth Social to launch crypto-linked exchange-traded funds. *This is not investment advice.

The price is now consolidating near the $2.150 support and might aim for a fresh increase. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.150 zone. The price is now trading above $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase unless there is a close below the $2.150 support. XRP Price Dips To Support XRP price started a decent upward wave above the $2.120 and $2.150 resistance levels, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price traded above the $2.220 and $2.250 levels to start a decent increase. A high was formed at $2.299 and the price started a downside correction. There was a move below the $2.20 and $2.180 support levels. A low was formed at $2.120 and the price started another increase. It cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.299 swing high to the $2.120 low. However, the bears are active near the $2.2350 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.299 swing high to the $2.120 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.20 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $2.2350 level. The next resistance is $2.30. A clear move above the $2.30 resistance might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.450 resistance or even $2.50 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.620. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $2.20 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.1620 level. The next major support is near the $2.150 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.150 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.120 support. The next major support sits near the $2.0650 zone.

However, in a paradox that has the crypto community scratching its head, the platform’s native CAKE token remains stuck in the oven, struggling to rise above the $2 mark. A Record-Breaking Quarter The latest data from Dune Analytics shows that PancakeSwap’s Q1 2025 wasn’t just a marginal improvement but a full-blown breakout. Trading volume has jumped 921%, going from $20.1 billion in 2023 to the current $205.3 billion. It also boasts 5.83 million unique traders, an 81% increase from two years ago. Similarly, transaction counts have followed suit, going from 44.1 million in Q1 2023 to 114.4 million in the first three months of 2025. Part of this meteoric rise can be attributed to recent upgrades like the CAKE Tokenomics 3.0, officially launched on April 23, 2025. This overhaul retired several outdated mechanisms, such as CAKE staking, veCAKE, revenue sharing, and farm boosting, while kick-starting a new era of reduced CAKE emissions. However, despite the blockbuster performance and a seemingly bullish shift in fundamentals, CAKE’s market price has continued to underwhelm. According to CoinGecko, its price fluctuated between $1.93 and $2.05 before finally settling at $1.95, a 3.8% dip in the previous 24 hours. The numbers were much better across the week, with CAKE posting an 8.7% uptick to marginally edge out the broader crypto market’s 8.5% growth in the same period. Nonetheless, it still lagged behind similar Ethereum ecosystem tokens, which rallied 12.7% in the last seven days. Price Struggles Amidst Growth The picture is more stark when zooming out further. CAKE lost 24.6% of its value over the past month, while it is down 36.2% year-on-year. Additionally, its current price is 95.6% lower than its all-time high of $43.96, recorded about 4 years ago. Even with a circulating supply of 313 million and a total value locked (TVL) surpassing $1.64 billion per data from DefiLlama, investor confidence in the token appears tepid, maybe due to macroeconomic uncertainties weighing on altcoins. The disconnect between PancakeSwap’s usage metrics and token price hasn’t gone unnoticed. On X, one community member called CAKE “significantly undervalued,” suggesting it should at least “match Uniswap’s price.” Others were more skeptical, one bluntly remarking, “Cake is still dead.” Another responded to PancakeSwap’s milestone post with a cryptic “Probably nothing,” a meme-like nod to the community’s doubtfulness amid ongoing volatility.

Unlike many other networks, it doesn’t have its own token. Instead, it uses ETH for gas fees, making the experience simpler for both developers and users. Built on the Ethereum mainnet, Base has quickly become a top player among Layer 2 solutions. It’s known for its low fees, high speed, and developer-friendly environment. The latest support from Binance U.S could help accelerate its adoption even further. Base Network’s Rapid Growth Despite overall market uncertainty, Base has been growing fast. According to IntoTheBlock data , Base’s share of active addresses among major Layer 2s has jumped from 63% in January to 82% today. It now handles over 1 million daily active addresses and more than 4 million daily transactions. Base’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has also reached $6.3 billion, showing strong user confidence and growing on-chain activity. These numbers highlight that the network is gaining serious traction. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinbase Inks Strategic Partnership With PayPal to Enable Mainstream Adoption of PYUSD Stablecoin , Community Sees Institutional Signal The news of Binance U.S supporting Base has sparked positive reactions from the crypto community.

As more DeFi projects launch and cross-chain bridges expand, Base could become a key player in the blockchain space. With Binance U.S now backing it, the network has gained an important boost in credibility and exposure. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Base is a scaling solution that runs on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It’s designed to handle more transactions at lower costs while still benefiting from Ethereum’s strong security. How does this integration benefit regular Binance U.S users? It allows users to send and receive ETH and USDC faster and at lower fees using the Base network. Can I transfer any crypto asset via Base, or is it limited to ETH and USDC for now? Currently, only ETH and USDC are supported via Base, but more assets may be added soon. Why is Binance U.S adding support for Base now—what’s the significance of this timing? Base has seen rapid user growth and on-chain activity, making now the right time to support it. Is this move limited to Binance U.S, or will global Binance also support Base soon? At the moment, this update applies only to Binance U.S; there’s no word yet on global support.",News|Exchange News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-25 04:13:04

Now, a new name is entering analyst discussions alongside them: MAGACOINFINANCE . Unlike its larger counterparts, MAGACOINFINANCE is still early. Its entry through a limited-access pre-sale phase is giving analysts and early investors a reason to look closer—not because it competes with BTC or XRP, but because it mirrors the conditions that made them successful in the first place. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Compared to Top Performers MAGACOINFINANCE’s launch generated rapid traction, confirming the excitement many insiders were already expecting. Its appeal comes not from flashy marketing but from disciplined tokenomics, early momentum, and a structure that rewards those who position themselves before mass listings begin. Analysts are beginning to see MAGACOINFINANCE as one of the few altcoins with real runway for exponential growth—a rarity in today’s maturing crypto landscape. MAGACOINFINANCE vs. ADA, BCH, and SUI: A New Cycle Begins Cardano (ADA) continues to push technical development. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) remains a fast alternative for payments. SUI has momentum as a newer protocol. But none of these assets provide the timing advantage that MAGACOINFINANCE does right now. It’s still early, still off the radar, and still priced for asymmetric growth. That makes MAGACOINFINANCE a completely different kind of opportunity—one that closely resembles the early phases of coins that later defined the market. Final Thoughts: MAGACOINFINANCE Follows the Footsteps of BTC and XRP’s Best Days Bitcoin (BTC) succeeded because it offered early believers a first-mover advantage. XRP delivered when it was still under the radar. Now, MAGACOINFINANCE is in that same position—structured, limited, and quietly building strength. This is how winning moves begin.

These new futures will be available in both large and micro-sized contracts, giving traders more flexibility and precision in managing their exposure to XRP. CME Launches XRP Futures This move is a huge milestone for XRP, as the CME is considered one of the most trusted and regulated futures exchanges in the world. While XRP futures have already been launched on platforms like coinbase coinbase - support@coinbase.com Wallet Centralised Exchange and Bitnomial, those are relatively small players compared to the CME. Many experts believe this development is a key step toward the long-awaited approval of an XRP Spot ETF . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) often looks to the CME as a gold standard when considering futures markets, and having XRP futures listed there strengthens the case for an ETF. XRP Spot ETF Gains Momentum Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Brad Garlinghouse Brad Garlinghouse is an American businessman and a major crypto influencer.

With Paul Atkins recently sworn in as SEC Chair and a noticeably more pro-crypto stance from the agency, analysts believe there’s a high chance of ETF approvals by Q2 or Q3 2025. If these ETFs get the green light, it could mark a major turning point for XRP’s market growth and wider adoption. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The firm argued that the rise in its BTC price target was driven largely by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance as “digital gold.” ARK’s Big Ideas 2025 report noted that the firm updated its Bitcoin price target for 2030, projecting bear, base, and bull cases of ~$300,000, ~710,000, and ~$1.5 million per BTC, respectively. The company also bumped its bear and base case scenarios for the price of BTC up to $500,000 and $1.2 million. ARK’s new bear and base targets were bumped up from its $300,000 and $700,000 Bitcoin predictions of February 11. ARK Invest elevates Bitcoin bull case prediction to $2.4M We’ve published our bitcoin price forecast through 2030. Read our research from @dpuellARK and share your thoughts. https://t.co/CH7y5EyUjY — ARK Invest (@ARKInvest) April 24, 2025 ARK Invest has raised its bull case Bitcoin price prediction from $1.5M to $2.4M by the end of 2030. The firm’s research trading analyst David Puell said in an April 24 report that the rise in BTC’s prediction was driven largely by institutional investors and the digital asset’s continued acceptance as “digital gold.” Puell acknowledged that ARK’s price targets relied on assumptions made regarding the total addressable markets (TAMs) and penetration rates, which is the percentage of BTC’s TAM that it could capture in certain cases. He added that the digital currency’s supply schedule, which will approach ~20.5 million units by 2030, can also determine its BTC price targets. The analyst also highlighted that Bitcoin may fail to reach ARK’s price targets if any TAMs or penetration rates are unmet. Source: ARK Invest. 2030 Bitcoin price target. The Florida-based investment management firm found that digital gold contributes the most to its bear and base cases, while institutional investment contributes the most to its bull case. The company also highlighted that nation-state treasuries, corporate treasuries, and Bitcoin’s decentralized financial services contribute relatively little in each case. Cathie Wood’s company also revealed that as of 2024, the global portfolio’s TAM, excluding gold’s 3.6% share, is ~$169 trillion. The firm applied an assumed 3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), resulting in a value of ~$200 trillion by 2030. Puell estimated that the virtual asset would achieve a 6.5% penetration rate into the $200 trillion financial market in a best-case scenario (excluding gold). The investment manager acknowledged that Bitcoin’s acceptance as “digital gold” was a major contributor to its elevated estimate. Puell also estimated that it could capture up to 60% of gold’s $18 trillion market cap by the end of 2030 in a bull scenario. ARK sees Bitcoin as a potential contributor to capital accrual Puell argued that BTC becoming a “safe haven” in emerging markets was the third-largest contributor to ARK’s $2.4 million bull case prediction at 13.5%. He pointed to the digital asset’s ability to protect wealth from inflation and devaluation in developing countries. “This Bitcoin use case has the greatest potential for capital accrual.” -David Puell, analyst at ARK Invest. ARK Invest’s BTC price projections also included nation-state and corporate Bitcoin financial services, which was initiated by the success of MicroStrategy ’s BTC purchases in 2020. The firm argued that if corporate strategies prove successful over the next six years, its bear and base cases’ conservative penetration assumption – 1% and 2.5%, respectively – could move toward its bull case assumption of 10%. According to Puell, a $2.4 million BTC price tag would send the virtual asset’s market cap to $49.2 trillion if Bitcoin’s total supply will have reached 20.5 million by the end of 2030. The firm also argued that Bitcoin’s native financial services are an emerging contributor to capital accrual. ARK noted the Lightning Network’s dedication to scaling BTC’s transaction capacity and Wrapped BTC (WBTC) on the Ethereum network, which enables BTC to participate in decentralized finance. The investment manager believes that such on-chain financial services generate a baseline CAGR of 40%, which is a realistic expectation between now and 2030.

Accumulation Trend Score Suggests Strong Buying From Mega Whales In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about how the Accumulation Trend Score has changed for the different Bitcoin investor cohorts recently. The “Accumulation Trend Score” refers to an on-chain indicator that basically tells us about whether the BTC holders are buying or selling. The metric calculates its value by not only making use of the balance changes happening in the wallets of the investors, but also the size of the wallets themselves. This means that large addresses have a higher weightage in the indicator’s value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Back In Green As Price Breaks $94,000 When the Accumulation Trend Score is greater than 0.5, it suggests that the large investors (or a large number of small holders) are participating in accumulation. The closer the metric is to 1.0, the stronger is this behavior. On the other hand, the indicator being under 0.5 implies the investors are distributing or simply not doing any buying. On this side of the scale, the zero mark acts as the point of extreme. In the context of the current topic, the combined Accumulation Trend Score of the entire Bitcoin market isn’t of interest, but rather the separate scores for the different investor cohorts. There are two main ways to divide holder groups: holding time and balance size. Here, the cohorts are based on the latter categorization. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Accumulation Trend Score for these groups over the past year. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin market as a whole has been in a state of distribution during the last few months, but one cohort started to pull away from the rest last month: the 10,000+ BTC holders. The investors holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC are popularly known as the whales, so these investors, who are even more humongous, could be termed as the mega whales. From the chart, it’s visible that the rest of the market continued to sell into this month, but the mega whales, who were already dropping off their distribution, pivoted to buying instead. They have since only strengthened their behavior, with the metric now even reaching a near-perfect score of 0.9. The whales have also turned things around very recently, as the score has hit 0.7 for them. Thus, it would appear that the big-money investors as a whole have been accumulating Bitcoin during the latest recovery rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot Volume Nearly Triples As BTC Breaks $91,000 Among the rest of the market, the sharks (100 to 1,000 BTC) are the closest at catching up to the whales, with their Accumulation Trend Score sitting at 0.5. The investors on the smaller end are still continuing to distribute. The current pattern is sort of similar to what was witnessed back in December 2024, where the Bitcoin mega whales started participating in strong distribution ahead of the rest. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin crossed above the $94,000 level earlier, but it seems the coin has seen a pullback since then as its price is back at $92,600.

The ETF was launched on January 11, 2024, and by press time, it has pulled in more than $53 billion in net assets. Within just seven weeks of launch, IBIT reached $10 billion, which made it the fastest-growing ETF in history. On April 22, the ETF had a 37.31% one-year return, and just a day later it raked in $643.16 million in new inflows—despite the current messiness of crypto prices. Saylor called Bitcoin the new anchor for corporate treasury strategy. He said companies are waking up to the fact that cash is weak and unstable in the long term. In his words, Bitcoin is “better than cash,” and he described it as a kind of future-proof money that can protect firms from inflation. Saylor said demand for Bitcoin-backed financial products like ETFs will rise as more companies start allocating their balance sheets into Bitcoin instead of letting inflation eat away at their fiat holdings. Bitcoin ETF inflows explode as institutions pile in While IBIT currently holds about $48 billion in assets under management, it’s still far behind giants like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, which holds $573 billion. But Saylor believes that IBIT could catch up fast if Bitcoin triples in value. He even said that it could give MicroStrategy the biggest cash reserve in the world. Since spot Bitcoin ETFs hit the US market, they’ve collected more than $37 billion in total net inflows. Together, they now control over $106.39 billion in assets. Out of all these, IBIT is the biggest one out there. It even picked up the “Best New ETF” award at the etf.com awards—a detail that Saylor made sure everyone in the room heard. Part of what’s helping ETFs gain attention is what’s happening in the political and economic space. Bitcoin broke past $90,000 recently. Traders tied that price move to President Donald Trump’s comment about possibly cutting Chinese import tariffs, and the announcement that Jerome Powell will keep his position as Federal Reserve Chairman. Another factor was SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, who has openly supported BTC and crypto in general, so with him in charge, traders have more clarity on where US policy might lean. After some weak inflows in early April, the recent flood of money into Bitcoin ETFs shows that investors are trusting BTC again. Not just as some risky bet, but as something they now see as a strategic asset and a possible inflation solution. With the US dollar weakening and expectations rising for a Federal Reserve rate cut in mid-2025, institutional buyers are starting to return. Some investors still worry about trade policy uncertainty and rising inflation, but for now, they’re putting money into Bitcoin again. Saylor’s main point was that this is just the beginning for Wall Street. He said, “Institutional adoption has only just started.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

That’s the state of things right now, as the top seven tech names—Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Tesla, Amazon, Nvidia, and Meta Platforms—fail to carry the market the way they did in the past. According to CNBC , their equal-weighted fund, the Roundhill Magnificent 7 ETF (MAGS), has already dropped 17% this year. That’s more than twice the S&P 500’s loss of just under 7%. The drop in performance has also cut into their share of the S&P 500. In early January, the Mag 7 held a 34% weighting in the index. That number is now down to 29%, based on data from Todd Sohn, an ETF strategist at Strategas. Todd said, “Index concentration has cooled for the moment, and along with this, so have Tech sector flows.” His note to clients on Thursday pointed to a shift in where investor money is going—away from tech, toward other sectors. The power each of these stocks holds in the S&P 500 comes from their market caps. So when they shrink, their influence shrinks. That means if they’re not doing well, they can’t drag the index up anymore. Even with some good news from names like Netflix, the whole group isn’t doing enough. Netflix crushed expectations on earnings. Tesla , despite missing estimates, still managed to rise for three straight sessions. Both Amazon and Nvidia insisted this week that the demand for AI data center is holding steady. Still, all that didn’t push the S&P 500 back past the 5,500 level. That resistance held firm on Thursday, even though tech names tried to give the market a little push. But investors are still nervous about tariffs and a wider slowdown. That fear’s heavier than any short-term bounce. Other sectors fall while Mag 7 underperforms The picture outside of Big Tech doesn’t look much better. Sean Simonds, a strategist at UBS, sent a note Thursday saying, “Sales and earnings expectations (+5% and +10%, respectively) are moving lower in virtually every sector.” Sean said the worst hits are in consumer discretionary stocks. That includes cars and household goods—areas that are getting beat up by tariff effects. Those stocks are now underperforming the rest of the market by 20%. This means even if the Mag 7 can’t carry the weight anymore, there aren’t many sectors ready to step in. Wall Street is stuck, trying to rally with no one leading. Later Thursday evening, S&P 500 futures gained a small bump of 0.3%. Nasdaq -100 futures moved up 0.4%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures didn’t move much at all. That little boost followed Alphabet’s Q1 earnings report. The company beat on both revenue and profit. In after-hours trading, its stock went up around 5%. Not every name in tech had a win. Intel disappointed. After giving investors weak guidance and saying it would slash spending on operations and capital, the stock crashed over 5% in extended hours.

The devs are proposing to test a raise in Ethereum’s gas limit to 150 million by the Fusaka hard fork, according to Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 9678, introduced on April 23 by Sophia Gold, a developer on the protocol support team at the Ethereum Foundation. During the last All Core Devs Execution (ACDE) meeting, there were discussions to make the gas limit increase a “key feature” of Fusaka, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko said in an April 24 meeting summary. “To align on client defaults and keep this as a priority, we’ve drafted an EIP. It’s a bit unconventional, but not unprecedented (see EIP-7840). We plan to get it merged early next week and formally SFI it on the next ACDE,” Beiko said. “As we continue this work, we expect to identify changes that need to be made in-protocol to support a higher gas limit. This implies adding more EIPs to Fusaka, even though the fork scope is final.” Source: Tim Beiko The next Ethereum upgrade, Pectra , is scheduled to go live on the mainnet in May. Fusaka has been flagged as possibly going online in late 2025. Gas limit increase a priority ahead of Fusaka As part of the motivation for increasing the gas limit, the developers said there was great interest in scaling layer 1 execution and that it could likely be done by implementing any new features. However, it requires guidance from execution layer developers because “we expect to find bugs in clients at higher gas limits than currently used on mainnet,” which will “require time from client developers both to test and to fix any bugs that arise, therefore it makes sense to include as an EIP in a hard fork to commit to this.” The developers behind the EIP say client developers will need time to test and fix any bugs that arise while increasing the gas limit. Source: GitHub “While the gas limit is ultimately set by validators, we agreed that having an EIP to coordinate client defaults would help keep this a priority and ensure all clients update their defaults by the time Fusaka goes live,” Beiko said. Related: Vitalik Buterin says the app layer needs ‘good social philosophy’ most The average Ethereum gas limit was around 30 million after increasing in August 2021, according to data on Ycharts. Validators supported raising the network’s gas limit on Feb. 4, increasing the maximum amount of gas used for transactions in a single Ethereum block. It’s just under 36 million at the moment, Ycharts data shows .

This has prompted a growing speculation about a possible trend reversal. While it’s too early to call it a full recovery, investor behavior is starting to suggest something more than a temporary bounce. US investors, for one, appear to be regaining confidence. US Buyers Lead Charge Since April 21, Bitcoin has shown signs of a trend reversal. CryptoQuant observed a renewed buying interest from major investors. Notably, whale accumulation on Binance has preceded each rebound, soon mirrored by activity on US-based crypto exchange Coinbase. This sequence has fueled growing optimism across the crypto market. A key indicator, the consistently positive Coinbase premium, points to steady demand from US investors and minimal resistance from sell-offs. The contrast in market sentiment before and after April 21 signals more than just a temporary recovery. The analysis suggests that the current movement reflects a deeper structural shift, as confidence among American investors appears to be strengthening alongside improving momentum. Binance Futures Volumes Surpass $1.04 Trillion This shift is now visible beyond spot markets. A similar trend reversal appears to be unfolding in the derivatives space as well. As per the latest stats shared by CryptoQuant, Binance has recorded over $1.049 trillion in futures trading volume so far in April 2025, especially fueled by Bitcoin’s recent nearly 10% recovery over the past week. Interestingly, this is the second-highest monthly volume for Binance this year, trailing only January’s $1.23 trillion and surpassing both February’s $962 billion and March’s $683 billion, with a few more days still remaining. Other major crypto exchanges are also reporting strong increases. For instance, OKX posted $519.9 billion, while Bitget reached $435.4 billion. Meanwhile, Bybit recorded $409.2 billion, all showing significant month-over-month growth. The rise in futures activity reflects increased market participation and directional conviction. “The increase in trading volume suggests serious market participation and interest in futures markets during this price move.” The post American Investors Regain Confidence Amidst Structural Shift in Crypto Market appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|United States,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-25 05:28:06

At the same time, market observers — including Prince Filip Karađorđević of Serbia — are noting signs of potential price suppression that could be delaying Bitcoin’s next major rally. Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit Six-Year Low as Corporate Accumulation Surges Post-Election The supply of Bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges has plummeted to its lowest level in over six years, according to Fidelity Digital Assets, a sign that long-term holders — especially publicly traded companies — are rapidly accumulating the digital asset. In a post on X, Fidelity revealed that Bitcoin reserves held on exchanges have fallen to approximately 2.6 million BTC — a level not seen since November 2018. More than 425,000 BTC have been withdrawn from exchanges since the start of November, signaling a major supply squeeze that could have implications for price discovery and long-term valuation. “We have seen Bitcoin supply on exchanges dropping due to public company purchases — something we anticipate accelerating in the near future,” Fidelity said. The exodus of coins from centralized platforms is often interpreted as a bullish signal, implying that holders are securing their Bitcoin in cold storage rather than keeping it readily available for sale. This behavior is typically associated with long-term conviction rather than short-term speculation. Strategy Leads the Corporate Bitcoin Charge Fidelity's analysis shows that publicly listed companies have acquired nearly 350,000 BTC over the same period, representing a massive shift in corporate treasury strategies. Dominating this accumulation is Strategy, the business intelligence and software firm co-founded by Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, which has evolved into a de facto Bitcoin investment vehicle. A snapshot of some of Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases over the past six months (Source: Strategy ) Since November, Strategy has acquired 285,980 BTC — a staggering 81% of the total public company purchases during this time frame. The company disclosed its most recent acquisition of 6,556 BTC on April 21, underscoring its aggressive pace and sustained bullish outlook on Bitcoin. Saylor, who stepped down as CEO in 2022 to focus on Bitcoin strategy, has repeatedly stated that the company views Bitcoin as ”digital gold” and a superior treasury reserve asset in an environment of rising fiscal instability and fiat debasement. The corporate accumulation trend is not limited to the United States. Asian companies are also jumping on board, using Bitcoin to diversify reserves and hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. Japan’s Metaplanet has emerged as a regional leader in Bitcoin adoption, with the firm now holding 5,000 BTC. CEO Simon Gerovich has publicly declared his ambition to double that figure by the end of the year, signaling long-term confidence in the asset’s future. Hong Kong-listed HK Asia Holdings has taken a similar route, announcing plans to raise approximately $8.35 million — a portion of which may be used to bolster its Bitcoin reserves. The move is part of growing momentum among Asia-Pacific firms to incorporate digital assets into their corporate strategies, particularly as inflationary concerns and dollar dominance remain key risk factors in global finance. Institutional Support Grows Post-ETF Approval The decline in exchange reserves and rise in corporate purchases come on the heels of the US Securities and Exchange Commission's historic approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. Fidelity itself launched the Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund as part of this cohort — a development that has played a crucial role in accelerating institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Fidelity Digital Assets, the crypto-focused arm of the $5.8 trillion asset manager Fidelity Investments, has long championed the institutionalization of Bitcoin . Established in 2018, Fidelity Digital was among the earliest Wall Street firms to explore crypto custody and trading solutions for professional investors. With more corporate balance sheets being restructured to include Bitcoin and major financial firms offering regulated exposure through ETFs, Bitcoin’s transformation from fringe technology to institutional-grade asset is now well underway. As Bitcoin exchange reserves dwindle and supply tightens, market observers are closely watching how these dynamics will affect the next leg of Bitcoin's price action. With over 350,000 BTC now in corporate hands — and counting — the available float for retail and smaller institutional investors continues to shrink. Should the current trend continue, Bitcoin’s scarcity-driven valuation thesis could gain even more traction, particularly in a macroeconomic environment increasingly characterized by currency debasement, geopolitical volatility, and demand for non-sovereign stores of value. Bitcoin’s “Omega Candle” Theory Gains Traction Amid Market Suppression Concerns and ETF Momentum Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s current price momentum may be deceptively subdued as it prepares for what some in the crypto community are calling an “omega candle” event — a potential parabolic rally that could redefine the digital asset’s value proposition. According to Prince Filip Karađorđević, the hereditary prince of Serbia and Yugoslavia, deliberate price suppression by powerful actors may be holding Bitcoin back in the short term — but not for long. In an April 24 interview with the crypto-focused outlet Simply Bitcoin, Prince Filip expressed his belief that Bitcoin’s price trajectory is being influenced by unseen hands in the market. “People are able to control the market to some extent,” he said. “Maybe that’s what acted on the 2021 market that suppressed its price from jumping high up. We could get that again in 2025, but there will be one point where [Bitcoin’s price] will run away.” The prince remains firmly bullish, emphasizing that Bitcoin is a fundamentally deflationary asset whose value is “always going to rise over time.” Filip’s comments reference the concept of the “omega candle,” a theory first popularized by Bitcoin advocate and Jan3 CEO Samson Mow. Speaking in November 2024, Mow suggested that once Bitcoin surpasses the long-anticipated $100,000 milestone, its price action could enter a new, hyper-volatile regime. “You’ll start to go up by $10,000 a day or drop by $10,000 a day,” Mow said. “And this is the God candle. After that, we’ll start to see omega candles, which are $100,000 increments daily.” While the prediction is dramatic, it resonates with the growing sentiment that Bitcoin could experience a major breakout as structural factors like institutional adoption, monetary policy shifts, and geopolitical instability push investors toward hard assets. Institutional Accumulation Fuels Uptrend Bitcoin’s fundamentals are strengthening, even if short-term price action appears restrained. Over the past week, Bitcoin recovered more than 9%, boosted by inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to data from Farside Investors, over $2.2 billion worth of BTC was scooped up by ETFs in just the three days leading up to April 23. Bitcoin ETF inflows (Source: Farside Investors ) Bitfinex analysts believe this trend is in line with Bitcoin’s growing resilience compared to equities and fiat currencies. “Bitcoin is rallying due to a combination of macro relief, strong ETF inflows, and growing expectations that the Fed will maintain policy flexibility amid softening economic data,” the exchange noted. These ETFs — approved in early 2024 — have significantly bolstered Bitcoin’s credibility among institutional investors, positioning it as both a hedge and a growth asset in an increasingly volatile economic environment. Despite the bullish undercurrents, macroeconomic uncertainty could still weigh on near-term Bitcoin performance. JPMorgan has placed the odds of a US recession in 2025 at 60%, citing US President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policy as a major risk. The 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, introduced earlier this month, are seen as a potential drag on global economic growth and a source of inflationary pressure that could complicate monetary policy. Still, this uncertainty could paradoxically drive more investors to seek refuge in Bitcoin. As trust in traditional financial systems erodes — a trend noted by both Mow and Filip — Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and capped supply offer an increasingly attractive alternative. Awaiting the Breakout For now, Bitcoin appears to be consolidating just below its all-time high levels, hovering around $93,000. Market participants are watching closely to see whether the current cycle will mirror 2021 — when Bitcoin’s price briefly surged before being pulled back — or if the so-called “omega candle” will finally be ignited. The convergence of institutional inflows, macroeconomic pressures, and increasing geopolitical uncertainty suggests that a breakout may be less a question of “if” and more of “when.” If the predictions hold true, the crypto market could be on the verge of witnessing the most explosive price action in Bitcoin’s history.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-25 05:30:00

Tether Signals Deeper Strategic Involvement as It Increases Stake in Juventus to Above 10% Investment arm Tether controls 6.18% of the club's voting rights, cementing its position as a major shareholder in the Italian Serie A giant. Tether first joined Juventus’ shareholders in February when it bought an 8.2% stake, and now it has further expanded its involvement with this latest move earlier this month. “We believe Juventus is uniquely positioned to lead in embracing technology that can enhance fan engagement, digital experiences and financial flexibility both on and off the pitch,” said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, emphasizing that the deal is about more than just returns. Tether's growing stake signals a broader ambition to become more involved in Juventus' management and long-term financial strategy. The company also expressed openness to participating in future capital infusions to help strengthen the club's balance sheet and prevent shareholder dilution. Founded in 1897, Juventus has 36 league titles and is considered one of the most successful football clubs in Europe. The investment in Juventus is part of Tether’s expanding portfolio, which includes ventures into artificial intelligence, bitcoin mining and agriculture. The company recently reported $13 billion in profits for 2024, providing significant firepower for further strategic investments.

The decision is being discussed inside Beijing as both economic pressure and trade friction intensify. Officials involved are also allegedly reviewing a full waiver for tariffs on plane leases, as part of a wider conversation around easing restrictions. This development followed comments made on Thursday by President Donald Trump, who confirmed that members of his administration had been holding meetings with Chinese officials regarding trade. Trump made the statement during a joint press event with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre. When asked which officials were involved in the discussions, Trump replied: “It doesn’t matter who ‘they’ is. We may reveal it later, but they had meetings this morning, and we’ve been meeting with China.” PBOC ramps up liquidity with biggest cash injection since 2023 While Trump’s White House pushed trade talks forward, the People’s Bank of China responded to mounting economic stress by injecting 600 billion yuan—about $82.3 billion—into the financial system on Friday using its one-year medium-term lending facility. The move came as a direct counter to the impact of rising US tariffs , which is as high as 145%. After factoring out expiring loans, this means a net increase of 500 billion yuan for April, the highest monthly liquidity boost since December 2023. In a written statement, the central bank said the operation is meant to maintain “ample liquidity” in the system. Wang Qing, chief macro analyst at Golden Credit Rating, said the decision indicates a monetary policy that aims to stay supportive under growing trade pressure. “This is also to ensure liquidity conditions remain ample when the government’s fundraising via special government debt issuances gathers pace,” Wang said. The PBOC had already been facing growing calls for policy loosening. Investors have been demanding stronger support measures as China’s economy faces both external trade hurdles and internal funding needs. The fresh liquidity could help banks handle surging demand for cash during early May holidays and back the launch of special bonds that started this week. Last month, the central bank adjusted how the MLF rate is set. It now allows banks to submit bids at different price points instead of relying on one fixed rate. At the same time, the PBOC has stopped announcing the cost of these one-year loans altogether. These changes are part of a shift toward managing the economy through shorter-term interest rates while maintaining what officials call a “moderately loose” stance. The return of a large-scale MLF injection was unexpected. In recent months, the PBOC had been trying to reduce reliance on the tool, often replacing it with three- to six-month reverse repurchase agreements. But this April, 1.7 trillion yuan worth of reverse repos are set to mature, the largest monthly total since the tool was introduced in October. An update on how the PBOC plans to handle this month’s reverse repo operations is expected at the end of April. Ming Ming, chief economist at Citic Securities, said the MLF move may help reduce pressure from the repo maturities and delay any need for cuts to banks’ reserve requirement ratio. “While the policy significance of MLF has decreased,” Ming said, “it remains a useful tool for the PBOC to inject longer-term liquidity.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In a press release published by the agency on Apr. 24, the Federal Reserve said it will no longer require state member banks to give advance notice before launching or participating in crypto-related activities. Instead, these activities will now be reviewed under the usual bank supervision process. This move marks a shift from the Fed’s earlier stance, which called for extra caution due to potential risks tied to digital assets. The Fed also canceled its 2023 guidance that limited how banks could engage with stablecoins , or “dollar tokens.” In addition, the Fed, alongside the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, withdrew from two joint statements made the same year.

By stepping back from these positions, the Fed appears to be opening the door to more bank participation in crypto while still keeping an eye on potential risks through regular oversight. The agency said that it will continue to monitor risks, but the decision is expected to lower compliance burdens and open new doors for bank involvement in the digital asset sector. This policy change follows a wider shift in Washington. In January, the Securities and Exchange Commission rolled back a rule that had forced banks holding crypto to list it as a liability, easing pressure on institutions. The Fed’s latest move comes as the Trump administration continues to position itself as pro-crypto. President Trump has publicly vowed to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet,” signaling that more regulatory changes could be on the way.

The company’s Apr. 25 fundraising announcement named Lightspeed Faction as the lead investor, with participation from Delphi Digital, Robot Ventures, Maven11, Mechanism Capital, and Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko. The round brings MagicBlock’s total funding to $10.5 million, following a $3 million pre-seed round led by a16z CSX in late 2024. The company said the new capital will be used to grow its engineering team and expand infrastructure for developers. MagicBlock is developing a technology called Ephemeral Rollups, which gives apps fast speeds and flexibility without leaving Solana ( SOL ). These rollups allow apps to process actions quickly while still staying connected to Solana’s core features, such as its liquidity and tools. This means developers don’t need to use layer-2 chains or bridges, which often split up user data and make apps harder to use together. “Every developer wants to build on the fastest chain with the deepest liquidity – that’s Solana. But they also want the customizability and real-time performance of a Web2 server. With MagicBlock, they don’t have to choose.” — Andrea Fortugno, MagicBlock co-founder You might also like: Crypto wagers generated over $81b in gaming revenue in 2024 alone despite legal barriers: report The startup is already working with projects like Flash Trade, Supersize, dTelecom, and Jito ( JTO ) to enable real-time trading, gaming, and communication directly on Solana. Instead of splitting states across chains, MagicBlock’s approach allows apps to remain composable while deploying app-specific plugins such as pricing streams and custom sequencing. The raise comes during a slow period for blockchain gaming. According to DappRadar’s Q1 2025 report , web3 gaming raised $91 million, a 71% decrease from Q4 2024. Projects building gaming infrastructure received the majority of the funding. The number of deals increased by 35% despite the decline in overall funding, indicating that investors are still supporting base-layer technologies even as they exercise more caution. MagicBlock’s raise shows there is still a strong appetite for infrastructure that can deliver scalable, on-chain gaming experiences without trade-offs.

The team has officially approved a new decentralized app (DApp) called Fruity Pi, and according to community member DR Altcoin , DApps and long-awaited KYB approvals might speed up. What is Fruity Pi? Fruity Pi is a puzzle game where players match fruits and earn rewards. Users can also link their Pi wallets and spend Pi tokens in the game. The Pi Core Team has given it a purple check mark, which means the app has been reviewed and approved. This approval is a big step, as only verified apps are allowed to fully launch and grow within the Pi ecosystem. DR Altcoin believes this move could speed up other pending approvals and finally kickstart delayed KYB (Know Your Business) checks—an important requirement for businesses to launch services on Pi. Major Pi Network Announcement During Consensus 2025 Event? These updates are happening just before the major Consensus 2025 summit in Toronto. This is one of the biggest events in the crypto space, and many expect the Pi Core Team to be present. With a new DApp approved and a possible wave of more approvals coming, Pi Network might be preparing to show its progress on a global stage. Pi Coin Exchange listing Fading Despite recent progress in the Pi ecosystem, Pi Coin is still facing problems getting listed on major exchanges. HTX was the first to list Pi after its mainnet launch in February 2025, but later removed it. Now, crypto payment service Banxa has also stopped supporting Pi Coin. Even BitMart, which once supported Pi, has paused trading for more than a month, waiting for KYB approvals before moving forward with the 1:1 Pi swap. Meanwhile, top exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have not shown any signs of supporting Pi Coin. Pi coin Price Analysis Pi Coin is facing increasing bearish sentiment, despite the overall crypto market doing well. Pi Coin price today is trading at $0.65 . It has stayed in a tight range between $0.60 and $0.68 over the past two weeks. While there’s been a small price increase in the last 24 hours, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) has dropped below 50, suggesting there’s still pressure on the price. FAQ Can I really earn and spend Pi tokens in Fruity Pi? Yes, Fruity Pi allows players to link their Pi wallets, earn rewards, and spend Pi tokens within the game. What announcements can we expect from Pi Network at the Consensus 2025 Event ? With Consensus 2025 approaching, the Pi Core Team may reveal new DApp approvals, KYB updates, and ecosystem progress. When will Pi Coin be listed on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase? There’s no official timeline yet. Exchange listings likely depend on KYB approvals and Pi Network’s mainnet readiness. Is it a good time to buy Pi Coin? Pi Coin is still in early development with limited exchange access, so it’s best to watch for updates before making a move.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-25 05:39:43

Bitcoin miners started selling, and the same can be said about Ethereum whales and other investors. #Bitcoin $BTC miners locked in over $18.57 million in profits as prices surged past $93,000! pic.twitter.com/ZgXosyJ5WU — Ali (@ali_charts) April 24, 2025 Miners, the backbone of the largest proof-of-work blockchain network, are generally bullish. They tend to hold to their BTC during market rallies. However, they sometimes lock in profits during market uncertainty, especially if they have to cover some costs. Following the massive turbulence experienced in the past several weeks due to Trump’s Trade War, when BTC’s price tumbled to a multi-month low of under $75,000, miners decided to secure some profits after the cryptocurrency added nearly $20,000 since April 9. More specifically, they locked in around $18.6 million in profits as bitcoin jumped above $93,000 earlier this week, said Ali Martinez. The landscape around Ethereum is more dire. As previously reported , many long-term ETH investors, such as Galaxy Digital, had decided to dispose of large portions of their ether holdings. More recent data shared by the same analyst indicates that 305,000 ETH (valued at roughly $540 million at today’s prices) was moved to exchanges within just a week, which is typically a sign for future sales. Additionally, Martinez said Ethereum whales started selling again after the recent trend reversal , offloading more than 63,000 ETH within just two days. In USD terms, this stash equals $110 million.

In a joint stipulation filed with Dragonchain on April 24 in a Seattle federal court, the SEC said it “believes the dismissal of this case is appropriate,” citing the work of the agency’s Crypto Task Force in helping “develop the regulatory framework for crypto assets.” “The Commission and the Defendants stipulate that this Litigation be dismissed with prejudice [...] and without costs or fees to either party,” the filing reads. The SEC sued Dragonchain, Inc. ; its backer, the Dragonchain Foundation; The Dragon Company; and Dragonchain’s founder, Joseph Roets, in August 2024, claiming they raised $16.5 million through a crypto token that was an unregistered securities offering. According to the SEC, the Dragonchain (DRGN) tokens raised $14 million in an August 2017 presale and an initial coin offering ( ICO ) that ran in October and November of that year. At the time, it said the company needed to register as the tokens were investment contracts under securities laws. The SEC said a further $2.5 million worth of DRGN was sold between 2019 and 2022, which it alleged was used to cover business expenses and develop the firm’s tech. The suit was stayed in October after Dragonchain made a settlement offer to the SEC, which was extended in January after the agency said the case should remain paused due to US President Donald Trump’s sweeping executive order earlier that month calling for the country’s “leadership in digital assets.” Meanwhile, the DRGN token has jumped 95% over the past day to over 8.5 cents on news of the SEC’s planned dismissal, but it’s still down around 98.5% from its $5.46 peak in January 2018, according to CoinGecko. Dragonchain’s token jumped after the SEC filed to dismiss its lawsuit. Source: CoinGecko SEC backs off crypto under Trump It’s the latest case involving crypto that the SEC has abandoned under the Trump administration.

Related: SEC task force met with Trump-supporting firms to discuss crypto regulation An agency memo shows its task force met with Dragonchain representatives on March 24 to discuss how the SEC should approach handling crypto. The SEC has also dismissed some of its most high-profile lawsuits against crypto firms, including its actions against Coinbase, Ripple and Kraken. It’s also dropped investigations into other crypto firms, including OpenSea, Crypto.com and Immutable, with no further action planned.

The prediction, outlined in a report released on Thursday , says the growth in adoption would be driven by regulatory developments and increased interest from both financial institutions and the public sector. According to the banking giant, stablecoin supply could reach $1.6 trillion by the end of the decade under its base-case scenario, while a more optimistic outlook places the figure at $3.7 trillion. Citigroup Warns Stablecoin Market Could Stall at $500B Without Regulatory Progress However, Citigroup also cautioned that if regulatory hurdles and integration challenges persist, the market could be limited to just $500 billion. The report comes amid a shifting regulatory landscape in the United States, where President Trump’s pro-crypto administration has renewed momentum for stablecoin legislation. Congress is currently reviewing proposals in both chambers that could pave the way for traditional financial giants, such as Bank of America, to issue U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins. Citigroup noted that clear regulations could significantly boost demand for U.S. Treasuries, positioning stablecoin issuers among the largest holders of government debt by 2030.

While Citigroup acknowledged the transformative potential of stablecoins, it also warned they could disrupt traditional banking through “deposit substitution.” Some banks are reportedly lobbying for stricter regulations to limit which entities can issue stablecoins, aiming to protect their role in the financial system as stablecoin adoption accelerates. Active Stablecoin Wallets Surge Over 50% in One Year As reported, the number of active stablecoin wallets has surged by over 50% in the past year , reflecting growing adoption and engagement within the digital asset ecosystem. More specifically, active stablecoin addresses increased from 19.6 million in February 2024 to 30 million in February 2025, marking a 53% year-on-year growth. Growing institutional adoption, expanding use in payments, and rising integration in decentralized finance (DeFi) has played a key role in the increase in active stablecoin wallets. These factors have made stablecoins a fundamental component of the digital economy, offering liquidity, stability, and accessibility to users worldwide. Beyond active addresses, the total stablecoin supply has also surged. In February 2024, the total supply stood at $138 billion, but by February 2025, it had climbed to $225 billion, reflecting a 63% year-on-year increase. Recently, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has weighed in on stablecoins , arguing that U.S. dollar-pegged digital assets could strengthen the dollar’s global dominance. Waller claimed that stablecoins already play an important role in the financial ecosystem.

While nothing has been officially confirmed, recent events have fueled speculation that something big might be brewing behind the scenes. On April 23, Pokémon HOME rolled out an update that introduced a new medal collection feature. However, this small change in the privacy policy attracted the crypto community’s attention. Notably, in certain regions, the policy now mentions Parasol Technologies as a developer the Pokémon Company may share user data with. Parasol is a blockchain gaming studio recently acquired by Mysten Labs, the team behind the Sui blockchain. This quiet addition has sparked speculation about a potential Pokémon partnership with Sui. On the same day, the Sui Foundation announced Parasol would be launching blockchain-based trading card games. The blog briefly mentioned Pokémon NFTs but later removed them. Shotgun , a popular crypto voice, noticed this and explained that these “medals” are not locked tokens but tradable digital items, making them even more exciting. He’s fully ready to dive in if the news proves true. Still, not all reactions were positive. One X user reminded people that speculation often leads nowhere without hard proof, like contracts or code. For now, the Pokémon-Sui connection remains a strong possibility, but not yet a confirmed reality. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News: KuCoin Thailand Officially Launches as SEC-Approved Crypto Exchange , SUI Crypto Price Surge SUI Price today has broken through key resistance levels, now sitting comfortably above $3.00.

The Asif Ali Zardari-led country also closed its land borders and shut its airspace to all airlines owned and operated by India. Mr. Asif Ali Zardari’s country announced that it has shut its airspace to all Indian airlines and those operated by the nation. The Islamic nation has also halted all its trade with India. Pakistan announced that the suspension affects all goods passing through the country and those from third nations. As a result of the airspace closure, Air India said that all flights to the United Kingdom, the Middle East, and North America would have to take a longer alternative route. Pakistan announces punitive measures targeting India Amidst the growing tensions between the two nations, Pakistan had announced suspension of trade with India . The Asif Ali Zardari-led nation clarified that the suspension of trade included goods passing through from third countries. Pakistan also said it has shut its airspace to all the airlines owned or operated by India. Following the closure of the Pakistan airspace, Air India has said that flights would take longer alternative routes. Air India confirmed that the affected flights included those heading to Europe, North America, the Middle East, and the United Kingdom. In a similar move, Pakistan said it had canceled all visas under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme, which enables some travelers to possess a ‘Special Travel’ credential exempting them from visas. Mr Asif Ali Zardari’s country clarified that Sikh religious pilgrims were exempted from the visa cancellation. Indian citizens living in Pakistan under the SVES were instructed to leave the country within 48 hours. The country also said that the Indian Defence, Air Advisers, and Naval Officers in Islamabad were ordered to leave by April 30th. Pakistan also announced that the posts in the Indian High Commission were nullified, and the support staff of the officials were ordered to return home. Pakistan said that it was concerned about the loss of lives of tourists and denied involvement in the Tuesday terror attack. It also described the punitive measures taken by Indians as unjust, unilateral, irresponsible, politically motivated, and devoid of any legal merit. The country also admitted that Kashmir remains an unresolved dispute. The country condemned all forms of terrorist attacks and also rejected India’s measures. Mr Asif Ali Zardari-led country said that in the absence of an investigation and evidence, any attempts to link the terror attacks with Pakistan were frivolous and devoid of rationality. India blames Pakistan for Tuesday’s Kashmir attack India will identify, track and punish every terrorist, their handlers and their backers. We will pursue them to the ends of the earth. India’s spirit will never be broken by terrorism. pic.twitter.com/sV3zk8gM94 — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 24, 2025 India has blamed its neighbor for the terror attack in Pahalgam, a renowned tourist destination in Kashmir, which both nations claim as their territory. The Indian authorities said that 24 of the victims of the terror assault were Indians. One of the people killed was a local tourist guide, and another was from Nepal. Indian authorities said that the Kashmir terror attack is the worst in many years, aimed at civilians. Many local shops and businesses in the affected area closed to protest the killing of the tourists. On Wednesday, Vikram Misri, India’s foreign secretary, said that Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, summoned an emergency cabinet meeting. In the meeting, the Indian leaders decided that the terror attack had some cross-border connections to their neighboring nation, Pakistan, without offering any evidence. Mr Misri said the land border between the two nations would be shut. He also said that the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, under which the two nations jointly manage a river system crucial to both, would be put on hold until Pakistan ceased to support cross-border terror attacks. Some diplomats had been asked to leave New Delhi amidst the growing tensions between the two nations. Indian diplomats were also recalled from the neighboring country.

43777179,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=738023,1745560833,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43777179.jpeg,"Before Dogecoin Hits $1, This Needs To Happen — Analyst Explains",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/before-dogecoin-hits-1-this-needs-to-happen/,"VisionPulsed, a popular YouTube chart analyst, believes Dogecoin’s path to the long-awaited one-dollar milestone still runs through a narrow technical corridor that has not yet been cleared. In his latest video, titled “THIS MUST HAPPEN TO CONFIRM DOGECOIN $1 PUMP and AVOID BEAR MARKET CRASH,” the analyst argues that Dogecoin and its bellwether Bitcoin have both broken their multi-month downtrends, but stresses that the market has one final proving ground to cross before a full-blown uptrend can take hold. When Will Dogecoin Reach $1? “We broke the downtrend—no matter how you draw it, it’s broken,” VisionPulsed tells viewers, pointing to Dogecoin’s diagonal resistance line that dates back to early 2024. In his framework, that downtrend was one of five “layers of hell,” a tongue-in-cheek name for stacked Fibonacci retracements and moving-average caps that have suffocated rallies since the 2021 peak. Three of those layers, he notes, are already “green,” and the fourth—essentially the 0.618 retracement—has now stalled price action. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $3? Analyst Weighs In Historically, VisionPulsed adds, every decisive trend break in this cycle has been followed by a retracement that “back-tests” the former resistance as new support. He cites two prior episodes on Bitcoin where the market circled back 50–60 days later to kiss the trendline before rallying. A similar rhythm would place Dogecoin’s potential retest in May. “It doesn’t have to happen,” he concedes, “but I’m not going to ignore it.” Much of the argument rests on Bitcoin, whose breakout he says is more advanced than Dogecoin. VisionPulsed sets $94,000 as the last bearish redoubt for Bitcoin—the level where the 0.618 retracement and a prior horizontal shelf converge. “This $94,000 range is basically the last resistance before it’s full-blown bull-market bullish,” he states. If Bitcoin vaults that barrier, his chart implies an air-pocket move to $100,000 and then $128,000, a scenario that would almost certainly lift Dogecoin with it. Conversely, a rejection at $94,000 and a slide back to the broken trend would keep the larger market in check and extend Dogecoin’s sideways drift. The analyst insists he has “learned [his] lesson saying things have to happen,” framing the levels as conditional road signs rather than certainties. Related Reading: Dogecoin Trader Who Nailed 300% Rally Says It’s About To Repeat For Dogecoin itself, VisionPulsed is candid: an explosive ascent is not imminent. “I still think the best-case scenario for Dogecoin is sideways,” he says, clarifying that by “up” he means the kind of vertical “barrage of green candles” last seen in early 2021. What encourages him is the subtle upward curl of the daily stochastic RSI—“the higher it goes, the more bullish probability increases,” he notes—without yet flashing the overbought extremes that preceded previous eruptions. Overlaying macro correlations, the analyst is watching the euro-dollar pair, which he argues has foreshadowed local Bitcoin tops throughout this cycle. If the euro rolls over while Bitcoin pushes into the mid-$90,000, past behavior suggests a near-term crypto peak could follow. Still, he declines to forecast a final top, saying, “We’ll worry about that when the time comes.” Taken together, VisionPulsed’s roadmap proposes a quiet consolidation through late April into May, a possible trendline retest, and then a decision point at Bitcoin $94,000. Only when that barrier is flipped into support, he contends, does Dogecoin earn the structural clearance to challenge the psychological one-dollar marker. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.175.

This signals that the regulator is adopting a much more collaborative posture, especially after the agency dropped several high-profile lawsuits against crypto firms. However, many of these firms are tied to Trump’s political network. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve recently rescinded restrictive 2022 and 2023 guidance, easing the path for banks to engage in crypto and stablecoin activities. These rollbacks align with President Trump’s push for pro-crypto innovation. Thanks to the easing regulations and attitudes towards crypto, New Hampshire advanced House Bill 302. This bill will allow the treasury to invest 10% of funds in Bitcoin, alongside other crypto-friendly bills. Overall, the United States is in the middle of a big regulatory shift in its approach to cryptocurrencies, which is evident in developments from the SEC, Federal Reserve, and individual states. SEC Crypto Task Force Expands Industry Talks The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto task force, which is now under the leadership of Commissioner Hester Peirce, maintained momentum in its engagement with the digital asset industry and continued to reassess regulation after the departure of former chair Gary Gensler. On April 24, the task force held a private meeting with representatives from Ondo Finance and legal experts from Davis Polk and Wardwell to deliberate on the issuance and sale of wrapped, tokenized versions of publicly traded US securities. Ondo Finance contributed $1 million to Donald Trump’s inauguration fund, and reportedly wanted to address registration and compliance questions related to tokenized securities. The representatives from the company also floated the possibility of establishing a regulatory sandbox for innovation in the sector. The meeting is part of the very noticeable shift in the SEC’s tone as the agency enters a new phase under Paul Atkins. He was appointed by Trump and was sworn in as SEC Chair on April 21. While Atkins has yet to implement his formal crypto agenda, the agency is reaching out to key industry players. On April 25, the task force will hold a roundtable to discuss digital asset custody, featuring input from major firms including Kraken, Anchorage Digital Bank, and WisdomTree. This discussion will happen amid the heightened institutional interest in crypto custody services after the landmark approvals of crypto exchange-traded funds earlier in 2024. Roundtable timeline (Source: SEC ) Despite the growing cooperation between the SEC and the crypto industry, there are still some questions about the agency’s future enforcement direction. Although the SEC affirmed its commitment to pursuing fraud-related cases, it recently dropped its lawsuit against Hex founder Richard Heart on the same day Atkins assumed office. Moreover, the SEC signaled that it will cease investigations or legal action against several prominent crypto firms, including Ripple, Coinbase, and Kraken. Interestingly, all of these companies have links to donations or executive support for Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign or inauguration events. These developments suggest that the agency may be recalibrating its stance toward digital asset regulation, and could potentially usher in a much more collaborative approach with the industry. Federal Reserve Pulls Back Crypto Restrictions The US Federal Reserve also recently took a big step toward easing restrictions on banks engaging with cryptocurrencies and stablecoins by withdrawing previous guidance that discouraged such activities. In a statement that was released on April 24, the Board of Governors announced it is rescinding its 2022 supervisory letter, which required state member banks to notify the Fed in advance of any crypto-related plans or operations. Going forward, the central bank stated that all crypto activities will be evaluated through its standard supervisory process. (Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ) The Federal Reserve also withdrew its 2023 guidance that imposed limitations on how state banks could interact with stablecoin ecosystems. Initially, this guidance pointed out various concerns, including the potential for crypto assets to affect financial stability, compromise consumer protection, and introduce systemic risks through mechanisms like destabilizing bank runs or payment system disruptions. It also flagged the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit activities like money laundering and terrorist financing. In a broader regulatory rollback, the Fed, alongside the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, retracted two statements from 2023 that warned banks about working with crypto firms potentially engaged in fraudulent behavior. These earlier joint advisories criticized misleading disclosures from crypto companies, and explained that such practices could cause serious harm to both retail and institutional investors. This move was one of the Federal Reserve’s first major crypto-related actions since President Donald Trump’s return to office and aligns with the broader administrative strategy to position the United States as a global leader in financial innovation. It also follows the Securities and Exchange Commission’s revocation in January of a rule that required banks to treat held crypto assets as liabilities on their balance sheets. This accounting standard was seen as a major barrier to institutional adoption of digital assets. New Hampshire Advances Crypto Investment Bill Thanks to the easing regulations, many US states are making a lot of progress with their own crypto bills. A bill that will allow New Hampshire to invest a portion of its state funds in digital assets and precious metals recently advanced to a full Senate vote after receiving approval from a second committee on April 23 in a 4-1 vote. (Source: General Court of New Hampshire ) The bill is known as House Bill 302, and the legislation was first introduced in January and passed the New Hampshire House earlier this month by a narrow margin of 192–179. If passed by the Senate and signed by the governor, the bill will authorize the state treasury to allocate up to 10% of its general funds into cryptocurrencies with market capitalizations exceeding $500 billion. Currently, this is a category limited only to Bitcoin. The proposal started a debate among lawmakers. Democratic Representative Terry Spahris is very much opposed to the bill, and argued that the bill is redundant and potentially risky. Spahris also suggested that the state treasurer already possesses the necessary authority to manage investments without additional legislation. In contrast, Republican Representative Jordan Ulery expressed support, and stated that the bill could provide a massive return on investment for the state. Beyond HB 302, New Hampshire is also advancing two other blockchain-related bills . HB 639 focuses on dispute resolution and regulatory clarity for blockchain technologies, while HB 310 addresses real-world asset tokenization and stablecoin integration. The state’s legislative momentum mirrors broader crypto trends, with Arizona taking an even more aggressive stance by exploring the creation of a dedicated strategic Bitcoin reserve, potentially making it the first US state to do so.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|ONDO,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-25 06:03:33

Ver is facing charges for his alleged involvement in mail fraud , tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. Per congressional filings , Ver defrauded the IRS, causing a loss of at least $48 million. Ver has denied the charges, citing logistical challenges in filing the exit tax, including the illiquid nature of the Bitcoin market at that time. In a video posted on his social media in January, Ver appealed to Trump , saying that he was being threatened with a possible sentence of more than 100 years in prison for his role in promoting crypto. Roger Stone Files Paperwork, Lobbying for Bitcoin Jesus According to the report, Roger Stone is lobbying Congress for Ver to change the law under which he was charged. He filed paperwork in February , which read that Stone had been retained by Ver and paid $600,000 to help his client’s case. His lobbying comes at a time when President Trump has embraced crypto, granting clemency to crypto pioneers, including darknet marketplace Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht . In February, Ulbricht openly called for support for Roger Ver , seeking a pardon over his tax evasion charges. He expressed gratitude to Ver for supporting him during his imprisonment and called on others to rally behind Ver. “Roger Ver was there for me when I was down and needed help. Now Roger needs our support,” Ulbricht wrote on social media. “No one should spend the rest of their life in prison over taxes.” Additionally, President Trump has backed away from Gensler-era enforcement against several crypto companies.

This is my story: pic.twitter.com/NEetn1b3r4 — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) January 27, 2025 Roger Ver Deserves a Presidential Pardon: Stone Last December, Stone posted an essay explaining why President Trump must act in pardoning Roger Ver. “By pardoning Roger Ver, you won’t just be freeing one man—you’ll be declaring that America still stands for the dreamers, the builders, the innovators who dare to imagine a freer world,” he wrote at the time. Stone told New York Times that he is not relying on his long-time relationship with Mr. Trump to help Ver. “I have not lobbied any official in the executive branch of government including the president regarding his case or a pardon,” said Stone, adding that he was primarily hired to advise Ver’s legal counsel.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy hypothetically hoarding nearly 48% of Bitcoin’s total supply wouldn’t pose any risk to the Bitcoin protocol or its price, says Bitcoin Standard author Saifedean Ammous. “If Michael Saylor ends up with 10 million Bitcoin, what is he going to do? He’s likely just going to leverage them to buy more Bitcoin,” Ammous said during an April 25 interview with crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano. Ammous dismisses Bitcoin hoarders posing risks “Ultimately, I don’t see how it would threaten the protocol in the serious sense,” Ammous said. Ammous said if Saylor managed to accumulate 10 million Bitcoin ( BTC ), he would be unlikely to “wake up one day and say let’s try and hard fork this so we can make another 5 million Bitcoin supply so that I can have 15.” He reiterated it would diminish the value of his existing 10 million Bitcoin.

At the time of publication, Saylor’s firm Strategy holds 538,200 Bitcoin, worth approximately $50.18 billion, according to Saylor Tracker. Meanwhile, the BlackRock iShares spot Bitcoin ETF has net assets worth $54.48 billion, which equates to roughly 585,000 Bitcoin, according to BlackRock data. Strategy paid an average of $67,793 per Bitcoin. Source: Saylor Tracker Collectively, the two firms hold approximately 5.3% of the total Bitcoin supply. However, Ammous said this is not a cause for concern. “It’s not like Michael Saylor or Larry Fink owns all those Bitcoins. They have shareholders who own all those Bitcoins, or ETF holders that own those Bitcoins.” “To the extent that BlackRock and Strategy hold those, they hold those because they are doing their fiduciary share of duties to their shareholders and the ETF holders in a satisfactory way,” Ammous added. Related: ARK Invest ups its 2030 Bitcoin bull case prediction to $2.4M Ammous explained that if BlackRock or Strategy ever started to manage their holdings in a way that’s harmful to shareholders or ETF holders, or starts abusing their position, that’s when investors would sell and look for other ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin. On April 24, Cointelegraph reported that Twenty One Capital, a new Bitcoin treasury company led by Strike founder Jack Mallers with the support of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald, is looking to supplant Strategy to become the “superior vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.” Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

43777468,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152645,1745561410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Perplexity CEO Reveals Shocking Browser Tracking Plan for Ads,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/perplexity-browser-tracking-ads/,"In the rapidly evolving world of AI and technology, where data is often described as the new oil, privacy concerns are paramount, especially for those in the cryptocurrency space who value decentralization and control. A recent revelation from Perplexity, a rising player in the AI search arena, has sparked significant discussion regarding user data and its monetization. The company’s CEO, Aravind Srinivas, shared insights into their strategy that echoes the practices of tech giants like Google and Meta, focusing heavily on data collection to fuel their ambitions in the online advertising market. Understanding Perplexity’s Browser Tracking Ambition Perplexity isn’t just building an AI-powered search engine; it’s developing its own web browser, code-named Comet, set for launch in May. The CEO’s comments on the TBPN podcast revealed a core motivation behind this move: gathering extensive user data. Srinivas explicitly stated that the browser is intended to collect information on everything users do online, outside of the Perplexity app itself. This comprehensive browser tracking is deemed essential because, according to Srinivas, user interactions within the AI search interface, often work-related, don’t provide a sufficiently detailed profile for effective advertising. The goal is to understand users beyond their professional queries. Srinivas highlighted the value of knowing user behaviors like purchasing habits, travel destinations (hotels, restaurants), and general browsing activity. This deeper insight into personal interests and spending patterns is seen as crucial for building accurate user profiles that can be leveraged for advertising purposes. The belief is that users will accept this tracking because it will result in ‘hyper personalized’ ads that are more relevant to their interests. Perplexity’s Playbook: Following the Giants? This strategy of using a browser to collect vast amounts of user data for advertising isn’t new; it’s a playbook successfully executed by tech behemoths. Google, for instance, built its immense market value, partly by tracking users across the internet via its Chrome browser and other services to power its advertising business. Similarly, Meta utilizes tracking technologies like Pixels embedded on websites globally to gather data, even from non-users of its platforms, to enhance its ad targeting. Even Apple, which often positions itself as a privacy champion, engages in some form of user tracking for advertising within its ecosystem. Perplexity’s approach, as outlined by its CEO, seems to directly emulate this model, aiming to build a similar data advantage to compete in the lucrative online advertising space. Data Collection and User Privacy Concerns The open discussion about extensive data collection through a browser raises significant privacy concerns. While Perplexity suggests users will be comfortable with tracking for personalized ads, the broader public sentiment, especially in regions like the U.S. and Europe, has shown increasing distrust towards big tech over data handling practices. Regulatory bodies are also scrutinizing how companies collect and use personal information. The timing of Perplexity’s CEO’s comments is particularly notable, given that Google is currently facing an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice. The DOJ alleges monopolistic behavior, partly centered around Google’s dominance in search and online advertising, and has even suggested divesting Chrome. Interestingly, both OpenAI and Perplexity have expressed interest in acquiring the Chrome browser business if Google were forced to sell, underscoring the perceived strategic value of owning a widely used browser for data access. Expanding Reach: Beyond Browser Tracking Perplexity’s ambition isn’t limited to its upcoming browser. The company is also actively pursuing partnerships to expand its reach, particularly in the mobile sector. A recent announcement revealed a partnership with Motorola to pre-install the Perplexity app on the new Razr series, allowing access via Moto AI. Reports also suggest talks with Samsung, another major mobile device manufacturer. These moves indicate Perplexity’s broader strategy to embed its AI search capabilities into user workflows across different platforms, complementing its browser tracking efforts to build a comprehensive understanding of user behavior. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI Search and Advertising? Perplexity’s candid approach highlights the intense competition in the AI and search markets and the critical role of data in this battle. By aiming to track user activity across the web, Perplexity is attempting to build a data moat similar to those held by established tech giants. This strategy, while potentially lucrative for targeted advertising, will undoubtedly face scrutiny regarding user privacy and regulatory compliance. The success of Perplexity’s browser and its data collection strategy will depend heavily on user adoption, trust, and the evolving landscape of data privacy regulations. In summary, Perplexity is making a bold move by developing its own browser with the explicit aim of extensive user tracking to power its online advertising business. This strategy positions Perplexity in direct competition with data-rich giants like Google and Meta, raising important questions about the future of user privacy in the age of pervasive AI and personalized advertising.

The three sham crypto consulting firms — BlockNovas, Angeloper Agency and SoftGlide — are being used by the North Korean hacker group Contagious Interview to distribute malware through fake job interviews, Silent Push Threat Analysts said in an April 24 report. Silent Push senior threat analyst Zach Edwards said in an April 24 statement to X that two shell companies are registered as legitimate businesses in the United States. “These websites and a huge network of accounts on hiring / recruiting websites are being used to trick people into applying for jobs,” he said. “During the job application process an error message is displayed as someone tries to record an introduction video. The solution is an easy click fix copy and paste trick, which leads to malware if the unsuspecting developer completes the process.” During the sham job interview, an error message is displayed, requiring the user to click, copy, and paste to fix it, which leads to the malware infection. Source: Zach Edwards Three strains of malware — BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret and Otter Cookie — are being used according to Silent Push. BeaverTail is malware primarily designed for information theft and to load further stages of malware. OtterCookie and InvisibleFerret mainly target sensitive information, including crypto wallet keys and clipboard data. Silent Push analysts said in the report that hackers use GitHub, job listing's and freelancer websites to look for victims. AI used to create fake employees The ruse also involves the hackers using AI-generated images to create profiles of employees for the three front crypto companies and stealing images of real people. “There are numerous fake employees and stolen images from real people being used across this network. We’ve documented some of the obvious fakes and stolen images, but it’s very important to appreciate that the impersonation efforts from this campaign are different,” Edwards said. “In one of the examples, the threat actors took a real photo from a real person, and then appeared to have run it through an AI image modifier tool to create a subtly different version of that same image.” Related: Fake Zoom malware steals crypto while it’s ‘stuck’ loading, user warns This malware campaign has been ongoing since 2024. Edwards says there are known public victims. Silent Push identified two developers targeted by the campaign; one of them reportedly had their MetaMask wallet compromised. The FBI has since shut down at least one of the companies. “The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) acquired the Blocknovas domain, but Softglide is still live, along with some of their other infrastructure,” Edwards said. At least three crypto founders have reported in March that they foiled an attempt from alleged North Korean hackers to steal sensitive data through fake Zoom calls. Groups such as the Lazarus Group are the prime suspects in some of the biggest cyber thefts in Web3, including the Bybit $1.4 billion hack and the $600 million Ronin network hack.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum finally woke up this week with a 12% price increase, which took it to the key resistance at $1,800. Since then, ETH entered a pullback, but buyers seem determined to eventually break the current resistance and challenge the $2,000 level. It is the first time since December that this cryptocurrency is giving a clear sign of a possible reversal. However, buy volume needs to continue to make higher highs to be confident on a renewed rally. Looking ahead, optimism is returning to the market and ETH has a real chance to put a stop to the downtrend. To enter a sustained rally, the price has to move above $2,000 which will allow ETH to recover some of the losses from previous months. Chart by TradingView Ripple ( XRP ) XRP was more timid this week but still managed to book a respectable 6% increase. This has consolidated the price above $2, which is key support. As long as XRP stays above this level, the bias leans bullish. The problem with the current momentum is that the volume is decreasing. This acts like a break on any attempt from buyers to take the price higher. Nevertheless, XRP has made steady progress in the past three weeks. Looking ahead, XRP has key resistance at $2.3 and $2.6. If bulls manage to clear those levels and turn them into support, then the asset has a good chance to revisit $3. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) ADA booked an impressive 16% price increase this week, making it the best-performing coin on our list. This allowed it to finally clear the $0.64 resistance, which is now acting as support. If this bullish momentum continues, then Cardano buyers will aim for $0.9, which is the next major resistance on the chart. However, the buy volume remains relatively low compared to the past. Looking ahead, ADA has a good shot to revisit $0.9 or even get back above $1. For this to become a reality the current momentum has to intensify on increasing volume. So far, this is not yet the case. Chart by TradingView Solana (SOL) Solana rallied by 13% this week and managed to test the key resistance at $152. Bulls were unable to break above this level yet, but pressure is building under this resistance. If the overall market remains bullish, SOL has a good chance of moving higher later. The current uptrend came on sustained volume, and there are no signs of weakness from buyers. This is encouraging. If sellers don’t put more pressure on the $152 resistance, they may retreat to $180 next. Looking ahead, SOL has built a strong bullish momentum in the past three weeks. This can allow it to break above $152 and test $180 next. Chart by TradingView Hype (HYPE) HYPE had a strong performance this week with a 10% price increase. Its price action is similar to Solana and appears to face some resistance at $19, where buyers were unable to break this level. Considering the price has more than doubled since its recent lows at $9, HYPE may consolidate under the current resistance to gather more strength before pushing higher. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency had a very strong performance to date and may continue to perform as long as the market sentiment remains bullish. If $19 breaks, then the next target will be found at $21.

In a new post on the instant messaging app Telegram, pseudonymous crypto strategist Crypto Capo tells his 122,084 subscribers that Bitcoin may hit $98,000 before plummeting in value. However, the analyst says as long as Bitcoin holds $88,000 as support, the flagship crypto asset will likely remain in an uptrend. Looking at other digital assets, the analyst predicts that Ethereum ( ETH ) may increase 30% of its current value before correcting and that Solana ( SOL ) may increase 33% of its current value before correcting. He also believes other altcoins may double in value. “As long as Bitcoin stays above $88,000 (ideally above $90,000), a final bullish move is likely before a strong reversal. Some levels I’m watching to start taking profits: BTC: $95,000-$98,000. ETH: $2,000-$2,300. SOL: $170-$200. Altcoins: 30%-100% higher on average, depending on the coin.” The analyst shares a chart that warns the flagship crypto asset may have a severe correction to $60,000 after first tapping $98,000. “Shorting here makes no sense at all. I’ll be looking at the $94,000-$95,000 zone for potential shorts, but for now, the smart move is staying net long.” Source: Crypto Capo/Telegram Bitcoin is trading for $93,376 at time of writing, up marginally in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, at time of writing, ETH is trading for $1,759, down 1.8% in the last 24 hours, while Solana is trading for $150, flat on the day.

The year 2025 is being seen as a pivotal year for the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. As per the projections, cryptocurrency markets are expected to reach $5 billion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 15.4% from its $2.1 billion valuation in 2024 ( Cryptocurrency Trends Business Report 2025: Global Market ) By leveraging blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies eliminate intermediaries, making transactions more transparent and efficient, unlike the traditional banking system. Efforts are being made to bring more clarity, which will eventually bring more confidence and attract more users to adopt cryptocurrencies as a mode of payment. In this guide, you will explore different methods through which you can leverage cryptocurrencies for payments, also discussing about pros and cons of each. Let’s dive in. 1. Direct Cryptocurrency Payments Direct payments are transactions with merchants using digital currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum and involve using a cryptocurrency wallet to send funds directly to the merchant’s wallet address. With the transactions happening using blockchain technology, there is an added layer of privacy and security. One can facilitate the payment by scanning a QR code provided by the merchant or by manually inputting their wallet address. Pros: There is a potential for lower transaction fees compared to traditional payment gateways. Offers faster settlement as there are no intermediaries involved. Cons: The merchants who accept crypto payments are relatively few, therefore, there is limited merchant acceptance. It is highly likely that the price of cryptocurrency fluctuates between the time when the payment is initiated and when it is confirmed on the blockchain. Payments are usually irreversible. In countries like El Salvador , where Bitcoin has been recognized as legal tender, direct acceptance is more prevalent. Platforms such as BitPay play a crucial role by facilitating direct crypto payments for a growing network of merchants. 2. Cryptocurrency Debit Cards Just like regular debit cards, crypto debit cards offer a convenient method to make the payments. Such cards operate by linking to a user’s cryptocurrency holdings and automatically converting the crypto into fiat at the point of sale. This conversion is very seamless and allows cardholders to make payments to merchants who don’t otherwise accept crypto payments. Pros: They are highly convenient to use as they are accepted anywhere major cards like Mastercards or Visa are used. Certain cards offer a reward system that allows users to utilize their cryptocurrency holdings for everyday spending. Cons: Users may have to face several fees, such as transaction fees, currency conversion fees, charges for ATM withdrawals, and even inactivity fees. There is also an inherent risk of volatility associated with cryptocurrency payments. It may happen that the value of a digital asset may fluctuate between the time of purchase and the final settlement of the transaction. Some crypto debit cards require users to stake a certain amount of the platform’s native cryptocurrency to unlock higher rewards or access different card tiers. Crypto debit cards are available on a number of platforms, with regional availability changing. The Coinbase Card, the Crypto.com Visa Card, and the BitPay Card are well-liked choices in the USA. Options such as the Binance Card, the Wirex Card, and the Crypto.com Visa Card are available to consumers in Europe. Notably, Mastercard and Kraken have teamed up to enable Bitcoin payments at more than 150 million shops in Europe. Cards like the Bybit Card, the Wirex Card, and the Crypto.com Visa Card are also available in Australia. 3. Engaging in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Crypto Payments Peer-to-peer crypto payments, or popularly known as P2P, are those payments that happen directly between two individuals without the need of any intermediary or central authority. These interactions are often enabled through P2P exchange platforms. Pros: One key advantage of P2P crypto payments is the lower transaction fees compared to centralized exchange because of fewer intermediaries. Users often have more control over the price at which they trade, as they can negotiate directly with counterparties. P2P platforms offer a wide variety of payment options like bank transfer, digital wallets, and cash. The decentralized nature provides enhanced privacy and transparency. Cons: One potential threat is that of scams and fraud as people deal with unknown parties while transacting. Transaction speed might be of concern as the process relies on mutual payment confirmation. Another potential drawback might be liquidity due to difficulties in finding suitable trading partners or executing large trades quickly. Regulatory compliance can also be a challenge, as P2P platforms and users need to be aware of and adhere to varying regulations across different jurisdictions. Binance P2P is widely recognized for its high liquidity, global reach, and support for numerous payment methods and fiat currencies. Paxful is known for its inclusivity, particularly in emerging markets, offering a wide range of payment options. 4. In-Game Crypto Payments The in-game crypto payments are gaining momentum and opening up new possibilities for digital commerce and ownership. Cryptocurrencies enable true ownership of in-game assets through the use of Non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This allows for the play to earn models where players can earn real-world value through their in-game activities. Pros: Transactions within these gaming ecosystems using cryptocurrency can be faster and less expensive than traditional means. Cons: The value of game-specific tokens can fluctuate, affecting their real-world value. The integration of cryptocurrency payments into popular gaming is still in its early stages. Concerns about the environmental impact of some blockchain technology are also prevalent in the gaming world. Leading metaverse platforms, such as Decentraland (MANA) and The Sandbox (SAND), use their own native currency for all in-world transactions, including purchasing virtual land and digital assets. Blockchain-based games built on platforms like Solana and Polygon are progressively embracing cryptocurrency payments for a variety of in-game features. 5. AI-Powered Crypto Payments The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in cryptocurrency payments is a cutting-edge concept that aims to improve and streamline transaction operations. AI can greatly increase security by incorporating improved fraud detection mechanisms. AI has the potential to personalize payment experiences depending on user behavior and preferences. Pros: AI can greatly increase security by incorporating improved fraud detection mechanisms. AI has the potential to personalize payment experiences depending on user behavior and preferences. Cons: Concerns about data privacy arising from AI analysis of payment information must also addressed. The reliability and accuracy of AI in handling financial transactions are areas that require further validation. Rezolve Ai and Tether are collaborating to build an AI-powered crypto payment platform with the goal of redefining point-of-sale transactions. Alchemy Pay is also actively creating an AI-native payment infrastructure as part of its future plans. Conclusion: Embracing Cryptocurrency Payments in 2025 In 2025, the options for purchasing with cryptocurrencies are growing more diversified and complex. From direct peer-to-peer transactions and the convenience of crypto debit cards to the inventive usage of stablecoins and the immersive economies of the metaverse, cryptocurrency users have a rapidly expanding range of possibilities. Payment processors’ involvement in enabling merchant adoption, as well as the emergence of AI-powered solutions, underscore the industry’s dynamic evolution. While each technique has advantages and problems, the overall trend shows a rising integration of cryptocurrencies into the fabric of ordinary trade.",Crypto News|cryptocurrency payments,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-04-25 07:05:15

The company behind XRP is choosing a different path, even after resolving its long-standing legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Why Ripple IPO Plan is Delayed? Ripple’s President, Monica Long, told CNBC that the company is financially secure, with billions of dollars in cash reserves. She noted that IPOs are typically used to raise capital or increase market visibility—neither of which Ripple needs right now. Echoing her statement, CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that the company isn’t looking to go public anytime soon and doesn’t require external funding. Years of Hype Around Ripple IPO Fizzles Out The Ripple IPO has been a topic of discussion for years. In 2022, Garlinghouse said the company would consider going public once its legal battles with the SEC were resolved. However, even after gaining some legal clarity, he clarified in late 2023 that an IPO wasn’t a top priority. In early 2024, Ripple repurchased shares at a valuation of $11.3 billion—down from a $15 billion peak in 2022. That buyback raised $285 million, bringing the company’s total funding to $318.5 million. Investors include major names like Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures, and Founders Fund. Focus on Growth Through Acquisitions Instead of going public, Ripple is growing by acquiring other companies. A big move was its $1.25 billion purchase of Hidden Road, a prime broker that handles $3 trillion in annual transactions. This deal is expected to boost Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD and expand its role in global finance. FAQ Why is Ripple not launching an IPO despite resolving the SEC case? Ripple says it doesn’t need an IPO right now because it has billions in cash and no urgency to raise funds or gain public exposure. The company is financially strong and prefers to grow through acquisitions. Will RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, be integrated into global payment systems? Yes, Ripple plans to integrate RLUSD into its expanding global network. The recent $1.25B acquisition of Hidden Road is a key step toward that, aiming to boost RLUSD’s adoption in institutional finance.",News|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-25 07:08:46

The lawsuit claims that XRP and other digital assets offered by the exchange are unregistered securities, placing Coinbase in violation of Oregon state law. Tyler, who responded to the complaint, referenced 2023’s federal ruling in the SEC vs. Ripple case, which concluded that XRP is not a security when sold on public exchanges. He called out Oregon’s attorney general for disregarding this outcome, stating, “Maybe Oregon’s AG didn’t get the memo. A U.S. Federal judge already ruled that XRP is NOT a security.” He went further, calling for the AG’s impeachment for wasting taxpayer money and defying existing legal precedent. Maybe Oregon’s AG didn’t get the memo. A U.S. Federal judge already ruled that XRP is NOT a security. Impeach this clown for wasting taxpayer money and blatantly defying the law. https://t.co/viuTwbMxov — Tyler Winklevoss (@tyler) April 22, 2025 Oregon’s Legal Challenge The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase , Ripple, and many other cryptocurrency companies. Despite this, the Oregon Department of Justice, in an April 18 statement, framed the lawsuit as an attempt to address a regulatory vacuum left by what it claimed was federal inaction under the Trump administration. It argues that Coinbase, through its standard platform and Prime service, offered tokens such as XRP, Aave, and Uniswap as investment contracts, allegedly making them securities under Oregon law. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, expressed frustration with the legal challenge , as it ignores important precedent, including the ruling on XRP’s status and Judge Katherine Polk Failla’s decision to allow an interlocutory appeal in the SEC’s case. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What’s Next for XRP? For Winklevoss and others in the crypto sector, Oregon’s action contradicts that clarity and reintroduces uncertainty into an issue many considered resolved at the federal level. By ignoring the federal court ruling, Oregon’s attorney general has drawn direct criticism from the crypto community members who see the move as legally unsound and politically motivated. Winklevoss’s response reflects broader frustration within the industry regarding continued attempts to relitigate XRP’s status through state-level enforcement. Despite the legal uncertainty, Coinbase recently expanded its support for XRP by adding futures contracts to its derivatives platform on April 21. Coinbase is not backing down, and just as Ripple fought the SEC for years, Coinbase could win another major victory for the crypto space in Oregon.

43779174,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152794,1745565113,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Blockchain Technology Explained: A Comprehensive Guide,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/blockchain-technology-explained-a-comprehensive-guide/,"Blockchain technology has emerged as a groundbreaking innovation with the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our digital world. At its core, a blockchain is a decentralized ledger that records transactions across a peer-to-peer network. This innovative approach allows participants to confirm transactions without the need for a central clearing authority, fundamentally altering how trust and verification are established in digital interactions. It can be understood as an advanced database mechanism that facilitates transparent information sharing within a business network. This database stores data in blocks that are linked together in a chain, forming a chronological and unalterable record of events. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are not the same as often perceived. The fundamental definition of blockchain emphasizes the concepts of decentralization, immutability, and a shared, distributed ledger. These core attributes are consistently highlighted across various expert sources, underscoring their paramount importance in understanding what blockchain technology truly is. These differentiating factors, most notably decentralization and immutability, are what imbue blockchain technology with its revolutionary potential and enable its diverse applications across various industries. Decoding the Blocks and Chains Blocks: The Building Units In blockchain technology, data is organized and stored in fundamental units known as blocks. These blocks are designed to store transaction data and are sequentially linked to preceding blocks, forming an ordered chain. Each block incorporates a cryptographic hash of the block that came before it, along with a timestamp indicating when the block was created and transaction data, which is often structured using a Merkle tree to ensure data integrity. A single block within a blockchain transaction serves to record the movement of assets, whether physical or digital, from one participant to another within the network. Once a transaction has been recorded within a block, its validity must be confirmed by the majority of participants on the distributed blockchain network through a process called consensus. Each block is assigned a unique identifier, akin to a fingerprint, known as a hash. This hash is generated based on the data contained within the current block as well as the hash of the immediately preceding block in the chain. Furthermore, blocks contain metadata within their header, which includes crucial information such as a timestamp to denote the block’s creation time, a random number called a nonce used in the mining process for certain types of blockchains, and the cryptographic hash of the previous block. The data stored within these blocks is not limited solely to monetary exchanges; it can encompass a wide array of data types, illustrating the versatility and broad applicability of blockchain technology across various domains. The fundamental definition of blockchain emphasizes the concepts of decentralization, immutability, and a shared, distributed ledger. While the terms “digital ledger” or “database” provide a familiar starting point for comprehension, it is crucial to recognize the key distinctions that set blockchain apart from traditional databases. These differentiating factors, most notably decentralization and immutability, are what imbue blockchain technology with its revolutionary potential and enable its diverse applications across various industries. Chains: The Linkages Between the Blocks The organization of blocks in blockchain technology follows a sequential and cryptographic linkage, forming what is aptly named a chain. Each new block that is added to the blockchain is securely connected to the blocks that came before and after it through the use of cryptographic hashes. A critical aspect of this linkage is that the cryptographic hash of a block incorporates data from the preceding block in the chain. This design makes it computationally infeasible to alter any single block without also necessitating the modification of all subsequent blocks in the chain. The irreversible nature of this chain is a significant security feature; each newly added block reinforces the security and validation of all the blocks that preceded it, thereby strengthening the entire chain against tampering. Consensus Mechanism Before a block is added to the chain, the network has to validate the transaction using consensus algorithms like Proof-of-work (POW) and Proof-of-stake (POS). This is done to prevent fraud and ensure transparency. Different Types of Blockchain Public Blockchain: A public blockchain is defined as a distributed ledger system that operates without restrictions, allowing individuals or entities to access, view, and participate in the network. This permissionless characteristic is central to their design, distinguishing them from the private or permissioned blockchains that impose control on network participation. Private Blockchain: Also known as permissioned blockchain, it is a type of blockchain network where access is restricted to a specific group of participants. Unlike public blockchains, these blockchains are controlled by a central authority or a consortium of trusted entities. Consortium Blockchain: It is a hybrid form of blockchain technology that combines elements of both public and private blockchains. Consortium blockchains are governed by a group of pre-selected entities or organizations that collaborate to manage the network. It is useful when multiple institutions need a shared, secure, and decentralized platform without giving full control to a single party. Real World Applications of Blockchain Blockchain in Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum are built on blockchain, enabling decentralized digital currencies. Blockchain in Supply Chain Management: Blockchain helps in traceability, accountability, and efficiency in logistics. Blockchain in Healthcare: Securely stores patients’ records, ensuring privacy and quick access for authorized personnel. Blockchain in Finance: Ensures faster payments, smart contracts, and fraud prevention in the current banking system. Advantages of Blockchain Blockchain technology is a transformative force, offering multiple benefits in different sectors from medical to education. Its decentralized nature ensures that no single entity controls the network, enhancing transparency, and reducing the risk of a single point of failure. The following are the advantages that blockchain provides: Decentralization : Blockchain removes the need for an intermediary by allowing peer-to-peer transactions, reducing reliance on central authorities. Transparency: In a public blockchain, all transactions are recorded on a public ledger, allowing anyone to verify and audit the data. Immutability: Once the data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity. Enhanced Security : Blockchain uses cryptographic algorithms to secure the data, making it highly resistant to unauthorized access. Efficient Transactions: With blockchain, settlements can be done on real real-time basis, which is useful especially in financial transactions or supply chain. Disadvantages of Blockchain Blockchain is proving to be revolutionary; however, it is not without limitations: Scalability Issues: Public blockchains often face performance bottlenecks due to limited transaction throughput. Complexity and learning curve : Blockchain development and integration require specialized skills and knowledge, making adoption difficult for some businesses. Conclusion Blockchain technology is reshaping the digital world by offering decentralized, transparent, and secure solutions across a wide range of industries. From powering cryptocurrencies to enabling smart contracts on platforms, the potential applications are vast and continuously expanding. Despite challenges, ongoing innovation and growing adoption are helping to address these issues. As we move forward into a more connected and decentralized world, blockchain will undoubtedly play a central role in shaping the technologies and economies of tomorrow.",Crypto News|BLOCKCHAIN|BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|WALLET,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-04-25 07:11:53

Two businesses, Blocknovas and Softglide, were created using fictitious identities and addresses. The operation is tied to a subgroup within the Lazarus Group. The North Korean-backed hacking unit has stolen billions worth of crypto in the past years using sophisticated techniques and strategies that target unsuspecting individuals or companies. “This is a rare example of North Korean hackers actually managing to set up legal corporate entities in the US in order to create corporate fronts used to attack unsuspecting job applicants,” said Kasey Best, director of threat intelligence at Silent Push, said. The hackers’ playbook is as manipulative as it is effective: use fake LinkedIn-style profiles and job postings to lure crypto developers into interviews. Then, during the recruitment process, they are tricked into downloading malware disguised as job application tools. Silent Push identified multiple victims of the operation, especially those contacted through Blocknovas, which researchers say was the most active of the three front companies. The firm’s listed address in South Carolina appears to be an empty lot, while Softglide was registered through a tax office in Buffalo, New York. The firm added that the malware used in the campaign includes at least three virus strains previously tied to North Korean cyber units. These programs can steal data, provide remote access to infected systems, and serve as entry points for additional spyware or ransomware. The FBI has seized the Blocknovas domain, per Reuters. A notice posted to the site states it was taken down “as part of a law enforcement action against North Korean cyber actors who utilised this domain to deceive individuals with fake job postings and distribute malware.”",Tech|North Korea|hacking|News,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-25 07:15:20
43779338,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=715504,1745565447,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43779338.jpeg,"Analysts now expect Wall Street’s S&P 500 to tumble as low as 3,700 this year",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-sp-500-to-tumble-3700-this-year/,"Wall Street analysts are now warning that the S&P 500 could sink to 3,700 this year, even without a full-blown recession. That’s what Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, told clients on Thursday. He said the index could drop anywhere between 3,700 and 4,100 if the U.S. economy slows down, making it a 37% to 30% crash from where it started in January. The S&P 500 has already dropped more than 7% this year and is sitting 11% lower than its peak in February. It officially entered a bear market earlier this month after President Donald Trump dropped his April 2 tariff bomb. Since then, the market has been moving sideways. Earnings expectations collapse under recession fears Chris said the biggest danger right now is what happens if the U.S. slides into a recession. If that happens, he expects S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) to fall from $266 to $225, which would be a 15% drop. That drop lines up with what has happened in past downturns. “If uncertainty caused by tariff policy were to push the U.S. economy into recession in 2025, we’d expect SPX EPS to fall at least 15% from current levels in line with the median EPS peak to trough over the past four recessions, of 16.7%,” Chris wrote Thursday. He also pointed out that price-to-earnings ratios would shrink in that case. The S&P 500 currently trades at 19.4x earnings. If it drops to the 15-year average of 16.6x or the 10-year average of 18.4x, and EPS hits $225, then the index would crash to somewhere between 3,700 and 4,100. For now, earnings season is off to a solid start. Out of the 157 companies on the S&P 500 that have reported so far, 76% beat expectations. That’s better than what analysts were expecting on March 31. Back then, they predicted a 7.2% growth rate, but the current blended rate—which combines actual results and remaining forecasts—is now at 8%, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. Death cross formation warns of more losses ahead The charts are flashing warnings too. On April 14, the S&P 500’s 50-day moving average dropped under its 200-day moving average, forming what traders call a death cross. This kind of crossover isn’t normal. It’s only happened 50 times since 1928, and when it does, things usually get worse before they get better. The data was tracked by Bank of America, and it shows that in the 20 days after a death cross forms, the S&P 500 has fallen 0.5% on average, and it’s ended lower more than half of those times. If you stretch that window to 40 days, things don’t look much better. The index still ends up lower in almost half the cases, but when it rises, it gains 0.9% on average. Push out to 80 days, though, and there’s some light. The index rises more often than not and brings in an average gain of 2.6% from when the cross forms. But in this case, things are even messier. The 200-day moving average was also dropping when the death cross hit, which makes the pattern more dangerous. Bank of America pulled data from times when both moving averages were trending down during the five days before the crossover. In those rare setups, the S&P 500 was down two out of every three times in the following 20 days, with an average loss of 1.6%. The good news doesn’t really start until day 40, when the index rises in more than half of those cases and gains around 1%. If you wait two months, the odds are even better—67% of the time, the market goes up, and the average return grows to 3.5%. Still, those gains only come after traders get knocked around. Bank of America’s Paul Ciana told clients this week, “This suggests we should consider buying a dip/retest of lows in April.” As of now, resistance for the S&P 500 sits around 5,500, and the index hasn’t been able to push past that level and was last seen just under it, trading at 5,483.

According to financial disclosures , McCormick has made repeated investments in Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin ETF, purchasing nearly $250,000. Source: US Senate Financial Disclosures The lawmaker has invested approximately between $310,000 to $700,000 in the Bitwise ETF in March alone. In February, McCormick disclosed as much as $450,000 in the same product, bringing his total investments close to $1 million. Per filings, the Senator bought up $65,000 to $150,000 in shares of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, days before Trump’s Executive Order to explore a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Sen. McCormick also disclosed several other trades, notably selling between $1 million and $5 million in Goldman Sachs stock. Crypto-Friendly Sen. McCormick Endorsed by Coinbase CEO During Campaign The Senator, who previously headed the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, has been perceived as being friendly to the cryptocurrency sector. His pro-crypto stance prompted an endorsement from Coinbase Global CEO Brian Armstrong, helping him narrowly win a Senate seat in the 2024 election. “[McCormick] is the better candidate on crypto among many other credentials,” Armstrong said at the time. In February, the lawmaker addressed the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets’s first hearing, stressing that “2025 is the year for digital assets.” “Blockchain and digital assets offer Pennsylvania and America a chance to lead the next wave of innovation, enhancing our national security and our economy,” he wrote on X . US Senators Having Direct Stakes in Crypto Apart from Sen. McCormick, Steve Daines of Montana owned a variety of different ETFs, which have since been sold. This includes ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF, Amplify Blockchain Leaders ETF, Vaneck Bitcoin Strategy ETF, and Valkyrie’s Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF. Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene from Georgia has disclosed buying shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), shortly before Trump’s Bitcoin Strategic Reserve announcement. Further, Justin Sun, the advisor to Trump’s World Liberty Financial, has claimed he is the largest shareholder of Valkyrie.

With staking pools, deflationary tokenomics, and a capped 1 billion token supply, CartelFi has already drawn over $1 million in presale investment. The CARTFI token started at $0.0251 and has reached $0.0352 as it enters the eighth stage of its 90-day presale. The price is set to rise 5% every three days until it reaches a final presale price of about $0.10. With the platform set to launch in Q3 2025, investors are weighing how high the price could go by year-end. Presale demand shows investor interest in CartelFi The CartelFi presale raised $500,000 in the first 24 hours alone. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens and 25% allocated to presale buyers, the project has generated strong early momentum. The platform is designed to let users stake meme coins like PEPE, Floki, and Wojak in single-asset pools, earning up to 1000% APY without needing to sell. CartelFi also uses a buyback-and-burn model, where platform fees purchase CARTFI from the market and burn 50% of it, creating deflationary pressure. With this dual value proposition—meme culture plus DeFi rewards— CartelFi is setting itself apart from typical hype-driven tokens. This unique appeal has led analysts to speculate that the token could climb beyond its final presale price quickly, especially if trading launches in a bullish market environment. How high can CARTFI go by end-2025? In a bullish scenario, if the broader crypto market recovers and CartelFi delivers on its staking roadmap, the token could trade well above $0.10 by the end of 2025. A market capitalisation in the range of $100 million to $300 million could push CARTFI into the $0.20 to $0.30 range. This would represent a 2x to 3x return post-listing for final-stage presale investors, and significantly more for early-stage participants. A more moderate scenario would see the token trading between $0.12 and $0.18 by year-end, supported by steady user growth and positive platform performance. However, delays in platform rollout or weak market sentiment could hold prices near the listing level of $0.10 or below. CartelFi vs PEPE, Floki, and other meme coins Unlike PEPE or Floki, which largely depend on community hype and token momentum, CartelFi combines entertainment value with built-in utility. PEPE reached a $1.6 billion market cap within weeks of launch but lacked yield mechanisms or token burning. Floki introduced utility later through gaming and DeFi, but its token remains highly volatile and heavily driven by marketing. CartelFi, in contrast, integrates yield generation from the outset. Its staking pools provide tangible reasons for holding the token, while the deflationary model supports long-term price appreciation. This positions it to retain value better than hype-driven tokens that often struggle after the initial surge. Can CartelFi sustain growth after launch? CartelFi enters the market at a time when meme coins are again gaining traction. Its early presale success, capped supply, and DeFi roadmap suggest that it could carve out a niche beyond the typical pump-and-dump cycle. If it delivers on its Q3 2025 platform rollout and attracts users from established meme communities, it could outperform its peers by year-end. That said, CartelFi still carries the risks common to all early-stage crypto projects. Its success will hinge on execution, community adoption, and broader market trends. But for investors looking beyond passive speculation, CartelFi offers a differentiated play in the meme coin ecosystem.

A rare divergence between rising open interest and negative funding rates could set up a short squeeze. BTC price must establish $95,000 as new support to continue the uptrend. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price has been consolidating within a tight $91,700- $94,490 range since April 22. However, expert opinions and indicators suggest that Bitcoin’s choppy price action could soon end. The key question remains when Bitcoin will break out of consolidation. BTC/USD four-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView BTC funding rates hint at potential short squeeze One of the most significant signs that consolidation will end soon is the presence of negative funding rates in its futures markets. While the recent recovery in Bitcoin price was accompanied by a 15% rise in open interest, average funding rates declined, suggesting rising short interest. Bitcoin’s funding rates dropped to as low as -0.023% as the price tapped $94,700. This indicates a growing bias toward short-side positioning, indicating that many traders are betting against the uptrend. This suggests that futures traders are “potentially viewing the recent move as overextended,” Glassnode said in its latest Week Onchain report, adding: “This divergence between rising open interest and negative funding sets the stage for a possible short squeeze scenario if upward momentum continues.” Bitcoin open interest and funding Rates. Source: Glassnode A short squeeze occurs when prices rise sharply, forcing traders with short positions to buy back contracts to cover losses. Often triggered by unexpected market events or supply constraints, this buying pressure further drives prices up, trapping short sellers. Commenting on this, analysts at Jlabs Digital said that “a rally with negative funding and rising OI is rare and bullish.” “Until that flips, the momentum has room to run despite some caution signals we see elsewhere.” Bitcoin must break $95K to end consolidation According to one popular crypto analyst, Bitcoin may continue consolidating in its current range for a bit longer, particularly if the resistance at $95,000 is not broken. “Bitcoin consolidating under resistance,” said market analyst AlphaBTC in an April 25 post on X. He referred to the resistance at $95,000, which capped Bitcoin’s latest rally. As Cointelegraph reported, $95,000 remains the next significant resistance . Until it is reclaimed, AlphaBTC says that the price is likely to continue consolidating within the $93,000-$95,000 range before moving higher. “The best case is $BTC consolidating and building a base before pushing higher to take liquidity above 100k.” BTC/USD four-hour chart.

Among the noise, three standout projects are building real momentum—one of which is turning more heads by the day: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) With over $7 million already raised in its presale, Mutuum Finance is no longer just another DeFi startup trying to find its place. It’s quickly becoming one of the most talked-about projects under $0.03—currently priced at just $0.025. This price, however, won’t stick around much longer. The next phase will push the token to $0.03, and based on analyst predictions, this could be just the beginning of a much larger breakout. What sets MUTM apart is its combination of practical DeFi infrastructure and an approach that encourages real usage over speculation. The platform is building around lending, borrowing, and collateralized stablecoin issuance—all operating through decentralized smart contracts. But what makes this particularly compelling is the protocol’s approach to revenue. Instead of relying on constant emissions to reward users, Mutuum channels part of its platform earnings into buying MUTM tokens from the market, which are then redistributed to participants. This creates recurring demand, aligning incentives between users and the protocol itself. Mutuum isn’t building hype—it’s building products. One of the key elements is its overcollateralized stablecoin, which will allow users to mint a dollar-pegged asset directly within the lending protocol. Unlike some DeFi platforms that rely on pooled reserves or opaque backing, every stablecoin minted through Mutuum is backed by on-chain assets, with smart contracts handling minting and burning automatically. This system benefits borrowers and depositors alike. Those who borrow stablecoins retain exposure to their original collateral (like ETH or DAI), while still gaining liquidity. Meanwhile, depositors earn passive income through mtTokens—interest-bearing tokens that grow in value as lending activity increases. This means a user depositing into the platform doesn’t just earn a yield—they also gain optionality. Their mtTokens can later be staked to earn MUTM rewards, giving users a second income stream simply for participating. At the current presale price of $0.025, a $2,200 investment secures 88,000 MUTM tokens. With a confirmed listing price of $0.06, this already suggests a significant price gap ahead of the token launch. But that’s only the beginning. Once platform utilities like the beta lending protocol and stablecoin become active, and exchange listings expand, many believe MUTM can climb far beyond the initial price. Analysts are forecasting a 30x return in the near term, driven by demand from platform activity and a growing holder base. At that rate, the value of those 88,000 tokens would jump to over $66,000—a serious payoff for those entering early. It’s not just early-stage buyers fueling this momentum. Experienced investors, including known DeFi whales and structured investment groups, are backing Mutuum’s vision. The utility-driven nature of the token, paired with the upcoming product launch, has turned this into a long-term portfolio pick for many strategists looking beyond the next short-term rally. Mutuum’s approach checks boxes that seasoned investors look for: non-custodial architecture, real yield mechanisms, scalable utility, and a revenue loop that drives recurring demand. The team has confirmed that a beta version of the platform is set to launch around the time of the token’s public debut. That milestone is expected to bring significant attention to MUTM, as new users begin testing the lending and stablecoin systems firsthand. This next phase will also likely trigger listings on major centralized exchanges—an event that typically brings a wave of new buyers and volume. Combined with the current presale closing in on sell-out, the timing is key for anyone still considering a position. For those asking what cryptocurrency to invest in now, especially in April 2025, MUTM is earning its spot on the shortlist. It’s not just about the price—it’s about timing, fundamentals, and utility. With the token still sitting at $0.025, an upcoming listing at $0.06, and product rollouts that support long-term demand, Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be one of the best crypto investments this month. As other tokens rely on speculation, MUTM is quietly building—and that might be exactly why it’s set to break out first.

The widely-watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index jumped to a score of 72, signaling “Greed” as bullish momentum returned. But just days later, that optimism appears to be fading. By April 25, despite Bitcoin maintaining a price range between $91,800 and $94,300, the index slid to 60 — still in “Greed” territory but cooling. Greed Returns to the Market — Briefly It marked the first time since early February that sentiment climbed so high. Back then, macroeconomic uncertainties and tariff tensions had sent Bitcoin tumbling below the $100,000 mark. Since reclaiming $90K, market participants seem torn between excitement and unease. Adding to the caution, Markus Thielen of 10x Research cited slow stablecoin activity as a red flag. “Our stablecoin minting indicator hasn’t shown signs of a breakout,” he warned, suggesting that liquidity inflows might not support a sustained rally. The divergence in outlook is becoming clearer. Bitfinex analysts, in a note published April 24, acknowledged Bitcoin’s relative strength versus U.S. equities, but hesitated to call it a lasting trend. They stopped short of labeling it a full structural decoupling. Analysts Split on Whether the Bitcoin Rally Can Last On the other hand, bullish voices remain. Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, sees buyers lining up. “We’re likely on our way to fresh all-time highs,” he said on X, predicting upward continuation if the $90K level holds. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have seen a major influx of capital. Between April 20 and 24, net inflows totaled $2.6 billion — the third-best week since these products launched in January. This institutional activity could prove to be a stabilizing force, even as retail sentiment wavers. Altcoins, however, continue to lag behind. CoinMarketCap’s altcoin season index is just 17 out of 100, and Bitcoin’s dominance hovers near 64.4%, according to TradingView — a strong signal that attention remains heavily concentrated on the top asset.

At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,754, showing a 3.3% decrease in the past 24 hours, while the total crypto market cap slipped by 3.6% during the same period. Although short-term price movements reflect shifting momentum, on-chain metrics signal deeper changes that may have broader implications for Ethereum’s network health and investor sentiment. Related Reading: Ethereum Adds 12% In 24 Hours – On-Chain Metrics Point To Modest Resistance Ahead Ethereum Long-Term Holders Accumulate as Inflows Hit Multi-Year Highs Recent data from CryptoQuant reveals that long-term Ethereum holders are increasing their activity. These wallets, known for never selling their ETH, have seen one of their highest inflows in recent years. This coincides with rising network activity, including a notable uptick in active addresses and transactional volume. Together, these developments suggest that behind the surface-level volatility, there may be a quiet phase of accumulation and user engagement building within the Ethereum ecosystem. CryptoQuant contributor OnChainSchool reports a significant development among Ethereum’s long-term holding addresses. In the last 48 hours, over 640,000 ETH flowed into wallets that have maintained a strict accumulation pattern without any recorded selling behavior. This marks the largest inflow to such wallets since 2018, suggesting that entities with a long-term outlook are increasing their exposure during the current price range. The behavior of these accumulation-only wallets is often viewed as a proxy for investor conviction, particularly among participants who are not influenced by short-term volatility. According to OnChainSchool, this activity during a period of price drawdown may reflect strategic positioning ahead of potential future developments. It’s also notable that these inflows come at a time when Ethereum fundamentals such as its transition to proof-of-stake, L2 adoption, and evolving staking mechanisms continue to advance. If sustained, this trend could help establish a support zone around current price levels. Network Activity Rises as Active Addresses See Double-Digit Growth Complementing the rise in long-term holder activity is a surge in Ethereum network usage. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Carmelo Alemán, highlights that the number of active Ethereum addresses grew by nearly 10% between April 20 and April 22, jumping from around 306,000 to over 336,000. This metric counts unique wallet addresses that were involved in transactions as either senders or receivers over a given period. While active addresses alone do not capture the full picture, Alemán notes that the metric should be viewed alongside others such as exchange volume, gas fees, transaction count, and Layer 2 activity.

Analyst Uses Fibonacci Extension To Make the Case",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-headed-to-135000-analyst-uses-fibonacci-extension-to-make-the-case/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has surged more than 10% over the past seven days and is currently trading in the low $90,000 range. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto suggests that further gains may be on the horizon based on Fibonacci extension levels. Bitcoin May Climb To $135,000 In a post published on X today, Titan of Crypto outlined Bitcoin’s potential path to $135,000. Using Fibonacci extension levels, the analyst predicts that the flagship digital asset could surge as high as $135,109 by July-August 2025. For the uninitiated, Fibonacci extension levels are technical analysis tools used to identify potential price targets during strong trends by projecting key Fibonacci ratios beyond a recent price swing. Traders use these levels to anticipate where an asset might find resistance or complete a move after a breakout. According to the following weekly BTC chart shared by Titan of Crypto, a 100% Fibonacci extension from Bitcoin’s recent retest of the $76,000 support level projects its next major target near $135,000. The chart highlights similar price behavior from August 2024, when BTC surged nearly 100%, setting a new all-time high (ATH) around $73,000 by November 2024. If the current trend follows a similar trajectory, BTC may post a new ATH by July 2025. Other crypto analysts also predict positive price action for the leading digital asset. For example, crypto analyst Jelle shared a chart showing BTC breaking through a downside deviation. Jelle noted that BTC is giving bulls “exactly what they want to see.” Following the recent rally, BTC experienced a shallow pullback and appears poised to confirm a range-low reclaim before potentially pushing higher. The analyst added that BTC could next test resistance near $100,000. Binance Data Indicates An Upcoming Short Squeeze Adding to the bullish case is trading data from Binance. According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by Novaque Research, BTC outflows from the exchange have risen significantly since April 19. The surge in withdrawals is backed by declining exchange reserves, suggesting reduced short-term selling pressure and a market increasingly driven by retail participants. The post states: High-leverage longs were flushed out between $82K and $88K, indicating that weak hands had been eliminated. Large short positions remain susceptible above $92,000, creating the possibility of a short squeeze, which might act as the next step higher. Broader macroeconomic factors could also contribute to BTC’s upside. For instance, rising concerns over the US Federal Reserve’s autonomy may drive investors toward decentralized assets like Bitcoin. At press time, BTC trades at $93,302, up 0.8% in the last 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|binance|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|downside deviation|fibonacci extentions|short squeeze,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-25 07:30:56

The clarification comes after rumors swirled that had people thinking participants were forced to shell out thousands to sit at a dinner with President Donald Trump. The confusion seems to have been set off by a series of Trump-related promotions, including NFT sales and fundraising events that offered high-paying supporters exclusive experiences. The statement came in the wake of a 71% surge in the $TRUMP token’s value, sparked by the initial announcement of the dinner event. Due to happen at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington, DC, on May 22, the dinner will be open to the top 220 holders of the $TRUMP coin. The top 25 holders will receive additional benefits, including a VIP reception and a special tour. Despite reports that an expensive ticket price had been set, the $TRUMP coin team has claimed there is no cost to attend the dinner directly. All are eligible, based only on how many $TRUMP coins a user holds from May 12 to April 23. “Our leaderboard updates hourly in real time. Your $TRUMP coin count puts you in the running. The market is highly competitive. Own $TRUMP — or watch from the sidelines,” according to the website marketing the coin. Crypto dinner invite sparks price surge Trump and his wife, Melania, debuted meme coins just days before his inauguration, although both tokens have lost much of their value since their debuts. The $MELANIA meme coin now sells for about 49 cents each, down from a peak of $13.76 on Jan. 20. Dubbed the “MAGACOIN” project, the $TRUMP meme coin from President Donald Trump’s camp has stirred buzz across the internet and markets. The $TRUMP meme coin website made a splashy announcement Wednesday inviting the token’s top 220 holders to an “intimate private dinner” with Trump. The value of the $TRUMP token exploded after the announcement. It soared to $14.32 at one point, recovering some ground from a sharp decline. The coin had surged to a high of $75.35 on January 19, the day before Trump’s inauguration. By mid-April, it had plunged 88%. The site stated that the dinner would be an opportunity for attendees to hear directly from President Trump about the future of cryptocurrency. A promotional video posted on X, formerly Twitter, echoed this message in the style of a flashy music video, featuring quick cuts of Trump, gold coins, and promises of exclusive access. Critics slam Trump’s crypto dinner as unethical power grab Although the $TRUMP Token team has tried to quell the storm concerning the event, the criticism hasn’t gone away. Ethics experts and lawmakers of both Democratic and Republican parties are raising alarms. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) described the dinner promotion as the president’s most openly corrupt act ever. At the same time, the watchdog group Accountable.US, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on corporate and government ethics, called it an open invitation for investors to buy access to Trump. Tony Carrk, the group’s executive director, said in a statement that Mr. Trump “is openly inviting investors to have a bidding war over who can buy the most access to him while he laughs all the way to the bank.” The structure of the $TRUMP token has also drawn a magnified gaze. Public transparency records reveal that entities closely tied to Donald Trump control nearly 80% of the total token supply—raising red flags about centralization and potential manipulation, issues that many in the crypto community strive to avoid. The upcoming event occurs when Trump increasingly uses cryptocurrency to spread his campaign message. He has pledged to make the US the leader of the crypto revolution.

This upward move follows a breakout from a long period of consolidation, hinting at the return of bullish sentiment among traders. Still, considering PEPE’s sizable market cap and the substantial gains it has already made, the potential for another massive rally may be limited. While smaller fluctuations could continue, a repeat of its early 100x run looks increasingly unlikely. Market Sentiment: Trump’s Crypto-Friendly Message Fuels Optimism Trump’s decision to downplay tensions around global trade has injected fresh optimism into the markets. His supportive stance on digital assets adds further confidence, and when combined with Elon Musk’s subtle endorsement of frog-themed tokens, it’s reinforcing the belief that a new altcoin cycle may be underway. Looking Ahead: Could Pepeto Be the Next 100x Meme Coin? As frog-themed tokens gain popularity, Pepeto ($PEPETO) is standing out—not just for its branding but for its unique set of features. With plans for the Pepeto Exchange , the zero-fee PepetoSwap , and advanced bridge technology supporting cross-chain transactions, Pepeto brings real functionality to the meme coin space. Adding to the intrigue are growing rumors that a former PEPE developer might be involved in the project—tied to Pepeto’s narrative about six critical documents that were allegedly stolen. If confirmed, this backstory could make Pepeto one of the most talked-about launches in crypto. Given it shares the same total supply as PEPE, some are watching it closely as a potential 1000x play. How to Buy $PEPETO The $PEPETO presale is still live and available through the official website , with each token priced at $0.000000124 . You can buy using USDT, ETH, BNB , or a credit/debit card . Early participants also gain access to staking rewards and exclusive features across the Pepeto ecosystem, ahead of its upcoming listing.

According to a recent Reuters report , U.S. cybersecurity company Silent Push has identified two shell companies that can be traced back to the North Korean hacker group. Researchers claimed that the two companies, Blocknovas LLC and Softglide LLC, were set up in New Mexico and New York respectively under fake personas and addresses. Upon further inspection, Reuters found that the address listed for Blocknovas in Warrenville, South Carolina appeared as an empty lot on Google Maps. Meanwhile, Softglide’s address in Buffalo, New York was occupied by a small tax office. Moreover, the contact persons listed under the companies could not be found. Director of threat intelligence at Silent Push, Kasey Best called it a “rare example of North Korean hackers actually managing to set up legal corporate entities in the U.S.” He explained how the Lazarus Group hackers would seek to infect users through fake job applications with at least three strains of detected malware linked to North Korean cyber operations. You might also like: Lazarus Group allegedly makes a profit of $2.51m from selling WBTC The malicious cyber attacks would use fake aliases to offer job interviews for prospective crypto or web3 developers, which would enable the hackers to deploy sophisticated malware designed to compromise the cryptocurrency wallets of developers. “They also target the developers’ passwords and credentials which could be used to further attacks on legitimate businesses,” said Best. The hackers behind these firms are allegedly part of a subgroup within the Lazarus Group, which is part of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, Pyongyang’s main foreign intelligence agency. Lazarus Group is known for being the actors behind some of the largest crypto hacks in history, including the most recent Bybit hack which resulted in losses of up to $1.5 billion. When asked about these shell companies and their possible ties to the North Korean hacker group, the New York Department of State declined to comment on companies registered in the state.

A major development is set to accelerate the creation of truly decentralized, real-time gaming experiences. We’re talking about MagicBlock, a company building a real-time engine specifically designed for decentralized games and applications on the Solana blockchain. They just announced a significant milestone that could pave the way for the next generation of interactive digital worlds. MagicBlock Secures Vital Crypto Funding In exciting news for the Web3 gaming ecosystem, MagicBlock has successfully closed a seed funding round, raising an impressive $7.5 million . This substantial injection of capital is a clear vote of confidence from major investors in MagicBlock’s vision and the potential of fully on-chain gaming. The funding round was spearheaded by Lightspeed Faction , a venture capital firm with a strong focus on the blockchain space. They were joined by a roster of other prominent investors, including: Maven11 Delphi Digital Robot Ventures Mechanism Capital Equilibrium Pivot Global Adding further weight to the round, notable angel investors also participated, including none other than Anatoly Yakovenko , the co-founder of Solana itself. His personal backing underscores the alignment between MagicBlock’s goals and the core capabilities of the Solana network. According to MagicBlock’s official announcement, the primary purpose of this funding is to fuel their core mission: enabling the development of real-time, fully on-chain games and applications built natively on Solana. But what exactly does “fully on-chain” mean, and why is it such a big deal? Understanding Fully On-Chain Games on Solana Most “blockchain games” today aren’t truly decentralized at their core. While they might use blockchain for asset ownership (NFTs for items, tokens for currency) or governance, the actual game logic – things like player movement, combat calculations, or world state updates – often runs on traditional, centralized servers. This creates potential points of failure, censorship, and a lack of true transparency and composability. A fully on-chain game , on the other hand, executes its core logic directly on the blockchain. Every significant action, every state change, is processed and verified by the decentralized network. This offers several compelling advantages: True Ownership & Verifiability: Game rules are transparent and immutable, ensuring fair play and verifiable outcomes. Assets are truly owned by players, not just represented in a centralized database. Composability: Game state and assets can potentially interact with other decentralized applications and protocols in novel ways. Censorship Resistance: The game cannot be arbitrarily shut down or altered by a single entity. Persistence: The game world exists as long as the blockchain does. Building complex, real-time applications like games fully on-chain is incredibly challenging. It requires a blockchain capable of high throughput, low latency, and predictable, low transaction costs. This is where Solana comes into play. Why Solana is the Chosen Battlefield for On-Chain Games Solana has emerged as a leading candidate for hosting demanding decentralized applications due to its unique architecture, particularly its Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism combined with Proof of Stake (PoS). This enables: High Transaction Throughput: Solana can process thousands of transactions per second, far exceeding the capacity of many older blockchains. This is crucial for games requiring rapid state updates. Low Transaction Costs: Gas fees on Solana are typically fractions of a cent, making frequent in-game actions economically viable for players. Fast Block Finality: Transactions are confirmed quickly, essential for a responsive, real-time gaming experience. While other chains are exploring similar capabilities, Solana’s current performance profile makes it particularly attractive for developers pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with fully on-chain logic. However, even with Solana’s speed, building a real-time game engine that leverages these capabilities is a significant technical hurdle. MagicBlock’s Engine: Powering the Next Wave of Blockchain Gaming This is where MagicBlock positions itself as a critical piece of infrastructure. Their engine is designed to abstract away much of the complexity involved in running game logic directly on the Solana blockchain. Think of it as a specialized toolkit or framework that allows game developers to focus on game design and mechanics, rather than getting bogged down in the intricacies of on-chain programming and state management. While the specifics of MagicBlock’s technology are still emerging, a real-time engine for on-chain games likely involves solutions for: Efficient State Management: How to store and update the game world’s state on-chain without excessive cost or latency. Deterministic Logic Execution: Ensuring that game rules execute predictably and identically across all validators. Handling Real-Time Inputs: Processing player actions and updating the game state in near real-time within the constraints of block times. Developer Tooling: Providing SDKs, APIs, and other tools to make it easier for developers to build on their platform. By providing this infrastructure, MagicBlock aims to lower the barrier to entry for creating complex, interactive on-chain games , potentially unlocking a new wave of innovation in the space. What Does This Crypto Funding Mean for the Ecosystem? The $7.5 million seed round is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a significant signal to the market. It indicates: Investor Confidence: Major VC firms and industry figures believe in the future of fully on-chain gaming and MagicBlock’s ability to deliver the necessary technology. Validation of the Vision: The funding validates the idea that there is a real need for specialized infrastructure to build sophisticated applications on fast blockchains like Solana. Accelerated Development: With this capital, MagicBlock can significantly expand its team and accelerate the development and rollout of its engine and developer tools. Potential for Growth on Solana: Successful development by MagicBlock could attract more game developers to the Solana ecosystem, bolstering its position as a hub for Web3 gaming. This funding round is a crucial step towards realizing the potential of truly decentralized, real-time experiences in the digital realm. It highlights the growing maturity and ambition within the blockchain gaming sector, moving beyond simple collectible or turn-based games towards more dynamic and interactive formats. What Challenges Lie Ahead for MagicBlock and On-Chain Games? While the funding is a massive boost, the path forward isn’t without its hurdles. Building and scaling fully on-chain games presents significant challenges: Technical Complexity: Even with specialized engines, the technical challenges of running complex logic on-chain remain substantial. Optimizing for performance and cost is an ongoing process. User Experience: On-chain interactions, while improving, can still present friction compared to traditional gaming (e.g., wallet interactions, transaction confirmations). Scalability Limits: While Solana is fast, there are still theoretical limits to how much computation and state can be handled entirely on-chain for truly massive, real-time worlds. Developer Adoption: Convincing traditional game developers to build on Web3 platforms, and specifically on a new engine like MagicBlock’s, requires compelling tools, documentation, and support. Economic Models: Designing sustainable and engaging game economies that leverage on-chain mechanics is still an evolving art form. MagicBlock will need to navigate these challenges effectively to deliver on its promise and facilitate the creation of compelling, user-friendly on-chain experiences. The Future is On-Chain: What This Means for You If you’re a game developer, this funding round signals that the tools and infrastructure for building truly decentralized games are rapidly improving, particularly on Solana. MagicBlock’s engine could offer a pathway to creating innovative experiences that leverage the unique properties of blockchain. If you’re a gamer, keep an eye on the games being built using MagicBlock’s technology. These could represent the next evolution in digital ownership, transparent mechanics, and potentially more dynamic, player-driven worlds. For investors, this round underscores the continued interest and investment flowing into the Web3 infrastructure layer, specifically targeting performance-oriented blockchains like Solana and promising applications like fully on-chain games . Conclusion: A New Era for On-Chain Gaming on Solana MagicBlock’s successful $7.5 million seed round is a pivotal moment for the development of fully on-chain games on Solana. With the backing of prominent investors, including Solana’s co-founder, MagicBlock is well-positioned to build the critical infrastructure needed to power the next generation of decentralized, real-time gaming experiences. While challenges remain, this funding significantly accelerates the potential for innovative, verifiable, and truly player-owned games to emerge on the Solana network. The dream of complex, interactive worlds living entirely on the blockchain is inching closer to reality, and MagicBlock is aiming to be at the forefront of this exciting evolution in blockchain gaming .

Bitcoin continued to command the spotlight, rising by 0.25% over the last 24 hours and briefly breaking above the $94,000 mark. This move, marked by renewed buying interest from the investors and a notable whale accumulation on major exchanges, points to growing confidence in crypto’s largest token amid signs of a broader market reversal. On the other hand, spot Bitcoin ETFs have purchased almost 25,000 BTC over the last 3 days, worth over $2.3 billion. BlackRock alone bought over $320 million worth of Bitcoin, accumulating nearly 12,500 BTC. Despite this, the BTC price is trading just below a key supply zone after a falling wedge breakout. Therefore, now the question arises whether the price will trigger a breakout above the range, as a confirmed breakout could fuel more upside. Meanwhile, a downside risk remains until the breakout is confirmed. After rising from the falling wedge, the BTC price surged over 12% and is struggling to rise above the resistance zone between $94,129 and $94,800. Although the OBV remains elevated, suggesting a continuation of a bullish trend, a failure from these levels could trigger a short-term correction. The RSI is displaying a bearish divergence before entering the overbought range, hinting towards a potential drop. On the other hand, the MACD suggests a drop in the buying pressure, but the levels have risen into the positive range for the first time since February, which has kept the bullish hopes alive. Currently, the BTC price is facing a key barrier near $94,500 to $95,000, and a repeated test has failed to produce a clean breakout. However, the upside momentum remains strong as long as it holds above $89,800, as a strong drop below the range may open room towards $86,800. Meanwhile, the macro trend remains positive, with ETF inflows and whale buying offsetting minor technical pullbacks. Therefore, the bullish setup remains in play if BTC consolidates above $92,000 and $93,000, and a breakout above $95,000 could quickly retest all-time highs.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-25 07:48:02

Fresh activity from both retail players and large BTC holders suggests the market may be approaching a turning point. Retail FOMO Meets Whale Accumulation Following Bitcoin’s brief surge above $94,200 on Wednesday, Santiment’s data showed a wave of FOMO from retail traders entering the market. This is in sharp contrast to recent weeks, when retail largely exited amid macroeconomic uncertainty. As such, the renewed enthusiasm marks a notable sentiment change. While such crowd behavior often precedes price tops, a move toward $100,000 now appears increasingly likely, according to the update by the crypto analytic platform. While retail FOMO has reentered the picture, the rally’s foundation appears to be even stronger, thanks to significant moves by major holders. In a separate analysis, Santiment noted that the 11% surge in Bitcoin’s value from April 21 to 25th also coincided with continued accumulation by key whales and sharks. Wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC were found to have added 19,255 BTC during the period. Such aggressive buying behavior has consistently been a precursor to notable market rallies and indicates that a constructive recovery is underway for Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s value has jumped +11.2%, and this has once again coincided with key whales & sharks adding on to their already enormous bags.

43780218,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152748,1745567419,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking TRUMP Memecoin Holder Revealed: ‘Sun’ Amasses $14M Fortune,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-memecoin-largest-holder/,"The world of political memecoins is buzzing, and the official TRUMP memecoin , known as Official Trump (TRUMP), is at the center of the latest intrigue. A recent announcement has sent ripples through the crypto community, revealing a single holder with a massive stake. Who is ‘Sun’ and Their $14M TRUMP Memecoin Holding? According to an official statement from the Official Trump (TRUMP) project’s X account (@GetTrumpMemes), the top holder on their current leaderboard goes by the username “Sun.” This user reportedly holds a staggering $14 million worth of TRUMP tokens, making them the single largest known individual investor in the project. This revelation immediately sparked widespread speculation across crypto news outlets and social media platforms. The most prominent theory circulating is that this “Sun” could potentially be Justin Sun, the well-known founder of the Tron blockchain and head of Huobi Global (now HTX). Justin Sun has a history of engaging with various cryptocurrency projects and is known for his significant holdings across different assets. However, the official announcement did not confirm the identity of the holder, leaving the connection to Justin Sun purely as speculation within the community. Neither Justin Sun nor representatives for the TRUMP memecoin project have publicly verified this connection as of yet. Why the Buzz Around Donald Trump and Memecoins? The TRUMP memecoin is directly associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump , positioning itself as his official cryptocurrency token. This connection taps into the intersection of politics and the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, a trend that has gained significant traction, particularly during election cycles. Political memecoins often gain value based on the popularity, news, and events surrounding the associated political figure. For TRUMP, this means its price and community engagement are heavily influenced by Donald Trump’s activities, statements, and political momentum. The emergence of a major holder like “Sun” with a $14 million position is significant because it indicates substantial financial backing or interest from potentially influential figures, which can impact market sentiment and visibility for the token. Is This Related to the Trump Dinner Event? Adding another layer to the story is the recent report that Donald Trump hosted a dinner event on May 22 at his Virginia golf club. This exclusive gathering was reportedly attended by the top 220 buyers of his NFTs, which are often linked or promoted alongside his other digital assets, including potentially the TRUMP memecoin. While the official statement about the “Sun” holding doesn’t explicitly link it to the dinner, the timing and the context of Trump engaging directly with his top digital asset buyers raise questions. Could “Sun” have been among the attendees? Was this large purchase related to gaining access to such events, or is it purely an investment play? Without official confirmation, these remain open questions fueling the discussion around this substantial memecoin investment . Understanding the Risks of Memecoin Investment While the story of a $14 million TRUMP holding is captivating, it’s crucial for potential investors to understand the inherent risks associated with memecoins: Volatility: Memecoins are notoriously volatile, with prices often driven by hype, social media trends, and speculation rather than underlying technology or fundamentals. Lack of Utility: Many memecoins, including political ones, have little to no practical use case beyond speculation. Their value is almost entirely based on community sentiment and market dynamics. Potential for Manipulation: Large holders (often called “whales”) can significantly influence the market price through large buy or sell orders. Scam Risk: The memecoin space is prone to pump-and-dump schemes and outright scams. The presence of a large holder like “Sun” could be seen by some as a positive sign of confidence, but it also concentrates significant power in one entity, which could pose risks if they decide to sell their large position. The Broader Impact on Crypto News and Political Tokens This development highlights the growing intersection of politics and cryptocurrency, a trend that is likely to intensify as elections approach globally. Political tokens like TRUMP are becoming a new way for supporters to engage financially and for figures to potentially leverage their brand in the digital asset space. The speculation around Justin Sun ‘s potential involvement adds another layer of institutional or significant player interest, suggesting that even established figures in the crypto world are paying attention to or participating in the political memecoin phenomenon. This story will undoubtedly remain a hot topic in crypto news as the community seeks more clarity on “Sun’s” identity and intentions. Conclusion: A Glimpse into High-Stakes Memecoin Plays The identification of “Sun” as the top TRUMP memecoin holder with a $14 million stake is a fascinating development that underscores the high-stakes nature of the memecoin market, especially those tied to prominent political figures like Donald Trump. While the identity of “Sun” remains unconfirmed, the speculation involving Justin Sun adds significant weight to the narrative. This event, coupled with Trump’s recent dinner with top buyers, paints a picture of a political movement increasingly intertwined with digital assets. As always in the crypto space, potential investors should approach such volatile assets with caution and conduct thorough research.

ARK Invest’s Bold Forecast Shakes Crypto Markets,https://cryptonews.com/news/2-4m-bitcoin-by-2030-ark-invests-bold-forecast-shakes-crypto-markets/,"Bitcoin (BTC) remains resilient near $93,628 as of April 25, easing just 0.5% during the Asian session. Despite minor intraday softness, the broader trend remains intact, supported by intensifying institutional interest. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently increased its Bitcoin holdings by 12,500 BTC, valued at $327.3 million, bringing its total exposure to approximately $1.16 billion. This move underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury asset and macro hedge. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s current price still trades about 40% below its estimated intrinsic value of $130,000, according to the Energy Value model by Capriole’s Charles Edwards—suggesting long-term upside remains. Polkadot ETF Postponed as SEC Reviews 70+ Crypto Funds Elsewhere, the SEC has delayed its decision on Grayscale’s Polkadot (DOT) ETF, now scheduled for June 11, 2025. This is part of a broader review involving more than 70 crypto fund proposals, including ETFs tied to XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin. NEW: SEC Delays decision on Polkadot ETF.

Institutional interest and political pressure are mounting—hinting that a more constructive ETF landscape may be approaching. Regulatory Shifts: Green Light for U.S. Banks on Crypto The regulatory tide appears to be turning. In a coordinated move, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC have withdrawn prior guidance that required banks to seek pre-approval before engaging in crypto-related activities. This reversal eliminates four key warnings issued in 2022 and 2023, which had cast a chilling effect on bank participation. Going forward, banks will rely on internal risk frameworks, while regulators shift to standard supervisory monitoring—a model that promotes innovation while managing systemic risk.

ARK Invest’s $2.4 Million Bitcoin Forecast: What’s Behind It? In its latest research update, ARK Invest projected Bitcoin could reach $2.4 million by 2030 under a bullish scenario. The base and bear case forecasts were adjusted to $1.2 million and $500,000, respectively. The bold outlook is driven by three central themes: Institutional Allocation: Rising participation from asset managers and corporate treasuries. Digital Gold Narrative: Potential for BTC to capture a significant share of gold’s $18 trillion market cap. Emerging Market Demand: Bitcoin’s growing role as a store of value in inflation-prone economies. JUST IN: ARK Invest updates their 2030 #Bitcoin price prediction to $2.4 million pic.twitter.com/aWWdE6HsNx — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 24, 2025 If realized, ARK’s top-end projection would imply a $49 trillion Bitcoin market cap—larger than the combined GDP of the U.S. and China. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Breakout or Bull Trap Near $94.7K? Bitcoin is consolidating just below a major resistance zone at $94,750, the 0% Fibonacci level from the recent $88,461–$94,758 rally. Price action remains within a steep ascending channel, with the 50-period EMA at $91,398 acting as dynamic support. However, the MACD histogram has begun to fade, signaling potential momentum fatigue. Bitcoin Trade Setup: Buy Entry: Above $94,750 on strong bullish volume Targets: $96,150 and $97,500 Stop Loss: Below $92,800 Pro Tip: This is a classic “pullback and retest” structure—wait for candle and volume confirmation before entering. Avoid chasing weak breakouts. Bottom Line Bitcoin continues to find firm footing above $93,000, bolstered by institutional inflows and loosening regulatory constraints. While ARK Invest’s $2.4M price target may appear ambitious, the underlying thesis—scarcity, adoption, and macro alignment—remains compelling. As the crypto market matures, the coming months could determine whether Bitcoin enters a new paradigm—or stalls below psychological ceilings. Either way, the setup demands attention from both bulls and skeptics alike. BTC Bull Token Nears $5M Mark as 83% Yield Drives Staking Momentum Investor participation in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to accelerate, with the Ethereum-based project approaching a key funding milestone. As of Thursday, the presale has raised $4,987,959.62, moving closer to its next pricing threshold set at $5,741,234. The token is currently priced at $0.00248, giving prospective buyers a narrow window to enter before the next price adjustment. Yield-Driven Utility Meets Flexible Access What differentiates BTCBULL from typical meme assets is its utility-focused design. The project offers a staking mechanism that delivers a projected 83% annual yield, alongside Bitcoin-based distribution rewards. Importantly, stakers can access their tokens at any time—no fixed lockups or withdrawal delays. Latest Staking Stats: Total Tokens Staked: 1,268,011,229 BTCBULL Annual Yield: 83% APY Unstaking: Anytime access This structure appeals to both passive income seekers and users looking to capitalize on potential token appreciation—without sacrificing liquidity. Presale Snapshot and Market Positioning The presale is entering its final stretch before the token price increases. With less than $754,000 remaining until the next tier, current buyers are securing positions ahead of anticipated upward repricing. Presale Metrics (as of today): Token Price: $0.00248 USDT Raised: $4.98M out of $5.74M target BTCBULL blends yield-generation with upside exposure, offering a unique entry point for those navigating the evolving meme token landscape.

Meanwhile, whales are piling into Bitcoin again, signaling strong market confidence and pushing prices to new highs. Bitcoin Whales Break 15-Year Silence with $5M Transaction A long-dormant Bitcoin whale woke up, drawing attention from across the crypto space. According to The Bitcoin Historian , a wallet holding 50 BTC mined 15 years ago has moved its funds. These coins, originally mined in 2010 when the price of 1 BTC was below $0.10, have now profited by an astonishing 93,460,500% . Overall, the value of 50 BTC was less than $5. Today, with Bitcoin trading above $94,000, the same holdings are now worth nearly $4.7 million . A similar case unfolded in November 2024, a BTC holder earned a massive profit of 150 million percent, when he sold his 2,000 BTC holdings, originally worth just $120, for approximately $179 million. Are Whales buying Bitcoin Right Now? Bitcoin's value has jumped +11.2%, and this has once again coincided with key whales & sharks adding on to their already enormous bags.

This brings their total holdings to an all-time high of 13.47 million BTC. At the same time, Bitcoin’s price jumped by 11.2%, reaching $94,430.89. This pattern shows that when these large investors buy more BTC, it often leads to a rise in price. Their buying reduces the supply available in the market, which can push prices higher. Glassnode’s latest data shows that large Bitcoin holders are buying more during the recent price rise. Wallets with over 10,000 BTC are in heavy buying mode, while those holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC are not far behind. Even mid-sized wallets with 100 to 1,000 BTC are starting to increase their holdings.

This latest skirmish highlights the ongoing rivalry and strong opinions within the world of Blockchain Technology . What Sparked the Latest Crypto Debate? The recent friction began when Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson offered a stark prediction about the future of Ethereum during a recent Ask Me Anything (AMA) session. Hoskinson drew a comparison between Ethereum and BlackBerry, the once-dominant smartphone maker that was ultimately overtaken by competitors like the iPhone. He suggested that Ethereum, despite its current market position, might not survive the next 10 to 15 years, implying it could suffer a similar fate of obsolescence. Such bold statements from a figurehead of a rival blockchain naturally drew attention and responses from various corners of the crypto community. Helius CEO Fires Back at Cardano Founder Stepping into the fray was Mert Mumtaz, the Helius CEO . Helius is a key developer platform built on the Solana blockchain, another significant competitor to both Ethereum and Cardano. Mumtaz took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to address Hoskinson’s criticism directly. Mumtaz’s response didn’t just defend Ethereum; it also turned the spotlight onto Cardano itself. While acknowledging that Ethereum has its flaws and shortcomings – a common point of discussion among blockchain developers and users – Mumtaz argued that it possesses significantly more substance and established utility compared to Cardano. He urged the Cardano project to first secure a meaningful foothold in the market, specifically suggesting they aim for at least a 10% market share in any single relevant metric (such as DeFi total value locked, transaction volume, or developer activity) before its founder makes sweeping claims about the demise of Ethereum. Mumtaz went further, describing Cardano as essentially “vaporware” with no real competitive presence or impact in the current blockchain landscape. This strong label suggests a perception that Cardano lacks tangible, widely adopted applications or significant network effects compared to its peers. Understanding the Stakes: Ethereum vs. Cardano To appreciate the context of this Crypto Debate , it’s helpful to understand the positions of the two blockchain giants at the heart of the discussion: Ethereum: Launched in 2015, Ethereum is the largest smart contract platform by market capitalization and has the most established ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and gaming. Despite facing challenges like scalability and high transaction fees (though improvements are being made with Ethereum 2.0/Serenity upgrades), it remains the dominant player. Cardano: Founded by Charles Hoskinson, one of Ethereum’s co-founders, Cardano launched in stages starting in 2017. It aims to be a more scalable, secure, and sustainable blockchain platform built on peer-reviewed research. While it has a strong community and active development, its ecosystem of dApps and user adoption significantly lags behind Ethereum. The rivalry is intense because they compete for developers, users, and investment in the smart contract platform space. Critiques from figures like Hoskinson are often seen as attempts to highlight Ethereum’s weaknesses to promote Cardano’s perceived strengths. Why Does This Debate Matter for Blockchain Technology? Exchanges like the one between the Helius CEO and the Cardano founder are more than just personal spats. They reflect fundamental disagreements about which technical approaches and development philosophies are best for the future of Blockchain Technology . Arguments about market share, developer activity, and real-world usage are crucial indicators of a blockchain’s health and potential for long-term survival and success. While Hoskinson points to potential future disruption based on technological evolution (like BlackBerry vs. iPhone), Mumtaz emphasizes current, tangible achievements and market presence as the true measure of a project’s substance. The term “vaporware” is a particularly harsh criticism, implying a project exists more in concept and promises than in functional reality and adoption. What Can We Learn From This Exchange? This public disagreement offers a few key takeaways for anyone following the crypto space: Competition is Fierce: The smart contract platform space is highly competitive, with projects constantly vying for dominance. Different Metrics Matter: Proponents of different blockchains often focus on metrics that favor their own platform (e.g., theoretical scalability vs. current TVL). Community and Leadership Impact: The public statements of founders and CEOs can significantly influence market perception and fuel debate. Substance vs. Potential: There’s an ongoing tension between projects with established ecosystems (like Ethereum) and those promising significant future improvements (like Cardano). Concluding Thoughts: The Future of Ethereum and Cardano While Charles Hoskinson’s prediction about Ethereum ‘s long-term viability is a provocative one, Mert Mumtaz’s counterpoint highlights a critical factor: current utility and market adoption. The debate underscores that in the rapidly evolving world of Blockchain Technology , both innovation and established network effects play vital roles. Whether Cardano can gain the significant market share that the Helius CEO suggests is necessary, or if Ethereum will indeed face an existential threat in the coming decade, remains to be seen. What is clear is that the competitive spirit and vocal disagreements among blockchain leaders are far from over, continuing to shape the narrative around these foundational technologies.

Prices rise fast, fall faster, and recover when least expected. The projects that endure don’t just survive the dips—they build through them. And that’s why names like Solana , XRP , and Bitcoin continue to attract capital even when the broader market stumbles. These aren’t passing trends. They’re cornerstone protocols that have weathered cycles and continue to play essential roles across infrastructure, payments, and long-term investment theses. But while the legacy leaders maintain their presence, new contenders are stepping into the light—one of them being MAGACOINFINANCE . MAGACOINFINANCE Is Stepping Into Focus With Quiet, Strategic Growth There’s something different about how MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining ground. It’s not riding a viral moment or reacting to market hype. Instead, it’s moving in steady waves—through community building, platform development, and consistent execution. The token’s growth isn’t loud—but it’s visible to those who know where to look. Early discussions are picking up across trading groups and analyst circles. Its roadmap is being examined not just for what’s promised, but for what’s already been delivered. That level of scrutiny usually doesn’t come this early—and the fact that it’s holding up under it says a lot. For those looking beyond price charts and into behavioral signals, MAGACOINFINANCE is starting to stand out for all the right reasons. The Resilient Four: XRP, Solana, Hedera Hashgraph, and Chainlink XRP remains a go-to for institutional-grade payment networks. Its focus on regulatory compliance and enterprise-scale partnerships makes it one of the few cryptos already integrated into global finance. Solana continues to impress as a developer-friendly ecosystem. Its speed and scalability power some of the most active NFT and DeFi platforms, keeping it at the center of innovation. Hedera Hashgraph stands apart with its enterprise-first model. Government collaborations and corporate pilots reflect its broader ambitions beyond the retail trading crowd. Chainlink , as always, is the unsung hero of decentralized data. As more protocols demand trustworthy oracles, Chainlink’s role only deepens—silently powering the systems others rely on. All of these projects remain worthy. But they are also mature. Their discovery arcs are complete. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is still writing its story—and that freshness is something investors constantly seek. Final Reflection Market dips come and go—but conviction stays. Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP have proven time and again that they deserve investor attention. But in a market built on both foundation and foresight, rising stars deserve a closer look. MAGACOINFINANCE may not be as loud—but it’s building with purpose. And in crypto, quiet confidence often leads to the most surprising outcomes.

Is a BTC price correction incoming?,https://crypto.news/santiment-flags-retail-fomo-surge-after-bitcoin-tops-94k-is-a-btc-price-correction-incoming/,"A fresh wave of excitement among retail traders has been triggered by Bitcoin’s rise above $94,000, but there are fears of a possible retracement. According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, fear of missing out among smaller traders spiked soon after the Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) recent price jump. In a post published on Apr. 25 via X, Santiment noted that this type of crowd behavior often appears near local market tops. “$100K could very likely arrive in the near future, but it typically won’t happen till the rocket emojis calm,” the team added. 📊 Following Bitcoin's surge above $94.2K Wednesday, @santimentfeed data showed that FOMO began pouring in from retail traders. This crowd reaction typically leads to tops. $100K could very likely arrive in the near future, but it typically won't happen til the 🚀 emojis calm. https://t.co/KPiUTkyCWw — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 25, 2025 Meanwhile, large holders continue to buy. In another update on the same day, Santiment reported that wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 Bitcoin have added over 19,255 BTC in the short stretch. Since Mar. 22, these key players have accumulated more than 50,000 BTC, now holding over 67% of the total supply. Additionally, CryptoQuant’s Apr. 25 analysis pointed to positive on-chain trends. The firm reported that the 100-day moving average of Bitcoin netflows to exchanges has fallen to its lowest level since February 2023. This is the biggest amount of Bitcoin outflows in more than two years, which suggests that investors might be putting their money in self-custody or cold storage for the long run.

Have you been keeping an eye on the action in the world of regulated digital asset products? The latest figures from the US spot Bitcoin ETF market are certainly grabbing attention, signaling continued strong interest from investors. According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, April 24th was a particularly robust day for these investment vehicles. Collectively, the US spot Bitcoin ETF products recorded a significant net inflow totaling $442.46 million. This impressive figure marks the fifth consecutive trading day where these ETFs have seen more money come in than go out, highlighting a positive trend in investor sentiment towards Bitcoin exposure via regulated channels. What’s Behind the Consistent Bitcoin ETF Inflows? The sustained pattern of Bitcoin ETF inflows suggests growing confidence and potentially increasing adoption among both retail and institutional investors. After the initial excitement and volatility following their launch in January, these products appear to be finding a steady rhythm of accumulation. Several factors could be contributing to this trend: Market Stability: Periods of relative price stability or upward movement in Bitcoin can encourage investment. Accessibility: ETFs offer a familiar and accessible way for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership (wallets, exchanges, security). Institutional Interest: Large financial institutions often prefer regulated products like ETFs for compliance and ease of integration into existing portfolios. Halving Anticipation/Impact: The recent Bitcoin halving event may also be influencing investor behavior, leading some to accumulate in anticipation of potential supply-side impacts. These consistent inflows act as a significant demand sink for Bitcoin, absorbing supply and potentially providing support for its price. Leading the Pack: A Closer Look at IBIT Inflows and Other Performers While the overall picture shows strong net inflows, some ETFs are clearly attracting more capital than others. On April 24th, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) once again demonstrated its dominance in the market. Here’s a breakdown of the inflows for the top-performing ETFs on that day: BlackRock (IBIT): A staggering $327.78 million in net inflows. BlackRock’s offering has consistently led the charge since its launch, indicating strong investor trust and reach. The significant IBIT inflows are a key driver of the overall market figures. ARK Invest & 21Shares (ARKB): Followed with a healthy $97.02 million in net inflows. ARKB has also been a consistent performer, appealing to investors seeking exposure through Ark’s investment strategies. Bitwise (BITB): Added $10.18 million in net inflows. Bitwise has positioned itself as a crypto-native expert, and its ETF continues to attract investment. Invesco & Galaxy Digital (BTCO): Saw $7.48 million in net inflows. BTCO represents another option for investors looking for regulated Bitcoin exposure. Interestingly, the remaining US spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no change in their holdings on April 24th, meaning they experienced neither significant inflows nor outflows. This concentration of inflows into the top few players, particularly IBIT, highlights the competitive landscape and investor preference for certain providers. The Significance of This Crypto Investment Trend The continued positive flow into US spot Bitcoin ETF products is a crucial indicator for the broader cryptocurrency market. It signifies ongoing mainstream acceptance and validates Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate asset class in the eyes of traditional finance. This consistent crypto investment via regulated products provides a steady stream of capital entering the ecosystem, different from the flows seen only on crypto-native exchanges. For investors, the presence of these ETFs offers diversification opportunities within traditional portfolios. It bridges the gap between legacy finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets, making it easier for financial advisors and institutions to allocate capital to Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for Digital Asset Investment? The success and sustained inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETF s are setting a precedent for other digital assets. The demand seen for Bitcoin exposure through this regulated structure could pave the way for similar products focusing on other cryptocurrencies, assuming regulatory environments become favorable. This expanding access through familiar investment vehicles is likely to accelerate the integration of digital asset investment into mainstream financial planning. While the market remains subject to volatility, the structural demand created by these ETFs adds a new, significant layer to the Bitcoin market. It provides a clearer picture of institutional and traditional retail interest, moving beyond speculation on crypto exchanges alone. Summary: A Bullish Signal? The $442.46 million in net inflows on April 24th, contributing to five consecutive days of positive flows, is a clear signal of strengthening demand for Bitcoin through regulated US ETF channels. BlackRock’s IBIT continues to lead the charge, demonstrating the power of established financial players entering the crypto space. This trend underscores the growing importance of US spot Bitcoin ETF s in the market structure and points towards increasing mainstream adoption of digital asset investment . While past performance is not indicative of future results, the consistent Bitcoin ETF inflows provide a compelling narrative of sustained interest and accumulation in the digital asset space, potentially offering long-term support for Bitcoin’s market position.

Using Cloudflare’s basic service in this manner is a violation of the Terms of Service. Please visit cfl.re/tos to learn more,” the message read on April 24. RTFKT’s head of tech, Samuel Cardillo, has refuted claims that it missed a payment, attributing the issue to changes happening with RTFKT’s “current Cloudflare setup.” NFT content creator Wale Swoosh earlier speculated that RTFKT may have subscribed to an inadequate Cloudflare plan for high-traffic image serving. Cloudflare offers a range of web infrastructure services. Source: Wale Swoosh Most of the CloneX NFTs have started to reappear, according to Cardillo, who added that Cloudflare has fixed the issue. However, the incident sparked considerable outrage from some CloneX holders, including one NFT holder who spent $1.25 million on a CloneX NFT. Source: mOpO680 The issue prompted Cardillo to find a more decentralized solution to host the NFTs. “I am working closely with ArDrive to decentralize both CloneX and Animus to ensure that post-30 April, no downtime of your favorite art ever happen again.” In a separate post, Cardillo said CloneX would specifically move to the decentralized data storage platform Arweave. Cardillo is RTFKT’s last man standing since the firm shuttered in January RTFKT — which pioneered virtual sneakers and was bought out by Nike in December 2021 — has largely been a one-man show since the shoe maker shuttered its operations in January. “Keep in mind that I am the last man standing and therefore I am doing it all myself,” Cardillo said in response to a flood of complaints shortly after the incident occurred. RTFKT confirmed its closure with an ambiguous letter, claiming it “isn’t ending” and would become what it has always meant to be — an “artifact of cultural revolution.” No substantial developments at RTFKT have come about since the December announcement.

OpenSea co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer said they would “reimagine everything,” and that a new version would come in December. On Feb. 13, OpenSea launched the open beta for OS2, allowing the public to finally use its platform after a period of reserved access for private beta users. The NFT marketplace also teased the launch of the project’s official token, SEA. Apart from launching a revamped NFT marketplace, the project ventured into crypto token trading. On April 19, the platform announced that it had opened its Solana trading access for all its users, skipping a scheduled closed beta phase limited to 50,000 users. The new feature allows OpenSea users to trade Solana tokens, including popular memecoins like Bonk and Ai16z. In addition to platform developments, the NFT marketplace had also been freed from regulatory scrutiny.

In an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on his YouTube channel, Hoskinson says he doesn’t “think Ethereum will survive more than 10 to 15 years.” According to Hoskinson, Ethereum faces existential threats both from within its ecosystem and externally. “The [Ethereum] layer-2s will continue to suckle out all of the alpha and people will start fighting and it will get harder and harder for [Ethereum co-founder] Vitalik [Buterin] to be able to hold it together through sheer force of will. And users will gradually migrate to other places and then they’re going to get eclipsed by Bitcoin DeFi (decentralized finance). Because once that turns on, the TVL (total value locked) will be larger than Ethereum and a lot of people will start migrating in that particular direction… …and the other thing is they’re being eaten alive by Solana and Sui and these other things. So, brilliant project. It’s just a victim of its own success. Like MySpace [social network] or any of these other things that have a lot of network effect and momentum. BlackBerry [smartphone] is another example. But people have fundamentally different paradigms that over the long term are intrinsically superior. And they creep up on you.” The Cardano creator says that Ethereum’s problems can be traced to three mistakes made by the founders and developers. “The number one problem Ethereum has is that they took an easy road out where they did three things wrong. So first off, wrong protocols. They have the wrong accounting model, they have the wrong virtual machine and they have the wrong consensus model. All of these were self-inflicted wounds. People told them not to do it, they did it and they got where they needed to go. Second, what they chose to do to solve these problems is put in all these weird slashing economics and layer-twos and other things and now they’re living with all of the consequences of these types of things. And third, they really don’t have a good on-chain governance system So really what needs to happen is you need a parallel track with solving all those three things.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

If you’re following the crypto space, you know that regulatory clarity, or lack thereof, has been a major factor influencing where companies choose to build and grow. Recently, the President of Ripple Labs, Monica Long, shed light on a significant strategic shift: a major Ripple US expansion is now underway, largely thanks to what the company sees as increasingly crypto-friendly policies emerging from the U.S. administration. Why is Ripple Labs Betting Big on US Crypto Policy? For years, the regulatory environment in the United States has been a point of contention and uncertainty for many crypto firms, including Ripple Labs. The ongoing legal battle with the SEC has been a prime example of this. However, recent statements and potential shifts in approach from U.S. regulators and policymakers seem to be instilling a renewed sense of confidence in some industry leaders. Monica Long highlighted in a recent interview that this evolving landscape is a primary driver behind Ripple’s decision to significantly scale up its domestic operations. This isn’t just talk; it involves tangible steps: Increased Hiring: Ripple is actively growing its team within the U.S., bringing in talent to support its expanding initiatives. Exploring M&A: The company is on the lookout for further mergers and acquisitions to bolster its capabilities and market position in the States. Scaling Operations: Beyond just headcount, the infrastructure and operational footprint are being expanded to handle increased business volume domestically. This focus on the U.S. market signals a belief that the regulatory tide may be turning, creating a more favorable environment for crypto businesses to operate and innovate. A Key Move: The Hidden Road Acquisition One concrete example of Ripple’s expansion strategy in action is the recent Hidden Road acquisition . Hidden Road is a prime broker for digital assets, offering services that are crucial for institutional participation in the crypto markets. Acquiring a firm like Hidden Road allows Ripple to: Expand its offerings to institutional clients. Strengthen its presence in the institutional crypto trading and financing space. Integrate prime brokerage services into its existing suite of enterprise solutions. This acquisition is a clear indication that Ripple is not just expanding its team but also strategically acquiring capabilities to enhance its business model within the U.S. and globally, leveraging the perceived shift in US crypto policy . What About a Ripple IPO? A question often asked by investors and market watchers is whether Ripple Labs plans to go public via an initial public offering ( Ripple IPO ). With the company expanding and seemingly finding its footing even amid regulatory challenges, an IPO might seem like a logical next step. However, Monica Long clarified that while the company is well-capitalized – boasting billions in cash reserves – the focus right now is squarely on business growth and expansion, not an IPO. Being well-funded provides Ripple with the flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions like Hidden Road and invest heavily in its core business areas without immediate pressure from public market demands or the need to raise capital through an offering. This means that while a Ripple IPO remains a possibility in the future, it is not the company’s immediate priority. The current emphasis is on building out its products, services, and market share, particularly within the U.S. as the regulatory picture potentially brightens. Benefits and Challenges of Ripple’s US Focus Ripple’s decision to double down on its Ripple US expansion comes with potential benefits and challenges: Potential Benefits: Capitalizing on a potentially massive domestic market. Closer engagement with U.S. policymakers and regulators to help shape future US crypto policy . Attracting top U.S.-based talent. Leveraging the U.S. financial infrastructure. Potential Challenges: Lingering regulatory uncertainties, despite positive signs. Competition from other crypto firms operating in the U.S. Executing successful integrations of acquisitions like Hidden Road acquisition . Managing the ongoing legal situation while simultaneously expanding. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community What does this news mean for you, whether you’re an investor, developer, or simply interested in the crypto space? Watch US Crypto Policy: Keep a close eye on developments in U.S. crypto regulation. Ripple’s move suggests industry leaders see positive momentum, which could impact other projects. Understand Ripple’s Strategy: Ripple is focusing on enterprise solutions and institutional services, evidenced by the Hidden Road acquisition . This indicates their primary business direction. Don’t Hold Your Breath for a Ripple IPO: While possible long-term, it’s not happening anytime soon. Their focus is internal growth and strategic M&A. Ripple Labs is Confident: The significant investment in U.S. expansion signals strong confidence from Ripple’s leadership in their future prospects, despite past and present challenges. Summary: Ripple’s Strategic Pivot to the States In conclusion, Ripple Labs is making a calculated and significant move by prioritizing its Ripple US expansion . This strategic pivot is largely influenced by perceived positive shifts in US crypto policy , creating what Ripple sees as a more conducive environment for growth. The company is actively hiring, exploring further M&A opportunities following the notable Hidden Road acquisition , and is well-funded with billions in cash. While the idea of a Ripple IPO is often discussed, President Monica Long confirms it is not an immediate plan, with the current focus firmly on building and scaling the business domestically. This aggressive expansion signals Ripple’s determination to solidify its position in a key global market as regulatory clarity potentially increases.

Sui ( SUI ) price continues to surge, up 18% in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $3.57. Today’s surge extends the rally that began on April 21, when SUI started printing consecutive green daily candles from an opening price of $2.10, accompanied by increasing volume. On April 22, SUI price broke out of a bullish double bottom pattern, piercing the neckline at around $2.80. It has now gained around 67% since the start of the rally. The price is now about key short-term and long-term moving averages, including 20 EMA, 50 SMA, 100 SMA, and 200 SMA. Momentum indicators back the bullish thesis with bullish crossover on MACD and widening gap. RSI is in the overbought zone, indicating a potential short-term pullback. However, volume is going up alongside price, which confirms strong buy-side conviction rather than weak momentum or a false breakout. Source: TradingView The breakout above the $2.80 neckline of the double bottom pattern marked a major shift in trend. That move confirmed a bullish reversal and paved the way for a measured move target in the $3.50–$3.60 range — which SUI has now hit. Looking ahead, the next immediate target is around $3.85 — the next major resistance zone based on 2.618 Fibonacci extension, a common profit taking level where the pullback is likely to occur. Then, $4.55 (a stretch target — momentum must stay strong) and $5 might come into play.

The interest is rising for tokens like BONK , DOGE , and SHIB . The next big move for these digital currencies is anticipated. Investors are eager to see which will soar. Dive deeper to discover which of these memecoins are poised for growth and ready to take the lead. Bonk Tokens: Surge Amid Long-Term Downturn Bonk experienced a significant 21% gain in the last week, though it only increased by 0.7% over the past month. In the previous six months, the coin saw a notable 30% decline, highlighting ongoing bearish sentiment. This recent surge stands in sharp contrast to the longer trend of downward movement, showcasing the coin's volatility and tendency for abrupt price changes. Current price levels show support around $0.00001 and resistance near $0.00002, with an additional resistance at $0.00003. A relative strength index of nearly 59 indicates moderate buying pressure, but mixed momentum signals reflect an absence of a clear trend. Traders may look for short-term opportunities between these levels while monitoring for any potential break in support. Dogecoin Price Action: Recovery Amid Volatility A 4.65% decline over the past month contrasts with a 32.05% gain over the last six months. Weekly gains of 12.16% indicate moments of strong upward movement despite some pullbacks. Price movement has shown volatility yet resilience, with short-term fluctuations revealing underlying strength during the overall market recovery. The current trading range spans from approximately $0.13 to $0.23. Immediate support is near $0.08 and resistance around $0.28, with a secondary resistance at $0.38. Bulls are actively testing these levels, creating trading opportunities within this range while the trend remains uncertain, balancing cautious buying with timely profit booking. Shiba Inu's Recent Market Dance Shiba Inu showed a modest decline of about 2% over the past month and a more noticeable drop of nearly 20% during the previous six-month period. A one-week surge of approximately 12% marked a brief recovery amid a generally declining trend. These movements indicate short-term volatility and longer-term bearish pressure shaping its price behavior. Price currently trades between $0.00001 and $0.00002, with a firm resistance level at $0.00002 and support at $0.00001. No clear trend dominates as bulls achieved a brief lift while bears maintain control over the extended outlook. Traders might consider entering near support and targeting resistance for potential short-term gains. Conclusion The growth or decline of memecoins like BONK , DOGE , and SHIB can depend on shifts in market interest and trends. Although past performance provides some insight, these coins often experience rapid and unpredictable changes. Current market dynamics suggest that movements could happen soon, but the exact direction for each token remains uncertain. Investors should watch market signals closely to stay informed.

Coinbase analysts are taking a more cautious stance on the short-term crypto market, with expectations that the floor may not come into view until late Q2. In a joint research report with blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, Coinbase analysts highlighted that while long-term Bitcoin ( BTC ) holders are steadily accumulating more coins, the exchange still foresees ongoing weakness before any potential rebound takes shape. “Bitcoins’ liquid supply (coins moved within three months) decreased in 1Q25, which suggests long-term Bitcoin holders have begun steadily accumulating more BTC since the end of February as the price dropped below $90,000.” Coinbase Despite the accumulation, Coinbase stressed that a defensive approach might be needed in the near term, citing concerns about possible market downturns. “We think a defensive stance on risk-taking may be warranted for the time being, but we still believe that crypto prices may be able to find their floor in mid-to-late 2Q25 — setting up a better 3Q25.” Coinbase You might also like: Bitcoin bear market could last at least six months: CryptoQuant CEO According to the company, both Bitcoin and the COIN50 index — tracks the performance of the 50 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap — have recently broken below their respective 200-day moving averages, signaling bearish trends.

This follows many regulatory bodies in the United States, which are taking a different stance on crypto investment and freeing up capital to invest in crypto innovations. The Fed cited evolving changes in risk assessment and financial innovations, with banks at the forefront of these new developments, and a changing supply chain influenced by both local and offshore political actors. Banking regulators, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), have made similar changes weeks ago, regarding the banking sector and its ability to choose which crypto industries it engages with. The changes stipulate that banks do not have to report investments before engaging with the crypto industry. Banks do not have to seek permission to invest in crypto innovations. The change comes as government officials frown on past practices of debanking. The regulators, however, have their reasons for distrusting the crypto sector, as they created these advisory policies immediately after the FTX collapse in January 2023. The FTX disaster was an embarrassment for regulators because it marked a stark failure for American regulators to prevent a brewing banking disaster right in front of everyone. The regulators considered any crypto activity, including trading, storing, or mining, to be contrary to good banking laws. Crypto innovators, however, especially those affected by debanking rules, would point out that anti-crypto regulations occurred long before the FTX crisis. The Federal Reserve has now joined these banks in reversing the negative policies, allowing banks to invest in crypto without seeking pre-approval. Banks will now have the freedom to make their own discretionary decisions about crypto investments, using their own trained staff, such as compliance executives and managers, to conduct good banking practices. The Fed has joined with regulators, the FDIC and OCC, in reversing the draconian laws against crypto. The bankers, however, will still need guidance on crypto policies because Congress will need to develop suitable policies to ensure they conduct themselves appropriately. The Fed has stated that it wants to collaborate with other agencies, such as the FDIC and OCC, to ensure consistency in regulations. This is partly why the Fed has reversed its debanking policies, as it wishes to complement the FDIC and OCC. The Fed has stated that it may introduce new policies in the future, depending on the market, to better adapt to crypto innovations. In March, the OCC rolled back its debanking policies, stating that national banks and federal savings associations could engage with crypto, allowing these institutions to use stablecoins or participate in decentralized platforms. In March, the FDIC also announced that banks do not need to seek approval to engage with crypto assets and can use their risk assessments and discretionary powers to make investment decisions. These changes come as Trump returns to the White House, easing regulatory restrictions and introducing more libertarian measures in the banking and crypto world. The OCC, moreover, stated that it would stop assessing banks for reputation risk, which was one of the reasons it restricted the use of crypto banking. The crypto industry, however, still feels the sting from draconian regulations and may still need time to recover from what was a loss of time and money.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-25 09:28:59

These particular giants dominate all of the headlines, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a more lesser-known project priced at merely $0.025, is quietly earning analysts’ top watchlists placement at this time. MUTM might not merely compete against leading cryptocurrencies throughout the coming 12 months. The idea that it might exceed their performance is increasingly plausible. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t just another DeFi token. It’s a fully structured protocol focused on decentralized lending and borrowing, designed to serve both experienced traders and newcomers looking for steady yield opportunities. While many crypto projects lean on hype or vague roadmaps, Mutuum brings a clear value proposition backed by real utility, an active presale, and a growing ecosystem that’s aligned for growth. At the core of Mutuum’s model is the use of mtTokens—deposit tokens that represent user assets held in the protocol’s smart contracts. These mtTokens not only track deposits 1:1 but also accumulate interest over time. Users can lend their assets, receive mtTokens in return, and either hold them to earn passive income or use them across the broader DeFi space. Unlike meme coins that spike and crash with social sentiment, MUTM is built around a revenue-linked token model. A share of the platform’s income is allocated to buy MUTM from the open market. The acquired tokens are then redistributed to participants who hold mtTokens. This creates a circular incentive that strengthens participation and demand. Now trading at about $0.025, analysts draw even growing attention to MUTM because they see such strong breakout potential once the token launches. Entry at this stage now represents one of the most affordable points with a total of 11 presale phases as well as the price rising in each. The following stage shall drive the cost to $0.03. The token is expected to list upon various major cryptocurrency exchanges after launch. Given the structure of the token economy, rising demand from exchange listings, and actual yield-generating mechanisms in place, MUTM is projected to see a price jump of up to 1,700% within the first few days after launch. But it doesn’t stop there—long-term forecasts suggest the token could eventually cross the $3 mark within 12 months, especially as utilities go live and the stablecoin system is integrated into the ecosystem. To put this into perspective: a $1,000 investment at today’s price secures 40,000 MUTM tokens. When the token hits $3, that position could be worth $120,000. Even at a more conservative $1 valuation, that’s a 40x return—something few established tokens are likely to offer within the same period. What makes Mutuum so attractive in the current cycle is its focus on real use cases. The platform is getting ready to introduce an overcollateralized stablecoin, designed to maintain a U.S. dollar peg through algorithmic mechanisms and on-chain collateral. This stablecoin will let users borrow while still holding onto their appreciating assets—removing the need to sell during market upswings. It’s a feature designed for long-term users, not just traders chasing the next pump. The upcoming platform is being developed with smart contracts audited by CertiK, ensuring that users will have a secure environment to interact with. The emphasis on transparency and safety has already helped Mutuum attract attention from experienced investors—many of whom have previously been active in projects like Solana, Polygon, and Avalanche. Bitcoin and Ethereum are now mature markets. Their gains, while still impressive, are unlikely to match the explosive growth seen in their early years. That’s where tokens like MUTM come in—micro cap entries with scalable infrastructure and rising adoption. With more than $7 million raised in the presale and nearly 9,000 holders already on board, the project is building real momentum. Its hybrid model—offering both yield and growth potential—positions it as a serious contender for the next big DeFi breakout. And unlike many speculative tokens, Mutuum Finance gives investors access to passive income, smart borrowing options, and exposure to future protocol upgrades. As the market enters a bullish cycle, the real winners are likely to be tokens that combine smart tokenomics with real functionality. MUTM ticks both boxes. With a low entry point, growing demand, and a DeFi model built for sustainability, this $0.025 token is one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in now—especially for those focused on long-term ROI rather than short-term pumps. For investors who missed early opportunities in Ethereum or Solana, Mutuum Finance might just be the most strategic play available in 2025.

That information came from the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday, showing that in 2024, California reached a GDP of $4.10 trillion, while Japan sat at $4.01 trillion. That puts California at number four globally. Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, announced the numbers with a straight-up statement. “California isn’t just keeping pace with the world, we’re setting the pace,” Gavin said. Trump’s tariffs put California’s economy on edge Gavin was also calling out Donald Trump’s trade policies. He said the progress California made is “threatened by the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration.” He also added, “California’s economy powers the nation, and it must be protected.” The Trump administration has already slapped 10% tariffs on almost every country shipping goods into the U.S., with a 90-day delay on additional increases. Then they hit Mexico and Canada with a 25% tariff. The main blow landed on China, triggering a full trade war between the first and second largest economies in the world. Right now, Chinese imports to the U.S. are getting taxed up to 145%, and China responded by hitting U.S. goods with 125% tariffs. That wasn’t even the end. Trump’s administration said the full total on some Chinese products could hit 245%, once the new charges stack on top of the old ones. Gavin filed a lawsuit earlier this month to block the president’s power to throw around these tariffs, saying that California runs America’s biggest ports, tech companies, farms, and factories. Trump’s tariffs mess with global trade, and that hits California harder than anyone. Japan stumbles while California climbs Japan didn’t drop because of bad luck. It’s facing long-term problems. The population is shrinking, people are getting older, and the workforce is getting smaller. At the same time, the cost of caring for all those retirees keeps going up. That’s killing Japan’s momentum. Earlier this week, the IMF downgraded Japan’s economic forecast. It said Japan’s central bank won’t raise interest rates as fast as expected, because the country is under pressure. The IMF’s World Economic Outlook said the higher tariffs from April 2 (and the confusion around them) are eating into whatever gains Japan was hoping for from wage growth and better consumer spending. “The effect of tariffs announced on April 2 and associated uncertainty offset the expected strengthening of private consumption with above-inflation wage growth boosting household disposable income,” the report said. California, on the other hand, is stacked. It has the largest share of U.S. agriculture and manufacturing, it’s got Silicon Valley, Hollywood, and it controls the two biggest seaports in the country. All of that adds up to serious leverage in the global economy. But even with all that power, Gavin warned that Trump’s trade moves are risking California’s entire economic engine. Trump, though, says the tariffs are needed. He claims the U.S. has been taxed unfairly by other countries for years and now he’s just “leveling the playing field.” The interest rate cuts Trump pushed are meant to make borrowing cheaper and pull factories and jobs back into the U.S. But Gavin doesn’t buy that. He’s more focused on the here and now: rising costs, slowed trade, and economic threats piling up on the West Coast.

This nightmare became a reality for one individual in South Korea, who reportedly lost a significant amount of Bitcoin to cunning thieves. The recent Bitcoin theft case in South Korea highlights the critical importance of securing your cryptocurrency, especially the seemingly simple, yet powerful, wallet recovery phrase . South Korea Bitcoin Theft: Unpacking the $4.1 Million Crime The details emerging from South Korea paint a picture of a sophisticated operation. Authorities have apprehended four individuals in connection with the theft of 45 Bitcoin, an amount valued at approximately 5.9 billion won, or roughly $4.1 million at the time of the report. The victim’s digital assets were allegedly siphoned off after the suspects gained unauthorized access to their crypto wallet. According to reports, the perpetrators didn’t resort to complex hacking methods in the traditional sense. Their alleged strategy was far more insidious: they reportedly approached the victim under the guise of offering a secure storage solution for their digital assets. This seemingly helpful offer was, in fact, a ruse to secretly obtain the victim’s wallet recovery phrase – the master key to their crypto holdings. The Master Key: Why Your Wallet Recovery Phrase is Paramount For anyone holding cryptocurrency, the wallet recovery phrase (also known as a seed phrase) is the single most important piece of information. Think of it as the ultimate backup for your crypto wallet. It’s typically a list of 12 or 24 words that allows you to restore access to your funds on any compatible wallet software or hardware, even if you lose or damage your original device. Here’s why it’s so critical: Full Access: Anyone with your recovery phrase can gain complete control over your cryptocurrency stored in that wallet. No Password Needed: Unlike a password that protects the wallet on a specific device, the recovery phrase bypasses this layer of security entirely. It grants access to the underlying private keys. Offline Security is Key: Because it’s the ultimate key, it should ideally never be stored digitally where it can be accessed by malware or hackers. Physical, secure storage is paramount. In the South Korea crypto crime case, the suspects allegedly exploited the victim’s trust and potentially their lack of understanding about the power of the recovery phrase to gain access. Tracking the Thieves: The Power of Blockchain Forensics While cryptocurrency transactions are often described as anonymous, they are more accurately described as pseudonymous. Every transaction is recorded on a public ledger – the blockchain. This inherent transparency, while sometimes complex to follow, is a powerful tool for law enforcement and blockchain forensics experts. In this Bitcoin theft case, investigators in Seoul leveraged blockchain forensics to track the flow of the stolen 45 Bitcoin. This wasn’t a quick process; police reportedly spent 10 months tracing the movement and laundering of the illicitly obtained crypto assets. By analyzing the transaction patterns, identifying linked wallets, and potentially collaborating with exchanges or other services, they were able to follow the digital trail left on the blockchain. Here’s a simplified look at how blockchain forensics works: Transaction Tracing: Following the path of specific cryptocurrency units from one wallet address to another. Cluster Analysis: Identifying groups of wallet addresses likely controlled by the same entity. Exchange Interaction: Tracking funds moved to or from centralized exchanges, which often require identity verification (KYC). Pattern Recognition: Spotting unusual transaction patterns indicative of money laundering or other illicit activities. The successful tracking over a significant period demonstrates the increasing capability of law enforcement worldwide to combat crypto crime using these specialized techniques. The Investigation Continues: Arrests and Charges The police in Seoul announced on April 25 that their extensive investigation using blockchain forensics led to the identification and apprehension of the group. Of the four individuals arrested, two have been formally charged and transferred to prosecutors for further legal proceedings. The remaining two suspects are still under investigation, though reportedly without detention at this stage. This development underscores the commitment of authorities in South Korea to tackling crypto crime and protecting investors from theft and fraud. Preventing Yourself from Becoming a Victim: Essential Crypto Security Tips The South Korea Bitcoin theft serves as a stark reminder that while cryptocurrency technology is secure, the points of access controlled by users are often the most vulnerable. Protecting yourself requires vigilance and adherence to fundamental crypto security practices. Here are actionable steps you can take to safeguard your digital assets: Guard Your Wallet Recovery Phrase Like Gold: Write it down on paper and store it in multiple secure, offline locations (e.g., a safe, a safety deposit box). Never store it digitally (on your phone, computer, cloud storage). Never share it with anyone, ever, for any reason. Be Wary of Unsolicited Help: As seen in the South Korea case, thieves may pose as helpful individuals or services. Only use reputable, verified platforms and hardware. Be extremely suspicious of anyone offering to help you manage or secure your private keys or recovery phrase. Use Hardware Wallets: For storing significant amounts of crypto, hardware wallets (physical devices) are highly recommended. They keep your private keys offline, making them immune to online hacking attempts. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Use strong 2FA on all your crypto exchange accounts and online wallets. Be Skeptical of Too-Good-To-Be-True Offers: If an investment opportunity or service seems unusually profitable or requires you to share sensitive information, it’s likely a scam. Educate Yourself: Understand how your wallet works, the difference between public and private keys, and the importance of your recovery phrase. Implementing these crypto security measures can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to theft. The Evolving Landscape of Crypto Crime and Security As the cryptocurrency market grows, so too do the methods employed by criminals. While blockchain forensics is becoming more advanced, thieves are also adapting, using mixers, decentralized exchanges, and other techniques to obfuscate their trails. This ongoing arms race between criminals and law enforcement/security experts highlights the dynamic nature of crypto crime . Cases like the South Korea Bitcoin theft are crucial learning opportunities for the wider community. They reinforce the fact that the biggest vulnerability is often the human element and the security practices users employ. Conclusion: A Call for Heightened Vigilance The arrest of four individuals in connection with the $4.1 million Bitcoin theft in South Korea is a positive step, demonstrating that crypto crime is not untraceable. The successful use of blockchain forensics over a prolonged period was instrumental in bringing the suspects to justice. However, the method used – obtaining the wallet recovery phrase through deception – serves as a critical warning. Protecting your digital wealth ultimately rests on your shoulders. By understanding the power of your recovery phrase, implementing robust crypto security measures, and remaining vigilant against scams and social engineering tactics, you can significantly enhance the safety of your Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Let this South Korea crypto crime story be a powerful reminder to prioritize security above all else in the exciting world of digital assets.

On April 24, the task force met with Ondo Finance and law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. The discussion centered around the rules for tokenizing U.S. assets and how blockchain-based systems could comply with existing financial regulations. The session was mainly focused on creating regulatory sandboxes or relief options that could encourage innovation within the existing compliance systems. This approach shows Ondo’s commitment to providing legally compliant institutional-grade tokenization solutions through blockchain. After the news, Ondo’s token price jumped 7.5%, crossing $1 and reaching a $3 billion valuation for the first time since March 7. The token is currently showing strong upward momentum as it trades above $1.03 with a surge of over 17% in the past 24 hours. Ondo Finance has previously donated $1 million to Donald Trump’s inauguration fund, and Davis Polk recently announced that it would represent Trump’s social media company, Truth Social, in launching crypto-linked ETFs. Technical analysis shows that Ondo’s price could continue to rise in the coming weeks after it emerged from a consolidation phase. If the price manages to close above $0.98, it could rise 21%, targeting $1.18. While the support level is at $0.81 and the next target is at $1.09, a breakout could further push the price to $1.20. Besides, analyst Dami-Defi said that ONDO has broken out of its descending re-accumulation pattern and is gearing up for a macro-scale rally. The first target is $1.88, and if the momentum continues, it could reach $3.50. Another analyst suggests that Ondo could follow the trends of global money supply (M2), and something big might be on the horizon for the token. Why did ONDO’s price surge?

The world of corporate finance just got a major headline, all thanks to the king of cryptocurrencies. MicroStrategy, the software company that has become synonymous with aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, has officially crossed a monumental threshold: their total Bitcoin holdings are now valued at over $50 billion. This isn’t just a big number; it’s a testament to their long-term conviction and a significant marker for the broader trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption. The news, initially highlighted by crypto market analyst Maartunn on X, confirms that as of April 20th, MicroStrategy (now officially known simply as Strategy, though many still use the former name) held a staggering 538,200 BTC. This vast sum, accumulated over several years through strategic purchases, represents one of the largest known corporate treasuries denominated in the digital asset. How Did MicroStrategy Build Such Massive MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings? MicroStrategy’s journey into Bitcoin began in August 2020, driven by CEO Michael Saylor’s belief in Bitcoin as a superior store of value and a hedge against inflation. What started as an initial allocation quickly evolved into a core corporate strategy. Unlike companies that might dip their toes into crypto, MicroStrategy dove headfirst, using various financial maneuvers to fund their purchases. Strategic Purchases: The company has consistently bought Bitcoin, often during market dips, but also through regular acquisitions. They haven’t just bought; they’ve adopted a long-term, hold-oriented approach. Capital Raises: To fund these ambitious purchases, MicroStrategy has frequently tapped into capital markets. They’ve issued convertible senior notes (debt) and sold common stock, specifically earmarking the proceeds for Bitcoin buys. This strategy allowed them to acquire significant amounts of BTC without solely relying on their operational cash flow. Long-Term Vision: Michael Saylor has been vocal about viewing Bitcoin as a multi-decade asset. This long-term perspective has guided their accumulation strategy, allowing them to ride out market volatility and continue buying. This aggressive accumulation strategy is unique among publicly traded companies and has positioned MicroStrategy as a de facto Bitcoin investment vehicle for traditional investors looking for exposure without directly holding the asset. Understanding the $50 Billion Valuation of Bitcoin Holdings It’s crucial to understand that the $50 billion figure represents the market value of MicroStrategy’s 538,200 BTC holdings at a specific point in time (around April 20th, based on the reporting). Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, meaning this valuation fluctuates constantly with the market. While the $50 billion milestone is significant, it reflects Bitcoin’s strong performance leading up to that date. One key metric often discussed alongside the total holdings value is the company’s average cost basis for its Bitcoin. While not explicitly stated in the original snippet, MicroStrategy regularly reports this figure. Their average purchase price per Bitcoin is significantly lower than the market price when the $50 billion valuation was reached. This difference between their cost basis and the current market value represents a substantial unrealized gain, though it’s subject to market fluctuations. The $50 billion valuation isn’t just a number; it highlights the immense scale of MicroStrategy’s bet on Bitcoin and how much value that bet has generated (on paper) during bull markets. It dwarfs the market capitalization of many large corporations and underscores the potential for significant returns (and risks) associated with holding such a volatile asset. What Does This Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Signify? MicroStrategy’s pioneering Corporate Bitcoin Strategy carries significant weight beyond just their balance sheet. Their willingness to convert substantial portions of their treasury and raised capital into Bitcoin has served as a powerful case study and catalyst for others considering similar moves. Here’s what it signifies: Validation of Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset: MicroStrategy’s move legitimized the idea that Bitcoin could be a viable alternative to traditional treasury assets like cash or bonds, especially in an environment of inflation concerns and low-interest rates. Paving the Way for Others: By demonstrating a framework for acquiring and holding Bitcoin as a public company, MicroStrategy provided a blueprint and reduced the perceived risk for other corporations contemplating similar strategies. Strong Belief in Bitcoin’s Future: Holding over half a million Bitcoin, even through market downturns, signals an exceptionally strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its potential to appreciate significantly over time. This strategy isn’t without its critics, who point to the volatility risk. However, reaching the $50 billion valuation milestone during a strong market period provides a powerful counter-narrative, showcasing the potential upside when the strategy plays out favorably. The Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Like MicroStrategy’s The rise of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption is a major theme in the current crypto market cycle, and MicroStrategy is arguably its most prominent corporate champion. Their large-scale buying has a tangible impact: Supply Absorption: Accumulating hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin removes a significant amount of supply from the market, potentially contributing to price appreciation, especially when combined with other forms of demand like spot Bitcoin ETFs. Increased Legitimacy: When a NASDAQ-listed company with a long history publicly embraces Bitcoin, it lends an air of legitimacy to the asset in the eyes of traditional finance and investors who might otherwise be hesitant. Attracting Investment: MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has become a popular way for investors to gain leveraged exposure to Bitcoin, effectively acting as a proxy ETF before the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. This increased investor interest further blurs the lines between traditional markets and crypto. While MicroStrategy’s holdings alone don’t dictate the entire market, their scale and vocal advocacy for Bitcoin play a significant role in the ongoing narrative of institutional acceptance and integration. Beyond the Headlines: Analyzing MSTR Bitcoin Exposure For many investors, buying MSTR stock has become a way to get exposure to Bitcoin without directly managing private keys or dealing with crypto exchanges. The company’s valuation is now heavily tied to the price of Bitcoin, often trading at a premium or discount depending on market sentiment and perceived leverage. Analyzing MSTR Bitcoin exposure involves looking at both the underlying asset (Bitcoin) and the company’s operational business (business intelligence software). However, it’s clear that the Bitcoin holdings dominate the investment thesis for many MSTR shareholders. This creates a dynamic where MSTR stock can be more volatile than Bitcoin itself, due to the added layer of corporate leverage and market sentiment surrounding the company’s unique strategy. Key Considerations for MSTR Investors: Bitcoin Price Sensitivity: MSTR’s stock price is highly correlated with Bitcoin’s price movements. Leverage: The company has used debt to finance some purchases, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Premium/Discount: MSTR stock often trades at a premium to the net asset value of its Bitcoin holdings, reflecting demand for this indirect exposure. Understanding the interplay between MicroStrategy’s corporate structure, its financing activities, and the volatile nature of Bitcoin is essential for anyone analyzing MSTR Bitcoin exposure. Challenges and Risks While the $50 billion valuation is a positive headline, it’s important to acknowledge the inherent risks. The primary challenge is Bitcoin’s price volatility. A significant downturn in the crypto market could quickly reduce the value of MicroStrategy’s holdings and impact their stock price. Historically, under previous accounting rules, significant price drops could also trigger impairment charges on their balance sheet, although new accounting standards effective in 2025 for certain entities may change this reporting. Actionable Insights from MicroStrategy’s Strategy What can businesses and investors learn from MicroStrategy’s bold move? Conviction Pays Off (If Right): MicroStrategy’s unwavering conviction in Bitcoin, despite market cycles, has led to significant unrealized gains during bull runs. Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset: The strategy demonstrates that Bitcoin can be considered as part of a diversified corporate treasury, offering potential upside and inflation hedging, albeit with higher risk. Leverage Amplifies Results: Using debt and equity to fund purchases allowed MicroStrategy to accumulate a massive amount of BTC, amplifying returns during a rising market, but also increasing risk during a downturn. Long-Term Perspective: Their success so far is tied to a long-term holding strategy, rather than short-term trading. A Landmark Achievement MicroStrategy surpassing $50 billion in Bitcoin holdings is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a landmark event in the history of corporate finance and institutional Bitcoin adoption. It underscores the growing acceptance and significant potential of digital assets in mainstream portfolios. While risks remain, MicroStrategy’s aggressive and transparent strategy has undeniably put them at the forefront of this trend, serving as a powerful example for the world to see.

Previously, he was located at the Victorville medium-security facility, a notoriously violent place, according to prison consultant firm Elizabeth Franklin-Best. Samuel Goldfaden, a partner at the crypto-centric lawfirm, DLT Law told Cointelegraph that while his previous facility was violent, BankmanFried had been held in a safer part of the facility, adding: “Sam Bankman-Fried spent most of his detention in the more secure dorm units of MDC Brooklyn, reportedly alongside other high-profile inmates such as Sean P. Diddy to ensure his safety.“ Terminal Island FCI review. Source: Elizabeth Franklin-Best In “good” company Terminal Island is located in San Pedro, California and houses involved in financial crime. According to Franklin, notable inmates at the facility include ormer stockbroker Anthony Elgindy (wire fraud, racketeering, securities fraud and extortion) and internet music entrepreneur Mouli Cohen (wire fraud, money laundering and tax evasion New York ttorney Aaron Brogan told Cointelegraph that Bankman-Fried’s “non-violent record may well have been incorporated into a risk score” which led him to this low-security facility. His alleged autism , on the other hand, was unlikely to have had an influence despite layers playing it as a card: “I've heard reports that describe Sam as autistic, but that is within a particular subclinical contemporary lens — autism can be a debilitating condition, but Sam graduated from MIT, founded multiple billion-dollar companies, and successfully defrauded millions of people.“ Goldfaden suggested a tie between Bankman-Fried’s interview with political commentator Tucker Carlson, which was not approved by prison authorities and followed by solitary confinement . He highlighted that shortly after the interview,“was transferred, to improved conditions and moved closer to his family. A win for the FTX co-founder Brogan pointed out that lower security facilities are usually “nicer” and said that as a result he is less likely to become a victim of violent crime. will probably have a “slightly easier” time communicating with his attorneys. Still, Brogan said that those are suppositions that are likely to be true, but not guaranteed and the change may be negative for Bankman-Fried instead: “It is hard to say from the outside, but generally one would expect lower security prisons to make such communication less challenging.“ The timeline of the FTX co-founder’s appeal will not be affected by the move, his pardon-seeking. The move also raises questions about the markedly different safety and rehabilitation environments that inmates guilty of non-violent offences find themselves in. Still, Brogan said that is “the nature of the United States prison system.” He highlighted that “the prison system treats all inmates unfairly, and almost nobody cares.” He : “This is a punishment and the mass of people want it to be hard.

Boiron criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. “It’s just renting liquidity; it’s not real loyalty,” he told Cointelegraph, noting that such strategies lead to fleeting liquidity that vanishes when yields drop or token prices falter. This reliance on short-term hype, he argued, undermines the sector’s stability and deters institutional adoption. Chasing DeFi stability over hype To break that cycle, Boiron urged protocols to prioritize fundamentals over flashy returns. “Sustainable DeFi needs models where liquidity sticks around for the right reasons,” he said, pointing to Polygon’s POL token as a blueprint for achieving this. “Protocols can put their treasury to work, earning yield instead of diluting token value. Over time, this strengthens the treasury rather than just paying off temporary liquidity providers.” Polygon’s approach centers on chain-owned liquidity, where protocols build treasuries to directly own liquidity positions rather than relying on external providers. Unlike token emissions, which Boiron said attract liquidity quickly but dilute token value, owned liquidity offers long-term stability and capital efficiency. The only trade-off in the plan, according to Boiron, is time. He explained that building a treasury through captured fees, bond mechanisms or limited emissions requires patience and disciplined management. Polygon prepares to onboard traditional finance in crypto For traditional finance (TradFi), liquidity stability and predictability are prerequisites for full DeFi adoption: “Traditional finance runs on models that need stable, reliable market access. If a DeFi protocol suddenly loses liquidity or slippage spikes, it creates a level of risk most institutions just won’t take.” However, Boiron said that Polygon’s solutions — sustainable treasury management, owned liquidity and transparent models — are not just for institutions. “These are good financial fundamentals that work for any protocol,” he said, dismissing suggestions that Polygon’s strategy is too narrow to address DeFi’s broader issues. Related: Yemenis are turning to DeFi as US sanctions target Houthi group Building a scalable blueprint for chain-owned liquidity As Polygon pushes for a DeFi reset, Boiron remains optimistic about getting support from frameworks like Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation and evolving US guidance. “We’re 12–18 months away from seeing a lot more institutional involvement,” he predicted. Looking to 2026, Boiron envisions a more stable DeFi ecosystem with less volatility, stronger community governance and sophisticated financial products bridging TradFi and real-world assets. He said Polygon ( POL ) could reduce reliance on mercenary capital, fostering true decentralization. He added that POL is the foundation for long-term growth, as it helps protocols focus on building better products and keeping users engaged, instead of plugging liquidity gaps or diluting tokens to stay afloat: “POL doesn’t solve everything on its own, but it gives protocols the breathing room to tackle bigger challenges like user retention and capital inflows the right way.” Boiron’s core message to DeFi protocols is clear: “Sustainable economics always win in the long run.” While market pressures make it tempting to chase high APYs, he noted that surviving protocols from past cycles prove the value of sustainability. “More teams are starting to get it,” he said, urging the ecosystem to adopt models that prioritize long-term growth over fleeting buzz.

The presidential meme coin project has officially published the $TRUMP Leaderboard , which showcases which addresses are among the top 20 to 40 holders in real time. As of April 25, an HTX cold storage wallet registered under the username SUN currently holds the largest amount of the president’s official meme coins. According to Lookonchain , this wallet allegedly belongs to Tron ( TRX ) founder Justin Sun . He currently holds 1,176,803 tokens, which is worth around $14.32 million according to current market prices. Sun has been known to be a major supporter of the administration’s crypto ventures, as demonstrated by the fact that he joined the Trump-backed crypto project, World Liberty Financial, as an advisor in November 2024. In second place is a Wintermute wallet registered under the username CASE, which currently holds around approximately 400,005 tokens or equal to around $5.18 million. In third place is a MemeCore wallet registered as MeCo, holding 655,166 tokens or worth around $8.5 million.

His son, who was part of his team received a four-year sentence in an earlier judgment. Austin was first convicted in September 2024 by a jury on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering, and interstate transportation of stolen property. His 18-year prison sentence along with three years of supervised release was pronounced on April 23, 2025, by District Judge P. Kevin Castel. His son, Brandon, was also sentenced by the same judge. Fraudulent investment scheme out of Long Island According to prosecutors , the father, son and a team of others ran a fraudulent investment scheme for years. They solicited funds from victims by falsely promising high returns through investments in cryptocurrency and foreign exchange markets. Austin reportedly got funds from friends, acquaintance, startups and small businesses under the guise that he’ll help them find investors from his network of high net-worth individuals. The team reportedly got about $5 million in one deal and $4 million in another. Instead of delivering on their promise, they used the money to fund a luxurious lifestyle. Prosecutors revealed that they spent on shopping, travel, entertainment, and other personal expenses. The two also used money from new investors to pay off earlier ones, which is a classic Ponzi scheme tactic. According to U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, who announced the sentencing of the duo, “Hugh Austin was the leader of a fraud and money laundering scheme that stole more than $12 million from more than two dozen victims. Austin involved his own son in his crimes, working with him to rip off victims and spending investor money on personal expenses, like luxury hotels.” A combined effort to tackle crime and get restitution Clayton also thanked the prosecutors and law enforcement partners who were involved in bringing the case to a close, adding that due to their efforts, “Austin will now be held accountable for the harm he caused to individual investors and others.”​ In addition to his sentencing, Austin, who is 62 years old, was ordered to pay $12.66 million in restitution. He also has to forfeit $6,062,564 and a 2022 Jaguar SUV alongside other properties at the time of his arrest. This case adds to the growing list of cryptocurrency-related frauds in the U.S.The trend has caught the attention of U.S. regulators, and law enforcement agencies report that they have increased efforts to clamp down on such schemes.

According to a joint filing on April 24, the SEC and Dragonchain have agreed the case should be dismissed with prejudice, meaning it can’t be refiled. The SEC cited the work of its newly established Crypto Task Force and said dropping the suit was the appropriate step. The lawsuit, originally filed in August 2022 , accused Dragonchain, its foundation, and founder Joseph Roets of raising $16.5 million through an unregistered token sale. The commission’s case centred on a 2017 presale and ICO that raised $14 million through DRGN tokens, with an additional $2.5 million sold between 2019 and 2022 to fund business operations and tech development. At the time, the regulator argued DRGN qualified as an investment contract and should have been registered under securities laws. You might also like: SEC Slammed Charges on Dragonchain Over $16.5 Million ICO Offerings The case, however, was paused in October 2024 after Dragonchain submitted a settlement offer and was later extended in January, following a major executive order from President Trump that called for the U.S. to take a leading role in digital assets. The order prompted a broader reassessment of how cryptocurrency is regulated in the U.S., and the SEC cited this shift in approach when deciding to withdraw from the Dragonchain lawsuit. In fact, the SEC’s newly formed Crypto Task Force, established the day after Trump returned to office, met with Dragonchain representatives on March 24. According to an internal agency memo , the discussion centred on how the SEC should approach crypto regulation, with a focus on blockchain’s non-financial applications. Dragonchain’s team, led by founder Joe Roets, argued that blockchain should be seen as foundational software, used for transparency, identity management, and automation, rather than purely as a financial instrument. For Dragonchain, the turnaround marked a sharp reversal for DRGN, which has been in a downtrend since 2021. As of press time, DRGN is still down heavily from its 2018 peak, but the token formed two God candles after the news broke, shooting up nearly 100% in the past 24 hours. DRGN/USD 1-day chart | Source: Trading View Since the start of the year, the SEC has been steadily walking back from some of its biggest crypto battles. It pulled out of long-running lawsuits against Coinbase , Ripple , and Gemini , cases that once defined the agency’s hardline stance on digital assets under former chair Gary Gensler. As previously reported by crypto.news, it recently dropped its fraud case against HEX founder Richard Heart, after a federal judge tossed the complaint and the SEC chose not to amend it.

According to the regulator, the dismissal of the case is “appropriate” given the evolving approach to crypto oversight and the work of its newly formed Crypto Task Force, which was created shortly after President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January directing federal agencies to prioritise US leadership in blockchain and digital asset development. In an April 24 joint stipulation filed in a Seattle federal court, the SEC pointed to recent developments in its regulatory approach and stated that its 2022 litigation should be “dismissed with prejudice and without costs or fees to either party.” A dismissal with prejudice means the case is considered closed and cannot be refiled in the future. The decision also follows a meeting with Dragonchain representatives on March 24, as suggested by an internal memo that has been made public. According to the memo, the meeting was requested by Dragonchain founder Joe Roets and focused on how blockchain tech is being used outside of finance. The team walked SEC staff through real-world use cases, such as fraud prevention, identity verification, and secure data tracking, arguing that blockchain should be viewed as foundational software, not just a tool for fundraising or investment. Roets also argued that blockchain should be viewed as a core infrastructure that can be used for transparency, identity management, and automation, rather than being narrowly defined as just a financial instrument. What is Dragon c hain? Dragonchain is a hybrid blockchain platform that combines the security of public blockchains with the confidentiality of closed networks. Initially developed by Disney in 2014 and later open-sourced in 2016, it was designed to support enterprise-grade applications with modular architecture, smart contracts written in traditional programming languages (like Python, Java, and C#), and a five-layer consensus model for scalability and trust. Unlike many public chains, Dragonchain doesn’t require all data to be published on-chain. Sensitive business logic and data remain private, while verification hashes can be anchored to public blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin. Why did the SEC sue Dragonchain? The SEC’s lawsuit, originally filed in August 2022, centred on Dragonchain’s 2017 token sale. The agency claimed that Dragonchain, along with its foundation and founder Joe Roets, raised $14 million through a presale and ICO of its DRGN tokens without registering them as securities. At the heart of the case was the SEC’s argument that DRGN tokens were investment contracts under US securities law. The commission sought penalties, disgorgement, and injunctions on the basis that Dragonchain should have registered the offering, especially since it took place after the agency had already issued guidance that warned many ICOs could fall under its jurisdiction. DRGN rallies 99% Dragonchain’s native token DRGN rallied nearly 100% after the news broke. At the time of publication, it was still up over 96% in the past 24 hours. While the altcoin is currently trading roughly 98% below its all-time high hit in 2018, today’s rally helped it break out of a multi-week downtrend that began earlier this year. According to some analysts, the recent price surge could spark an extended rally in the coming weeks, especially due to its US origins.

Celsius Network investors are calling for a life sentence for co-founder and former chief executive Alex Mashinsky, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges after the crypto lender collapsed in 2022. In a court filing this week, prosecutors submitted more than 200 victim impact statements ahead of Mashinsky’s May 8 sentencing, Bloomberg has learned , adding that most urged the court to impose the harshest sentence allowed by law. “The very essence of cryptocurrency, along with my ambitions and dreams, has been tarnished.

Mashinsky’s lawyers are asking for a sentence of no more than one year. Probation officers have recommended 15 years, while prosecutors haven’t yet made a final recommendation. Celsius froze the withdrawal of client assets in June 2022. A month later, the company went bankrupt . The crypto lender said it had only $167 million left in its accounts to repat its hands and froze all customer withdrawals to give time to seek more funds.

Speaking in an April 24 interview with Simply Bitcoin , Prince Filip suggested that while certain market forces may currently be suppressing Bitcoin’s price, a breakout is inevitable. “People are able to control the market to some extent,” he noted, referencing similar dynamics seen in 2021. Back then, despite strong bullish sentiment and significant adoption milestones, Bitcoin’s price faced unexpected resistance and corrections. This led to speculation that certain entities were deliberately suppressing price movements. Prince Filip Says Bitcoin’s Deflationary Nature Ensures Upward Trajectory Prince Filip claimed that Bitcoin’s deflationary nature ensures its long-term upward trajectory, adding, “Its value is always going to rise over time.” Filip pointed to the “omega candle” concept, a theory popularized by Jan3 CEO Samson Mow. According to Mow, once Bitcoin surpasses the $100,000 threshold, its price could accelerate dramatically, potentially rising in daily increments of $100,000. Supporting this bullish outlook, Bitcoin has rebounded over 9% in the past week, fueled by strong demand from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. Data from Farside Investors shows that ETFs accumulated $2.2 billion worth of BTC in just three days leading up to April 23. BULLISH: Prince Filip of Serbia says Bitcoin is being suppressed and “that one day the price will “run away” and we could get a “Samson Mow's Omega Candle.” pic.twitter.com/4AL0q0ylO8 — Simply Bitcoin (@SimplyBitcoinTV) April 23, 2025 Bitcoin climbed above $94,000 on Tuesday after President Trump clarified he had no plans to dismiss Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, easing investor fears over Fed independence. Trump’s softer stance on China tariffs further fueled market optimism, helping Bitcoin extend its rally, which had already begun earlier in the day. Bitcoin’s Rally Signals Potential Market Regime Shift In a recent note shared with Cryptonews.com, Bitfinex analysts said that Bitcoin may be on the verge of a market regime change as it decouples from traditional equities and strengthens its position as a macro hedge. “Bitcoin is rallying due to a combination of macro relief, strong ETF inflows, and growing expectations that the Fed will maintain policy flexibility amid softening economic data,” Bitfinex analysts said. They noted that cooling inflation signals and renewed institutional demand are fueling momentum, with on-chain data suggesting accumulation rather than distribution. However, they cautioned that the rally’s durability hinges on Bitcoin holding above the $89,000–$90,000 range with strong spot volumes and stable funding rates. A recent wave of short squeezes — over $800 million in liquidations within 65 hours — has accelerated the price surge, but analysts warned that rising open interest could trigger a near-term pullback if market sentiment overheats. “For decoupling to signal a true regime change, we need persistent low correlation across varying macro conditions and sustained inflows into Bitcoin even when equities retreat.” Bitcoin’s dominance, now hovering around 56%, underscores its evolving role as a store of value, particularly as altcoins struggle under regulatory pressure. “If BTC breaks to new all-time highs while majors like ETH and SOL continue to lag, the narrative of ‘no second best’ could shift from slogan to consensus,” the analysts added.

This setup allows developers to launch their own app-specific chains with full-stack customizability, while staying connected to the broader ecosystem. The Initia L1 itself is built on the Cosmos SDK but uniquely integrates the MoveVM, enabling the use of Move smart contracts. Initia also tightly integrates foundational infrastructure like LayerZero for messaging and Celestia for data availability, along with built-in oracles, indexers, and native USDC support. At the heart of Initia is its Enshrined Liquidity mechanism designed to overcome the limitations of proof-of-stake and rollup networks—most notably, the trade-offs between security and liquidity. Typically, in most PoS networks, users must choose between staking their tokens to secure the network and earn rewards or using them to provide liquidity for trading. This creates a dilemma: more staking boosts chain security but limits the availability of assets for liquidity, and vice versa. Enshrined Liquidity removes this trade-off by allowing liquidity positions on InitiaDEX, specifically in INIT-token pairs approved by governance, to double as staking assets with validators. In other words, users can stake their LP tokens and still earn trading fees—while also supporting network security and receiving staking rewards. The INIT token is used for gas fees across both L1 and L2s, and also serves as the base asset for liquidity pools that fuel cross-chain trading.

A primary driver is the broader strength of the US dollar, often seen as a safe haven during times of global uncertainty. However, specific regional issues are also at play. Economic growth forecasts for some Asian economies have been tempered, impacting investor confidence. Additionally, central bank policies within Asia, particularly regarding interest rates compared to the US Federal Reserve, create yield differentials that can influence currency flows. The recent uncertainty surrounding trade relations, particularly the prospect of new US China Tariffs , adds another layer of complexity and downside pressure. Understanding the Impact of US China Tariffs Trade tensions between the United States and China have been a significant source of market volatility for years. Recent discussions and potential implementation of new tariffs by the US on Chinese goods have reignited concerns. Why does this matter for Asia FX ? Supply Chain Disruption: Many Asian economies are deeply integrated into the US-China supply chain. Tariffs can disrupt this flow, impacting manufacturing and export sectors. Reduced Trade Volumes: Higher tariffs can lead to decreased trade volumes between the two economic giants, reducing demand for goods from intermediate suppliers in Asia. Investor Sentiment: Uncertainty about trade policy makes investors cautious. This can lead to capital outflows from riskier assets, including emerging Asian markets and their currencies, towards perceived safer assets like the US dollar. Economic Growth Concerns: Reduced trade and investment can dampen economic growth prospects in export-reliant Asian nations, further pressuring their currencies. The prospect of escalating trade friction presents a significant challenge for policymakers and businesses across the region, directly translating into pressure on currency values. Why the Japanese Yen is Under Pressure The Japanese Yen (JPY) is another key Asian currency facing headwinds, but for slightly different reasons, though global factors still play a role. Despite recent economic data suggesting inflation is picking up, the Yen has weakened. This might seem counterintuitive, as higher inflation often prompts central banks to raise interest rates, which can support a currency. Here’s a breakdown of factors impacting the JPY: Interest Rate Differential: The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has maintained ultra-low interest rates for an extended period, contrasting sharply with higher rates in the US and other major economies. This large yield gap makes holding Yen less attractive compared to currencies offering higher returns. Global Risk Sentiment: While the Yen is sometimes seen as a safe haven, its reaction can be complex. In the current environment, strong US dollar demand often outweighs traditional Yen safe-haven flows. Interpretation of Data: Market reactions to economic data are not always straightforward. Even if data like the Tokyo CPI shows rising inflation, if it doesn’t significantly alter market expectations for immediate or aggressive policy tightening by the BoJ, the currency might not strengthen as anticipated. Energy and Commodity Prices: Japan is a major importer of energy and raw materials. Rising global prices for these items can worsen Japan’s trade balance, putting pressure on the Yen. The confluence of these factors means the Japanese Yen remains sensitive to both domestic economic signals and broader global market dynamics. Decoding the Tokyo CPI Data Recent inflation data from Tokyo, the Tokyo CPI , is often watched closely as a leading indicator for nationwide price trends in Japan. The latest figures showed inflation remaining firm, even slightly exceeding some forecasts. Logically, persistent inflation should nudge the Bank of Japan closer to normalizing monetary policy by raising rates, which would typically support the Yen. However, the market’s reaction saw the Yen weaken. This suggests that while the data confirmed inflationary pressure, it perhaps didn’t meet the threshold needed to convince traders that the BoJ is poised for a rapid or significant shift in its dovish stance. The BoJ has repeatedly emphasized the need for sustainable wage growth alongside price increases before committing to substantial policy changes. The market may be interpreting the Tokyo CPI data as not yet strong enough to trigger such a commitment from the central bank in the immediate future. Navigating the Forex Market Landscape The current environment for Asia FX and the Forex Market more broadly is characterized by volatility and uncertainty. The interplay of geopolitical risks (like trade tensions), differing central bank policies, and localized economic data creates a complex picture. For participants in the Forex Market , understanding these dynamics is crucial. Key considerations include: Monitoring Economic Data: Pay close attention to inflation reports (like Tokyo CPI ), GDP figures, trade balances, and employment data from major economies and key Asian nations. Tracking Central Bank Commentary: Statements from central bankers provide insight into future monetary policy intentions, which heavily influence currency valuations. Assessing Geopolitical Risks: Developments related to trade disputes, geopolitical conflicts, and political stability can trigger sudden shifts in market sentiment and currency flows. Understanding Correlations: Recognize how different currency pairs move in relation to each other and to other asset classes. For example, the US dollar’s strength often correlates inversely with riskier currencies. Navigating this landscape requires careful analysis and a willingness to adapt to changing conditions. The pressure on Asia FX from factors like US China Tariffs and the specific dynamics affecting the Japanese Yen following the Tokyo CPI report are prime examples of the forces at work in the global Forex Market . In conclusion, the recent weakening across Asia FX , exacerbated by the specter of renewed US China Tariffs and the particular dip in the Japanese Yen after the Tokyo CPI release, underscores the fragile state of global markets. These events are driven by a mix of trade policy uncertainty, central bank divergence, and nuanced reactions to economic data. For anyone involved in the Forex Market or observing global economic trends, staying informed on these interconnected factors is not just helpful, but essential for understanding potential future movements.

A Comparative Analysis of Gold and Stocks,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/is-bitcoin-risk-on-or-risk-off-trading-vehicle-comparative-analysis-of-gold-stocks/,"The post Is Bitcoin a Risk-On or Risk-Off Trading Vehicle? A Comparative Analysis of Gold and Stocks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Over the past decade, Bitcoin has emerged as a highly debated asset in the financial world. As the first decentralized cryptocurrency, its appeal lies in its potential for high returns and innovative technology; however, it is also fraught with volatility and uncertainty. The classification of Bitcoin as either a “risk-on” or “risk-off” asset poses an intriguing question for investors and traders alike, especially when compared to traditional assets such as gold and stocks. This article will explore the characteristics of Bitcoin, its relationship with the U.S. dollar, and how traders can effectively manage its inherent volatility. Understanding Risk-On and Risk-Off Assets To ascertain whether Bitcoin trading is more of a risk-on or risk-off vehicle, it’s essential to define these terms. Risk-on assets are typically associated with higher returns and increased volatility. They thrive in a favorable economic environment characterized by strong growth prospects. Investors tend to move into risk-on assets during periods of financial optimism and confidence. Risk-Off Assets : In contrast, risk-off assets are those that preserve value during market downturns or periods of instability. They are generally regarded as safe havens, where investors seek refuge to protect their capital when economic sentiment is bearish. Bitcoin: A New Class of Asset When observing the behavior of Bitcoin during various market conditions , we note its complexities. Bitcoin exhibits both risk-on and risk-off characteristics depending on the prevailing market conditions and investor sentiment. Bitcoin as a Risk-On Asset During periods of economic expansion or low unemployment , Bitcoin often behaves like a risk-on asset. This is primarily reflected in its price movements, which tend to align with market optimism. For instance, in the wake of positive news concerning regulatory developments or widespread institutional adoption, Bitcoin’s price surges as investors are willing to take on more risk for potentially more significant returns. Bitcoin as a Risk-Off Asset However, Bitcoin has also exhibited behavior typical of risk-off assets during times of economic uncertainty or instability. Store of Value : In times of financial turmoil, investors may turn to Bitcoin as a digital alternative to gold. During periods of inflationary pressures or currency devaluation, many proponents argue that Bitcoin can serve as a hedge, preserving value against traditional fiat currencies. This narrative has gained traction during economic crises, where Bitcoin’s capped supply resonates with the principles of scarce resources, much like gold. Flight to Safety: During periods of geopolitical tension or significant stock market corrections, Bitcoin can attract investors looking to diversify their portfolios away from traditional equities. The concept of “digital gold” has been highlighted in various analyses, suggesting that Bitcoin has the potential to serve as a safeguard against traditional systemic risks. Comparison with Gold and Stocks To further explore Bitcoin’s classification, it is helpful to compare it with other investment vehicles, such as gold and stocks. Bitcoin vs. Gold Gold has long been regarded as a risk-off asset —a haven in turbulent economic times. Its value tends to hold more stability compared to equity markets: Historical Stability: Gold’s intrinsic value as a physical commodity has made it a traditional store of value for centuries. During economic downturns or periods of inflationary pressure, investors tend to flock to gold, driving up prices. Correlation with Inflation: Gold often correlates with inflation data, as it tends to maintain purchasing power even when fiat currencies lose value. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s correlation with inflation is still being developed, offering a modern alternative amidst economic uncertainty. Bitcoin vs. Stocks Stocks are predominantly viewed as risk-on assets. When investors show confidence in the economy, they are more likely to invest in stocks, anticipating capital growth. Potential for Capital Appreciation: Stocks offer dividends and have a proven track record of returns on investment , whereas Bitcoin does not provide dividend yields. Investors looking for passive income may prefer stocks over Bitcoin’s speculative allure. However, the landscape is shifting. Some institutional investors have begun to view Bitcoin as a distinct digital asset class, necessitating a recalibration of traditional risk and return perceptions. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin and its potential for significant appreciation make it a unique investment vehicle among equities. The Relationship Between Bitcoin and the U.S. Dollar The relationship between Bitcoin and fiat currencies , particularly the U.S. dollar, is complex and multifaceted. The dollar serves as the world’s primary reserve currency, making the dynamics between Bitcoin and the dollar essential to understand. Inverse Relationship during Uncertainty Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited an inverse relationship with the dollar during periods of economic uncertainty or downturn. When investors fear inflation or currency devaluation, they often move their assets into Bitcoin, driving up its demand and price. The effects of quantitative easing and low-interest rates have further exacerbated these dynamics, leading traders to seek alternative assets that can hedge against inflation. Dollar Strength and Bitcoin Volatility Conversely, during periods of a strong U.S. dollar, Bitcoin tends to experience price declines. A robust dollar can lead to lower demand for alternative assets as investors gain confidence in the dollar’s purchasing power. Furthermore, a strong dollar makes goods priced in Bitcoin more expensive for foreign investors, potentially dampening international demand. Managing Bitcoin’s Volatility The volatility of Bitcoin is one of its defining characteristics, making it both an opportunity and a risk for traders. Here are strategies traders can use to handle Bitcoin’s inherent volatility: The Bottom Line The question of whether Bitcoin is more of a risk-on or risk-off investment vehicle is not straightforward. Its dual nature allows it to be considered both, depending on market conditions. During periods of economic optimism, Bitcoin behaves like a risk-on asset, attracting speculative investment and rising in tandem with the stock market. Conversely, during periods of financial uncertainty, it can also serve as a risk-off asset, attracting investors seeking a store of value amid market volatility. When compared to gold and stocks, Bitcoin occupies a unique position in the financial landscape, blending characteristics of both traditional and emerging asset classes. Its relationship with the U.S. dollar further complicates its classification, as macroeconomic factors can lead to significant price swings.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-25 09:51:25

Is this turn in the market about to send Bitcoin back to the all-time high? Huge ETF inflows over the last 4 days Since 10 February, when the $BTC price was beginning to roll over from the $109,000 all-time high, the outflows from the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs became more frequent than the inflows. This reached its peak on 25 February, when the biggest ever outflow of just over $1 billion in BTC was recorded on a single day. Nevertheless, over the last 4 days, nearly 30K BTC have flowed into the U.S. ETF coffers, and this will have done a great deal for the confidence of investors thinking to enter the market once again. Sentiment moves fast in crypto Market sentiment moves fast in crypto. While the traditional markets have the Fear and Greed Index at 33 (Fear), the crypto market indicator is at 60 (Greed), having jumped from a Fear reading of 33 only last week. So it might appear that as long as the U.S. stock market maintains its recent rally, and the Trump tariff wars continue to move towards the calmer waters of talks and deals, the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs can keep adding to the inflows and thereby provide more impetus to the $BTC rally. $BTC short-term price scenarios Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC shows that the price is still being rejected from the $94,000 resistance. That said, given the sharp rise to this level, a rejection was probably to be expected. It now remains for the price to fluctuate and potentially stay above $91,000, which would hopefully act as support. One possibility that could play out is an M pattern. If the current price action falls down through the small ascending trendline, and confirms below the neckline of the M at $91,700, the measured move would take the price exactly back to the $88,600 trend change level. Holding above that particular level would be crucial. While the 4-hour Stochastic RSI is still trying to bottom, and the 8-hour has some way to come down, the above scenario is a reasonable possibility. However, market sentiment may be strong enough for some sideways price action, followed by another attempt to break through $94,000. $BTC mini bull flag forming? Source: TradingView Yet another possible scenario is that the $BTC price is forming a mini bull flag. While there are only two touches of the top and the bottom of the potential flag so far, this could change as the price action chops sideways. If this did become a confirmed bull flag, the measured move would take the price to just above $102,000. MACD posturing positively on the weekly time frame Source: TradingView In the weekly chart, the price can be seen rejecting from the $94,300 resistance level. That said, some good news in the markets could help the bulls push the price through and enable it to confirm above. At the bottom of the chart, the MACD shows that the blue line is angling up to cross back over the orange line. Also, the histogram is displaying a decreasing height in the pink bars. If both of these positives continue to play out over the next couple of weeks, this will serve as another signal that Bitcoin is on its way back to the top, and potentially beyond.

According to crypto.news, Polygon’s native token, POL (formerly MATIC), surged nearly 20% to an intraday high of $0.26, pushing weekly gains to 34% and marking a 70% rebound from its monthly lows. Its market cap has once again crossed the $2 billion mark, standing at around $2.15 billion at the time of writing. A sharp rise in trading activity backed this rally. POL’s 24-hour volume also shot up 270% to over $340 million, signaling increased buying pressure. Meanwhile, interest from derivative traders is also on the rise, with open interest in POL futures climbing 25% to $107 million in the last day alone. The latest price surge appears to be closely tied to the launch of the Agglayer Breakout Program , Polygon’s new initiative aimed at incubating high-impact projects that build on Agglayer and Polygon. The program supports early-stage blockchain startups with funding and dev resources while directly directly rewards POL stakers with token airdrops ranging from 5% to 15% of a project’s token supply from graduating projects. Notably, two standout projects, Privado ID and Miden, are already preparing their own drops. Privado ID is allocating around 5%, and Miden plans to airdrop 10% of its tokens to POL stakers.

A recent report from crypto.News shows that NFT sales on Polygon ( POL ) reached $22.1 million in the seven days leading up to April 22, surpassing Ethereum ( E T H ), which brought in $21.8 million during the same period. As of press time, Polygon is also outpacing other platforms in terms of the number of buyers. Over the past week, 47,592 people bought NFTs on Polygon, a noticeable increase of roughly 62%. In comparison, Ethereum had 39,498 buyers per data from CryptoSlam. Source: Santiment The rising bullish sentiment among its investors is also evident in a steady increase in the number of wallets holding between 10,000 and 100 million POL tokens. That suggests whales and mid-sized holders are accumulating, possibly expecting more upside. POL price analysis On the daily chart, POL has broken out above the upper trendline of a long-term descending pattern that began in December 2023. This kind of breakout often signals the start of a trend reversal, and the momentum looks strong. POL price, 9-day and 20-day EMA — April 25 | Source: crypto.news It also formed a golden cross on the daily timeframe, with the 9-day EMA moving above the 20-day EMA for the first time since November 2024. Back then, this signal flashed just before POL went on a 112% rally within a month, climbing from $0.34 to $0.71. If history repeats, a similar upside move could be on the cards. POL Aroon and Supertrend chart — April 25 | Source: crypto.news Momentum indicators are leaning bullish, too. The Aroon Up is at 92.86% while the Aroon Down sits at 35.71%, showing clear dominance by buyers. The Supertrend indicator has also flashed a buy signal, with its green support line appearing below the price for the first time since last December. With the current momentum in play, analysts have started to line up bullish targets. For instance, Man of Bitcoin pointed out that POL is currently in the third wave of an Elliott Wave pattern and has just hit the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, typically where wave-3 peaks. A healthy wave-4 pullback could come next, with support between $0.241 and $0.217. Meanwhile, Mohamed G. Sewid believes this bounce might be the start of a massive bull run, possibly ending a 3-year corrective wave. As long as the $0.151 low holds, he says, POL could be eyeing a return to all-time highs, especially if it clears the $0.768 mark.

According to blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, approximately 62,800 BTC that had remained untouched for over seven years were transferred between January and March, compared to just 28,000 BTC during the same period in 2024. Notably, this activity, which excludes the highly publicized 141,000 BTC linked to the Mt. Gox estate transfers in May 2024, represents a significant shift in behavior among long-term holders. By filtering out Mt. Gox’s court-mandated movements, the data provides a clearer picture of organic changes in investor sentiment. Interestingly, this quarter’s trend follows smaller but notable awakenings seen earlier in the year, such as the sudden movement of 1,057 BTC that had remained inactive for up to a decade. At the time, speculation linked the move to market jitters following the introduction of new tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump. Analysts suggest that several converging factors may trigger this surge in the old Bitcoin movement . Macroeconomic instability, shifting market expectations, and institutional liquidity requirements are all being cited as potential catalysts. Moreover, Bitcoin’s recent price action has likely played a key role in motivating these moves. Meanwhile, whales and sharks (wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC) have been steadily accumulating. As per a Friday tweet by Santiment, during the recent price surge, these large players added 19,255 BTC to their holdings. Historically, such accumulation by large entities often signals confidence in future upside and precedes major price breakouts. That said, earlier this week, Bitcoin surged past $94,000, its highest level in months, prompting speculation that the long-awaited push past the $100,000 psychological barrier may be imminent. Recently, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes forecasted that Bitcoin could surge to $200,000, citing the U.S. Treasury’s ongoing buyback of its own bonds as a key bullish driver. However, not everyone shares this optimism. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju remains cautious, reiterating his belief that the current rally may be short-lived. He noted that Bitcoin’s price is now 10% above the level at which he previously declared the bull market over, but insisted a true trend reversal will only be confirmed if BTC decisively clears the $100,000 mark. “After I said the bull cycle was over, Bitcoin dropped 10%—but now it’s 10% above where it was when I made that call. He tweeted . “ I still think we’re moving within a wide range. If it breaks above $100K, I’ll gladly admit I was wrong. Until then, I’m keeping an eye on the data for a few more weeks to see if this is truly a trend reversal.”",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-25 09:57:34

Meanwhile, Tron founder Justin Sun has emerged as the undisputed leader of the pack, amassing $14 million worth of the meme coin to outpace other contenders in what is becoming a high-stakes competition for some face time with Donald Trump. Separating Fact from Fiction The initiative, promoted by the TRUMP meme coin team, promised an exclusive dinner with the U.S. President for the top 220 participants in a leaderboard. However, misinformation soon spread quickly across social media, suggesting that the 220th-ranked TRUMP holder was the cutoff for the dinner. On-chain data shows that the particular account held more than $300,000 worth of the token. It forced the team to go to X to dispel the rumors, clarifying that leaderboard eligibility was based on time-weighted holdings rather than raw dollar amounts. They also confirmed that participation is open to any holder who registered in time, regardless of whether their holdings measure in millions or mere hundreds. “We want to clarify a few things people seem to be confused by on X and in the Media,” the official TRUMP meme account posted. “You need $300K+ to participate (You Don’t). That we’re unlocking into this competition (We’re Not).” The selection system is designed to reward long-term holders rather than last-minute whales looking to buy their way in. “The field is wide open and it’s anyone’s opportunity to have dinner with President Trump,” the team wrote, explaining that the leaderboard calculation will exclude locked tokens, exchange wallets, and non-participating holders. Justin Sun’s $14M Bet Data from the leaderboard confirms the diversity that the team spoke about. While the top-ranked wallet, associated with TRON founder Justin Sun, currently holds 1,176,803 TRUMP tokens valued at about $14 million, the 220th position is occupied by a wallet with a mere 35.3 TRUMP worth approximately $420. Sun’s involvement, also confirmed by Lookonchain, sent ripples through the crypto community. His registration for the dinner added fuel to speculation that major figures in the crypto space were taking the event seriously. However, not everyone is buying the hype. Some have voiced strong skepticism, calling the promotion a pump-and-dump trap: “Lmao pumping the coin before the release of the locked coins for them to dump,” wrote a user. Still, the market has reacted feverishly. Following the dinner announcement, TRUMP jumped from a local low of $9 to more than $16, hitting a seven-week high in minutes. The price has since corrected, and at the time of writing, it was trading at $13.08, a 9.1% on the day. The uptick also pushed the token up 73.6% over the past week and 62.4% across the last fortnight, significantly outperforming the broader crypto market.

Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, pointed out on X that there is a large movement in leveraged long ETFs and, at the same time, safer bets like gold and cash. Suppose one had to choose if Bitcoin ( BTC ) was a risk-on or risk-off asset . In that case, it may come down to how investors interpret its narrative, whether they see it as digital gold or another speculative vehicle. Bitcoin’s ETF ecosystem has entered a new phase of capital absorption. On April 23, 2025, daily inflows surpassed $912 million , setting a record for the year. This seemingly marked a dramatic return to bullish sentiment just weeks after prolonged outflows. But this surge is not just a simple return to form. What is taking shape is a strategic redistribution of investor positioning, one with structural implications that could temper the speculative heat familiar from past crypto bull cycles. Bitcoin, in 2025, is no longer a monolithic asset. It is a spectrum of exposure. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was declared the “best new ETF product” by etf.com. From IBIT to derivatives, trusts and leveraged vehicles, the market is now defined by access mechanisms just as much as by price. That access may be soaking up energy that once fueled altcoin seasons, meme runs and vertical spot rallies. This is not a cycle of runaway liquidity. It is one of refined distribution. When exposure displaces ownership Since the United States greenlit spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, over a dozen products have emerged. By April 2025, ETF inflows had become a primary barometer of market sentiment. Year-to-date, these ETFs have pulled in more than $2.57 billion in net inflows. The biggest single-day surge hit $978.6 million on Jan. 6. Conversely, Feb. 25 saw the largest outflow of the year at $937.9 million. Across 81 trading days in 2025 so far, only 37 have been net positive. The average daily net flow is a modest $31.8 million, suggesting that while institutional interest is robust, it remains volatile and dependent on external signals. These data points reveal a new structural rhythm. ETF capital tends to flow in pulses, reacting to macroeconomic headlines, not crypto-native momentum. Unlike 2021, when funding rates and leverage dominated market direction, today’s price action hinges on whether allocators view Bitcoin as a hedge, a risk asset or both. Related: A guide to crypto trading bots: Analyzing strategies and performance This new market plumbing is both a blessing and a bottleneck. Liquidity is deeper than ever, but it is not as kinetic. Long-horizon capital doesn’t chase candles. It waits for basis points. That creates a more stable floor but a lower ceiling. It also suppresses the retail euphoria that once catalyzed altseasons and speculative parabolas. The frontier has not disappeared — it has been absorbed. When everyone buys Bitcoin, but nobody buys risk The same forces responsible for Bitcoin’s institutional ascent may also be strangling the lifeblood of altcoin speculation. One of the most notable shifts in 2025 is the absence of a classic altseason . In past cycles, BTC dominance would rise, then rotate into Ether ( ETH ), mid-caps and micro-caps. But this year, the cascade has stalled. Capital that would once have dripped into altcoins now stops at the ETF gateway. With the likes of Larry Fink floating a $700,000 BTC projection , the capital behind that optimism stayed in structured products. It went into IBIT, not Uniswap or a centralized exchange like Coinbase. ETF liquidity fragments exposure. Sovereign wealth funds buy Bitcoin. They do not ape into Solana NFTs. They buy ticker symbols and rebalance quarterly. Their entry provides stability but crowds out chaos, which has always been crypto’s native accelerant. Ether and Solana ETF proposals are now pending. If approved, they may not revive altseasons but institutionalize them. Instead of meme rotations, we may see ETF pair trades instead of MetaMask and Bloomberg terminals. This is capital concentration, not dispersion. Macro catalysts reinforce this trend. In both February and March, CPI prints exceeded expectations . Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows above $200 million on each release, turning inflation anxiety into passive accumulation. This behavior mirrors gold’s post-2008 ETF boom, when monetary policy began shaping commodity flows. Bitcoin has now entered that regime. It is still speculative but no longer wild. Still volatile and still increasingly calculable. The market still runs on belief but trades on compliance.

Binance has introduced a fund management solution for portfolio managers, while Securitize and Mantle have launched a diversified index fund designed to generate onchain yield — signaling a broader shift toward more sophisticated investment infrastructure in the digital asset space. Binance Launches Fund Accounts to Simplify Crypto Asset Management for Institutions Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has unveiled a powerful new tool designed to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. Announced on April 24, the platform's new Fund Accounts offering introduces an institutional -grade solution for portfolio managers, marking a notable step in the ongoing convergence of TradFi and crypto. The launch of Fund Accounts signals Binance’s commitment to meeting the growing demand from professional investors for sophisticated asset management tools. As institutional interest in crypto continues to swell, driven by the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, real-world asset tokenization, and increasingly robust on-chain financial products, platforms like Binance are rapidly evolving to cater to this new wave of users. Simplifying Asset Consolidation with Fund Accounts Fund Accounts are a standard feature in the traditional finance world, particularly among asset managers and brokerage firms. Binance’s iteration allows portfolio managers to consolidate externally-raised investor funds into one or more omnibus accounts, a model that is designed to reduce operational inefficiencies while optimizing trading execution. According to Binance, these accounts allow trades to be executed on behalf of multiple clients from a centralized structure, minimizing fragmentation and improving oversight. While the exchange did not provide in-depth operational details, such accounts typically rely on a single custodian to manage and settle trades, allowing managers to operate more efficiently within regulatory boundaries. However, access to this new product isn’t open to everyone. Only eligible fund managers can participate, and they must contact their Binance VIP representative for onboarding. These managers, along with their investors, must also pass strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) checks and must be licensed or legally exempted in their jurisdictions. The Fund Accounts rollout is the latest in a series of updates aimed at expanding Binance’s institutional client base. In December 2024, the exchange revamped its VIP program, lowering thresholds for high-volume traders and adding incentives for private clients and firms. The VIP program is structured to support sophisticated investors with features such as lower fees, exclusive services, and priority access to new tools — now including Fund Accounts. The exchange's renewed focus on institutional infrastructure is timely. Data from CoinMarketCap shows Binance remains the leader in daily crypto trading volumes, but its dominance is being increasingly challenged by competitors offering institutional-focused products. Top crypto spot exchanges as of April 24 based on daily trading volume (Source: CoinMarketCap ) In parallel to Binance’s developments, the broader crypto industry is also witnessing an uptick in TradFi-style infrastructure and investor involvement. The Institutionalization of Crypto Accelerates The introduction of Fund Accounts is more than just a new product — it’s part of a broader narrative. After years of cautious observation, institutional investors are becoming key drivers of crypto market activity. Mantle’s mETH yields 3.78% (Source: DeFILlama ) From BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF to the tokenization of government bonds and real estate on blockchain networks, traditional finance is moving past the experimentation phase and embedding itself in Web3 architecture. Yield-bearing DeFi products, stablecoin settlements, and programmable asset management platforms are now competing with legacy financial services, creating a new financial paradigm that blends the best of both worlds. Other players are also taking note. On the same day as Binance’s announcement, onchain trading platform Theo revealed it had secured $20 million in funding to expand its infrastructure to retail users. The round attracted prominent investors from Jane Street, JPMorgan, and Citadel — names synonymous with high-frequency trading and institutional finance. Theo’s strategy is aimed at providing institutional-grade tooling for everyday traders, suggesting that the lines between institutional and retail crypto services are becoming increasingly blurred. Securitize and Mantle Launch MI4 Fund, Aiming to Be the ‘S&P 500 of Crypto’ In related news, tokenization leader Securitize has teamed up with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Mantle to launch a cutting-edge index fund that aims to offer diversified exposure to top digital assets while generating attractive onchain yields. The new product, called the Mantle Index Four (MI4) Fund, was announced on April 24 and is being hailed as a major leap in the fusion of traditional fund structures and next-generation blockchain-based yield mechanisms. A Crypto Index Fund for the Institutional Age Structured similarly to a traditional index fund that tracks a basket of stocks like the S&P 500, the MI4 Fund offers investors diversified exposure to the crypto market’s biggest players. The fund includes allocations to Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Solana (SOL), as well as stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, according to the official press release from Securitize. What sets the MI4 Fund apart is its integration of liquid staking tokens, including Mantle’s mETH, Bybit’s bbSOL, and Ethena’s USDe. These assets allow the fund to tap into native yield-generating mechanisms on blockchain networks — a feature unavailable in traditional finance. By combining these innovative DeFi tools with the structure and risk-management standards expected by institutional investors, the MI4 Fund aims to become what Timothy Chen, Mantle’s Global Head of Strategy, describes as the “S&P 500 of crypto.” The fund’s innovative structure appeals to a growing class of investors looking to hedge macroeconomic risks while capitalizing on the income-generating potential of onchain assets. For instance, Mantle’s flagship staking token, mETH, currently delivers a 3.78% annual percentage yield (APR), according to DefiLlama. Combined with bbSOL and USDe, the MI4 Fund layers yield-bearing instruments on top of a market cap-weighted portfolio of leading crypto assets — a hybrid that marries the safety of diversification with the profitability of staking and synthetic yield. These enhancements are particularly attractive in today’s macro environment, where inflation concerns, fiat currency devaluation, and traditional bond market volatility are pushing both retail and institutional investors toward crypto as an alternative store of value. The partnership between Securitize and Mantle comes at a time of explosive growth in the tokenized asset sector. Securitize currently holds a commanding 71% market share in the institutional tokenization market, according to RWA.xyz , and has become the go-to platform for converting real-world assets (RWAs) into blockchain-based investment products. The Future of Institutional Crypto Investing The debut of the MI4 Fund is part of a broader trend: the normalization of crypto within traditional finance. By offering a turnkey solution that combines DeFi-native yield generation with a familiar portfolio format, Securitize and Mantle are effectively demystifying blockchain for institutional asset managers. Moreover, the fund signals a deeper shift in the evolving identity of crypto — no longer just a speculative play or a hedge against fiat currency devaluation, but a fully integrated component of modern portfolio management. As tokenized funds continue to attract billions in inflows and staking yields become more accessible to regulated entities, the financial sector is inching closer to a future where blockchain-based assets are foundational, not fringe. The MI4 Fund may not yet be the S&P 500 of crypto — but with its powerful blend of diversification, yield, and regulatory alignment, it might just be the blueprint.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-25 10:00:00
43783820,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152766,1745575209,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Ethereum Developers Propose Dramatic Gas Limit Increase for Fusaka Hard Fork,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-gas-limit-fusaka/,"Exciting developments are brewing in the world of Ethereum! The network’s core Ethereum developers are considering a significant technical upgrade that could dramatically alter how transactions are processed. A key proposal for the upcoming Fusaka hard fork suggests a massive fourfold increase in the layer-1 Ethereum gas limit , potentially boosting it to an unprecedented 150 million gas. What’s Behind the Proposed Ethereum Gas Limit Increase? This ambitious proposal is detailed in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 9678, spearheaded by Ethereum Foundation developer Sophia Gold. The current gas limit stands at approximately 35.95 million, a figure that has seen a modest increase from an average of 30 million since August 2021, according to data from YCharts. The move to 150 million represents a fundamental shift in network capacity. Raising the gas limit essentially allows more computational work (and thus more transactions or more complex smart contract interactions) to be included in each block. Think of the gas limit as the maximum amount of ‘fuel’ a block can hold. A higher limit means more fuel is available per block. Why the Fusaka Hard Fork? Integrating such a significant change requires careful planning and testing. Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko highlighted that testing the network under higher gas limits is crucial because it can reveal underlying client bugs that might not be apparent at lower capacities. Including this increase in the Fusaka hard fork provides a dedicated timeframe and coordinated effort to rigorously test and implement the change safely. Potential Benefits of a Higher Gas Limit While the primary focus right now is on testing and implementation, a successful increase in the Ethereum gas limit could have several positive implications: Increased Transaction Throughput: More transactions could potentially be processed within the same timeframe, leading to higher network capacity. Lower Transaction Costs (Potentially): With more ‘space’ in each block, the competition for block inclusion might decrease, which could lead to lower average gas fees per transaction, although this is subject to network demand and market dynamics. Support for More Complex Operations: Blocks could accommodate more computationally intensive smart contract executions. Challenges and Considerations for Ethereum Developers It’s not all smooth sailing. Increasing the gas limit is a complex undertaking with potential downsides: Client Stability: As Tim Beiko mentioned, higher gas limits can stress client software, potentially exposing bugs or performance issues that need significant developer resources to fix. Network Propagation: Larger blocks take longer to propagate across the network, which could potentially increase orphaned block rates or impact decentralization if it favors nodes with better bandwidth. State Growth: A higher transaction volume contributes to faster growth of the Ethereum state (the overall data stored on the blockchain), which can increase the hardware requirements for running a full node over time. The Ethereum developers are carefully weighing these factors as they test EIP 9678 for potential inclusion in the Fusaka hard fork . What Does This Mean for Crypto News Followers? This proposal is significant crypto news because it directly impacts the fundamental capacity and economics of the Ethereum network. While still in the proposal and testing phase, its inclusion in Fusaka would mark one of the most substantial increases in the gas limit in Ethereum’s history. It signals the developers’ ongoing efforts to scale the network at the base layer, alongside Layer 2 scaling solutions. Looking Ahead to the Fusaka Hard Fork The path to implementing EIP 9678 and the 150 million gas limit is contingent on successful testing and consensus among the core developers and the wider community. The discussions and testing results leading up to the Fusaka hard fork will be closely watched by everyone involved in the Ethereum ecosystem, from users and developers to businesses building on the platform. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Ethereum’s Capacity The proposal to quadruple the Ethereum gas limit to 150 million for the Fusaka hard fork is a bold move aimed at significantly increasing the network’s capacity. While presenting potential benefits like higher throughput and potentially lower fees, it also comes with technical challenges that Ethereum developers are actively working to address.

Litecoin Has A Notable Part Of Its Supply Dormant For Years Now In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed about the trend in the supply of two Litecoin long-term holder cohorts. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) broadly refer to a class of LTC investors who have been holding onto their coins for more than a year, without having sold or moved them on the network even once. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point, so the LTHs with their long holding times are considered resolute entities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Back In ‘Full Force’ For The Rally, Glassnode Reveals In the context of the current topic, not the entire LTH cohort is of interest, but rather two subdivisions of it: the holders carrying coins dormant since between three and five years ago, and those since more than five years ago. As these investors are on the deeper side of the the LTHs, they would represent the most stalwart side of the market. The 5+ years old LTHs, especially, would be the diamond hands among diamond hands. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the amount of Litecoin supply held by these LTH groups over the history of the cryptocurrency: In the graph, IntoTheBlock has pointed out an interesting pattern with red boxes. These boxes correspond to periods of sharp increase in the supply of the 3 years to 5 years Litecoin cohort. Something to keep in mind is that a rise in the supply for these groups doesn’t correspond to accumulation that’s occurring at the time of the increase. Rather, what it indicates is that some buying occurred 3+ years ago and those coins have now matured enough to become part of one of these cohorts. The timing of the red boxes would put the buying periods of the coins roughly to the previous bull run. Thus, it would appear that some resolute hands buy during bull runs and hold tight until at least the next one. While accumulation has a delay equal to the cutoff of the group attached to it, selling isn’t the same. When coins are moved on the blockchain, their age instantly resets back to zero, and so, they are ejected out of the LTH cohort. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Back In Green As Price Breaks $94,000 From the chart, it’s visible that despite their conviction, the 3 years to 5 years group does sell sometimes. “They tend to sell both into the next rally and during the following downturn,” notes the analytics firm. Interestingly, the 5+ years group has proven to be different, as its supply has mostly been following an upward trajectory over the years. Today, these diamond hands control more than 20% of the Litecoin UTXOs. LTC Price Litecoin has made recovery of over 9% in the past week as its price has jumped to $83.

Coinbase has officially removed transaction fees for PYUSD—the PayPal-issued stablecoin—allowing users to convert the token directly into U.S. dollars without friction. What might seem like a simple operational tweak is, in reality, a meaningful signal. This partnership between Coinbase and PayPal represents far more than reduced fees—it points to a coordinated push to bring blockchain-powered payments into the mainstream. Coinbase and PayPal’s PYUSD Collaboration Signals a New Era At the heart of this development lies a strategic effort to recalibrate how digital payments are made and settled. Coinbase, which has previously only extended zero-fee treatment to Circle’s USDC, is now throwing its weight behind PayPal’s PYUSD—a clear indication that stablecoin competition is heating up. This isn’t just about market share; it’s about shaping the infrastructure for everyday payments. By making PYUSD freely convertible and removing on-chain transaction fees, Coinbase effectively lowers the barrier for both individuals and merchants to adopt blockchain-based payment systems. The integration with PayPal’s vast merchant network could quietly redirect billions in settlement volume away from legacy systems toward crypto-native rails. It’s also a strong endorsement of stablecoins not just as trading tools, but as functional currencies. With over $238 billion already circulating in the stablecoin market, this partnership reflects how fintech incumbents and crypto-native platforms are beginning to converge. As Coinbase and PayPal explore future DeFi integrations, PYUSD may evolve into a serious contender in a space still dominated by USDC and USDT. This move doesn't just benefit PYUSD holders—it signifies a broader alignment. When two financial powerhouses begin dismantling the friction between fiat and crypto, the future of payments begins to look a lot more decentralized. Best Crypto to Buy Now as Conventional Finance Joins Blockchain Fantasy Pepe The announcement that Coinbase will waive fees for PayPal’s PYUSD isn’t just a perk for stablecoin users—it’s a statement. One that tells us blockchain is finally being taken seriously as infrastructure for global payments. That idea resonates strongly with Fantasy Pepe, a project that’s rethinking fantasy football through the lens of AI and blockchain. Built around predictive algorithms that simulate real-world football outcomes, Fantasy Pepe allows users to stake tokens on fantasy lineups, with rewards determined not just by luck, but by AI-validated performance insights. Unlike traditional fantasy sports apps, which rely on outdated interfaces and centralized reward systems, Fantasy Pepe decentralizes both prediction and payout. Its token, FEPE, acts as the currency of this new ecosystem—used for staking, upgrading lineups, and earning performance-based bonuses. What makes it timely now is how it aligns with the larger move toward programmable, stable, blockchain-based finance. As PYUSD finds a use case in instant merchant settlements, Fantasy Pepe offers a model where micro-rewards and prediction-based gaming can flourish using similar low-cost, on-chain transfers. The integration of AI means that Fantasy Pepe isn’t just reactive to matches—it builds forecasts, giving players strategic depth. Over $200k has been raised already, with more investors pouring in to park funds into the project as soon as possible. The gap between entertainment and finance is narrowing—and Fantasy Pepe is poised to thrive in that convergence. Solaxy Coinbase extending zero-fee treatment to PYUSD signals a broader shift: payments and settlements are becoming blockchain-native. That same ideology is baked into Solaxy , a Layer 2 protocol built for scalability and seamless movement of assets across Ethereum and Solana ecosystems. While traditional banks require clearance times, Solaxy enables real-time transfers, staking, and smart contract execution—features that mirror the kind of speed and efficiency PayPal is now aiming to achieve through stablecoins. Solaxy isn’t just another L2—its foundation is purpose-built for developers who want to deploy apps with deep liquidity, efficient routing, and sustainable staking rewards. Its consensus layer incentivizes validators through a dynamic reward system, making it both fast and economically aligned with user participation. For investors, it means not just holding a token, but contributing to a constantly optimizing network. Take a trip in the Solaxy! 🛸🪐31M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/0iTcX4cqxh — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) April 21, 2025 What makes Solaxy particularly relevant right now is its role as a facilitator of payment systems that could work alongside, or even integrate, stablecoins like PYUSD. As traditional payment giants move toward chain-based settlements, they’ll need the infrastructure to support thousands of concurrent interactions per second—without incurring gas spikes or scalability issues. Solaxy provides exactly that kind of ground-level solution. Its dual-chain strategy reduces liquidity fragmentation while ensuring composability with DeFi platforms. In a world where PYUSD can settle merchant transactions in seconds, Solaxy could serve as the technical undercurrent enabling such flows. As Web2 finance adapts to blockchain, Solaxy quietly positions itself to handle the mechanics of what comes next. SUBBD SUBBD is a creator-economy protocol reimagining fan monetization through Web3-native structures. If PayPal is making blockchain usable for mainstream payments, SUBBD is making it indispensable for creators. SUBBD’s $SUBBD token fuels a permissionless platform where artists, streamers, educators, and performers build income streams without depending on intermediaries. Instead of relying on YouTube algorithms or Patreon payouts, creators earn directly via tokenized subscriptions and perks governed by smart contracts. These contracts ensure instant access, programmable tiering, and full ownership of audience relationships. The implications are huge—particularly as stablecoins like PYUSD make peer-to-peer payments simpler and faster. Where it gets more interesting is in the cross-over potential. As creators and audiences become more crypto-native, they’ll want payment methods that are stable yet decentralized—PYUSD and $SUBBD could coexist in this context, with PYUSD serving as an entry point and $SUBBD powering internal platform mechanics like tipping, gating, and revenue sharing. With over $240 billion in the stablecoin market and Coinbase now openly embracing this direction, SUBBD is no longer a fringe use case—it’s a frontrunner. It tackles two converging trends: the decentralization of income and the tokenization of access. And in doing so, it redefines what financial empowerment means in the digital age. MIND of Pepe The recent move by Coinbase to eliminate fees on PYUSD is more than a corporate partnership—it reflects a larger systemic trend: data, money, and decision-making are all migrating to decentralized, automated systems. MIND of Pepe sits in a similar category, not by offering another meme coin, but by embodying a live AI agent built to interact, respond, and shape sentiment across crypto communities. MIND of Pepe isn’t just a token—it’s a thinking entity. It scours social media in real time, analyzes investor mood, and provides public-facing insights on what’s trending and why. This AI isn’t locked behind an interface or dashboard. Instead, it exists as a voice in the memecoin ecosystem, reacting to shifts, identifying patterns, and occasionally even instigating momentum. Its token, $MIND, fuels access to exclusive insights, investor signals, and AI-generated engagement tools tailored to active crypto traders. Creators and popular crypto companies like 99Bitcoins have already featured the project in their posts and videos online, calling it a high-potential initiative worth checking out. MIND of Pepe reflects the next leap forward: a data-native, AI-first, user-facing interface that can not only transact but predict and guide. In a world where payment rails are frictionless and AI is injected into everything from finance to fandom, MIND of Pepe’s appeal isn’t its meme—it’s its intelligence. As the lines between communication, automation, and transaction blur, this project positions itself as the digital nervous system for crypto culture. It doesn’t just exist in Web3—it thinks in it. Conclusion The decision by Coinbase to waive fees for PYUSD marks a definitive step in the integration of blockchain with conventional finance. As stablecoins edge closer to real-world usability and partnerships between fintech leaders and crypto platforms deepen, the conditions are rapidly aligning for wider adoption of on-chain tools across sectors. Projects building with foresight—those rooted in utility, scalability, and engagement—are increasingly likely to benefit from this shifting tide. Options mentioned above are still in their early stages and could thus be excellent additions to one’s portfolio for the upcoming months or years.

Chatbots blew our minds when they first emerged more than a year ago. Having a conversation with an AI as if it were a human in the next room, seeing it summarize complex ideas—it felt like the dawn of a new era. But since then, the state of development has become fragmented in interesting ways. You might also like: Crypto is the currency of artificial intelligence | Opinion Despite all the excitement and the billions poured into AI development, where are the truly transformative applications? Apple, Microsoft, and Meta have had over a year to integrate AI into their ecosystems, yet their biggest AI breakthroughs amount to incremental improvements to existing products. Microsoft put a chatbot in Word. Meta put one in Instagram. Apple’s flagship AI project? A delayed Siri upgrade that still hasn’t arrived. The momentum is instead with independent developers, who are racing ahead, building AI agents that can write and deploy entire software applications, autonomously manage investment portfolios, and generate real-time content in completely new formats. The most meaningful innovation isn’t happening inside Big Tech. It’s happening at the edges, among scrappy builders who see AI not as an added feature but as the foundation for something entirely new. Corporate resources are no substitute for innovation, and defending moats is a risky strategy in the middle of a technological shift. Today’s leading tech companies are falling behind, slowed by internal complexity as they cede ground to more agile, imaginative, and unencumbered challengers. Big Tech has everything it needs to win AI—and yet, it won’t Apple, Microsoft, and Meta have near-infinite resources, armies of engineers, and some of the biggest AI research budgets in the world. On paper, they should be dominating the AI revolution. Instead, their AI strategies look like patchwork fixes. Rather than building something fundamentally different, they’re trying to shoehorn a radically new technology into their existing product lines. Take Apple. The company that once revolutionized personal computing, mobile phones, and digital payments is now struggling to deliver a timely AI-powered upgrade to Siri. It has the data, the talent, and the resources, but it’s still failing to integrate AI into its ecosystem in a meaningful way. Microsoft, Meta, X, and other tech heavyweights similarly have thrown their might and corporate resources at AI, but all have more or less come up with the same application: a chatbot. All of this is not to suggest these companies are being complacent or ignoring the more innovative uses of AI. Microsoft has deeply integrated AI into productivity software, Google is embedding AI into search, and Apple is rumored to be developing AI-powered device processing. But their approaches remain cautious, designed to add to what already exists rather than build something entirely new. They are fundamentally defensive moves, trying to preserve their existing empires instead of embracing the unknown. And they’re making a critical mistake. Incumbency can be as much a hindrance as an advantage While known for their iconoclastic origins, the dot-com pioneers are all grown up now. Mark Zuckerberg is no longer the hoodie-wearing college dropout disrupting the internet with a scrappy startup. He’s a corporate tycoon running one of the world’s largest ad empires. The Facebook that once moved fast and broke things is now slow, cautious, and reactive—a company trying to squeeze AI into its existing business model rather than building something radically new. And history is clear: being slow to adapt is how giants fall. Yahoo had every opportunity to dominate the internet, but it dismissed search as a secondary feature, failing to recognize its central role in the nascent online economy. Google took search seriously—and built an empire around it. Microsoft was the undisputed leader in software, but dismissed smartphones as a niche market. By the time it realized its mistake, Apple and Google had already divided up the mobile world, leaving the Windows Phone dead on arrival. IBM, once the gold standard in computing, underestimated the rise of cloud architecture. While Amazon quietly built AWS into the backbone of the internet, IBM remained focused on enterprise hardware and services—betting on the past while the future passed it by. Now, the tech founders we once idolized as rule-breakers and disruptors have become the establishment—and they’re making the same mistakes. AI isn’t just another feature to be bolted onto Word, Instagram, or Siri. It’s an entirely new paradigm—one that demands new business models, new interfaces, and new ways of thinking. True AI innovation is driven by the unconstrained Some of the most compelling and innovative AI applications aren’t emerging from expensive R&D Labs—they’re being built by small developer teams shipping products over a weekend. These developers aren’t adding AI to existing products; they’re building entirely new products with AI at their core. We’re seeing tools that can autonomously trade and manage crypto portfolios, generate interactive lessons on any subject in seconds, and spin up full-stack web apps from a single prompt. And increasingly, we’re seeing developers embrace AI’s unexpected strengths—improvisation, humor, and surprise. One standout example is AI Dungeon, a web-based game where AI narrates an unfolding story based on player prompts. It can generate characters, plot twists, and environments in real-time, adapting with every user interaction. It’s a case study in what dynamic, user-driven content might look like in an AI-first internet. Another is SceneCraft, a tool that lets tabletop game masters generate narratively consistent fantasy scenes from just a few lines of story setup. Used by players of games like Dungeons & Dragons, it stitches together visual art, character design, and lore—all in real time—to help players immerse themselves in custom-built worlds. It’s not an AI layer on top of an existing game engine or productivity suite—it’s a wholly new type of product, born from the creative possibilities of AI itself. This kind of experimentation is reminiscent of the early App Store era, which in turn echoed the era of the early internet. In both cases, what started as a flood of oddball experiments, viral hits, and personal projects laid the foundation for entirely new platforms. What looked like play was, in hindsight, the beginning of a seismic shift. And that’s the point. The freedom to explore ideas that don’t have to scale, fit a roadmap, or serve an existing customer base is exactly what creates the space for these projects to break new ground. AI won’t be won by the companies stuck in the past Every technological shift brings a new class of winners. Earlier pivot points elevated companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, while others like Yahoo and IBM struggled to adapt to a rapidly evolving landscape. The smartphone revolution catapulted Apple and Android to dominance, while Microsoft, Nokia, and BlackBerry failed to adapt. AI will be no different. The companies that truly define this era won’t be the old guard—they’ll be the scrappy, relentless newcomers who build AI-native products that unapologetically break from the past.
