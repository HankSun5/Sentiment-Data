The interview came hours after President Donald Trump announced new tariff threats against China, once again rekindling the threat of retaliation from China. Luckey says the broader economy is at risk As far as Luckey is concerned, the US has become too reliant on China for critical resources like rare earths and semiconductors, and that dependence poses a significant risk to national security. He claimed that Anduril has been able to distance itself from Chinese supply chains, a fact he implied was not true for many other American companies. According to him, the reasons for its decision to distance itself from Beijing’s supply chain have to do with sanctions and the need for independence in defense manufacturing. He said: “We have to get off the Chinese supply chain. We need to reindustrialize. We need to have our own rare earth supply and make our own chips and computers,” adding that China already holds “too much leverage” over the US, particularly where critical materials essential for military hardware are concerned. Luckey has called for the re-industrialization of the US to reduce dependency on China, advocating for domestic production of essential technologies to strengthen the economy and national defense. This is crucial especially since geopolitical tensions with China are now part of the new reality for American companies, Anduril Industries Inc. Chief Executive Officer Brian Schimpf said on Friday. “I think it’s going to be a long-run conflict with China, and that’s just something that we’ve got to be prepared for,” Schimpf said . Anduril and Palantir are working to transform US defense Anduril is part of a growing crop of defense technology startups aiming to modernize the US military with artificial intelligence, software, and autonomous vehicles like drones, fighter jets and submarines. Schimpf expects the company’s revenue to double this year and boost production of its products by 400%. However, there are a few kinks it will need to work out. For example, an internal Army memo reportedly highlighted “fundamental security” issues with the NGC2 battlefield communication platform that Anduril received a $100 million contract to develop. The NGC2 prototype aims to enhance battlefield communications by connecting soldiers, sensors, and commanders. However, the memo claims it is “very high risk” and susceptible to vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized access to sensitive information. “We cannot control who sees what, we cannot see what users are doing, and we cannot verify that the software itself is secure,” the memo says. In its defense, Anduril has said the memo reflects an outdated state of the program, while Palantir asserted that no vulnerabilities were found in their platform. Both companies have seen their valuations surge under Trump’s presidency, with Anduril recently signing a $159 million deal for an initial prototyping period to develop a night vision and mixed-reality system as part of the Soldier Borne Mission Command. In comparison, Palantir signed a $480 million contract for Maven, an artificial intelligence tool with the ability to sift through images and sensor data to provide battlefield analysis.

52960440,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=836452,1760133636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52960440.jpeg,From $254M To $78.5B:  Tron USDT Growth Drives Network Valuation,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/tron-trx/from-254m-to-78-5b-tron-usdt-growth-drives-network-valuation/,"Tron (TRX) is at a decisive moment after retracing to key demand levels that could determine its next major move. Bulls, who have been in control since late March, are now working to defend support and prepare for a possible breakout. However, to confirm a bullish continuation, Tron must overcome the current supply zone and regain strong upward momentum — a challenge that will test the strength of the recent rally. Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Drops 50%: Is The Rally Built On Weak Fundamentals? Adding context to Tron’s long-term growth, top analyst Maartunn shared striking on-chain data revealing that TRON’s USDT supply has surged 309x in just six years. What began as a modest 254 million USDT on the network has now expanded to a staggering $78.5 billion, marking one of the most dramatic liquidity expansions in the crypto industry. This massive increase highlights the network’s role as a core hub for stablecoin activity and underscores how liquidity growth has historically correlated with TRX’s price performance. As Tron trades near a critical juncture, both onchain strength and market structure will play a decisive role in shaping its direction. If demand holds and liquidity continues to flow in, Tron could be gearing up for another leg higher in the weeks ahead. Tron Unprecedented Growth: The Power of Liquidity and Network Effects According to Maartunn, the story of TRON is a perfect example of how fast the crypto industry can evolve. “Time in crypto has a strange rhythm,” he notes — what feels like a lifetime of change in traditional markets can unfold in just a few years on-chain. Six years ago, Justin Sun proudly celebrated a major milestone for TRON: reaching 254 million USDT on the network, with 300 million “coming soon.” At that moment, it represented a remarkable achievement for a still-developing ecosystem. Fast-forward to today, and TRON’s growth has been nothing short of exponential. The network now hosts $78.58 billion in circulating USDT, a staggering 309x increase since that post. This transformation underscores TRON’s evolution from a niche blockchain to one of the most important infrastructures for stablecoin liquidity worldwide. Over the same period, TRX’s price rose from $0.0155 to $0.338, reflecting how price action and liquidity expansion often move hand in hand. Maartunn emphasizes that this correlation between USDT supply and TRX price illustrates a broader truth about crypto markets — liquidity drives adoption and valuation. When infrastructure, user demand, and network effects align, growth compounds at an astonishing pace. The key takeaway, he adds, is to zoom out: short-term volatility can obscure the far more powerful story of long-term innovation, adoption, and capital rotation. TRON’s rise proves how quickly a well-positioned network can become indispensable to the digital economy.

The chart shows that after reaching a local high near $0.36, the price entered a sideways range, with buyers defending the 50-day moving average (blue line), currently acting as dynamic support. This region has proven crucial in maintaining the bullish market structure. The 200-day moving average (red line) remains well below the current price, confirming a long-term bullish bias, while the 100-day MA (green) continues to serve as mid-term support around the $0.32 zone. As long as TRX holds above this area, the broader uptrend remains intact. Related Reading: Coinbase Premium Gap Signals Strongest Bitcoin Accumulation Since ETF Launch – Details However, a clear breakout above $0.35–$0.36 is still needed to confirm renewed bullish momentum and open the door toward $0.38 and $0.40, levels not seen since early 2022. On the downside, a decisive drop below $0.32 could invite further corrections, potentially testing the $0.30 psychological level. Overall, Tron’s chart structure remains healthy. Consolidation above support suggests that buyers are accumulating, waiting for stronger market conditions to push the price into a new bullish phase aligned with the broader crypto trend.

His remarks emphasized Ripple’s professionalism, XRP’s use case , and the company’s commitment to building a lasting financial infrastructure. XRP Framed As The Coin With The Strongest Use Case Crypto analyst John Squire has drawn fresh attention to Ripple and XRP after sharing a video of Gilbertie praising the token’s real-world utility on X social media. In the interview, the Teucrium CEO discussed why the company chose XRP , calling it the digital asset with the strongest utility across the crypto market. He said his confidence in XRP stems from Ripple’s focused mission to achieve its goals of building a robust and sustainable financial system . Gilbertie commended the Ripple team’s disciplined mindset and deep technical expertise—qualities that set the crypto payments company apart from other blockchain firms. These strengths, he added, are key reasons Teucrium selected XRP, viewing it as a transformative technology with real utility rather than merely a speculative token. “The Ripple team, from the interaction we’ve had with them, they’re really professional, they act like investment bankers over there. They know what they’re doing, and they will make this work,” Gilbertie said in the interview. The Teucrium CEO’s high praise of Ripple reflects confidence in XRP’s potential as a settlement tool . He explained that while Bitcoin serves as a store of value, XRP distinguishes itself by solving tangible problems within the global payments landscape. He clarified that his statement was not a price prediction, but rather a reflection of his belief that XRP possesses the most utility among all the cryptocurrencies in the market. Gilbertie’s remarks about Ripple come shortly after Teucrium’s XRP ETF went live on the market , providing regulated exposure to the altcoin. Although the fund did not receive explicit approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) amid the ongoing government shutdown , the company proceeded with the launch. According to one expert, the SEC’s lack of response signaled implicit consent, noting that “silence is compliance.” Analyst Calls XRP “The Plumbing” For The Next Financial System In a separate report, crypto market commentator X Finance Bull urged investors to rethink how they evaluate XRP, insisting it should not be compared to corporate stocks. He described XRP as “the plumbing” for the next global financial system—one that connects institutions, governments, and decentralized ecosystems through tokenized infrastructure. From his viewpoint, Ripple’s objective is not to chase company valuations but to develop a framework that enables global money movement, covering $200 trillion in annual cross-border payments, trillions in tokenized assets, CBDCs , DeFi rails, and Real-World Assets (RWAs) . He added that capturing even 1-2% of this value could change the price of XRP forever. The analyst also highlighted Ripple’s expanding institutional network, noting recent collaborations with Luxembourg’s Ministry of Finance and its growing presence across Bahrain, Dubai, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) .",XRP|Altcoin|CBDCs|DeFi Rails|John Squire|real-world assets|ripple|RWAs|Sal Gilbertie|Teucrium’s XRP ETF|US SEC|US Securities and Exchange Commission|X Finance Bull|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-10 22:00:50

Nearly $1 billion in liquidations slammed the Bitcoin market within 24 hours, based on CoinGlass data, while Ethereum remains under $4,000 at press time, after following Bitcoin’s crash the first time. Binance data shows that Bitcoin actually dropped to a 24-hour low of $101,516.5 before recovering to $110,563.5, down 7.03% on the day. Ethereum (ETH) fell to a low of $3,400.00 and is now trading at $3,722.30, a 9.11% decline. Total liquidations over the past 24 hours reached approximately $706.2 million, with long positions accounting for $648.5 million, the largest single-day long liquidation so far this year. This meltdown follows Trump’s latest rant on Truth Social, where he said China sent “an extremely hostile letter to the World,” revealing plans to launch massive export controls on nearly everything they produce. Trump called the decision “unheard of,” “a moral disgrace,” and claimed it would impact all countries without exception. He vowed that the U.S. would answer with a 100% tariff, plus software export bans aimed squarely at Beijing. Trump cancels Xi meeting, reignites crypto panic This wasn’t Trump’s first warning shot today. Just three hours before, Cryptopolitan reported that the US president had said: “I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so.” He went on to accuse China of lying, saying they’re “becoming very hostile” with restrictions on rare earth metals, a critical ingredient in everything from smartphones to missiles. That post kicked off the initial selloff, but Friday’s update blew the doors off. The fallout spread to stocks quite fast. The SPY ETF dropped 2.7%, the QQQ sank 3.5%, and BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF fell 3.7%. The CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF also dropped 3.9%, showing there was nowhere to hide—not even in mining stocks, which had looked strong just days earlier. Despite the crash, some miners still walked away with gains over the week. HIVE ended the week up 40%, even with the sharp downturn in Friday’s session. Right behind it, BitFarms closed the week with a 31% gain. Over the last month, mining stocks have been some of the wildest movers in the market. Between September 10 and October 10, both HIVE and BitFarms doubled their value. Another name, IREN, nearly did the same, starting at $30.68, closing just under $60. The average one-month return for top miners came in at 73.26%. But that trend may be breaking now.

Bitcoin Faces Key Test Near $126K Trendline,https://cryptopotato.com/wall-breaking-bitcoin-faces-key-test-near-126k-trendline/,"Bitcoin is trading near $121,600 after reaching a new all-time high above $126,000 earlier this week. The asset has slowed and is now moving sideways just below a major diagonal resistance that has capped the price for several months. Analysts are watching to see whether Bitcoin can break through or if it will be rejected once again. Meanwhile, the market is holding near a key level while open interest remains high in the futures market. Bitcoin Struggles Near Long-Term Resistance Bitcoin is facing resistance at a trendline that has held firm since earlier cycle tops. The latest weekly candle shows another rejection near $126,000, followed by a pullback of around 5.5%. Earlier this year, similar rejections led to drops of nearly 10% and close to 30%. The difference this time is the size of the pullbacks. Each rejection has been smaller than the last. Rekt Capital pointed out that “this trendline looks to be a weakening point of rejection,” suggesting sellers may be losing strength at this level. Source: Rekt Capital/X On the lower timeframes, Bitcoin is holding just above $121,000. This zone is marked by a previous support level and lines up with a Fibonacci retracement near $119,550.

The trend remains bullish overall. A confirmed higher low would support another leg higher, especially if resistance breaks. Bearish Scenario Still in Play While short-term sentiment remains positive, some market participants are still cautious. Analyst Ali Martinez shared a scenario where Bitcoin gets rejected at $124,000 and begins a correction toward $96,000. If that level fails, the next major support is around $70,000. Source: Ali Martinez/X The projected path shows a slow recovery beginning in late 2026, with Bitcoin climbing back toward $90,000. This scenario reflects a broader retracement, not a trend reversal, and suggests long-term structure could still remain intact. Futures Market Remains Heated Data from Glassnode shows that futures open interest is still elevated. This means that many traders are positioned on both the long and short sides. Sharp moves in either direction have triggered liquidations. Glassnode said the market is undergoing “ a leverage reset ” as volatility flushes out excess positions. With Bitcoin sitting just below resistance and leverage still high, traders are watching closely. A move above the current range could open the way toward $130,000. If resistance holds, another pullback could extend the current consolidation. The post Wall Breaking?

Ethereum Foundation, Keyring Network Raise Funds According to an October 10 announcement , the two organizations have launched fundraising efforts to “pioneer open-source legal defense funding.” The announcement also states that the first three months of fees from zkVerified permissioned vaults on the Ethereum mainnet will go to Storm and Pertsev’s legal defense. “We believe privacy is a fundamental right, and that open-source developers should not face criminal liability for writing code,” said Alex McFarlane, CEO of Keyring Network. “By donating our early protocol fees to the defense of Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, we’re signaling that zkVerified DeFi can uphold compliance, safety, and privacy while standing in solidarity with the builders who paved the way,” he added. Following the news, Pertsev took to X to say he is “beyond grateful” for the donations.

Federal prosecutors alleged Storm laundered and concealed more than $1 billion through Tornado Cash—including hundreds of millions for the Lazarus Group, North Korea’s state-sponsored malware collective. “Roman Storm and Roman Semenov allegedly operated Tornado Cash and knowingly facilitated this money laundering,” then-U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in an August 2023 press release.

With Ethereum (ETH) holding strong above the $4,000 mark , meme coins tied to its ecosystem are getting a boost. As the second-largest meme coin , SHIB is well-positioned to ride Ethereum’s upward trend and attract renewed attention from traders looking for the next big move. Data from CryptoQuant shows that transaction volumes have been increasing while active addresses on the Shiba Inu blockchain have continued to rise. In addition, exchange netflows, a metric that indicates the amount of tokens flowing in or out of exchanges, has turned negative. This means that investors are withdrawing SHIB to cold storage – a move that is commonly interpreted as a bullish signal. These positive on-chain metrics could be an early indication that investors are jumping back on the market to scoop up SHIB at this lower price. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB ETF Could Ignite Rally to $0.000021 In the past 7 days, Shiba Inu has retreated by 3% as the crypto market as a whole has taken a breather. SHIB has once again found strong support at $0.000012 and could soon bounce off this level to retest its trend line resistance and the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Trading volumes have subsided lately, meaning that the selling pressure could be easing. Moreover, growing institutional adoption could result in the launch of a Shiba Inu exchange-traded fund (ETF) soon. A bullish breakout above $0.000015 could set off a rally toward $0.000021, with above-average trading volumes confirming such a move. New projects have outperformed legacy meme coins during this cycle, and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could be one of those hidden gems that is ready to explode. This top crypto presale has raised nearly $3 million in a heartbeat to build a strong community of like-minded degen traders. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Combines the Power of Meme Culture with High-Leverage Trading Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a meme coin that connects retail traders who aren’t afraid to trade at 1000x leverage to seize the moment and make the most out of this bull market. Token holders can share alpha , compete to make it to the top of the leaderboard, and access strategies typically reserved for whales . Weekly competitions reward top ROI hunters, while gamified challenges like Max Ripped and Max Gains will keep the community engaged through attractive and highly rewarding challenges. Finally, the Maxi Fund allocates up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds on the most promising tokens of this cycle with leverage to boost returns. The earnings from this fund will be used to further promote $MAXI and push the token to the top.

Bitcoin's price quickly plummeted to $102,000, leaving investors confused by the perception that October is typically a bullish month. Cryptocurrency analyst Timothy Peterson shared a striking analysis, noting that this decline is historically rare. According to Peterson, drops of more than 5% in October have only occurred four times in the last 10 years: October 24, 2017 October 11, 2018 October 23, 2019 October 21, 2021 Related News: Bitcoin Partially Recovers After Major Drop, But Liquidations Are Severe!

However, Trump has softened his stance in recent statements. Trump stated today, “The meeting with Xi has not been canceled,” indicating that potential contact between the two leaders has not been completely ruled out. He also said that “other options for export controls may be considered.” However, Trump also stated, “I don't know if I will meet with Xi.” Related News: HOT MOMENTS: Expert Analyst Reveals What Happened to Bitcoin After Historical Declines in the Previous Octobers In a post on Truth Social the day before, Trump noted that China had announced that it would impose comprehensive export restrictions on “virtually all products” starting November 1, 2025, calling the decision “unprecedented in the history of international trade and morally shameful.” In his post, Trump also announced that in response to China’s move, the US would impose 100% additional tariffs on China starting November 1 and impose export controls on all critical software. *This is not investment advice.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $776.48. In 2031, AAVE will range between $1,164.73 to $1,261.79. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $218.09 Market cap $3.51B Trading volume (24-h) $729.53M Circulating supply 15.25M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $279.24 24-hour high $173.32 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.18% 50-day SMA $300.81 14-Day RSI 43.29 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Green days 17/30 (57%) 200-Day SMA $259.84 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE dropped 21% in one day, breaking below key support. Heavy volume and strong MACD divergence confirm deep bearish control. Immediate support for bulls to defend is $200. Aave 1-day price chart As of October 10, AAVE has suffered a brutal 21.45% daily drop, falling from $273 to $215, its lowest level in weeks. The daily candle is large and red, decisively breaking below the lower Bollinger band at $242.59. This move signals a deep oversold condition and a potential panic-driven selloff. Volume surged to 68.8M, confirming heavy participation in the breakdown. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD deepened into bearish territory with a widening separation between the signal and MACD lines, indicating growing downside momentum. Unless the price swiftly reclaims $242–$250, sentiment will likely remain bearish. The next significant support zone lies near $200, followed by $188 if selling pressure continues. Aave 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart confirms intense downside pressure, with AAVE falling as low as $215 before stabilizing slightly at $218. The Alligator lines are sharply fanned downward, showing a strong bearish trend with no signs of flattening yet. RSI has plunged to 17, indicating a highly oversold market, but that doesn’t guarantee an immediate bounce as momentum remains overwhelmingly negative. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView While a minor technical rebound toward $230–$235 is possible, the dominant trend remains downward until the price reclaims at least $250. Traders should expect further volatility, as sharp bear moves are often followed by brief but violent relief rallies.

Momentum remains firmly bearish across all timeframes. While an oversold bounce could emerge, recovery will likely face heavy resistance near $250. Traders should avoid catching the falling knife until stability or a confirmed reversal pattern forms above that zone. Is AAVE a good investment?

AAVE’s historic price sentiment AAVE price history ⏐ Coingecko Aave, originally launched as ETHLend in 2017, rebranded in 2018 and became a major player in DeFi. Its protocol went live in 2020, and by August, its total value locked had reached $1 billion. The coin reached an ATH of $666.86 in 2021 but slumped afterward. Aave v3 launched in March 2022, driving prices back up to $261 before fluctuating between $50 and $100 later that year. In 2023, AAVE saw steady growth, ending the year at $109. It continued its upward trend in 2024, peaking at $178 in September and hitting a high of $328 by December. AAVE hit $378 in January, dropped to $192.57 by February, then fluctuated between $152 and $238 in March. April saw a low of $115, while May reached $282 and June peaked at $319.

52961597,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=833281,1760134838,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52961597.jpeg,The Nobel Committee is investigating a potential leak after Polymarket correctly predicted the 2025 Peace Prize winner hours ahead,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nobel-investigates-itself-over-polymarket/,"Officials in Norway have announced that the Nobel Committee is now investigating how a crypto trader on Polymarket appeared to know this year’s Peace Prize winner (María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader known for challenging her country’s regime) before anyone else, according to Erik Aasheim, spokesperson for the Nobel Institute, which manages the prize selection. As Cryptopolitan previously reported , the surge in bets happened just after midnight in Oslo, raising suspicion that someone leaked the result before the official announcement. Trader 6741 turns a late-night gamble into $50,000 profit Roughly 12 hours before the Nobel announcement, a mysterious trader using the handle “6741” started buying huge positions on Machado’s victory. At that point, she was considered an unlikely choice. But within 2 hours, the trader’s activity transformed the quiet market into a frenzy. When the winner was announced the next day, “6741” walked away with more than $50,000 in profit. What turned heads was how fast her odds jumped from 5% to nearly 70% overnight, all traced back to a newly created Polymarket account. Another Polymarket user, known as “GayPride,” began betting heavily once the early wagers caught attention on social media. With odds swinging between 60% and 71%, that user ended up pocketing over $85,000. For many traders, it was a jackpot. Neither Polymarket nor the Nobel Institute responded to detailed questions from journalists, and The Wall Street Journal reported it couldn’t reach “6741” for comment. Polymarket operates offshore and is technically banned for U.S. users, so it doesn’t outlaw insider trading. That’s why even if someone inside the Nobel process tipped off traders, it’s unclear whether the bets actually violated any law. Harvard professor Jason Furman, who once advised President Barack Obama, reacted to the situation online. “The other day a student asked me about the prevalence of insider trading in prediction markets. I now have an answer,” he posted on Bluesky, attaching a screenshot from Polymarket’s Nobel betting page. Trump’s campaign, Polymarket’s $8 billion boom, and the legal gray zone This year’s Nobel Peace Prize carried extra attention because Donald Trump publicly campaigned for it, which made the prize itself a trending topic, drawing more bettors to prediction platforms like Polymarket. Earlier this week, the Intercontinental Exchange, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, announced plans to invest $2 billion in Polymarket, in a deal valued the latter at $8 billion and signaled how mainstream prediction markets have become. Polymarket was founded just five years ago by the relatively mysterious Shayne Coplan and got in trouble with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2022, which ended with Shayne agreeing to block American users. The crypto betting platform got really popular last year when bettors correctly predicted Trump’s second presidential win and even pop cultural moments, like a user named “romanticpaul” betting on Taylor Swift’s engagement hours before it went public. In September, Cryptopolitan reported that Polymarket acquired a small CFTC-licensed exchange, as part of its plan to re-enter the U.S. Economists remain divided, with some arguing that insider trading improves accuracy, while others call it unfair manipulation. One potential growth area for Polymarket in the U.S. is sports. Kalshi now offers betting contracts on football, basketball, and other professional sports, encroaching on the turf of established sportsbooks such as DraftKings and Flutter Entertainment’s FanDuel.

The DEPEG incident occurred shortly after Donald Trump announced he would impose 100% tariffs on China. Ethena stated that USDE is experiencing volatility in the secondary market due to sudden market fluctuations and widespread liquidations. The protocol asserted that its minting and redemption functions are functioning smoothly and that USDE remains overcollateralized.

However, investor capital is rapidly rotating into altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have already achieved new valuation records in 2025. With U.S. regulators nearing completion of long-awaited crypto legislation, and what many believe could be the final major bull run before mainstream adoption, XRP, Pi Network, and Cardano are well placed to lead the next bull run. Ripple (XRP): 2025’s Cross-Border Payment Powerhouse Has Plenty of New ATHs to Come XRP ($XRP) , the native digital asset of Ripple’s fast, low-cost payments network, has long touted itself as a modern alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. Endorsements from the UN Capital Development Fund and partnerships with several major U.S. banks have propelled XRP to the third-largest crypto by market capitalization, now around $169 billion. Ripple’s introduction of RLUSD, a dollar-backed stablecoin, underscores its intent to capture a leading share in the fast-growing stablecoin sector. Over the past year, XRP has skyrocketed by 437%, setting its first new high in seven years at $3.65 on July 18, before pulling back around 22.5% to its current $2.81, still far outpacing Bitcoin’s 100% gain over the period under examination. Currently holding a relative strength index (RSI) near 43, XRP has headroom for recovery after its 7% decline over the past week. The broader $4.24 trillion crypto market remains unchanged in the last 24 hours as a brief midweek selloff wraps up, cashing in on strong start-of-week rallies. Technical data highlights dual bull flag formations on XRP’s summer charts, which have yet to break out. With ETF approvals anticipated in mid-October, favorable news could lift XRP to the $5–$10 range, or even higher. Pi Network ($PI): Can the Mobile Mining Trailblazer Hit $1 Before Year-End? Pi Network changed the game by pioneering a mobile-friendly “tap-to-earn” mining model, allowing users to mine crypto without expensive hardware or high electricity costs. By simply opening the app and tapping once a day, users can participate in mining, dramatically lowering barriers for newcomers entering the crypto space. Pi’s RSI is sub-30, indicating the token is undervalued right now after recent selling. For investors who want to go long, this makes today a prime dip-buying opportunity. A falling wedge pattern identified earlier this year points to a potential breakout by December. Should sentiment improve, Pi could hit $1 by Christmas, reaching a seven-month high and quadrupling from its current price near $0.24. The Pi team is also currently deploying major updates, gradually ushering in version 23, a crucial milestone toward its long-awaited mainnet release. With its intuitive app interface and proprietary Layer 1 blockchain, Pi is strategically placed to capture market share as crypto adoption continues expanding globally. Cardano ($ADA): The Sustainable Smart Contract Platform Looking Toward 2026 Cardano ($ADA) continues to demonstrate resilience and investor trust through 2025, having risen 142% over the past year, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana alike. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is built on a philosophy of scientific research and energy efficiency, utilizing a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. Its approach has even influenced parts of Ethereum’s ongoing development roadmap. Now capitalizing roughly $30 billion, ADA would need to triple in price to challenge Solana and mount a serious challenge to Ethereum’s dominance. Trading near $0.814 today, ADA has gained 0.5% in the past hour as it looks set to lead a market rebound. Supportive macro and policy trends could drive it toward $1.50 by fall and potentially move to challenge its $3.09 ATH by year’s end. Even without major regulatory breakthroughs, continued steady growth could still see ADA reach $2 within the same timeframe. Additionally, from a technical standpoint, ADA formed a bullish flag pattern over the summer, typically a precursor to large upward moves. The token looked set to break out at the end of summer but lost its steam in a generally bearish September. Key resistance sits near $1.15, with solid support established between $0.85 and $0.90. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The Meme-Driven Bitcoin Layer-2 to Watch in 2025 Finally, one of 2025’s most exciting newcomers, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , is quickly drawing tens of millions in presale investments by enhancing Bitcoin’s scalability and capability with a proprietary Layer-2 protocol inspired by the viral energy of meme culture. The HYPER presale has already netted around $23 million, with analysts predicting potential 10x+ returns post-launch. Built using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER delivers high-functionality smart contracts, low-cost and high-speed transactions, and a Canonical Bridge for near-instant Bitcoin transfers, dApp compatibility, and integrated meme token functionality. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed zero vulnerabilities, strengthening investor confidence. The HYPER token fuels the platform’s ecosystem, powering governance, staking, and transaction fees. Early investors can earn up to 51% APY through staking while enjoying DAO voting rights. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

As U.S. regulators move closer to rolling out comprehensive frameworks to strengthen domestic crypto activity, DeepSeek’s data-driven dreams could come to fruition… XRP ($XRP): DeepSeek AI Sees Path to $10 by Year-End DeepSeek anticipates that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could reach $10 before the end of the year, representing a nearly fourfold increase from its present price, $2.82. Now in its thirteenth year, the cross-border payment token has continued to show strong resilience. Following Ripple’s courtroom win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after a drawn-out five-year dispute, investor confidence surged, sending XRP to $3.65 on July 18, its first new all-time high since 2017. According to DeepSeek, should XRP decisively move beyond that July peak, the token could realistically surpass $10 by January, assuming favorable macroeconomic and regulatory developments. Over the past 12 months, XRP has appreciated by 437%, making it the strongest-performing non-stablecoin among top crypto assets. For comparison, Bitcoin rose 100%, while Ethereum gained 82% over the same period. Technical data reveals three separate bullish flag formations throughout 2025, two of which appeared this summer, signaling a potential breakout as the year winds down. Market watchers now anticipate that October’s seasonally bullish pattern, coupled with pending ETF approvals and the potential for a comprehensive crypto legislative framework in the U.S., could act as major upward catalysts. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): DeepSeek Sees Potential 8× Upside Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) is Dogecoin’s closest rival, now capitalizing $7 billion of the market. Currently trading at $0.00001203, SHIB remains virtually unchanged in the last 24 hours, mirroring the broader market’s stasis. From a technical perspective, SHIB has not yet broken out of either a falling wedge or a bullish flag pattern this year. Surpassing the sticky $0.000025 level by November could pave the way for DeepSeek’s ambitious year-end price range of $0.00005 to $0.0001, just over 8x its current value. Beyond its meme-driven origins, Shiba Inu offers real-world functionality via Shibarium, the project’s Layer-2 network that delivers fast, low-cost transactions, decentralized applications, and enhanced privacy, differentiating SHIB from competing meme assets. Dogecoin ($DOGE): DeepSeek AI Thinks Doge Can Blast Past Traditional $1 Target Originally launched as a parody in 2013, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into a top-10 cryptocurrency, boasting a $38 billion market cap within the $80 billion meme coin sector. Its long-standing success stems from a passionate community and increasing use in real-world payments. Although Dogecoin’s price often tracks Bitcoin’s trends, its deep liquidity and loyal retail following have allowed it to withstand several market downturns. Currently priced near $0.25, DOGE has more than doubled in value over the past year, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. With its RSI hovering around 50 and trending upward, the data suggests growing investor accumulation. Over the last 24 hours, DOGE actually gained 1.1%, beating out leading coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, all of which shed 1%. Chart patterns also highlight multiple bullish patterns forming over 2025, a potential indicator of a major upside breakout. DeepSeek estimates that DOGE could close the year between $1.50 and $3, although its upper bound is a real stretch target, considering Dogecoin peaked during the 2021 bull run at $0.7316. A run up to $0.50 is achievable in normal market conditions, with $1.50 standing as a reasonable bull target. Adoption trends also continue to strengthen: Tesla still accepts DOGE for merchandise purchases, while PayPal and Revolut now support Dogecoin transactions within their payment ecosystems. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin Riding a Wave of Community Excitement Although DeepSeek AI’s forecasts primarily focus on leading established tokens, a newer entrant, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , is gaining notable traction within meme coin circles, having already secured over $2.8 million in early presale funding. Promoted as Dogecoin’s wilder, more speculative cousin, Maxi Doge embraces his degen identity while celebrating both fitness culture and meme-powered virality. After years of living in Dogecoin’s shadow, MAXI is carving out his own brand with high energy and unapologetic flair. Built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, MAXI encourages active participation through Telegram and Discord communities, trading competitions, and upcoming strategic partnerships. Out of 150.24 billion total tokens, 25 percent are allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” which will be used for marketing, collaborations, and community growth. Staking is live during the presale, offering up to 119% APY, though returns diminish as the number of stakers rises. Presale tokens are currently priced at 0.0002615 dollars, with incremental increases as fundraising milestones are met. Investors can participate using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

The meme coin is now expected to rise by 40% should buying pressure increase, as market structure and on-chain data suggest an early parabolic formation. This surge is a reflection of the DOGE past pre-breakout stages of the earlier bull cycles. Interestingly, as DOGE plan its next upward leg, MAGACOIN FINANCE has come into the spotlight as another competitor, with over 500% ROI potentia l. Dogecoin Price Holds $0.24 Support Dogecoin price is holding above the weekly support level of $0.24, indicating stability in the volatile market. Technical analysts noted DOGE recorded higher lows since June 2025, confirming its bullish structure. This support is a launchpad to the past rallies and the present arrangement is an indication that buyers are back in charge. In the market data, it is shown that exchange reserves have declined by almost $23 million worth of DOGE traded out of key trading hubs. Historically, these outflows are associated with periods of whale accumulations as huge investors transfer holdings into cold storage. The trend reflects growing conviction that Dogecoin may be preparing for another sharp move higher. DOGE Inflow/Outflow Chart | Source: Coinglass Meanwhile, volume trends continue to support the bullish case. On-chain activity shows consistent inflows to non-exchange wallets and steady liquidity retention near current levels. If Dogecoin maintains its support above $0.24, analysts anticipate a breakout toward $0.30 , marking a 40% upside move in the near term. Sustained momentum above that range could extend gains toward the 2021 highs over the coming months. Smart Money Signals $0.30 Breakout Technical structures on the 4-hour DOGEUSDT chart indicate a strong reversal setup. Multiple Breaks of Structure (BOS) and Changes of Character (CHoCH) confirm that buyers are gradually reclaiming market dominance. Analysts identify repeating fractal wave patterns consistent with Dogecoin’s past parabolic cycles. DOGEUSD 4-Hr Chart | Source: TradingView These formations suggest that once DOGE clears the $0.30 barrier, the next resistance may not appear until $0.45–$0.50. Furthermore, smart money accumulation continues to build. Volume profile data shows that institutional-scale wallets and experienced traders are entering positions during every dip, taking advantage of consolidation phases. The trendline breakout from Dogecoin’s long-term downtrend has also been confirmed through multiple retests. Analysts highlight that such accumulation patterns often precede extended rallies in assets like DOGE. As these structural signals strengthen, traders expect the meme-coin to spearhead the next bullish wave. Similarly, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the top “smart money” picks of the quarter, showing comparable accumulation among large crypto wallets. MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops Analyst Picks in Q4 MAGACOIN FINANCE presale is one of the most successful launches of 2025. The project, which is a multi-stage presale, is based on the Ethereum network and gives early adopters a chance to have discounted access to the altcoin before exchange launches in Q4 2025 . Its clear roadmap, proven presale platform and rising community traction are regarded by analysts as strong signs of legitimacy and sustainability. Therefore, MAGACOIN FINANCE price trend in 2025 continues to attract a lot of optimism among industry experts. The initial comparisons to Shiba Inu and DOGE breakout years are creating investor confidence that MAGACOIN FINANCE will be able to give 500X ROI as soon as the exchange trading begins. Analyst reports highlight that the prelaunch amount of presales is generally not this large, which demonstrates that the project has strong credibility. Its design compensates early adopters and has fair distribution, appealing to both retail and institutional investors. Conclusion The fact that Dogecoin remains above $0.24 and that its exchange outflows are at $23 million is a solid turning point for bullish traders. Analysts estimate a 40% rally towards $0.30 in case the momentum accelerates, which is in line with repetitive technical and on-chain signals. Simultaneously, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming an opportunity with 500x ROI , attracting the attention of smart money and resembling the initial Dogecoin hype.

Analyst Charts Path To $0.60,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/is-the-dogecoin-low-chart-path-to-0-60/,"Dogecoin’s structure “is still trying to turn around,” according to a market technician More Crypto Online who argues that both the higher-time-frame and intraday counts now permit a constructive path toward $0.60—provided a handful of support and breakout thresholds hold. In a new video, the analyst describes a market that is “printing higher highs and higher lows,” but cautions that the advance is “choppy, slow… boring and very fragile,” language that underscores how conditional the bullish setup remains. Dogecoin Breakout Loading On the daily chart, the crux of the thesis is the integrity of August’s corrective low, labeled as the wave-2 pivot. “From a daily chart point of view [price] should really… ideally hold above the wave 2 low that formed here in August,” the analyst says, calling that local invalidation line at $0.189. A decisive violation would force a re-marking of the larger structure: “If we break below this red line, the idea that a B-wave bottomed in June will have to be revised.” Even so, the commentator preserves a secondary bullish path, noting that an extended B-wave could still be in play as “a broader A-B-C structure,” with the market attempting another reversal “from the lower support area” thereafter. Related Reading: Is It Too Late To Buy Dogecoin? 3 Analysts Reveal What’s Next Upside conviction rotates around September’s swing high. “Once we break above the last swing high from September, we might be on our way to $0.49+,” the analyst says. That level functions as the first high-time-frame gateway: a clean breach would confirm that the move out of the September trough has transitioned from corrective to impulsive character, validating the notion that June’s B-wave low has already printed. The lower-time-frame evidence is doing some heavy lifting. On the one-hour chart, price action out of the late-September base is described as a motive sequence: “The move to the upside from the September low appears to be a five-wave move up. This allows for the interpretation that we have already bottomed in the B-wave.” The decline from the September 13 local high is, in contrast, framed as a completed three-leg retracement. If that count holds, the present pullback should remain corrective and terminate above clearly defined micro levels: “Upper micro support is between $0.23 and $0.245 with an additional key level… at $0.233,” the analyst notes. The condition is crisp: “Ideally we’re holding above $0.23 in this pullback. If we see an impulsive reaction from here to the upside, then this could be the beginning of a third-wave rally up.” Related Reading: Rounded Bottom Formation Shows When Dogecoin Price Will Begin ‘Flying’ Risk management and location remain central. The broader support shelf that cushioned September’s local bottom sits above the daily invalidation line and is expected to remain active on any deeper shakeout: “This support area is still relevant… we might get another test… probably in the area around $0.21 to $0.20,” the analyst says, adding that this band nests within the larger $0.227–$0.20 zone. Lose $0.23 decisively and “it increases the probabilities that we are still caught in this B-wave,” he warns—a shift that would postpone, not nullify, the bullish roadmap so long as $0.189 endures. What would carry Dogecoin beyond $0.49 toward the headline target of $0.60? The blueprint the analyst lays out implies an impulsive third-wave advance once micro support holds and September’s swing high gives way. In classical Elliott terms, a confirmed third wave often stretches beyond the initial motive leg, and the technician explicitly flags the setup: “If we see an impulsive reaction… this could be the beginning of a third-wave rally up.” Moreover, the $0.49 handle—identified as the first destination after a breakout—would be a staging area rather than a terminus. After a fourth wave correction, DOGE could start a fifth wave which the analyst places in the $0.60 region. The message, however, is emphatically conditional rather than euphoric. “It’s always important to zoom out,” the analyst reminds viewers, stressing that while Dogecoin is “moving up step by step slowly,” the advance is not yet an emphatic impulse. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.25.

At the same time, new data shows that corporate XRP treasuries have climbed above $11.5 billion following a fresh purchase from Reliance Global. Ripple Expands Into Bahrain, Strengthening Its Middle East Presence According to the press release , Ripple has entered the Kingdom of Bahrain through a new partnership with Bahrain Fintech Bay (BFB), the country’s leading fintech incubator and ecosystem builder. Ripple and Bahrain Fintech Bay plan to run accelerator activities and take part in local events to boost blockchain innovation across the country. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, said Bahrain was one of the first jurisdictions in the world to regulate crypto assets. According to Merrick, Ripple aims to help strengthen the local blockchain industry in Bahrain and eventually introduce its custody solution and Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin to financial institutions in the country. Suzy Al Zeerah, Chief Operating Officer at Bahrain Fintech Bay, described the collaboration as a key step in connecting global innovators with Bahrain’s financial ecosystem. Ripple currently holds more than 60 regulatory licenses and registrations worldwide, including its DFSA license from March 2025, making it the first blockchain-enabled payments provider licensed by the Dubai Financial Services Authority. Ripple is taking part in Fintech Forward 2025 in Sakhir on October 8 and 9, an event organized by Economist Impact that will bring together key players from banking, fintech, and government. XRP Treasuries Cross $11.5 Billion as Corporate Adoption Surges Corporate interest in XRP continues to rise as large firms add the token to their balance sheets. According to corporate disclosures compiled by Crypto Treasury Tracker, combined XRP holdings across institutions in the U.S. and Japan now total more than $11.5 billion, showing a significant rise in blockchain-based asset adoption. The growth follows Reliance Global’s purchase of $17 million in XRP, which the company disclosed in a filing with the SEC on September 30, 2025. SBI Holdings leads global XRP holdings with around $10.4 billion in reserves. Other notable corporate treasuries include Trident Digital, which plans to raise $500 million for XRP reserves, and Webus International, which filed with the SEC for a $300 million XRP-focused treasury. In Japan, Gumi Inc. allocated $13.5 million of its $38 million raise to XRP under its Digital Asset Treasury initiative, while VivoPower added $19 million to its holdings. Companies are turning to XRP for its fast settlement time, low transaction cost, and ability to improve cross-border liquidity. Adding to the momentum, a well-known finance bull on X shared that Ripple won “Best Initiative with Digital Currencies” at the PAY360 Awards, calling it a significant recognition of XRP’s real-world utility.",XRP|ripple|Ripple news XRP Ledger|XRP Ledger Adoption|XRP Ledger news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-10 23:00:15

Multiple sources allegedly told FOX Business’ Charles Gasparino that the conversation has picked up in recent weeks. They say the Trump team is treating it like a real option, though perhaps for the tenth time this year. The crypto community’s beloved CZ ran into trouble with the feds back in 2023. He cut a plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice, admitting guilt to money laundering charges, which also forced him to step down as CEO and cost Binance a massive $4.3 billion in fines. On top of that, CZ personally had to cough up $50 million and serve four months in prison. He got sentenced in April 2024, did time at a low-security federal prison in California, then finished up at a halfway house. He got out in September 2024. Trump’s team pushes back on crypto crackdown According to Charles, many inside Trump’s circle think CZ got railroaded. They’re calling it political, part of what they describe as the Biden administration’s war on crypto. The pardon idea fits into a bigger plan most of them have been pushing all year: a hard pivot toward pro-crypto policies. They believe the former administration deliberately treated crypto leaders like criminals instead of innovators. Even some critics of Binance think the government went overboard. The original case claimed CZ let the exchange process illegal transactions, including those involving sanctioned parties, and failed to set up strong anti-money-laundering systems. But whether the punishment fits the crime has always been a hot topic. Some argue that CZ was made into an example during an election season. CZ still owns the biggest single stake in Binance. A pardon could bring him back into formal leadership. He started the company in 2017, and under his watch it became the world’s largest place to trade Bitcoin and other cryptos. Right now, he’s not in charge, but his influence remains strong behind the scenes. A cleared name would change everything. Still, nothing moves fast in Trump world. His attention is stretched across several global fights: Ukraine, Gaza, and even China, where trade tensions are flaring up again. People familiar with how clemency decisions are made say they often take longer than expected, especially with this kind of case. Get seen where it counts.

These three altcoins are all in positions where they could rally strongly very soon, with each boasting strong fundamentals that will support longer term increases. We’ll examine these three in the following article, while we’ll also be discussing a new token that is showing enough potential to surge when it lists later in the year. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Bullish Fundamentals and Oversold Technicals Predict Big Incoming Rally Despite having crept up to $2.82 in the past few hours, XRP remains down by 7% in a week and by 5% in a month. On the other hand, it boasts an impressive 435% increase in the past year, with the altcoin having been one of the chief beneficiaries of Donald Trump’s second term as U.S. President. Ripple has finally ended its long-running case with the SEC in recent months, freeing up the company to sign new partnerships, make acquisitions and expand into new territories. This has boosted demand for XRP, which will see another boost in the next few weeks, as the first XRP ETFs are likely to launch. It’s in this hugely positive environment that the coin finds itself in an oversold position, as highlighted by its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) indicators. Source: TradingView Because XRP has been oversold for a couple of months, it’s now overdue a big rebound, something which the launch of XRP ETFs could trigger. As such, we may see the coin reach $3.50 by the end of this month, while it could pass $5 in December. Crypto Price Prediction: BNB Coin ($BNB) – Bull Market Will Push Binance’s Token to New Highs BNB has dipped by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, yet its current price of $1,259 represents a 16% gain in a week and a 42% increase in month. Clearly, BNB is one of the market’s hottest top-100 coins at the moment, and it doesn’t look like the token will run out of steam anytime soon. Its indicators remain within bullish ranges, and while there’s an argument that it may be nearing overbought territory, this has been the case since late July. Source: TradingView And with the market likely to become even more positive in the next few weeks, as more altcoin ETFs come online, BNB is in a prime position to ride the wave. Because it’s the native token of Binance, the market’s biggest exchange (by quite some distance), it will directly benefit from any increase in trading activity. For this reason, it could reach $1,500 by the end of October, while it rise above $2,500 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Sui ($SUI) – Network Growth and Canary ETF Ready to Set Altcoin Alight SUI has risen to $3.46 in the past couple of hours, and while it’s down by 3.5% in the past week, it boasts a decent 9% increase in a fortnight. While SUI is up by 90% in a year, it remans 35% down from its all-time high of $5.35, which it set back in January. It therefore has some catching up to do, although the MOVE-based cryptocurrency (and Libra offshoot) has the fundamentals to retake and then eclipse its current ATH. Sui is currently the ninth-biggest blockchain in terms of total value locked in , which stands at $2.6 billion, having risen by 163% in the past year. It’s witnessing encouraging growth as a smart-contract platform, while its chart today suggests that a rebound may be coming soon. Source: TradingView Its MACD is about to turn positive, indicative of returning buying pressure, while it has also been trading within a bullish pennant. This pennant is close to a convergence point, implying that the SUI price could break out very soon. And with Canary planning to launch a SUI ETF , the altcoin could surge towards the end of year, with its target being a bullish $8. $1.8 Million Raised As PEPENODE Prepares to Launch Mine-to-Earn Platform As good as the tokens above look right now, traders may also want to diversify into smaller, newer tokens, since these can often outperform the market during bull rallies. This may include investing in presale coins, which often have the advantage of generating momentum prior to listing on exchanges. One such coin with lots of momentum is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has raised just over $1.7 million in its sale. Never Mine in the Dark. Let PEPENODE show you the light with the World’s first MINE-TO-EARN Memecoin. https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/U2B7p5W1XY — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 9, 2025 What’s interesting about PEPENODE is that it’s launching a mine-to-earn platform, which will provide users with the chance to run their own virtual mining rigs. Users can expand their rigs by buying new nodes with the PEPENODE token, with more nodes equalling greater rewards. The platform will pay rewards out in the form of other popular meme coins, such as Fartcoin and Pepe. This could provide a strong incentive to buy and hold PEPENODE, which investors can also stake. They can join the token’s presale by visiting the PEPENDOE website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. Visit the Official Pepenode Website Here PEPENODE is currently available at $0.0010962, although this price will rise every three days until the sale ends.

This decision puts Trump-connected capital next to the crypto empire of the Binance co-founder, who served a prison sentence in 2024. According to a statement released Friday, Dominari Securities, the investment banking arm of Dominari Holdings, is working directly with Hemi, a blockchain project built on top of Bitcoin, to increase the usage of the Hemi token. Dominari is involved at multiple levels. American Ventures, where Dominari holds the majority stake, also made a strategic investment in Hemi. The exact amount wasn’t made public. Dominari helps launch Tron, invests in Hemi, and links up with CZ’s circle Hemi, which just raised $15 million in fresh capital from backers like YZi Labs, Republic Digital, and Crypto.com, is now positioning itself as a key Bitcoin-layer solution with institutional interest. Co-founded by Matthew Roszak, a long-time crypto backer and close ally of CZ, the project is now tied into a wider political and financial web. Dominari’s headquarters sits inside Trump Tower in Manhattan, and the firm has played a visible role in deals tied to the former president’s circle. Its parent company brought in Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump as advisers. In June, the firm got involved with SRM Entertainment, a struggling toy company, and helped flip it into a new entity called Tron Inc. That firm plans to start accumulating TRX, the native token of Justin Sun’s Tron blockchain. Justin, too, has poured money into Trump-linked crypto projects and coins. CZ, who stepped down from Binance leadership after a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. regulators, served four months in prison. He’s publicly said he applied for a pardon. This partnership means Dominari is expanding beyond advising Trump-friendly ventures. It’s now funneling capital and institutional clout into projects that sit directly on Bitcoin’s base layer. The plan is to create access points for ETFs and regulated crypto exposure, but with roots in Trump-affiliated money and CZ’s post-Binance ecosystem.

In a recent post on X , Coach JV revealed that he stores his family’s earnings in these two digital assets, citing the consistent depreciation of the U.S. dollar as his primary motivation. He noted that the dollar has lost nearly all of its value over the past century, arguing that inflation continues to erode household savings year after year. The Case Against the U.S. Dollar According to Coach JV, inflation has stripped the U.S. dollar of about 96–97% of its purchasing power since 1913. This, he said, represents a gradual but damaging process that undermines long-term financial security. He contends that conventional money systems inherently lose value over time, whereas digital assets with capped supplies provide stronger preservation of wealth. Why do I store my family’s hard-earned money in XRP and Bitcoin? Because since 1913, the U.S. dollar has lost 96–97% of its purchasing power. Inflation silently robs you every single year. There’s only one way out of poverty, getruthlessly accountable and convert your earned… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) October 8, 2025 He emphasized that assets like XRP and Bitcoin operate on a fixed or limited-supply model, unlike fiat currencies that can be expanded without limit. This fundamental difference, in his view, allows these cryptocurrencies to maintain, and potentially increase, their value relative to the dollar. Limited Supply as a Hedge Against Inflation Coach JV refers to Bitcoin and XRP as “fixed-supply, deflationary assets” that resist inflationary pressures. Bitcoin’s total supply is capped at 21 million coins, while XRP’s is fixed at 100 billion tokens. By contrast, central banks can create new currency indefinitely, contributing to steady declines in real value over time. Statistical comparisons illustrate this point. Over the past decade, the U.S. dollar has lost roughly 37% of its value due to average inflation of 3.2% per year. In real terms, $10,000 in 2015 now has the same purchasing power as about $7,300 in 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has surged from around $600 in October 2015 to about $126,000 in October 2025, an increase that exceeds 20,000%. XRP’s growth over the same period has been even more striking, climbing from $0.0045 to roughly $3, representing a gain of more than 65,000%. Such performance, according to Coach JV, explains why more investors are choosing digital assets as a store of value rather than relying solely on fiat-based systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Growing Support for XRP and Bitcoin as Financial Havens Coach JV’s views echo a broader sentiment within the crypto community. Last month, market analyst Zach Rector projected that XRP could eventually reach $100 , citing weaknesses in the U.S. economy. Rector pointed to a decline in job creation, higher unemployment, and persistent inflation as signs that investors are losing confidence in traditional markets. He added that recent discussions at the Federal Reserve regarding potential interest rate cuts could further boost interest in cryptocurrencies. Historical data support this perspective. XRP rallied by 580% following the 2016 U.S. election, with similar upward movements observed in assets like XLM and HBAR during comparable macroeconomic shifts. In May, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also predicted significant long-term upside for Bitcoin, estimating that its price could reach $1 million by 2028. Hayes based his outlook on weakening U.S. Treasury demand and growing financial fragmentation worldwide, factors he believes will push investors toward borderless digital assets like Bitcoin. Concluding his remarks, Coach JV underscored his personal priorities: “God, family, and protecting your ecosystem at all costs.” He encouraged his audience to take proactive steps in managing and preserving their wealth, particularly as global inflation and economic uncertainty continue to challenge traditional financial systems. For him, Bitcoin and XRP represent more than investment vehicles; they are instruments of financial protection designed to safeguard family assets from the slow erosion of value caused by inflation and monetary expansion.

According to a recent press release, the company has already acquired 2 million SOL , valued at over $440 million , and appears poised to continue adding aggressively to its position. “By utilizing Coinbase’s suite of products, STSS can enjoy the institutional-grade infrastructure, deep liquidity, and competitive pricing required to effectively manage a leading Solana treasury,” commented the head of the company, James Zhang. Through Coinbase, they will also be able to stake Solana to earn yield on their investment. As of today, the staking rewards for this token sit at 6.8%, meaning that its treasury could produce up to $30 million per year. Solana Price Prediction: Ascending Price Channel Favors Bullish Outlook for SOL The daily chart shows SOL is trading within an ascending price channel, a classic bullish setup that supports the case for a Solana price prediction targeting $270 in the short term — and potentially new highs once it breaks above its January all-time high. The $210 level stands out as a key demand zone, backed by both previous highs and trend line support. If SOL pulls back to this area and bounces with volume, it could trigger a breakout toward $270 , followed by a stronger move to $300 . Looking ahead, as institutional adoption accelerates and Wall Street continues to embrace Solana , the long-term target could reach $600 — a 172% gain from current levels. While Solana leads among large caps, the best crypto presales could deliver even bigger returns this cycle. One of the most promising contenders is SUBBD ($SUBBD) , a decentralized content platform that’s raising money at the presale stage.

Bybit, Binance, and other major exchanges do. The now-trending perp decentralized exchange Aster had also minted 8 billion ASTER tokens to a multisig. All these go to show how popular multisignature crypto wallets have become. Multisig wallets balance between security and joint custody of crypto assets. They are much harder to screw up compared to regular wallets, like MetaMask, Phantom, etc., which are single-signature by design. But multisigs are not without some risks. Earlier this year, Bybit lost $1.5 billion to hackers, and UXLINK recently lost $11.3 million , all of which was a result of compromised multisig wallets. Starting with a breakdown of what multisig wallets are and how they work, we’ll show you the upsides and downsides of using one, and some of the best multisig wallets in 2025. Multisig Wallet Definition Multisig is short for multiple signatures. A multisignature crypto wallet is one that requires two or more signatures to sign off on a transaction. The way a Bitcoin multisig wallet works may differ from that of Ethereum multisig wallets or Solana multisig wallets. However, the idea of requiring multiple signatures to make a transaction remains the same. When you initiate a crypto transaction on-chain, a digital signature is required to prove your ownership. That signature is basically a mathematical construct of your Private Key and the hash of the transaction you are making. In the case of multisignature wallets, you will need more than one signature to send a transaction. The wallets are designed to allow multiple signers, each with their own unique private keys, to approve the transaction. Multisigs can be set such that a minimum or all of the signers are required to authorize a transfer from the wallet – more on this later in the article. How It Differs From Standard Wallets Standard wallets like Trust Wallet, Phantom, and MetaMask, including Ledger devices, function as single-signature wallets. That means they only require a single private key or signer to authorize a transaction from the wallet. Single-signature wallets are just perfect for personal use, interacting with dApps, daily transactions, and holding small amounts. On the other hand, multi-signature wallets require many signers. No one signer can fully confirm a transaction without the other, which removes the single point of failure in regular wallets. That is why multisigs are the preferred choice for crypto firm and institutions that manages large crypto treasuries. Individual investors can also decide to use multisigs, especially when dealing with a large amount of money, only that it adds an extra layer of friction where you have to share and require another signature from a trusted third party to spend your money. Analogy With Traditional Bank Signatures The concept of signature in crypto is not entirely new. One can even argue that it’s borrowed from traditional banking. Your handwritten signature does the same work as a cryptographic signature, which is to authorize transactions. For instance, when signing a cheque, you are telling the bank, “I authorize you to write this change (debit) on my account.” The teller then compares the signature to the one on file. If verified, the bank accepts the cheque, and the transaction is written permanently into its records. Traditional banks also have their own system for distributing control to eliminate a single point of failure, i.e., multisig. In joint and corporate accounts, banks can be instructed to require the signatories of some or all authorized persons before greenlighting a payment. How Do Multisig Wallets Work? Multisig wallets work very differently from regular wallets and are more technical to set up. But we can break it down into three segments, which shall include the public/private key generation, setting of the M-of-N threshold, and then the transaction authorization process. Public and Private Keys in Multisig During the setup, each participants first create their own standard private key, which is used by the wallet software to calculate their corresponding public key. Using a script/smart contract, the wallet owners then merge their public keys and agree on the M-of-N configuration on how many keys should be required to sign a transaction. The script is then used to generate the multisig receiving address, where the funds are sent. M-of-N Signature Model The M-of-N signature model is the configuration used to decide the number of keys that are required to send a transaction from multisig wallets. The N represents the total number of keys that can sign a transaction, while the M represents the minimum number of signatures required to validate a transaction. There are three types of multisig wallets based on this model: 1-of-2 Two public keys are paired in this type of multisig wallet, but only one is required to sign a transaction. Such wallets are best suited for personal portfolio management or shared access between two trusted parties. 2-of-3 Only two signatures out of three total keys are required to make transactions from this multisig wallet. In the case of one key loss, the funds can still be accessed. 3-of-5 Multisigs of this type required a minimum of three out of the five total keys. You could still access your funds even if you lost two private keys. N-of-N Multisig wallets can also be set to require all key holders to sign a transaction. In numbers, it would look like this: “2-of-2.” If a dApp with two co-founders sets up a multisig wallet with such a configuration, this means that both founders would have to sign every time a transaction is initiated from the wallet. But this is a risky practice, given that access to the wallet may be impossible if one of the founders loses their private key. Transaction Authorization Process The process of authorizing a transaction from a multisig involves the initiator and the signers, all of whom are key holders of the wallet. In the case of a 3-of-5 multisignature crypto wallet, when one of the key holders initiates a transaction to send, e.g., 1 BTC to another address, it remains pending and is passed to the other key holders, with only two signatures needed to authorize the transfer. The other holders verify the details of the transaction and then add their signature, which goes to show they are aware and approve of the transfer. Once the transaction has collected a total of three signatures from the key holders (the initiator and two signers), it is then marked as fully authorized and broadcast to the network. Benefits of Multisig Wallets There are some good reasons why crypto firms and security-conscious investors choose to use multisignature wallets over standard wallets. 1. Enhanced Security Against Hacks Requiring many signatures adds an extra layer of security to crypto wallets. Multisigs enforce a system where no single individual can move funds in the wallet, which removes the single point of failure inherent in regular crypto wallets. So, if hackers manage to gain access to one of the private keys, they cannot do much with it. With some wallets, you have the option to remove the compromised key, replace it, or add new key holders. 2. Protection Against Key Loss With threshold signature wallets like 1-of-2, 2-of-3, etc., you can still access your crypto assets even with a key loss. This is unlike Phantom, MetaMask, and other single-signature wallets, where losing your one private key makes your assets impossible to recover. 3. Shared Control for Teams and Organizations The M-of-N configuration of multisig wallets is ideal for shared control, which is why it is very common among teams and firms. With it, no single person is a custodian of the funds, and no transaction would be processed without the knowledge of other team members enlisted as key holders. 4. Governance and Trust in DAOs Multisig wallets are usually how Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) get to manage their crypto treasury transparently and trustlessly. The community doesn’t have to trust that one key holder acts in good faith and not run away with their funds. Also, the DAO’s funds remain “SAFU” even if one key holder acts maliciously or becomes unavailable. Risks and Limitations of Multisig Wallets Despite having fantastic security benefits, there are a few limitations or downsides to using a multisignature wallet. 1. Complexity in Setup and Use From our breakdown earlier, you will agree that setting up and using multisig wallets can be complex. It’s usually technical, and that’s why many don’t recommend it for beginners or simple day-to-day spending. 2. Potential Delays in Transaction Approvals The fact that multiple signatures are required to make a transaction presents its own problem. You can make a payment with just a few clicks on single-signature wallets, but multisigs require a certain number of key holders to review and approve the transaction, which delays processing time. 3. Smart Contract or Software Bugs The wallet software is prone to bugs, which can be exploited to compromise the wallet. This was the cause of the $1.5 billion Bybit hack in February, where the exploiters musked a transaction UI to change the smart contract logic of the wallet, leading to the theft. 4. Limited Support Across Platforms Most multisig wallets are built for specific blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means a team or DAOs using a Bitcoin multisig, for instance, would need to set up a different wallet for crypto tokens based on Ethereum or Solana. Popular Use Cases for Multisig Wallets These are some of the popular cases where it makes more sense to use a multisig wallet. 1. Business and Institutional Funds Management Multisig setups like 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 make it easier for businesses and institutions to manage large crypto assets, in that a consensus must be reached among key executives before funds can be moved. 2. DAO Treasury Management Multisig wallets are how DAOs establish trustlessness and the safety of funds. Even if a key holder goes rogue, the community treasury remains intact. 3. Joint Crypto Accounts (Families, Partnerships) A 2-of-2 multisig wallet can be used by partners to collectively manage funds, where transactions can only be approved if/when both partners agree on it. 4. Escrow Services The 2-of-3 setup is usually employed for escrow services, involving a buyer, seller, and a mutually agreed-upon third-party arbitrator. If a dispute arises, the arbitrator intervenes to release funds to the right party. Examples of Leading Multisig Wallets in 2025 Below are some of the best multisig wallets in 2025 used by the top crypto companies and high-net-worth crypto profiles. 1. Gnosis Safe Gnosis Safe is now known as Safe. It is specifically built for the Ethereum ecosystem, meaning it can only be used to manage assets on the Ethereum blockchain, and other EVM-compatible chains can use it. 2. Casa Casa provides a multisig wallet for Bitcoin, often called vaults. It was co-founded by Jameson Lopp and also supports a few stablecoins. 3. Electrum Multisig Electrum Multisig is another Bitcoin-focused multi-signature wallet. It may not be the friendliest for beginner users, but it’s quite popular among Bitcoiners due to its compatibility with Ledger, Trezor, and other hardware wallets. 4. BitGo BitGo manages and also provides multisignature wallets for institutional clients using smart contracts on programmable networks like Ethereum. BitGo wallets support both multisignature and multi-party computation (MPC) signature schemes. Multisig vs Other Security Solutions Here is how multisig wallets compare with other wallet solutions like MPC, Ledger, and MetaMask. Multisig vs Single Private Key Wallets Most of the standard wallet is designed as single private key wallets, including hardware wallets. So, Ledger, Trezor, Trust Wallet, MetaMask, and so on, fall under this category. This means that they require one and only private key to sign off on a transaction. Multisigs like Casa, Safe, etc., can have more than one private key and require multiple signatures to approve a transaction. Multisig vs Hardware Wallets Although hardware wallets are under the single private key umbrella, they also vary from multisig counterparts in that they are physical devices. However, multisig wallets are usually smart contract-based software. Oftentimes, both can be combined to achieve optimal security. Multisig vs Multi-Party Computation (MPC) With multisignature wallets, a certain number of private keys are generated, which are used for signatures. But in MPC, only one private key is generated and is split into a certain number of encrypted shares held by multiple parties. The goal with MPC is to remove a single point of failure of a single private key, while still allowing transactions with a single signature. The Future of Multisig in Crypto Security Most crypto companies and teams use multisig crypto wallets, especially for the use cases mentioned earlier, like shared crypto wallets management, escrow, etc., and it will likely remain so. Integration With DeFi and DAOs Multisigs have become the gold standard for DAOs and DeFi teams to manage treasuries. Multi-signature solutions will be an ongoing practice in DeFi. Multisig + MPC Hybrid Solutions Multisig + MPC solutions could become popular in the future. We could see more firms adopt such hybrid solutions for high-frequency institutional operations. Growing Institutional Adoption Over the past few months, several organizations have announced plans for a digital asset treasury. As this continues, we could see more adoption of multisignature wallets across different networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.",Learn Crypto: Beginner Guides,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|WALLET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-10 23:40:59

The South American country’s government revealed the developments on Friday, indicating that a letter of intent has been signed for the project, that could be one of the most significant technology and energy infrastructure initiatives in the history of Argentina. The Argentina project fits into OpenAI’s growth strategy According to a Reuters article, the project will entail the development of a large-scale facility with a capacity of up to 500 megawatts meant to power advanced artificial intelligence computing. A government statement indicates this mega project will be structured under the country’s RIGI tax break initiative, which went into effect last year as an effort to attract foreign capital. In a social media post, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirmed the development, officially naming the project. “We are proud to announce plans to launch Stargate Argentina, an exciting new infrastructure project in partnership with one of the country’s leading energy companies, Sur Energy.” Altman. Altman also emphasized the project’s importance being the first of its kind ever to be developed in Latin America, a region which he described as “full of talent, creativity and ambition.” The announcement comes at a time the AI startup is experiencing exponential growth. OpenAI which now has 800 million weekly users for its ChatGPT service recently concluded a secondary share sale, solidifying its position as the world’s most valuable startup with a $500 billion valuation. Its recently launched AI-powered video generating tool, Sora is experiencing fastest growth within a week of its launch surpassing ChatGPT. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , Sora massive demand reaching 1 million downloads. Although its access is currently limited to the US and Canada on an invite only basis, market data shows that Sora saw 627,000 downloads on iOS downloads during its first seven days of availability while ChatGPT recorded 606,000 downloads in its first week. This growth also comes at a cost, high energy consumption. The colossal computational power needed to train and operate the startup’s AI models necessitates a global expansion of its AI infrastructure. The Argentina project also seem to be an instrumental part of that strategy. The development also come after the startup’s developer conference earlier this week, where OpenAI showed off a series of new partnerships with huge brands like Spotify, Zillow, and Mattel, together with a suite of new tools aimed at expanding its application ecosystem. As for the Argentina project, while the letter of intent represents the early stages, successful implementation of the project would provide a significant boost to Argentina’s economy and position the Latin American country as a critical hub for AI development in that region.

The meme coin now sits at a critical level, where the next move could either confirm a deeper correction or set up a high-conviction buy-the-dip opportunity. Whale wallets are clearly leaning bullish — the top 100 holders added over 2.7 trillion PEPE in the past week, according to Nansen . Still, short-term sentiment remains shaky, with CoinGlass reporting a 13.6% drop in open interest , showing a decline in speculative demand. Pepe Open Interest. Source: Coinglass. Those who remain engaged appear to be betting on a bounce, with the funding rate almost tripling to 0.0095 over the past 24 hours, suggesting traders are retaking long positions. Yet optimism persists among active traders. The funding rate has nearly tripled to 0.0095 in the past 24 hours, suggesting traders are retaking long positions amid the retest. Pepe Funding Rate. Source: Coinglass. PEPE Price Analysis: Deeper Slide or Bounce Ahead? Pepe now sits at a crucial confluence of support around $0.000009: a historical demand zone aligning with the lower boundary of a 7-month bullish pennant pattern. This level marks the final threshold before a breakdown, with momentum indicators signaling caution. The RSI has slipped below the neutral line, showing sellers in control, though a reversal around 40 could hint at buyers stepping back in. The MACD histogram paints a similar picture. While a death cross suggests downside risk, the narrow gap between the lines shows bearish momentum remains fragile. In a breakdown scenario, the next key support sits 40% lower at $0.0000055. However, with market participants positioning for a bounce, focus could shift back to a breakout. The key threshold remains the $0.0000125 supply zone. However, if momentum flips bullish, a bounce could put a breakout back in focus. The key threshold sits around a past supply zone at $0.0000125. Flipping this level into support would validate the pennant pattern and target a 215% move toward $0.000029. But under stronger demand with continued U.S. interest rate easing into 2026 and growing potential for TradFi exposure through ETFs, the rally could extend 430% to $0.00005.

The price has since entered a consolidation phase, hovering near the $120,000 level as traders search for fresh demand. Market sentiment remains divided — some analysts expect Bitcoin to stabilize and prepare for another leg up, while others warn of a possible drop below current levels as momentum cools. This raises the question that’s echoing across the market: Could this be the first truly different Bitcoin cycle? According to top analyst Darkfost, traditional patterns may not apply this time. “Some claim that a -80% to -90% bear market will occur as usual,” he explains, “but certain data points suggest that this cycle is being built on new foundations.” Unlike previous cycles driven by retail speculation, this one appears increasingly influenced by institutional participation, ETFs, and long-term holders, all contributing to reduced volatility and deeper market maturity . While corrections remain part of Bitcoin’s DNA, structural changes in demand and liquidity may be redefining how this cycle unfolds. Whether Bitcoin breaks higher or faces a major retracement, one thing is clear — this market is evolving faster than ever before. Bitcoin’s Fourth Cycle: A Stable and Mature Market Phase According to top analyst Darkfost, Bitcoin’s current cycle stands out as the most stable in its history. During this bullish phase, BTC has not experienced a single correction exceeding 28%, a stark contrast to previous cycles where violent retracements were common. Most drawdowns have remained within a modest 10%–20% range, and only four corrections have surpassed 25%, marking this as the least volatile Bitcoin cycle so far. For perspective, between 2020 and 2022, Bitcoin endured multiple 50% drawdowns, creating sharp waves of fear and euphoria that defined the market’s rhythm. Today, the picture is very different. Volatility has dropped to its lowest levels since the last bear market, reflecting a new level of market maturity. As Darkfost points out, this decline in volatility has also led to a tightening of the Bollinger Bands’ standard deviation, signaling growing price stability and disciplined market behavior. This shift suggests that Bitcoin’s market structure has fundamentally evolved. It no longer mirrors the chaotic, retail-driven cycles of the past. Instead, adoption continues to climb, regulation has become more favorable, and, most importantly, the investor base is changing. Large institutional players and corporate treasuries — particularly in the United States — are entering the market, absorbing selling pressure that once triggered deep corrections. As a result, Bitcoin’s fourth cycle is rewriting the rulebook, built on deeper liquidity, stronger hands, and long-term conviction rather than speculation. This may be the first cycle where Bitcoin transitions from a volatile asset to a globally recognized, maturing store of value. Price Consolidation Continues Around $121K Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $121,800, consolidating after a volatile week that saw strong resistance near the $126,000 all-time high. The 4-hour chart shows that BTC is moving sideways within a narrow range, struggling to reclaim the short-term 50 EMA (blue line), which has now turned into dynamic resistance. The immediate support level sits near $120,000, while the key horizontal level at $117,500 — highlighted in yellow — remains the most crucial zone to maintain the broader bullish structure. As long as the price holds above this area, the uptrend remains intact, with potential for a renewed push toward the $124,000–$126,000 zone. Momentum indicators suggest that buyers are still defending critical support, though market indecision dominates. The 100 and 200 EMAs (green and red lines) continue trending upward, reinforcing mid- and long-term bullish sentiment. However, failure to close above $122,500 in the coming sessions could expose Bitcoin to deeper retracements, with eyes on $118,000 as the next demand area. The chart suggests a healthy consolidation phase after a major breakout. A decisive move above $123K would confirm renewed bullish momentum, while a breakdown below $120K could mark the beginning of a deeper correction phase.

His comments follow recent market turbulence that saw XRP lose ground while other major cryptocurrencies posted stronger performances. Over the past week, Bitcoin and BNB briefly rallied before the momentum cooled across the market. XRP, however, failed to keep pace, struggling to maintain its position above the $3 threshold. At the time of reporting, the token trades near $2.79, reflecting a mild correction alongside the broader market decline. Market Uncertainty This retracement has sparked renewed concern among retail traders. According to recent on-chain data from Santiment, sentiment toward XRP has reached its lowest level in six months. The growing unease reflects broader frustration among investors, as the token has lagged behind competitors during the latest market recovery phase. I don't understand those who are getting scared, all structures are still in place and XRP is just moving sideways. pic.twitter.com/44jkq6ASzr — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) October 8, 2025 However, analysts like Mr. Xoom argue that this negative sentiment is misplaced. In his latest market update, the chartist noted that XRP’s technical framework has not been compromised, describing the asset’s current position as a normal consolidation phase. He added that, from a structural perspective, XRP remains well-positioned for a potential continuation of its upward trend once current pressures subside. Key Technical Levels Identified To support his assessment, Mr. Xoom outlined several critical areas on XRP’s daily chart. His analysis identified three main zones of interest, two resistance levels, and one support region that define the token’s short-term trading outlook. The first resistance zone lies between $3.00 and $3.12, which he described as the immediate level to watch for a potential breakout. A successful move above this range could signal renewed bullish strength. Beyond that, the second resistance band, positioned between $3.52 and $3.62 , aligns with XRP’s July high near $3.66 and represents a key threshold before any move toward new all-time highs. On the downside, Mr. Xoom highlighted the $2.70–$2.72 region as a vital support level. This area has acted as a strong base in previous market cycles and currently forms the lower boundary of a descending triangle pattern visible on XRP’s daily chart. With the token still trading comfortably above this support, the analyst sees no indication of structural weakness. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Analyst Maintains Optimism Mr. Xoom reiterated that XRP would only enter a bearish phase if the price fell below the $2.70 support and closed decisively beneath that range. Until that happens, he maintains that the asset is simply consolidating within its established structure, waiting for the next directional move. In his view, many investors are misinterpreting short-term fluctuations as trend reversals, when in reality, XRP’s broader setup continues to mirror healthy technical behavior. With similar optimism, other market observers have urged investors not to overreact to XRP’s short-term underperformance. Market analyst Zach Rector, for example, recently addressed investor anxiety following BNB’s brief rise above XRP in market capitalization rankings. Rector reminded traders that despite temporary setbacks, XRP has still delivered impressive performance since the U.S. elections, recording gains of nearly 488% over the period. Overall, the consensus among seasoned analysts remains largely positive. While market sentiment has weakened and price action has turned sluggish, most experts agree that XRP’s long-term structure remains positive and its next major move will likely depend on broader market stability and renewed trading volume.

Once trapped under legal uncertainty, XRP has begun to reclaim attention thanks to favorable legal developments and the anticipated launch of Spot XRP ETFs. However, XRP’s current valuation is significantly below that of the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. But what if XRP were to rise to the same market capitalization as Bitcoin? Data from MarketCapOf offers a glimpse into how much each XRP token would be worth if it reached Bitcoin’s current market cap. Linking XRP’s Price With Bitcoin’s Market Cap Bitcoin’s market capitalization has reached heights that rival and even surpass some of the world’s largest multinational corporations. Notably, Bitcoin’s current market cap of $2.415 trillion places it shoulder to shoulder with tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is the eighth-biggest asset by market cap, just behind Silver and Amazon, and well ahead of Meta Platforms, Broadcom, and Saudi Aramco. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Why XRP Has Not Followed Bitcoin’s Trajectory In 7 Years, And Why Everything Is About To Change XRP is currently the third biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, but its market cap is far below Bitcoin’s lead. However, many analysts and market commentators believe XRP stands out as one of the few assets capable of challenging Bitcoin’s dominance. This belief originates from XRP’s alignment with traditional finance. Its established partnerships with banks and payment providers give it a practical use case that most cryptocurrencies do not have. At the time of writing, XRP has a market cap of $168 billion, not even up to one-tenth of Bitcoin’s market cap. According to MarketCapOf, if XRP were to reach Bitcoin’s current market cap, each token would be worth approximately $40.68. Given XRP’s circulating supply of about 53.4 billion tokens, this price prediction represents an increase of over 14,000% or 14.35x, from its current level of around $2.8. In practical terms, an early investor holding just 1,000 XRP today would see their holdings valued at more than $40,000 under this scenario. What This Means For XRP Holders The comparison provides a valuable perspective on XRP’s long-term potential and the scale of value transfer possible within the crypto market. It also shows how far XRP needs to go in order to reach Bitcoin’s current level. Related Reading: XRP Could Mirror 2017 Style Surge: Here’s How High The Price Will Go If It Happens Bitcoin’s dominance today is due to its first-mover advantage and its acceptance as a store of value. However, XRP is growing in remittances and real-world asset tokenization, and Ripple’s stakeholders are working to challenge SWIFT. This gives the cryptocurrency a utility foundation that could cause the growth of its market share. If Ripple continues to secure partnerships with central banks, payment providers, and institutional investors, as Ripple has increasingly done in regions like the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, then the idea of XRP closing even a fraction of the gap with Bitcoin becomes less far-fetched. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.83. Another factor that could contribute to this projected price growth is if Spot XRP ETFs are launched in the US and they perform well.

In an X post on October 10, Russell Vought, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, confirmed that “RIFs” — short for reductions in force — have officially commenced. The administration had previously warned that such measures could be implemented across federal agencies. Regarding the layoff, the White House did not state the exact number of federal employees to be affected by the layoff. However, officials hinted at departments that would be affected. This includes departments such as Treasury and Health. These widespread layoffs have raised concerns among individuals as they anticipate that they might significantly increase the economic-related risks associated with the government shutdown . During usual shutdowns, federal employees labeled as non-essential go on furlough and can receive payment for their lost wages once funding resumes. Trump’s decision to lay off federal workers raises heated debates among individuals Earlier, Trump made public his intention to permanently terminate federal employees from the workforce and threatened workers who were furloughed that they would not receive back pay. The president’s statement has worsened the shutdown’s effects on government employees and the economies they support. Vought, who offered assistance in writing the Project 2025 plan for Republicans to gain control of the White House, strongly advocated for reducing the number of federal workers and making changes to the federal government. On the other hand, Lee Saunders, the president of AFSCME, a powerful group representing government workers, referred to the mass firing as an illegal act and cautioned the Trump administration that implementing such an act could result in devastating effects. “Whether these federal employees are food inspectors, public safety workers, or perform many other public service roles that enable America to keep running, federal workers should not be used as pawns in this administration’s political games,” Saunders stated. He further mentioned that they will investigate every legal choice to stop the Trump administration’s illegal attacks on the rights and jobs of public service workers. Democrats have also commented on the situation. They swiftly criticized the layoffs, with Chuck Schumer, the Minority Leader of the United States Senate, alleging that this is deliberate chaos in America. According to Schumer, the Trump administration has thoughtlessly decided to harm people — the workers who protect their nation, check their food, and offer help during emergencies. US Democrats call for an extension of health insurance subsidies Some Republicans also appeared uneasy about the move. Senator Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, said she strongly opposed Vought’s announcement and warned that it would hurt families in her state and elsewhere. The shutdown began on October 1, when Democrats declined to back a temporary proposed bill that Republicans had hoped would fund the government until late November. Concerning the proposed bill, Democrats pointed out that they would support it only if Republicans committed to negotiating an extension of health insurance subsidies, which are scheduled to expire at the end of the year, potentially increasing medical coverage costs for tens of millions of Americans. Additionally, some Republicans, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, a representative from Georgia, started to raise concerns about their party’s stance, stating that a solution for the expiring healthcare subsidies needs to be found. Greene shared an X post highlighting that Democrats created this problem in 2010, which worsened in 2021, while Republicans never addressed it. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has announced that he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China starting next month. In a post on social media, Trump stated that the US would also impose export controls on critical software. In an earlier post on Friday, he hit back at Beijing’s move this week to tighten its rules for exports of rare earths, accusing China of “becoming very hostile” and trying to hold the world “captive”. He threatened to withdraw from a meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping. He later said he had not cancelled it, but that he did not know “that we’re going to have it”.

ChainLink faced a sharp drop after traders dumped thousands of tokens, sparking fresh bearish sentiment. On the other hand, Stellar continues to fight within a downtrend, and its weak social buzz has scared off traders who fear another drop may be lurking around the corner. With so much uncertainty, the crypto crowd is scrambling to spot what could be the next big move. The market keeps proving that altcoins can flip direction faster than a penguin sliding on ice. Prices pump. Then dump. Then repeat. This is why crypto investors are shifting toward opportunities that offer real upside potential while also rewarding long-term believers. Many are asking one simple question. Where is the next breakout that can create real wealth instead of crumbs and peanuts? That is why meme coins keep dominating crypto conversations. Meme coins went from a joke to a financial revolution that turned small wallets into bull-powered moon rides. The hype cycle is back, and MoonBull has entered the arena at full speed. Most importantly, MoonBull Presale is live now, and it is cooking with insane growth potential. It offers structured tokenomics and real returns instead of empty promises. This new meme project has positioned itself as the best crypto to join in 2025 , and the window is still open, but not for long. MoonBull Presale Live Massive FOMO Opportunity for Early Investors MoonBull is cooking up one of the biggest, loudest, and most talked-about launches in the crypto space right now. The presale is pulling serious momentum, and crypto investors are lining up like kids outside a candy store. The hype is not just noise. There are strong numbers behind it. The presale is running across 23 stages, and Stage 4 is live now. The price per token at this stage is just 0.00005168, which still gives massive upside potential. MoonBull ($MOBU) is connected directly to the best crypto to join in 2025 narrative because it is still in early stages and offers real tokenomics that focus on sustainability. This is not just another meme coin blowing hot air. It brings auto liquidity, reflections, and deflationary burns. Every trade builds its token strength instead of weakening the chart. Over three hundred thousand dollars has already been raised, and over one thousand holders have jumped on board. Here is where things get crazy. The current ROI from Stage 4 to the future listing price of 0.00616 sits at 11,800%. That is not a typo. That is a bulls-smashing-through-walls type of growth. Here is a simple example. An investment of 25,000 dollars at the Stage 4 price would secure almost 484 million tokens. When the listing price is reached, that bag could potentially be worth just under 3 million dollars. That is not retirement money. That is freedom money. That is crypto island and supercar energy. The reason MoonBull can secure that type of growth is that the presale is first-come, first-served, and each stage increases the price. The clock is ticking. Once Stage 4 ends, Stage 5 goes live, and the price jumps again. Then again. Then again, until 23 stages are complete. MoonBull is built for FOMO, and right now it is delivering. Liquidity Through Staking Power that Pays Off MoonBull’s staking system gives buyers more than just a bag of coins. It unlocks a 95% APY at Stage 10. Rewards stack daily and holders keep full control over their tokens. This is liquidity staking that lets holders earn without freezing assets forever. Staking lets holders earn passive rewards while fueling price stability. Rewards come from a pool of 14.6 billion tokens that keeps payouts healthy and long-lasting. It encourages loyal holders and pushes long-term gains because more tokens are locked, which reduces market circulation. All of this makes MoonBull the best crypto to join in 2025 for early-stage potential. That claim is strong, and the proof is in the presale math. MoonBull is a movement. A meme with muscle. A bull that refuses to walk. It charges. It climbs. It smashes price ceilings on the way to orbit. Stellar Struggles While Bulls Wait For A Rebound Stellar has been one of the most useful blockchains in the payment and remittance industry. It has fast transactions and a strong utility use case. But price action does not care about fundamentals sometimes. The latest Stellar price prediction shows more room to fall. The XLM chart recently failed to complete a bullish flag pattern and fell below a major support zone. The downtrend started months ago and the market still has not seen a breakout. The latest XLM crypto news highlights another problem. Social buzz for Stellar has collapsed to weak levels. Trader interest has dipped heavily, and that signals low buying demand. That is dangerous because price pumps need hype. Without hype, a token becomes flat. This is what Stellar is facing today. Yes, long-term utility is strong, but short-term upside is crawling at a snail’s pace. Traders get bored with waiting and move their liquidity toward faster opportunities. That is why Stellar investors now keep their eyes on MoonBull, which has already become the best crypto to join in 2025 for those who want gains before the next Bitcoin halving cycle takes flight. Stellar might bounce one day, but it looks stuck in a slow lane while MoonBull is flying in the fast lane with nitro boosters. The choice is simple. Chase potential or wait on a hope. ChainLink Outlook Amid Selling Pressure and Market Volatility ChainLink has been one of the most trusted projects in the blockchain world due to its role as the leading oracle network. Yet recent LINK news today paints a shaky picture. ChainLink dropped sharply by about 4% in a single trading session after heavy institutional selling triggered panic among retail investors. The LINK price today recently touched a session low near 21 dollars, which marked its weakest level in days. This sudden reversal caught traders off guard as LINK had briefly pumped earlier in the week. Chainlink Reserve also purchased over 45K LINK tokens, but the market crash left the reserve sitting underwater. The average cost basis was above $23, and LINK is now trading below that mark. This means even the reserve is technically down, which does not boost investor confidence. Resistance levels are stacking up like bricks at 22.68 and 21.92, which shows that bullish pressure is getting slapped back fast by sellers. Market sentiment is still stuck in fear mode. Trading volumes jumped, but the price kept falling, which signals a bearish trend. Bears are not leaving the party yet, and LINK could tumble again if Bitcoin drags the market further down. Despite ChainLink being one of the more stable altcoins historically, it still cannot deliver the insane early growth potential compared to MoonBull, which is currently considered the best crypto to join in 2025, thanks to its explosive presale trajectory. That comparison matters. Investors who want strong upside returns usually chase presale gold mines before they explode. LINK might still be a long-term hold, but right now it feels more like watching a hippo swim slowly rather than a bull charge to freedom. Conclusion ChainLink and Stellar both sit at important phases in their journey. LINK fights selling pressure while XLM tries to recover from weak demand. Both projects carry long term value but neither delivers explosive growth in the near term. MoonBull breaks that pattern. The presale invites anyone searching for the best crypto to join in 2025 with a chance to enter before the price rockets stage by stage. MoonBull builds hype with solid tokenomics, staking rewards, referral bonuses, audit security, and a launch system that protects early holders. MoonBull is different and the numbers speak louder than words. MoonBull is rewriting the meme economy. The presale is live now and the window for the biggest returns is still open. Anyone who missed PEPE or Shiba Inu now has a second chance. Grab MoonBull today before it blasts off.

52965833,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=833352,1760142749,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52965833.jpeg,Apple sets sights on Prompt AI to supercharge smart home tech,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/apple-eyes-prompt-ai-to-boost-home-tech/,"Apple is reportedly in late-stage talks with the computer vision startup Prompt AI to acquire talent and technology that would help it upgrade its smart home devices and further enhance its position in the artificial intelligence market. First reported on by CNBC, the deal highlights Apple’s low-key but purposeful strategy of shaping its AI offerings through small acquisitions focused on buying talent rather than purchasing billion-dollar companies across the board. Leadership at Prompt AI informed employees during an all-hands meeting that they were nearing the finalization of talks with Apple. Some staff would move to Apple as part of the deal, the company said, and those who did not would receive a less generous salary package and be encouraged to apply for open positions at the iPhone maker. Before Apple entered final-stage talks, other proptech players, including xAI and Neuralink (which is coming from Elon Musk), had reportedly shown interest in acquiring Prompt AI, according to people familiar with the meeting. Yet Apple’s bid seemed to be the most strategically focused, with an emphasis on both the company’s technology and its research talent. Prompt AI was established in 2023 by veteran AI researcher Tete Xiao, who holds a PhD in computer science from UC Berkeley, and Trevor Darrell, a co-founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab. That same year, the startup raised a $5 million seed round led by AIX and Abstract Ventures. Xiao and Darrell are both respected figures in the AI community, known for their work in computer vision and deep learning — two areas where Apple has been quietly building its capabilities behind the scenes. Apple and the Prompt AI founders have not responded to requests for comment on the deal; however, sources familiar with it note that the acquisition is likely to close within the next few weeks. Apple eyes Prompt’s tech for home automation Seemour, the flagship app of Prompt AI, is certainly central to Apple’s attention. The app integrates with home security cameras and utilizes a sophisticated computer vision system to recognize specific individuals, pets, vehicles, and objects. It can send alerts, text messages, or answer users’ questions about what has been happening in front of the camera — a development that suggests a conversational interface for home monitoring. However, while a technical success, the prompt AI failed to find a sustainable business model. At a town hall meeting, Xiao reportedly informed staff that the app and all user data would be deleted to safeguard privacy. This aligns with Apple’s robust stance on privacy, making them a well-matched partner on a cultural and ethical level. Industry watchers believe that Apple will utilize Prompt’s technology for its HomeKit platform — the one behind devices such as light bulbs, thermostats, and security systems that run on Siri. That could potentially transform HomeKit from a largely reactive automation system into an intelligent home assistant that is responsive and intuitive — one capable of observing real-world activity and responding instantly to it. Apple has historically been acquisitive of small AI and vision startups, usually to integrate their work into forthcoming products. In 2020, it bought Xnor. AI, a startup that does edge AI processing, which later helped improve Apple’s on-device image recognition features. Apple’s subtle AI strategy gains focus Indeed, unlike rivals such as Google , Microsoft, and Meta, Apple has steered clear of splashy AI-focused purchases. And while it has made large acquisitions before, its biggest-ever deal is still the purchase of Beats Electronics for $3 billion in 2014. Rather, Apple has shown a preference for “acquihires” — strategic and tactical acquisitions made to soak up specialized talent and proprietary technology. Some analysts argue that this cautious approach has hindered Apple’s outward progress in generative AI. And its new “Apple Intelligence” suite — intended to deliver personalized, on-device AI functions to iPhones and Macs — has seen delays in rolling out and mixed early reviews. Apple’s stock is down just 2% this year, after being left behind by most major tech indices and competitors that have adopted their belief in AI.

This huge wave can legitimize Bitcoin at a global level. But while the crown prince in the market is BTC, smart investors are also eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an early-stage project with asymmetrical potential. Being a next-generation DeFi protocol built for real-world applications, Mutuum Finance has become one of the hottest presales of 2025. The project is presently at Phase 6 of its token sale for only $0.035 per token, with over 60% of the phase already sold out. More than 16,830 investors have collectively raised over $17.05 million. Mutuum Finance can outperform Bitcoin’s returns in the upcoming bull cycle, and therefore the time to purchase both now could be ideal. Bitcoin’s Path to a Central Bank Reserve Asset Deutsche Bank strategists already believe that Bitcoin is to be a part of central bank reserves by 2030, when its volatility dwindles and its price action more closely follows gold. Despite having no physical support by a commodity, the appeal of Bitcoin as a safe-haven vehicle for value is taking hold as central banks seek diversification and companies are placing BTC in their treasuries. The digital currency recently crossed $125,000, and with its comparative volatility diminishing in proportion to its rising price, the argument of analysts Marion Laboure and Camilla Siazon is that BTC will shortly be employed as a fresh pillar of economic security, just as gold was employed within the 20th century. And with Bitcoin’s strategic position in the global financial system to increase, the majority of investors are already looking ahead, to Mutuum Finance that could offer a much greater level of upside potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to be trendy as presale Phase 6 continues to create this much hype. Investor appetite still prevails, with over 16,830 investors investing in excess of $17.05 million, demonstrating that confidence in the long-term future and vision of the project in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector continues to rise. Mutuum Finance protocol relies on dynamic real-time Loan-to-Value (LTV) and real-time liquidation factors. These are adjusted in real-time depending on market condition. This kind of dynamic ability enables the possibility of actively hedging volatility and therefore the protocol is more resistant to volatile market conditions. Next-Generation Lending and Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance announced it would be launching its groundbreaking lending and borrowing protocol . The Version 1 of the protocol will launch on Sepolia Testnet Q4 2025, the first to announce with it an extensive range of primary functionalities such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. The protocol will be supported by ETH and USDT in the forms of borrowing, lending, and collateralization on day one, just like offering users a high-speed, efficient, and scalable experience within DeFi. Reserve multipliers also help to offer the system an extra layer of security, ranging from 10% for low-risk assets to 35% for risk assets, as an additional layer of security against the markets. MUTM collateral management is designed to maximize borrowing capacity and overall capital efficiency via synergetic leveraging of the correlated assets. Together, they minimize insolvency risk and offer a safe, stable, and sustainable DeFi lending experience. Rich DeFi Bet On The Horizon Along With Bitcoin Following Deutsche Bank’s predicting central banks to invest in Bitcoin (BTC), long-term belief in digital currencies is on the rise. Smart investors are also coming in to join Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a next-generation DeFi protocol with dual-layer borrowing, lending, and dynamic collateral management. Phase 6 presale tokens are at $0.035, over $17.05M raised, 16,830+ investors, and over 60% sold out. Its upcoming lending protocol on Sepolia Testnet, backed by ETH and USDT, offers secure, scalable, and efficient DeFi exposure. Stack MUTM now and be ready for the next bull cycle.

52966409,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85989,1760144402,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analyst: XRP Moving Like Amazon, Sets $27 Target",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-moving-like-amazon-sets-27-target/,"A respected market analyst known as ChartNerd has drawn parallels between XRP’s long-term price movement and Amazon’s early trading history, suggesting that the digital asset could be preparing for a significant upward breakout. In a recent market update, the analyst shared a comparative chart showing how Amazon’s price action between 1999 and 2009 mirrors XRP’s consolidation pattern from 2017 to 2025. Based on this historical correlation, he proposed that XRP may be entering the same pre-rally phase that preceded Amazon’s massive multi-year growth. Amazon’s Historical Pattern and XRP’s Current Setup According to ChartNerd’s assessment, Amazon’s stock peaked in 1999 before spending roughly a decade moving sideways in a prolonged consolidation phase. Once it broke above resistance in 2009, the company’s stock entered an extended rally that defined its long-term growth trajectory. $XRP 1. $AMZN 1999-2009 2. $XRP 2017-2025 Amazon placed an ATH in 1999 and had to wait just under 10 years before a whopping vertical climb above $20.. $XRP placed an ATH in 2017 and has had to wait 8 years to start breaking its ATH.. Yet I'm reaching with my $27 targets? pic.twitter.com/CtdryNC3TS — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 8, 2025 He compared this structure to XRP’s price behavior following its 2018 all-time high. For nearly eight years, XRP has traded below that level, repeatedly testing resistance without a clear breakout. The analyst noted that both assets share similar long-term accumulation patterns, with XRP’s key resistance area centered around the $3 mark. ChartNerd believes that once XRP closes decisively above this threshold, the market could see a sustained breakout phase similar to Amazon’s in 2009. He identified $27 as a realistic target based on the scale of prior consolidation and the projected extension of the current cycle. Why the $27 Projection Appears Reasonable The analyst emphasized that the projection is not merely speculative but rooted in historical price behavior. He explained that market cycles often repeat when similar technical conditions appear. Amazon’s breakout followed years of low volatility and steady accumulation, a setup he argues XRP now replicates. A move from XRP’s current range near $2.80 to $27 would represent nearly a 10-fold increase. ChartNerd suggested that such an advance, while ambitious, aligns with how previous major crypto assets have behaved once they overcame multi-year resistance levels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ChartNerd is not the only commentator expecting XRP to reach this level. Market analyst EGRAG recently reiterated a similar $27 forecast using long-term Fibonacci extension and linear regression models. In his analysis, EGRAG projected that XRP could potentially reach that target before the end of the year if momentum shifts in favor of bulls. Both analysts share the view that XRP’s ongoing consolidation phase reflects strength rather than weakness and could serve as a foundation for the next major rally once market sentiment improves. Expanding Views: Triple-Digit Scenarios Beyond these moderate projections, other analysts have suggested far higher long-term possibilities. Nick Anderson of Bullrunners has presented an even bolder outlook, arguing that XRP’s setup mirrors Amazon’s full consolidation and breakout timeline, which spanned more than 3,800 days. Anderson observed that Amazon’s stock advanced from about $5 to over $200 after finally breaching its previous highs, and he believes XRP could follow a comparable pattern. Based on this model, he envisions a possible price range extending into triple digits, estimating a potential target of $100. Supporting Anderson’s viewpoint, Brad Kimes of Digital Perspectives highlighted parallels between the two companies’ historical challenges, Amazon’s battles with regulatory oversight in its early years, and XRP’s recently concluded legal disputes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While such extreme price levels remain speculative, analysts agree that XRP’s technical position shows resilience. The asset continues to hold above key supports, and long-term consolidation patterns suggest the groundwork for a future rally is still intact.

A textbook bull-flag pattern and whale accumulation are converging, hinting at a massive rally that may reshape the market’s narrative. Analysts believe this momentum could push Bitcoin to $140,000, opening the door for significant 2025 gains for major altcoins. Among the top beneficiaries, Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are attracting growing institutional and retail attention due to their network strength and scalability potential. Besides these two, analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE , a fast-rising small-cap token, is also emerging as one to watch as investor interest broadens beyond blue-chip cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Forms a Classic Bull-Flag Pattern Bitcoin’s technical outlook is promising, backed by a bull-flag pattern that has historically been associated with massive upward movements. The formation started with a sharp rally followed by a period of tight consolidation, which formed a setup recognized by traders as a bullish continuation signal. Source: X Analysts say that bull-flag breakouts in crypto have an average success rate of 65%. If confirmed above $125K, analysts believe that Bitcoin could extend up towards $140K, mirroring similar patterns observed before 15-20% price surges in past cycles. Whale Accumulation Strengthens Market Confidence Whale accumulation is in full force again supporting the bullish thesis. A short-lived dip led to wallets associated with big exchanges adding almost $79.9 million worth of Bitcoin on October 8, indicating long-term confidence among big holders. This trend aligned with past bull cycles. Analysts have put the current accumulation in a clear light that suggests Bitcoin bears may be getting exhausted as institutional conviction recovers. Technical Indicators Support the Bullish Setup Momentum signals are also in line with the positive trend. The stochastic RSI crossed above the 50-level on October 9, suggesting that bullish momentum is increasing, and volume data indicates less selling pressure across exchanges. If Bitcoin breaks the $125K-$126K resistance range, analysts predict cascading short liquidations to drive a faster rally. All major moving averages from 10-day to 200-day are now below the spot price, validating a general uptrend structure. Institutional Demand Adds Long-Term Stability Institutional inflows continue to be one of the most consistent supports of Bitcoin price structure. Spot ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity have already seen over $7.5 billion in cumulative trading volume this month. These inflows strengthen liquidity and affirm Bitcoin’s position as a go-to hedge against inflation and market uncertainty. Analysts say that as long as the $120K support level is in place, institutional confidence is likely to persist, adding further strength to the next leg of the bull market. Ethereum (ETH) Eyes $7K as Institutional Adoption Expands Ethereum (ETH) remains the shining star in the altcoin recovery story. With institutional adoption, Layer-2 growth, and increasing staking participation, analysts project Ethereum to hit $7K in 2025. With the growth of decentralized finance activity and the acceleration of ETH’s supply deflation post-upgrades, the network continues to be the strongest base for long-term on-chain growth. Capital rotation from Bitcoin into ETH normally comes during a period of consolidation, indicating that Ethereum can outperform in early 2025. Solana (SOL) Builds Strength Ahead of 2025 ETF Decisions Solana (SOL) is building strength in anticipation of potential ETF approvals. A growing developer community, low-cost infrastructure and a vibrant DeFi ecosystem have contributed to it being one of the key players among the next-generation blockchains. Analysts believe pending ETF applications could boost Solana’s liquidity and give confidence to institutional investors. If this trend persists, SOL may break out to the $300-$350 range, making it one of the top performers for gains in 2025. Emerging Altcoins Draw Retail Attention As Bitcoin bulls take control again, big money is flowing into leading cryptocurrencies, and retail traders are searching for even greater growth in smaller-cap tokens. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn notable attention for its expanding base and low-cap potential. Analysts note that because of the large market cap of Bitcoin, the growth rate is limited, but the smaller tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE have potential for rapid growth. Retail traders view it as an opportunity to reap from an upside before it is adopted by institutional investors. This contrast between the whale accumulation of Bitcoin and retail investors placing bets on the agile and smaller assets, may determine the next growth cycle allowing new projects to shine. Final Word Bitcoin’s ability to hold above the $120K support level is further evidence that Bitcoin bears are fading and bulls hold the technical and on-chain metrics. Whale accumulation, ETF activity, and institutional flows are the foundation for this recovery. As Ethereum and Solana position for potential long-term outperformance, smaller-cap projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing growing attention from retail traders seeking faster exposure.

DOGE's price trends sideways on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Dogecoin Whales Accumulate As Exchange Supply Thins On-chain flows are aligning with the ETF narrative. Data show roughly $23 million in DOGE left centralized exchanges recently, classic whale accumulation that reduces immediate sell pressure and can tighten supply when demand rises. At the same time, the technical structure remains constructive as DOGE has respected an ascending channel since the summer, and this week marked a fourth successful bounce off rising trendline support. Momentum gauges have stabilized, with hourly RSI hovering above neutral and OBV trending higher, signs that dip-buying persists even as broader crypto volatility ticks up. Together, shrinking exchange reserves and steady whale bids build a supportive backdrop into Q4, historically a seasonally strong stretch for DOGE. Doge Price Outlook: Key Levels To Watch Near term, bulls need to reclaim $0.254–$0.255 to break a short-term downtrend cap; a close above $0.260 would strengthen a push toward $0.278–$0.284, with the channel top near $0.33 as the next stretch target. Failure to clear $0.255 keeps price range-bound between $0.24–$0.26. On the downside, Dogecoin’s initial support sits at $0.2475, then $0.240 (channel lower bound). A decisive break below $0.232 would invalidate the constructive setup and expose $0.212–$0.205.

Although SHIB’s price action is relatively quiet compared to other cryptocurrencies, it is forming a structure on the daily candlestick timeframe chart that could soon lead to an explosive rally. Technical analysis of Shiba Inu on the TradingView platform shows that the meme coin is about to go on an explosive price action. Testing The Boundaries Of A Long-Term Structure Technical analysis of Shiba Inu’s recent price movement on the daily candlestick chart reveals that the token is currently retesting a major strong buy zone within a broad descending structure that has shaped its trend since May 2025. Shiba Inu has been locked in a tight consolidation range over the past several months, defined by a horizontal support region at the bottom and a slanting resistance trendline connecting a sequence of lower highs. The upper resistance is now situated between $0.0000135 and $0.000014. However, as it stands, Shiba Inu may still solidify its strong buy zone between $0.0000108 and $0.0000120 in order to collect liquidity that’s needed for a breakout momentum. Each test of this area since May has led to some sort of buying pressure that has prevented further declines. If SHIB can maintain stability within this accumulation zone and begin to push higher, the next important step would be a clean breakout above its descending resistance line. It would need to close decisively above $0.0000150 on the daily chart to confirm the strength of this move. That kind of breakout would mark a clear shift in structure and open up an explosive move to $0.000017. However, the area around $0.0000176 to $0.0000190 also coincides with a broader trend reversal zone, where Shiba Inu might experience selling pressure from previous order blocks. A rejection here could cause another pullback that will keep the meme coin within its long-term consolidation. On the other hand, if the price manages to pierce through $0.0000190 and establish support above it, the SHIB could finally escape the confines of its descending structure and set the stage for a sustained bullish move above $0.00002 again. Current Shiba Inu Price Action At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.000012 after a mild pullback from $0.00013 earlier in the week. Whether this breakout materializes will depend heavily on the broader crypto market. Bitcoin’s continued dominance and momentum are dictating the sentiment across altcoins. Therefore, an extended uptrend from Bitcoin’s current consolidation after its most recent all-time high could also contribute to Shiba Inu bouncing off its strong buy zone. Meanwhile, a popular Shiba Inu community member account on X recently warned the SHIB Army to be careful of a growing phishing scam.",Shiba Inu|Altcoin|bitcoin|Descending Structure|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-11 01:00:52

Sources familiar with the matter say discussions inside the White House have intensified in recent weeks, as Trump’s advisers debate the political and legal implications of such a move. Trump Allies Push for CZ Pardon, Calling Binance Case ‘Politically Motivated’ Changpeng Zhao, known widely as “CZ,” served a four-month prison sentence earlier this year after pleading guilty in 2023 to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws. The case, brought during the Biden administration’s broader crackdown on the crypto industry, required Zhao to step down as Binance CEO and pay a $50 million fine . Binance itself was fined $4.3 billion as part of the settlement, one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history. According to Gasparino’s report , several Trump allies believe the case against Zhao was “weak” and did not warrant felony charges or prison time. SCOOP: People close to @cz_binance , the former @binance chief who spent some time in the can amid the Biden Admin's crackdown on all things crypto, say discussions inside the White House are heating up on the possibility of a pardon from @realDonaldTrump . Many Trump insiders… — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) October 10, 2025 They argue that the enforcement actions taken under the previous administration were politically motivated and unfairly targeted crypto businesses. A pardon, they say, would symbolize Trump’s willingness to “reset” Washington’s relationship with the digital asset industry and review what some insiders describe as “overreaching” enforcement by Biden-era regulators. Trump is reportedly inclined to approve the pardon, but the White House is divided on the optics. Some aides have raised concerns about potential backlash, noting the president’s expanding business ties to the crypto sector and the possibility that a pardon could be perceived as favoritism. Others argue that Zhao’s cooperation with law enforcement and lack of prior criminal history strengthen the case for clemency. Zhao’s case became one of the most high-profile legal actions in crypto history. In November 2023, he admitted in a Seattle federal court to failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program at Binance, in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. The plea deal allowed him to retain majority ownership of Binance while stepping down from his executive role. A Pardon Could Bring CZ Back to the Global Crypto Stage — But Does He Even Want It? In April 2024, U.S. District Judge Richard Jones sentenced Zhao to four months in prison , far lighter than the 36 months sought by the Department of Justice. A Seattle courtroom became the stage for a major moment in the cryptocurrency industry as former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao received a four-month prison sentence. https://t.co/WaQvI63Y3O — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 30, 2024 Prosecutors had accused Binance of facilitating transactions linked to sanctioned countries and illicit activity, but the judge cited Zhao’s cooperation, remorse, and clean record as mitigating factors. Zhao was released from federal custody on September 27, 2024 , two days earlier than scheduled, after serving 116 days. Following his release, he indicated in interviews that he had no desire to return as Binance’s CEO, calling his seven-year tenure at the company “a closed chapter.” Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao @cz_binance is back — with plans to continue investments in blockchain, AI and biotech after his prison stint. #Blockchain #CZ https://t.co/3lOa0QZ5Pn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 30, 2024 In a November interview, he said he was focused on new ventures in artificial intelligence , biotechnology, and education, including Giggle Academy , a nonprofit initiative aimed at providing free global basic education through gamified blockchain-based learning systems. Despite stepping back from leadership, Zhao remains Binance’s largest shareholder, reportedly holding a 90% stake in the exchange. His net worth, which surged to an estimated $75 billion, rose sharply following BNB’s breakthrough to a new all-time high in July , which coincided with a surge in Bitcoin’s price to new all-time highs. Binance continues to operate under CEO Richard Teng , who succeeded Zhao following his resignation. The exchange still faces multiple legal challenges, including ongoing litigation with bankrupt crypto firm FTX. In November 2024, FTX sued Binance and Zhao , seeking to recover nearly $1.8 billion in allegedly fraudulent transfers made before FTX’s collapse. The lawsuit claims that Binance’s 2021 share repurchase deal with FTX was funded using misappropriated customer assets. Binance has denied the allegations, calling the claims “meritless.” Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has requested the Delaware Bankruptcy Court to dismiss a $1.76 billion recovery lawsuit filed by the FTX trust. #Binance #FTX #ChangpengZhao https://t.co/kUnttIufCw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 6, 2025 If approved, a Trump pardon would clear Zhao’s criminal record and potentially open the door for his formal return to the global crypto scene. While sources close to him have said he has moved beyond his Binance chapter, others believe a pardon could restore his ability to engage more freely in regulated markets and corporate affairs. As discussions continue inside the White House, the timing of any official decision remains uncertain. Gasparino noted that presidential pardons often take longer than expected, especially amid competing foreign policy and economic priorities.

52967579,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=833360,1760145657,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52967579.jpeg,Reeves presses CEOs to promote UK optimism before tax-hike budget,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/reeves-presses-ceos-to-promote-uk-optimism/,"Chancellor Rachel Reeves is urging top UK business leaders to project confidence in Britain’s economy ahead of next month’s high-stakes, tax-raising Budget. Reeves has privately cautioned that persistent economic pessimism could play into the hands of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, which is now polling ahead of the Conservatives and closing in on Labour among disillusioned voters. In a coordinated push, the Treasury has been highlighting positive remarks from global corporate figures, including Microsoft President Brad Smith, who recently described Britain as a “force for stability in an uncertain world.” The Financial Times says Reeves and her Treasury team have ramped up attempts to convince CEO’s to speak out in public about their confidence in the UK economy. Executives were warned at recent roundtables hosted by the Treasury that “talking down” the economy would simply play into Reform UK’s populist narrative. Treasury officials have reportedly encouraged chief executives to speak positively on social media or in statements about government policies such as planning reform and support for the green industry that might be considered “pro-business and pro-growth.” An ally of Reeves said her absence at this stage reflected what they described as a gutless approach to statecraft, adding that the government’s tone echoed that of the newspaper and warning that joining the chorus of talking Britain down would “only lead to a bad place.” The move is part of a broader ”City charm offensive” launched by the Treasury this month, in which senior executives extol Britain’s investment credentials. Business jitters rise ahead of looming tax hikes As the government tries to inject optimism , many business leaders remain wary of Reeves’s November Budget, which is expected to include rises in corporate and personal taxes to fill a £22 billion fiscal gap. Several CEOs charged that the chancellor was sending conflicting signals — first cautioning that Britain’s finances were worse than they thought when Labour came in, and then now demanding confidence from businesses. Critics also cite previous Reeves proposals to increase employer national insurance contributions by £25bn and toughen workplace protections, which some fear will hike the cost of employment and deter firms from hiring. However, the Treasury continues to claim Britain’s fundamentals are on the up. Official figures show business investment grew 3-year-on-year in the second quarter, and the OECD predicts the UK will be the second-fastest-growing economy in the G7 by 2025. However, growth has decelerated sharply this year – with GDP expanding by just 0.2% in the three months to July – and inflation, at 3.8%, is still eroding household incomes. Labour moves to blunt Farage’s populist surge At play behind Reeves’s shove is political calculus. The Treasury is concerned that Reform UK could capitalize on economic pessimism to reinforce its message of opposition to the establishment. Labour strategists warn that a Farage government would hollow out the institutions of Britain, end the Bank of England’s independence, and put a kebab skewer through Keir Starmer’s attempt to reforge post-Brexit trade links with Europe. In recent months, Reform UK has been courting the business world, with policies that include tax cuts, reduced spending, and increased drilling for North Sea oil. Farage’s team refused to comment specifically on Reeves’s comments, but party figures said government spin on optimism was bypassing the real-world pain felt by British firms. Reeves’s positivity drive received a boost last night after Microsoft’s Brad Smith announced a detailed £22 billion investment plan in the UK over four years, including data centres, AI research, and cloud infrastructure. Britain had become a force for stability in an uncertain world, Smith informed the chancellor — quite a change of tune from 2023, when he went off on UK regulators for thwarting Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard. Following a change in position and regulatory approval, the deal was subsequently approved, and Reeves has since cited Smith’s presidential endorsement as evidence of newfound confidence in the UK’s governance and innovation environment. In January, Reeves also sacked Competition and Markets Authority chair Marcus Bokkerink, citing the need for a “more pragmatic approach” to business regulation — a decision that some at the time interpreted as part of her wider pro-investment agenda.

He also anticipates that XRP may soon experience a comparable move, drawing parallels between both assets’ long-term technical structures. BNB has recently outperformed most major cryptocurrencies, securing a position among the week’s top-performing digital assets. Over the past seven days, it has appreciated by more than 16%, surpassing several large-cap coins. During this period, BNB set a fresh all-time high of $1,350 on October 7. Meanwhile, XRP has trended in the opposite direction, retreating by 7.5% and slipping below the $3 threshold, which allowed BNB to overtake it in overall market ranking. Despite these contrasting performances, EGRAG maintains that BNB’s rally has not yet reached its full potential and that XRP could eventually mirror the same bullish structure once its accumulation phase ends. #GOLD vs #BNB and #XRP vs #BNB I'm not really into #BNB , but take a look at how the movements of #BNB and #GOLD are surprisingly similar in formation! It seems like #BNB could still have a parabolic move towards the $2K region. Just to be clear, I'm not buying or trading… pic.twitter.com/qiwoWghRfM — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 9, 2025 BNB’s Movement Compared to Gold In his latest analysis, EGRAG highlighted a notable correlation between BNB’s price behaviour and that of gold over longer time frames. Examining both the 3-month and 1-month charts, he found that BNB’s trend appears to replicate gold’s historical movement with a slight delay. He noted that gold’s long-term pattern included a sharp correction below a horizontal resistance line in late 2011, following its then-record high near $1,921. Gold subsequently consolidated for several years before reclaiming the $2,000 level in November 2023. Once this threshold was breached, gold entered a steady uptrend that has since carried it to new highs above $4,000. EGRAG sees a similar technical setup in BNB. The token experienced a sharp decline from its 2021 peak of around $691, breaking below its horizontal trendline in May of that year. For nearly four years, it remained in a consolidation zone. In February 2025, BNB finally reclaimed the $700 level, initiating a strong upward trajectory that led to successive record highs. Its most recent all-time high of $1,350 represents an increase of roughly 93% from the breakout point. Based on gold’s previous performance after its breakout, the analyst believes BNB could extend its rally toward $2,000 in the months ahead. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Pattern Aligning With BNB’s EGRAG also compared XRP’s long-term structure with BNB’s historical pattern. According to his research, XRP’s price action demonstrates similar characteristics, though the asset appears to be at an earlier stage of the same trajectory. He explained that XRP first dropped below a comparable horizontal trendline following its 2018 peak of $3.31. The cryptocurrency then spent nearly seven years trading beneath that level. During the broad market rally in November 2024, XRP finally moved above the long-standing resistance, signaling a potential shift in market direction. While the breakout has not yet produced an explosive move similar to BNB’s, EGRAG contends that XRP remains positioned for a comparable advance. If it continues to follow BNB’s lead, he projects that XRP could eventually rise toward the $13 mark. This would represent an increase of approximately 364% from its current level near $2.74 . The analyst’s projection suggests that BNB’s ongoing performance could serve as a guide for what may come next for XRP. Though their short-term trends differ, both assets share a similar technical foundation characterized by prolonged consolidation and eventual recovery above key resistance levels. EGRAG’s findings reflect a broader market expectation that once XRP completes its current consolidation, it could join other major digital assets in a significant upward phase, potentially marking the start of a new cycle of growth.

52968393,603796,1760148031,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52968393.jpeg,US Senate Push for DeFi Restrictions Raises Fears of Crypto Market Slowdown,https://bitcoinist.com/senate-push-defi-restrictions-fears-market-slowdown/,"A leaked draft from the US Senate Banking Committee Democrats outlines an aggressive approach to decentralized finance (DeFi), proposing that any person or firm “designing, deploying, operating or profiting from a DeFi front-end” be regulated as a broker and register with the SEC or CFTC. The text would also extend KYC/AML obligations to DeFi interfaces, including some non-custodial wallets and UI hosts, and authorize the U.S. Treasury to maintain a “restricted list” of risky protocols and front-ends. While the memo carves out room for “sufficiently decentralized” protocols that don’t monetize, and shields open-source developers who don’t profit from running the tech, critics argue the compliance bar is functionally impossible for most U.S.-based teams. Industry Backlash And Early Market Impact Reaction from crypto policy leaders was swift. Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, said that “ropes in everyone in crypto,” calling it unworkable and tantamount to a ban on U.S. DeFi front-ends. Summer Mersinger of the Blockchain Association warned it would “effectively ban DeFi, wallet development, and other applications in the United States,” pushing responsible builders offshore. Consequently, markets appeared to flinch as a DeFi basket gauge slipped 3–4%, with notable underperformers including HYPE and ASTR amid growing regulatory uncertainty. Beyond prices, founders fear a chilling effect on hiring, fundraising, and product launches if front-end operators and wallet providers must run full broker-style compliance stacks. Politics, Policy, And The Risk Of An Innovation Exodus The Senate had been inching toward a bipartisan digital-asset market-structure compromise after the House passed its Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (294–134) . But Democrats’ DeFi counter-proposal, driven in part by illicit finance and national-security concerns, may stall momentum in a chamber that needs 60 votes. If the “restricted list” and front-end broker provisions survive, expect heavy lobbying, civil-liberties pushback, and potential court challenges. Strategists warn the U.S. could cede developer mindshare and liquidity to Europe’s MiCA regime, which already provides clearer guardrails for token issuers and service providers. Potential Impact of Senate DeFi Restrictions The leak raises the odds of a near-term U.S. DeFi slowdown as teams reassess legal exposure and capital waits for clarity. For markets, the key watchpoints are (1) whether Senate staff soften front-end and wallet obligations, (2) how “sufficient decentralization” is defined in statute, and (3) whether Treasury’s blacklist power is scoped narrowly. Without meaningful revisions, the U.S. risks swapping consumer protection for a brain drain, with innovation (and tax revenue) flowing to friendlier jurisdictions.

The recent correction has pushed ETH toward the $4,300 support zone, a level that bulls are now fiercely defending to prevent a deeper retracement. Despite the pullback, on-chain data suggests that large holders remain confident, signaling that this dip may be part of a healthy market reset rather than the start of a downtrend. Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Drops 50%: Is The Rally Built On Weak Fundamentals? According to recent data, Bitmine continues its aggressive accumulation of ETH, adding to its holdings even as prices fluctuate. This steady inflow from institutional players highlights strong conviction in Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals, particularly as the network maintains dominance in DeFi and smart contract activity. Still, sentiment among retail traders remains mixed. Some fear that sustained weakness below $4,300 could trigger another wave of selling pressure, while others see this as a potential accumulation opportunity before the next major move. As Ethereum stabilizes at these levels, the coming days will be crucial to determine whether the market resumes its bullish momentum or enters a prolonged consolidation phase amid heightened volatility. Ethereum Accumulation Continues As Bitmine Strengthens Its Position According to data shared by Lookonchain, institutional accumulation around Ethereum remains strong despite recent market volatility. Just a few hours ago, Bitmine received another 23,823 ETH (worth $103.68 million) from BitGo, marking yet another significant inflow of capital. This move comes only two days after Bitmine acquired 20,020 ETH ($89.7 million) via FalconX, underscoring their consistent strategy of building exposure during price dips rather than chasing rallies. Such accumulation patterns are often seen as a sign of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals, particularly from institutional investors who view ETH as a core asset within the broader digital economy. While short-term sentiment remains cautious after the recent correction, these inflows suggest that smart money continues to see value around current prices. The coming days will be critical for Ethereum’s technical structure. Bulls must defend the $4,300 support zone to maintain momentum and set up a potential recovery toward the $4,600–$4,750 resistance area. A strong defense here could pave the way for a new all-time high, confirming renewed investor confidence and establishing $4,300 as a key accumulation level. Related Reading: Grayscale Stakes 857,600 Ethereum Worth $3.83B As Institutional Confidence Grows Bulls Defend $4,300 Support Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading near $4,325, showing signs of consolidation after a 10% decline from its recent high of $4,750. The 12-hour chart reveals that ETH has fallen below the 50-day moving average (blue line), signaling short-term weakness, while the 100-day (green) and 200-day (red) moving averages are still trending upward — a sign that the broader uptrend remains intact. The $4,300 level now acts as a key support zone, with bulls attempting to establish a base and prevent further downside pressure. If this level holds, the next target would be a retest of $4,500–$4,600, where sellers are likely to reappear. However, a break below $4,250 could expose Ethereum to a deeper pullback toward the $4,000 psychological level, an area that previously served as a strong accumulation zone in late September. Related Reading: Short-Term Holder Supply Rises By 559K Bitcoin – New Buyers Flood the Market Momentum indicators suggest that selling pressure is easing, aligning with the recent on-chain data showing continued accumulation from large entities such as Bitmine. This reinforces the idea that institutional confidence remains strong, even amid volatility. For now, holding above $4,300 is critical — a successful defense could mark the foundation for Ethereum’s next push toward new highs.

The team stated that the move was necessary to ensure that all allocations accurately reflect users’ correct participation ratios across reward epochs. Aster posted on X, stating that it is verifying all allocation data after users reported errors in their token rewards. The team said most users’ allocations will stay above their final snapshot holding percentage and promised to update the numbers within a few days. Aster checks all user data and opens the refund option Aster said that some of its users have complained that the amount of tokens they received does not match the work, trading, or staking they had done on the platform, so the company’s team is reviewing the data again to address this issue . The process will take some time because there are many users and large amounts of data to compare, but once the checks are over, the company will share new and corrected allocation numbers for all users to see. Everyone will have 48 hours to review their updated results and decide whether they are satisfied with them or if they would prefer a USDT refund instead. The exchange said the refund options will make things fair for users who may have been affected by the data mistakes and will make sure they get the money one day after the final airdrop is completed. The exchange noted that its approach will demonstrate to users that it values their time, effort, and loyalty, which will also enable the project to continue growing with the support of its community. Aster stated that it will keep users updated on progress, respond to questions, and make sure that the airdrop will be done in a way that is accurate, fair, and fully transparent for everyone involved. Community questions fairness as Aster promises transparency Aster’s airdrop was delayed because some users said they received much less than they expected after inviting many new users, trading often, or holding large amounts of tokens. Others said they compared their results with their friends and found that people who did less somehow received more tokens. Social media platforms like X were flooded with messages from users sharing screenshots, spreadsheets, and explanations of what they believed had gone wrong. These posts pushed the Aster team to explain the problem. Quinten (048.eth), a well-known community member who had been promoting Aster for a long time, said he generated more than $100 million in referral trading volume and attracted around 250 new users to the platform. However, he explained that he only received 338 ASTER tokens as a reward, which he felt was far too little compared to his contributions. Quinten accused both Aster and Binance of unfairly rewarding certain insiders instead of regular users, claiming that insiders or people close to the project had received almost 95% of the total rewards. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) replied to Quinten’s post and asked if the numbers that Quinten had shared were correct and if the data could be verified. Quinten responded that the numbers were accurate based on Aster’s publicly shared data and that the problem was with the reward formula and not the math. He said that the reward system gave too much importance to referral-based points while ignoring other ways users had contributed, such as trading, staking, or supporting the community. Users who focused only on referrals earned much more, while those who had been active in many ways received much less. Aster released a statement, stating that its technical team had already begun checking every allocation record to ensure all numbers were correct. The exchange plans to complete the revised token drop by October 20.

In a stunning 24-hour period, more than $19 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated , erasing months of gains and leaving traders worldwide reeling. Screens that glowed green just days ago turned blood red as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major assets plummeted in synchronized freefall. Analysts are calling it the mother of all liquidations . Bigger than LUNA. Bigger than the COVID crash. Bigger even than the FTX implosion. The wipeout was triggered by a perfect storm: overleveraged positions collapsing in sequence, heightened regulatory pressure from multiple jurisdictions, and a sudden loss of investor confidence following the implosion of several highly speculative tokens. As automated liquidation engines kicked in, billions of dollars vanished from the markets within hours. Veteran traders compared the chaos to a financial hurricane. Exchanges experienced record traffic as investors scrambled to close positions, stablecoins briefly de-pegged, and panic rippled through DeFi protocols that had long been considered secure. Sentiment collapsed faster than prices, reinforcing the cycle of fear that gripped the global crypto landscape. Yet amid this unprecedented carnage, one digital asset stood resilient, BDT COIN (BDTC) . While the market drowned in red, BDT COIN continued to climb, defying the gravitational pull that dragged even the strongest cryptocurrencies down. The Calm Within the Storm: BDT COIN’s Rise While traders struggled to comprehend the market’s sudden collapse, BDT COIN remained firm and stable. Its value not only held but showed steady upward momentum, becoming a beacon of security in an otherwise turbulent market. The reason behind this resilience lies in BDT COIN’s design and philosophy . Unlike volatile, speculative cryptocurrencies, BDT COIN is backed by real, tangible gold reserves , giving every token intrinsic value. This gold-backed foundation has become the ultimate safeguard against the kind of systemic panic that wiped out billions elsewhere. BDT COIN isn’t just another digital asset; it is engineered to drive economies forward. It offers stable money , backed by gold for genuine confidence in every transaction. It empowers global commerce through effortless and low-cost international payments that transcend traditional financial barriers. It promotes financial inclusion , giving people everywhere access to participate in the new digital economy. And it stands as a fortress of ultimate security , protected by advanced, quantum-resistant technology that future-proofs it against cyber threats. A Vision of Stability in a Volatile World Launched with the vision of merging the reliability of gold with the innovation of blockchain, BDT COIN represents a new era of financial integrity. Its hybrid model , combining digital utility with physical asset reserves, delivers unmatched transparency and trust. Each BDT COIN is verifiably backed by audited gold holdings, ensuring that its value remains rooted in the real world. While speculative tokens falter, BDT COIN thrives by staying true to fundamental economics. Its transparency and asset-backing have earned it growing recognition among institutional investors and retail holders alike. During the market’s darkest hours, investors sought refuge in BDT COIN, viewing it as one of the few digital assets capable of maintaining stability when everything else failed. In a landscape defined by uncertainty, BDT COIN has proven that innovation anchored in real value is the foundation for lasting success. Its performance during this record-breaking market crash is more than a show of strength; it is a signal that the future of crypto will belong to assets built on trust, security, and tangible value. The Future Belongs to the Resilient As the dust settles on the largest liquidation event in crypto history, one message rings clear: the age of reckless speculation is ending. The future belongs to assets that blend innovation with stability, technology with transparency, and ambition with accountability. BDT COIN stands at the forefront of this transformation. It offers not just a safe haven in times of crisis but a sustainable path forward for the global financial system. For investors seeking security, real-world backing, and long-term growth potential, BDT COIN is more than a token—it is a movement toward resilient digital finance . Now is the moment to explore, understand, and invest in what could become the gold standard of tomorrow’s economy.

Pepe, one of the most well-known meme coins, currently trades at $0.059122, experiencing a slight 5.26% decline in the last 24 hours. Similarly, SPX6900, trading at $1.39, has recently experienced a more significant 12.99% decrease. Both of these coins have garnered attention for their volatility and strong communities, which drive much of their price action. The meme coin price trends are not always predictable, but they present opportunities for investors willing to ride the waves of the market. However, while Pepe and SPX6900 offer the thrill of short-term gains, investors are now eyeing a new contender that might offer even greater returns. BullZilla ($BZIL), a new meme coin built on the Ethereum blockchain, is quickly gaining attention for its solid technical foundation and high potential for long-term growth. As its presale continues to gain momentum, the meme coin price of $BZIL is becoming an increasingly attractive proposition for investors looking for an entry point into the meme coin market. Let’s take a deeper dive into these three coins, with a special focus on BullZilla and its unique value proposition. BullZilla: A Game-Changer in the Meme Coin Space BullZilla ($BZIL) offers an exciting opportunity for meme coin investors looking for a combination of hype and technical strength. Unlike many of its predecessors, BullZilla is built on the Ethereum blockchain, one of the most secure and scalable networks in the crypto world. This technical foundation provides $BZIL with several key advantages, including the potential for greater liquidity, security, and scalability. Currently, the meme coin price of $BZIL during its presale stands at $0.00013907, an attractive entry point for investors seeking high returns. BullZilla’s presale has already raised over $850k, with more than 2800 token holders, signaling strong community support and investor confidence. The coin’s unique features, such as its Roar Burn Mechanism, staking rewards, and a referral system, position it as a promising long-term investment. These features not only add value but also offer potential for growth and engagement within its ecosystem. How to Buy BullZilla Coins To buy BullZilla ($BZIL) coins, you’ll first need to set up a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. These wallets allow you to store your cryptocurrency securely and interact with decentralized applications. After setting up your wallet, purchase Ethereum (ETH) through a cryptocurrency exchange like Binance or Coinbase, and transfer the ETH to your wallet. Once your wallet is funded with ETH, visit the official BullZilla presale site and connect your wallet to the platform. From there, you can easily swap your Ethereum for $BZIL tokens. Simply select the amount you wish to purchase, confirm the transaction, and your tokens will be secured. Your allocation of $BZIL will be held in your wallet until the presale concludes, and you can claim it once the presale ends. Investment Scenario: What $2000 Could Buy You in BullZilla Presale For investors looking to get in on the ground floor of BullZilla, the presale offers a great opportunity. With the current price at $0.00013907, a $2000 investment would get you approximately 14,388,506 $BZIL tokens. If the coin appreciates by 10x after the presale, as many other meme coins have in the past, your $2000 investment could grow to $20,000. While this scenario is speculative, it highlights the potential for significant returns when investing early in promising meme coins. BullZilla’s technical foundation and its strong presale performance make it a particularly attractive investment. The presale price offers a unique opportunity for early investors to lock in a price before the coin potentially rises in value post-launch. Pepe Price: A Meme Coin with a Loyal Following and Volatile Price Pepe, while facing recent price drops, remains one of the most recognizable names in the meme coin space. Its current price of $0.059122 might not seem like much, but its high volatility means that it could surge once market conditions shift. Pepe is often considered a “safe bet” for meme coin investors, thanks to its massive following on social media platforms and its deep roots in internet culture. The meme coin price has been heavily driven by hype, with investors eagerly awaiting the next “pump” that could propel its value higher. Despite the current downturn, the long-term potential of Pepe should not be discounted. The meme coin price is often cyclical, following trends set by larger market movements and social media buzz. As a result, investors usually view Pepe as a coin that’s ripe for quick trades, capitalizing on its periodic price swings. With its established community and continued brand recognition, Pepe remains a meme coin worth keeping an eye on. SPX6900 Price: A High-Risk Meme Coin with Volatility at Its Core SPX6900, trading at $1.39 with a 12.99% decline in the past 24 hours, brings a unique level of volatility to the meme coin market. This meme coin is often seen as an underdog, with its price largely driven by market sentiment and community hype. While it may seem like an attractive investment during price dips, SPX6900 is a high-risk option for investors looking for stability. Its volatility is a double-edged sword,offering the potential for large gains, but also posing the risk of significant losses. The meme coin price of SPX6900 is influenced more by hype than by technical advancements or ecosystem improvements. As a result, it’s often seen as a speculative investment, ideal for traders who can time the market but not necessarily for long-term holders. With its current price at $1.39, SPX6900 may still hold promise for traders willing to navigate the choppy waters of meme coin trading. However, those looking for a more structured investment might find more appeal in newer meme coins with stronger foundations. Conclusion: Pepe, SPX6900, and BullZilla, Meme Coin Price Trends for 2025 Pepe and SPX6900 remain popular meme coins, but their prices continue to fluctuate with the crypto market’s highs and lows. For those looking for a more stable investment with the potential for long-term growth, BullZilla presents an exciting opportunity. The $BZIL presale is gaining momentum, and its price continues to rise as more investors jump on board. With its Ethereum-backed infrastructure, deflationary features, and strong community support, BullZilla is a meme coin price that is poised for success. Investing in meme coins has always been about timing the market and understanding the underlying value. While Pepe and SPX6900 provide opportunities for short-term gains, BullZilla offers a much stronger foundation and the potential for significant long-term growth. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a newcomer to the meme coin market, BullZilla is one to watch in 2025.

Israeli Trader Stabbed, $600K Stolen in Home Attack",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-or-your-life-israeli-trader-stabbed-600k-stolen-in-home-attack/,"According to the Tel Aviv District Attorney’s Office, a Bitcoin trader in Herzliya was attacked and robbed in what prosecutors call a violent home invasion on September 7. The victim was stabbed and forced to give up digital wallet access. Reports say the thieves walked away with roughly $600,000 in assets and valuables. How The Attack Unfolded Reports have disclosed that the assailants waited in the stairwell outside the victim’s apartment and struck at about 8:10 a.m. They forced their way in when the door opened. The attacker tied the man up and stabbed him twice, each wound above the knee. They threatened harm to his family to force him to hand over wallet codes. At first, the group demanded 500 Bitcoin, a demand that was later scaled down as violence was used to extract access. Under pressure, the victim surrendered credentials that allowed transfers of approximately $547,260 in Bitcoin and $42,248 in USDT. The intruders also took a Rolex watch valued at about $50,000, a laptop, a Trezor hardware wallet, around €5,300 in cash and several thousand Israeli shekels. Before leaving, they sprayed disinfectant inside the flat—apparently in an effort to erase traces. Arrest And Charges Based on reports, police arrested 46-year-old Murad Mahajna on September 10. He was indicted by the Tel Aviv District Attorney’s Office. The charges include breaking and entering, aggravated robbery, extortion by threats, obstruction of justice and making threats. Prosecutors say they linked Mahajna to the scene using phone records, voice identification, technological data and CCTV footage. He is described as having a criminal history with 10 prior convictions for matters including violence, drugs and weapons. Numbers And Evidence The sums in this case are specific. Roughly $589,508 in crypto was reportedly moved from the victim’s accounts — the combined total of the Bitcoin and USDT transfers. When the watch and cash are added, the financial loss approaches the headline figure of $600K that circulated in early reports. Crypto-analytics sources tracking physical attacks on holders listed this event among confirmed “wrench” style assaults ; one count put it as the 52nd such physical attack recorded in 2025. Phone calls allegedly made after the assault pressured the victim for more coins and included threats to “find” family members if demands were not met.

Canary Capital’s updated S-1 now includes ticker LTCC and a 0.95% fee, the kind of last-mile filing detail ETF watchers say typically appears “before go-time.” With Grayscale and CoinShares also in the hunt, analysts argue LTC’s commodity-like profile and long proof-of-work history make it one of the cleaner alt candidates for regulated fund access once the SEC resumes normal operations. Litecoin Technical setup: $130 reclaim tees up $135–$138 On the charts, Litecoin blasted through the $127.45 swing high and reclaimed stacked moving averages (7- and 30-day SMAs), turning the multi-month range from ceiling to potential floor. RSI (68) shows strong momentum without a blow-off, and MACD remains firmly positive. Immediate resistance sits at $130–$131; a daily close above opens a path to $134–$135, then $138 and $150. Should FOMO follow an ETF headline, bulls point to a broader vacuum up to the $150–$160 zone, Litecoin’s highest region since early 2022. On higher time frames, some technicians note a breakout from a year-long diagonal that, if confirmed, preserves a stretch target toward $275 over the coming months; that scenario likely requires sustained ETF-driven inflows. LTC's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: LTCUSD on Tradingview LTC Levels That Matter, And What Could Invalidate For momentum traders, the line in the sand is $125: lose it decisively and swift profit-taking could drag LTC back into $122–$125 support, with $115–$118 as a deeper retest. Hold above $125 and reclaim $130 with volume, and bulls keep control into $135–$138. Macro remains a swing factor; government shutdown timing, SEC throughput, and broader crypto risk appetite can still inject volatility.

For searchers tracking the Litecoin price, keep your eyes on $130: it’s the path to the next leg.

The milestone marks growing confidence in regulated crypto investment products and increasing liquidity in the Bitcoin market. BlackRock’s IBIT fund continues to lead with the $244.5 million in yearly revenue and almost $100 billion in controlled assets. With consolidation above $120 000, analysts are also shifting focus to high-potential altcoins. Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK) top the list, yet MAGACOIN FINANCE is now entering the conversation as one of the next big altcoins to buy with the renewed capital rotation. Bitcoin ETF Volume Hits $7.5B Milestone Institutional inflows are continuing to fuel record activity across Bitcoin ETFs. Combined volumes have exploded right through early October, driving cumulative trading to new highs. Bitcoin is trading at nearly $121,000, down slightly from its record $126,279 high reached two days ago. The token managed to add over $10,000 in two weeks before stabilizing. Prediction markets have a 38% chance of prices holding between $120,000 and $122,000. Technical readings remain positive. Thirteen out of fifteen moving averages indicate a bullish structure, whilst the RSI at 60 indicates balanced momentum. Resistance levels are at $123,240 and $125,000-$126,000, and solid support at $118,000-$119,500. Profit-Taking Emerges After Record Highs Open interest has fallen from $47 billion to $46.1 billion as some long positions have been taken off after the new highs. Analysts consider this normal profit-taking, rather than a sign of weakness. Market sentiment is optimistic, and traders expect liquidity to rotate into altcoins as Bitcoin consolidates. Historically, such phases often signal the start of the next broad-based crypto rally. Top Altcoins to Buy Cardano (ADA) — Resilient Structure Suggests Upside Potential Cardon (ADA) is trading above its 50-week moving average and keeping its long-term bullish structure intact. The coin is consolidating around $0.80 level, with $0.70 to $0.75 being an effective support zone. Analysts are targeting the $1.00 to $1.20 range as the next big resistance. Developer activity and DeFi growth continue to strengthen ADA’s position as one of the best altcoins to buy for investors looking for stability and growth. Chainlink (LINK) — Breakout Pattern Targets $54 Chainlink (LINK) is trading close to $22.33 after breaking out of a bullish flag pattern. Volume has increased 16% to $916 million, indicating renewed momentum. Technical projections call for a $54.60 target if momentum is sustained. Support is now near $23.50, which was the previous breakout zone. LINK’s expanding role in linking real-world data to blockchains has made it a leading utility token for institutional adoption. Market Rotation Expands Beyond Bitcoin As Bitcoin ETFs attract institutional inflows, analysts anticipate a shift to liquidity from large- and mid-cap altcoins. Historically, when Bitcoin stabilizes, capital moves into assets that have better potential for upside gains. Cardano and Chainlink have profited from this first wave, but analysts monitor small-cap emerging projects, too, with exponential potential. As capital begins rotating from Bitcoin into smaller-cap assets, analysts are highlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most promising tokens to watch. The project has captured investor attention due to its strong fundamentals and rapid early-stage accumulation. According to projections, analysts expect MAGACOIN FINANCE to deliver up to 65× returns before the end of the year, fueled by a growing community and rising on-chain activity. This outlook reflects sustained buying pressure from early participants seeking high upside exposure as the market enters its next altcoin cycle. With expanding liquidity and active community growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout small-cap contender positioned to benefit from renewed demand for higher-return opportunities. Its early-stage traction mirrors previous market leaders that multiplied during prior bull rotations. Conclusion — ETF Strength Sets the Stage for Altcoin Growth The $7.5 billion Bitcoin ETF volume underscores how deeply traditional finance has entered the crypto sector. As Bitcoin steadies near record levels, attention is shifting toward altcoins with stronger fundamentals and technical appeal. Analysts say ADA and LINK are leading the charge, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming one to watch among emerging assets. With capital rotation accelerating and institutional inflows rising, these projects could anchor the next major altcoin rally as the market transitions into the final quarter of 2025.

This includes the strategic launch of the stablecoin across its Multi-Assets Collateral mode and SmartEarn product. This expansion is accompanied by an unprecedented three-tier campaign, offering users powerful tools for more efficient asset management and substantial rewards. Triple Incentives for USDD Holders The announcement states that from 4:00 (UTC) on October 11 to 4:00 (UTC) on October 21. To access the three exclusive benefits, users must click “ Register Now ” on the event page, activate USDD on SmartEarn, and switch to Multi-Assets Collateral mode. Earn 10% APY on USDD with SmartEarn: Registered users who activate USDD on SmartEarn can earn a 10% APY during the event period. Interest will be automatically distributed as Points on the T+1 day. Enjoy 2% Rebate on USDD Transfers to Futures Account: Users who transfer USDD to their USDT-M Futures accounts will receive a 2% rebate on the net transferred amount (minimum 100 USDD). The campaign features a total prize pool of 20,000 USDD, distributed on a first-come, first-served basis, with a maximum reward of 200 USDD per participant. Climb the Trading Volume Leaderboard to Share 30,000 USDD: Users who trade Futures in Multi-Assets Collateral mode during the event can qualify for a share of the 30,000 USDD prize pool. To be eligible, participants must maintain a daily average USDD balance of at least 100 USDD in their U-Margined Futures account (verified by daily snapshots) and reach a cumulative futures trading volume of at least 10,000 USDT. Each participant can earn up to 3,000 USDD in rewards. USDD (Official Social Media: https://link3.to/usdd ) is a decentralized stablecoin deployed on the TRON and Ethereum blockchains, characterized by its security, transparency, and stability. It maintains a stable 1:1 peg to the US dollar, supported by secure liquidation, dynamic collateral management, and an advanced risk control framework. Since its upgrade to USDD 2.0 this year, it has achieved seamless integration with Decentralized Finance (DeFi), while introducing efficient liquidation processes, collateral auctions, and a Peg Stability Module (PSM) to enhance price stability. The USDD 2.0 ecosystem is committed to long-term growth, empowering users and enhancing protocol security through real-time monitoring and community-driven decisions. SmartEarn and Multi-Assets Collateral Maximize Asset Efficiency HTX’s Multi-Assets Collateral mode allows a broader range of assets to serve as margin collateral for USDT-margined futures, enabling users to optimize their portfolios without converting all assets into USDT. This feature helps fully activate idle assets, significantly improving overall capital utilization and efficiency. SmartEarn automatically calculates rewards by taking snapshots of assets held in users’ USDT-M Futures accounts. Importantly, even after activating SmartEarn, users can transfer or trade their assets at any time without restrictions. Activating Multi-Assets Collateral mode is easy—users just switch the asset mode on the futures page. Enabling SmartEarn is just as simple: on the App, go through the futures asset banner to the SmartEarn page, or on the Web, select SmartEarn from the Futures navigation bar and click “Enable All.” Both actions are quick, intuitive, and take effect immediately. The addition of USDD to both Multi-Assets Collateral and SmartEarn not only enhances HTX users’ asset allocation options but also broadens the range of available trading and wealth management opportunities. Looking ahead, HTX remains committed to optimizing the user experience and will accelerate the rollout of innovative financial tools to help users achieve highly efficient asset growth.

Trader anxiety that a cooling trade war was about to re-ignite sent a macro shock rippling through crypto, triggering one of the largest long declines in prices of BTC, ETH and other digital assets seen all year. Bitcoin recovered to $113,294 and Ether to $3,844 as the CoinDesk 20 Index slid 12.1%. The world's largest cryptocurrency had fallen below $110,000 briefly, marking a 10% decline over the past 24 hours. Crypto's total market cap dropped to $3.87 trillion, and roughly $16.7 billion of the $19.1 billion in liquidations came from longs, while Ethena’s USDe briefly printed $0.9996, a mild deviation that highlights peg stress when derivatives markets whipsaw. Friday's crash saw crypto's worst liquidation in terms of pure volume, seeing over 10 times as much dollar value liquidated as the crashes when FTX collapsed in 2022 or when global markets melted down during the early COVID lockdowns. At a percentage level, Friday's crash is much less significant, given how much the overall crypto market has grown since 2022. CoinGlass said in a post on X that while it recorded $19.13 billion in liquidations, ""the actual total is likely much higher,"" noting that crypto exchange Binance — the largest in the world — does not report as quickly as other platforms. The Ethena team said USDe minting and redemptions remained fully operational despite the volatility and pointed out that the stablecoin is even more overcollateralized as unrealized gains from short positions are realized. Adding to traders’ concerns, the U.S. government shutdown has delayed key economic data releases, leaving markets to navigate without official indicators just as trade war rhetoric returns to center stage.

XRP Whale Flow Is At A Negative $50 Million Per Day At The Moment As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, XRP whales have been offloading coins recently. “Whales” refer to the big-money investors who hold significant amounts in their wallets and carry some influence in the market. The behavior of these key investors can often be worth keeping an eye on, as even if it may not always directly correlate with the asset’s trajectory, it can still be revealing about how the influential entities are feeling about the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Pivoting To Accumulation, But Mega Whales Are Still Selling There are many ways to track the behavior of the XRP whales, with one such being the metric cited by Maartunn: the Whale Flow. This indicator measures the net amount of coins that’s entering into or exiting out of the wallets of this cohort. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the XRP Whale Flow over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA XRP Whale Flow plunged to a highly negative value in July as the coin reached its top above $3.6. This suggests that the large holders took the opportunity of the rally to participate in profit-taking. Interestingly, since this plummet in the indicator, its value has remained at a similarly red value until today, meaning that the whales have only continued to apply selling pressure. At present, the metric is sitting at a negative value of $50 million per day, meaning that whales have been withdrawing an average of $50 million every day for the past month. This could be a reason why the cryptocurrency hasn’t seen any big rally recently, while Bitcoin and other coins have been flying. In some other news, analyst Ali Martinez has identified a price level that could help turn XRP around. As the below chart shared by Martinez in an X post shows, the coin has seemingly been trading inside a Parallel Channel over the last couple of months. A Parallel Channel is a technical analysis (TA) consolidation pattern that forms when an asset trades between two parallel trendlines. The lower level of the pattern acts as a support line. From the chart, it’s visible that in the case of this XRP Parallel Channel, it’s situated at $2.73. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Rally Still Looks Intact, CryptoQuant Says: Here’s Why The analyst has noted that if this support level holds, the coin could see a rebound to the upper level at $3.10. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.745, down more than 11% over the last week.

52974494,603464,1760155244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52974494.jpeg,Weirdest Bitcoin Heist Yet? OP_RETURN Targets Dormant Wallets,https://bitcoinist.com/weirdest-bitcoin-heist-yet-op_return/,"An obscure firm using the storied “Salomon Brothers” name has ignited one of Bitcoin’s strangest ownership fights to date: a mass “dusting” campaign that blasted tens of thousands of legacy wallets with on-chain “legal notices” embedded in OP_RETURN messages. In a detailed forensic study, Galaxy Research links the messages to a coordinated attempt that may be laying groundwork for abandoned-property claims—though it remains unclear how any claimant could ever take control of coins without the private keys. Bitcoin Dust Attack Sparks Legal Chaos According to Galaxy’s analysis , an unknown, sophisticated actor sent 41,523 OP_RETURN messages from 3,738 sender addresses to 39,423 recipient addresses that collectively held about 2.334 million BTC when targeted. The vast majority—98.82%—were legacy P2PKH addresses with very long inactivity, averaging roughly 2,171 days (~5.95 years). The campaign rolled out in waves over the summer: test transactions in late June with no links or “Salomon” references, followed in July and August by messages carrying all-caps “LEGAL NOTICE” language and URLs pointing to Salomon Brothers’ website. Early operational hiccups—like an initial broken URL—were later corrected as the sender iterated through a “test → blast → monitor → adjust” loop. The notices directed recipients to a page asserting that the targeted wallet “appears to be lost or abandoned,” and that a Salomon client “has taken constructive possession of it.” The page gives owners ninety days to prove control—either by moving funds on-chain or by submitting documentation—warning that “the lack of a response may be provided to a court as evidence of the relinquishment of all rights, title and interest.” As of Friday, October 10, 2025 (Europe/Berlin), the page states that responses must come “before October 10, 2025.” “Constructive possession,” as defined by Cornell Law’s Legal Information Institute, refers to legal possession without direct physical control—“for example, someone with keys to a safe deposit box may have constructive possession to the contents of that box.” Applied to bearer-style digital assets, the analogy is provocative: on Bitcoin, control is cryptographic, not custodial, and “keys” are literally the ability to sign. Establishing constructive possession without a private key is, at minimum, legally novel. Galaxy’s researchers stress there is no evidence the episode reveals a Bitcoin protocol flaw or a private-key compromise. In fact, most of the targeted scripts (legacy P2PKH) are less exposed to certain hypothetical attack classes than other address types. Still, the scale and method—paired with explicit deadlines and relinquishment language—suggest the organizer could attempt legal action in jurisdictions with unclaimed-property statutes that contemplate digital assets. “Given the OP_RETURN campaign’s scale, the messages’ contents, and the notices they linked to, a plausible interpretation is that whoever is behind them may try to wage legal claims on unresponsive wallets,” Galaxy writes, while cautioning that “the legal viability and possible reach” are “questionable.” The campaign also coincided with renewed on-chain movement from at least one long-silent whale. Shortly after a tranche of messages drew attention in early July, a wallet associated with an early holder moved roughly 80,000 BTC, fueling speculation that the dusting acted as a wake-up call for dormant addresses. Whether cause, coincidence, or opportunistic timing, the episode underscored a truth unique to bearer crypto: proof of life is an on-chain signature away. Salomon’s public posture, captured across its website, frames the effort as a compliance exercise “meant only for the wallet owner,” insisting the client “is not a hacker and is not phishing.” But the notice also asserts that, after the 90-day window, the “digital wallets and their contents will be considered to be confirmed as abandoned,” and warns against any “trespass” without the client’s authorization—language likely to alarm Bitcoiners who view private keys as the sole arbiter of control. What happens next hinges on courts more than code. Abandoned-property law in the US varies by state, and even where statutes recognize virtual currency, translating a court order into on-chain control is non-trivial. Without the keys, a claimant cannot sign a transaction; without a cooperative custodian or intermediary, there is no off-chain lever to pull. Galaxy’s bottom line reflects that tension: the gambit is sophisticated and not purely performative, but any attempt to convert “constructive possession” into spendable BTC would face profound practical and legal hurdles. For now, the dust has settled into an uneasy signal. The campaign demonstrates that OP_RETURN can carry more than memes—it can deliver pseudo-legal processes at blockchain scale. Whether that message ever amounts to more than noise will test the boundaries between on-chain facts and off-chain claims, and whether courts will try to bridge a gap that cryptography, by design, made very wide.

SOLT achieves 2x Solana exposure via regulated futures, not direct SOL purchases, with $781M AUM, 1.85% expense ratio, and robust liquidity. On-chain analysis highlights strong Solana fundamentals: rising TVL, user growth, and liquidity inflows, supporting positive momentum and long-term value. Recommend tactical buying of SOLT to amplify Solana beta, driven by strong fundamentals and ETF approval speculation, with active risk management essential. Introduction 2x Solana ETF (SOLT) is a Volatility Shares Trust ETF that seeks to double (+200%) the daily Solana price movement (daily target 2x), using derivatives instead of buying the asset directly. It is listed on the NASDAQ, with a start date of 20/03/2025, and is intended for traders who understand the effect of daily capitalization (compounding) and the risks of 2x leverage. The fund manager warns about this: this vehicle is a product for investors who can monitor the position on a daily basis and tolerate amplified volatility; the value of the stake can vary sharply even in a single session. Volatility Shares As of 9/10/2025, the fund's website shows: net assets $672 million NAV $24.38 27.56 million shares median spread: 0.12% (30d) expense ratio: 1.85% Ticker: SOLT CUSIP: 92864M830 Volatility Shares Operationally, SOLT obtains its exposure primarily through Solana futures listed on regulated markets (CME Group's Solana future), further relying on high-quality cash and collateral (T-bills or government monetary funds) to cover margins and liquidity. Volatility Shares In its holdings, we found that it holds a 200% exposure in Solana futures and a 100% “Cash & Other” item (cash, accrued assets/liabilities and government money fund shares). This combination makes it possible to meet the 2x target without recourse to capital lending: the leverage is derived from derivatives, not traditional financial leverage. The trade-off is the costs/benefits of roll (as contango/backwardation) and potentially imperfect spot tracking when the futures curve moves. Risks: Daily Compounding and Beta Slippage In the first graph, taking as a time horizon the start of the ETF, we have built a comparison of how the Solana cryptocurrency has evolved in its spot price and the real SOLT ETF. To these two series we have added the theoretical SOLT (SOLx2) that takes the spot performance of Solana and multiplies it by two, without added frictions. This graph, we will use it as a visual support to compare the trajectories of the underlying, the actual product and the x2 “ideal”. In this way, we obtain a first insight into the effect of volatility and daily reset. Node Analytica SOLT, SOLX2, SOL-Spot base 100 Looking at the series in the graph, while there is a clear trend the SOLT ETF accompanies the theoretical one (SOLx2) and loses in lateral movements with volatility increasing the widening between the series. Node Analytica Daily Tracking Difference & Cumulative Divergence We visualize better the gap between the real and the theoretical with the following graph that combines the blue line of cumulative divergence with the area of the Daily Tracking Difference (green if SOLT yields above 2× daily and red if it yields below). The cumulative divergence measures how far the accumulated “path” of the ((REAL)) SOLT ETF has deviated from the theoretical when both start on the same day. If positive, the actual ETF is ahead of the theoretical ETF and vice versa. In this way we can quantify the erosion (daily reset, roll, commissions, spreads, etc.) of the leveraged ETF. After a convulsive start that we will treat as an operational outlier (by possible time misalignment and/or premium/discount at closure), over time the divergence deepens, to a current -20%. The gaps between both values are accentuated when volatility increases, while more stable trends bring the real performance closer to the theoretical. In the same way, it can be seen that the Tracking Difference tends to oscillate around 0 with a typical amplitude of +/- 10%. When the underlying asset ((SOL)) enters into cleaner trend tranches, the area softens and the divergence reconverges. On the other hand, in lateral and volatile phases, tracking alternates with greater intensity, and divergence deepens. So far, this indicates that SOLT is a good option to maintain in the short term and capture directional impulses with positive momentum. In this scenario, the position offers its best version, while on the volatile side, it erodes the result versus the theoretical one, and therefore maintaining it in the long term makes no sense from the point of view of profitability/risk. Node Analytica Rolling effective beta In the following graph, with the effective beta, we observe how many points real SOLT moves for each point that SOL spot moves. As the ideal theoretical beta should stay around 2, if you frequently move away, it means that something is happening with tracking, microstructure, or market regime. Since the start of the ETF, except on two occasions, the beta has remained constantly below 2, reaching extreme levels of 1.5-1.6 in volatile laterality regimes and only reaching levels 2 of beta, when the trend was constant and directional volatility during the month of July. We also observed a convergence last September when the price maintained momentum without strong oscillations in the microstructure. This analysis reinforces the theory that this instrument should be used tacitly for short-term operations, a tight size, and measuring accurately the inflows by monitoring beta, tracking volatility, and volatility: final phases of price consolidation and/or beginnings of confirmed upward micro-trends that break with sideways ranges. Also, reduce/close exposure when side volatility increases along with downward reversals of the beta. Regulatory Warning Regulatory warning. SOLT is a 2× daily reset leveraged ETF that gets its exposure mainly through futures and is geared towards tactical operation by experienced investors. The SEC and FINRA caution that leveraged/reverse ETFs are designed to meet their objective in daily periods and that over longer horizons their performance may differ significantly from the expected multiple of the underlying, especially in volatile or sideways environments; therefore, they require active monitoring and a short-term horizon. In addition, FINRA reminds institutions (and by extension the investing public) of their suitability and supervision obligations with these products, given their complexity and specific risks. Analysis - On-Chain Fundamental In this section we will analyze the investment vehicle proposed from the perspective of on chain analysis. The purpose of this block is to obtain insights from the blockchain to provide information to the reader about its fundamental value and argue the momentum of it and how it translates into the price of the asset. Node Analytica TVL & Stables The first chart shows two metrics: Total Value Locked (TVL) (Blue) and Total Stable Coins (Yellow), both measured in USD. The TVL is the number of Solanas that are “blocked” and cannot “move”—that is, it represents how much of the total circulating supply is not actually available. On the other hand, the line of SOL_STABLE, represents the amount of stable coins expressed in USD that are found in the Solana blockchain. That said, let’s look at each: A positive trend of the TVL, like the one we have in the graph, is usually linked to two main factors: an increase in the number of projects and greater DeFi activity. This in turn positively influences the number of validators/operators committed to the ecosystem. The translation is simple: capital inflow and increased interest: interest on the part of application developers, new validator/operator nodes, and infrastructure creators for DeFi markets → improves the supply and availability of services on the network → attracts users → increased capital inflow into the Solana ecosystem → increased demand = medium/long-term value. Another important aspect of the TVL is that the higher it is, the greater confidence and security it conveys. The idea is that whoever is blocking your Solana coins, is “betting” that they will be revalued or, what is the same, placing their trust in the blockchain, in addition to receiving a periodic reward for it (in the cases of staking). Not only has the TVL been on a positive trend, but so has the liquidity of the system. The curve in the amount of dollars that have flowed into Solana’s ecosystem since mid-2024 has been dramatic. Solana stands out mainly for its DeFI ecosystem, more stablecoins in the blockchain (more liquidity) implies tighter spreads, a greater market depth in the DEX (Decentralized Exchange) and Swaps. In addition, liquidity represents the entry of “new players,” whether market makers or speculators, reinforces network activity, Solana's demand, the increase in fees, etc. Which translates into an improvement in the structural growth of the blockchain. In addition, a growing ecosystem increases the number of Solanas that are burned at each epoch, and this increase affects the issuance of new Solanas in such a way that reduces the amount emitted; that is, it exerts a deflationary effect on supply that sustainably positively affects the valuation of the asset. Node Analytica Transfers, addresses & fees To reinforce the concept of the evolution of the Solana ecosystem, in the following graph we show the series of: Total Addresses, Total Transfers and Total Fees. Being Total Addresses, the total number of addresses created in the blockchain, Total Transfers, the total number of transfers executed in the blockchain and finally, Total Fees is the total number of fees in USD that have been “paid”. All this in daily temporality. The sustained growth of Total Transfers and Total Addresses, reinforces the idea that the user base and usage activity has been increasing. While it is true that within the total of addresses we can say that many of them may have stopped being active long ago, the key to this data is the slope of the curve itself and how it has accelerated since the beginning of 2024, this increase in the speed of address creation is very significant. All this keeps Solana as an attractive and competitive network in front of its counterparts (L1/L2). Initially, the entry of new users usually comes from the good performance and development of the network and the number of services it offers; however, what is interesting here is that the increase of users of an ecosystem, attracts more capital and new developments, which in turn is usually accompanied by a new wave of users. Currently, we are living the second wave after the previous bear market, which will push Solana to greater heights until seeking new points of balance. Node Analytica Transfers, addresses & fees zoom Finally, it should be noted that the spike of transfers and fees that was given at the beginning of the year. Part of Solana's ecosystem, it stands out for managing a large volume of ""speculative appetite"": memecoins. In 2025, the launch of the memoir linked to Donald Trump meant an unprecedented increase in traffic and on-chain transactions on the network, in a short space of time. This type of episodes, general volatility in the asset and in a product like SOLT must be taken into account: the impulses are strong and short as well as their effect that lacking “a fundamental value” as soon as the “fashion” passes is dissipated. However, we must not underestimate this sector, as it introduces liquidity into the global system, generates impact, and, in the long term, contributes its grain of sand to total growth. In addition, this sector is of vital importance to monitor since it is a great indicator of confirmation of soils in downward cycles and corrections in upward cycles: the continued disappearance over time of this type of volume in the blockchain, confirms practically all of the absence of appetite for speculation, typical of those moments. On the contrary, as long as there are some levels of appetite for speculation, it is one more fact that helps us to assess that we are still in a positive momentum. Node Analytica SOL on-chain transfer volume adjusted by market cap and TVL z-score To complete the current analysis, we bring you one of our metrics: On-Chain Transfer Volume Adjusted Daily. To create this indicator, we divide the volume in USD of the transactions between the difference of the market cap and the total value locked. With this, we seek to give a better context to the valuation of the asset with respect to its actual use. By dividing the total volume transacted by the really free circulating supply, we are representing how many dollars are being moved daily for each unit of dollar actually available. The ratio may rise due to increases in the LVT, increases in the volume transacted, or decreases in the price, and both variables remain constant or increase and vice versa, low. From the ground formed in July, we observed a divergence between the Z-Score and the price movement. Taking into account that, in that same period, the number of transactions and TVL fell along with the stables and the total directions increasing, it gives us a reading that the price has been pushed more by the valuation than by the real economic use. Although liquidity continues to flow in, the drop in the number of transfers may be indicative of a cooling off in blockchain activity and suggests that such capital has not yet been “deployed” via on-chain. If you look at the record, this situation has only happened once, and it was in the second stage of the rally experienced in the bull market of 2021, where after boosting close to $200, and falling back to $130, the ratio decreased while the upward momentum in the price continued. Taking into account the whole conglomerate and the rumors about the approval of the ETF and the creation of Solana treasuries companies, we can be on the cusp of a new rally driven by the inflow of liquidity from the TradFi sector and be witnessing how some speculators are already taking positions. Conclusion In short, taking advantage of Solana's fundamental on-chain moment coupled with the speculation (buy the rumor and sell the news) of the approval of ETFs and the news about the creation of Solana treasuries companies, SOLT stands for those investors looking to speculate by amplifying the cryptocurrency beta. Of course, always with active risk management. Based on the above, our recommendation is to buy tactical short-term ETF x2, looking for directional upward trends and avoiding or reducing exposure during choppy, non-trending ranges.

The total crypto market capitalisation dropped more than 9% to around $3.8 trillion, wiping out roughly $200 billion in value within hours. Bitcoin, which earlier this week hit a fresh all-time high above $126,000, was trading near $112,013 at last check, down 7.6% over the past 24 hours and 8.5% lower for the week. Ethereum fell 12.5% to $3,803, while Solana and XRP posted sharper declines of 16.5% and 14.3%, respectively. Binance’s BNB token slipped nearly 11% to $1,132, and Tether held its peg around $1.00. Record liquidations deepen the crypto market crash According to data provider Coinglass, more than $19 billion worth of leveraged crypto positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, affecting over 1.6 million traders. CoinGlass @coinglass_com · Follow The largest liquidation event in crypto history.In the past 24 hours, 1,618,240 traders were liquidated, with a total liquidation amount of $19.13 billion.The actual total is likely much higher — #Binance only reports one liquidation order per second. 5:18 am · 11 Oct 2025 227 Reply Copy link Read 14 replies Of this, $7 billion was wiped out in less than an hour on Friday, as selling pressure cascaded across exchanges. The scale of forced liquidations—caused by automatic margin calls on over-leveraged positions—may have been undercounted due to exchange reporting limits. Coinglass noted that Binance, the world’s largest exchange, only logs one liquidation order per second, potentially masking the true extent of the sell-off. Market participants said the rout began when Trump declared plans for a 100% tariff on Chinese goods and export controls on software, measures that rattled risk assets globally. Bitcoin’s fall below $115,000 triggered margin calls and a wave of automated liquidations, further accelerating the decline. Sentiment turns cautious The abrupt reversal follows a week of heightened optimism that had pushed major cryptocurrencies to record levels. Analysts said the combination of geopolitical tension, high leverage, and overheated sentiment created the perfect conditions for a sharp correction. Despite the plunge, some traders see this as a temporary shake-out. Funding rates on futures contracts have reset closer to neutral levels, and long-term holders have shown limited selling activity so far. Analysts are now watching whether Bitcoin can hold above the $110,000 support zone. A sustained breach below that level could invite further losses, while a stabilisation above it might suggest the worst of the forced selling is over. Volatility is expected to remain elevated in the coming sessions as traders digest the policy shock and await possible responses from China. For now, the market’s euphoric rally has come to an abrupt halt—brought down not by crypto’s internal flaws, but by geopolitics colliding with over-leverage.

Latest exchange data – such as Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) Confirmation Score – suggests that BTC is benefitting from strong underlying demand. CVD Confirmation Shows Strong Demand For Bitcoin According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Bitcoin’s CVD Confirmation Score – a 30-day rolling correlation between Bitcoin’s price and the CVD – is suggesting a strong resynchronization of the trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decouples From Miner Flows With -0.15 Correlation – What It Means For Price? For the uninitiated, the CVD Confirmation Score measures the 30-day correlation between Bitcoin’s price and the CVD, which tracks the net difference between taker buy and sell volumes on exchanges. A high score (above 0.7) indicates that price increases are backed by real buying pressure, while a low or negative score suggests weak or speculative momentum. Latest data from Binance shows that the CVD Confirmation Score currently hovers around 0.8 to 0.9, indicating that the current price surge is largely driven by genuine taker buying rather than a technical bounce or a short squeeze. Past data also suggests that whenever this data point has remained about 0.7 for an extended period, price corrections tend to be relatively shallow and short-lived. This is because new liquidity in the market quickly absorbs any incoming supply of BTC. The CryptoQuant analyst remarked that if the CVD Confirmation Score continues to hover above 0.7 – coupled with a decisive breakout above the $124,000 – $126,000 resistance zone – then it could be on its way to a potential target of as high as $135,000. However, any negative divergence with BTC price rising and CVD Confirmation Score dropping below 0.4 should be seen as a warning sign, as it increases the likelihood of distribution or liquidation pressure. Conversely, the $112,000 – $115,000 and $108,000 – $110,000 stand out as strong support levels for BTC. At these price levels, the CVD Confirmation Score should remain steady to ensure the uptrend remains intact. Arab Chain added: The underlying trend is bullish and supported by real inflows on Binance, the highest-volume exchange globally. Monitor three confirmation signals: CVD Confirmation stays high, open interest remains moderate, and funding does not become excessive. Any clear imbalance across these metrics will be the first warning of a momentum shift. Is BTC Due For A Correction? While bulls are hoping for an extended rally for BTC, some analysts aren’t quite convinced about the digital asset surging to new highs in the near term. For instance, crypto analyst ZVN recently stated that BTC may witness a pullback before its next surge to $150,000. Related Reading: Short-Term Holder Supply Rises By 559K Bitcoin – New Buyers Flood the Market Similarly, fellow crypto analyst Dick Dandy recently predicted that BTC may witness a massive 60% price correction, falling all the way down to $43,900.

Despite the recent volatility, bulls are showing resilience, holding price levels that suggest the broader uptrend remains intact. However, uncertainty persists as some analysts warn that a deeper correction toward lower demand zones could still occur before the next leg higher. Interestingly, onchain data provides a more optimistic signal. Metrics indicate that Bitcoin miners are not in a hurry to sell, suggesting strong conviction in the market’s long-term trajectory. This stability from miners — historically one of the largest sources of selling pressure — reflects growing confidence in the sustainability of current price levels. As the market navigates this phase of consolidation, traders are watching whether Bitcoin can reclaim $125K and establish a new base for continuation. For now, the combination of miner confidence and stable demand suggests the market is preparing for its next decisive move rather than signaling exhaustion. Bitcoin Miners Remain Strong Top onchain analyst Axel Adler shared new insights into the state of the Bitcoin mining economy through the Miner Financial Health Index — a composite metric designed to measure the financial condition of miners by accounting for hashprice, block profit, fee share, and overall cash flow. According to Adler, the index currently stands at 59%, which represents a healthy, neutral-to-bullish mining economy. This reading indicates that miners are operating in a stable environment with balanced profitability and no signs of distress. Importantly, the absence of excessive stress or euphoria suggests that miners are not under pressure to liquidate holdings, a factor that often contributes to market stability. Historically, periods when the index stays within the 50–65% range have coincided with steady price growth, as miners tend to accumulate or hold their rewards rather than selling into rallies. Adler notes that a sharp rise above 80% would mark the beginning of a distribution phase, typically associated with increased miner selling as profits peak. For now, the moderate reading highlights that the current cycle still has room for growth before reaching overheated levels. This insight aligns with other onchain indicators showing robust network activity and strong miner confidence, reinforcing the notion that Bitcoin’s recent correction remains a healthy consolidation phase rather than a sign of structural weakness. As long as miners continue to operate profitably and refrain from large-scale selling, Bitcoin’s underlying market foundation remains firm — setting the stage for potential renewed momentum once price volatility subsides. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Bulls Defend $120K Support Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $121,400, consolidating after a brief pullback from the $126,000 all-time high. The daily chart shows BTC holding above key support levels, with the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages trending upward — confirming that the broader structure remains bullish. The $120,000–$121,000 zone is emerging as a short-term support area, where buyers have stepped in to defend against further downside. A sustained move above $123,500 could open the door for a retest of $125,000, while a breakdown below $120,000 would likely expose BTC to a deeper correction toward the $117,500 level, a major horizontal support that previously acted as resistance in September. Momentum indicators suggest the market is in a cooling phase after an extended rally, allowing for potential re-accumulation before the next major move. The recent consolidation aligns with on-chain data showing miners maintaining confidence and no significant selling pressure. Bitcoin remains structurally bullish, as long as price holds above $117,500. Traders will watch for a breakout above $125,000 to confirm renewed momentum and potentially push BTC into price discovery territory once again.

His assessment is not definitive yet, but rather dependent on a specific technical condition being met. Brandt stated , “This is on my list of short candidates XRP but it is conditional upon completing the descending triangle.” The accompanying chart outlines the structure he is monitoring, showing XRP moving within a tightening range that has developed since July, when the asset hit an all-time high . The setup Brandt referred to centers on a descending triangle pattern , a formation recognized in technical analysis as a potential continuation pattern that often precedes a downward move. The pattern forms when lower highs repeatedly test a horizontal support level. In XRP’s case, the chart shows resistance descending from near $3.2 while horizontal support holds around $2.68. The price has compressed between these levels, creating a narrowing zone of trading activity. Ripple —> Certified as Sharia-Compliant by the Central Bank of Bahrain.

The upper boundary of the triangle connects several lower highs from August through early October, while the base level has been tested multiple times near $2.68743. The chart shows an 8-day and an 18-day moving average with both trending slightly downward and reflecting weakening momentum. A completed descending triangle would require a clear breakdown below the support line. If the market closes below that threshold decisively, it would validate Brandt’s condition for a potential short setup. The chart’s Average Directional Index (ADX) reading near 12.61 suggests low trend strength, indicating that the market is consolidating rather than trending. The Average True Range (ATR) also remains subdued, signaling reduced volatility during the consolidation phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Support and Breakdown Levels The current price of $2.8 sits only marginally above the key support zone. The base at $2.68743 represents the critical level traders are likely to watch for confirmation. Should this level give way, the next historical support appears around $2.22, a point noted on the chart as a prior consolidation area. Further below, a long-term reference at $1.879 may represent a deeper target if bearish pressure intensifies. Until a decisive move occurs, XRP remains confined within its converging pattern. The declining highs reinforce seller control, but buyers have managed to hold the lower boundary repeatedly, maintaining short-term equilibrium. Brandt’s comment suggests that he is not preemptively shorting but waiting for the market to confirm the setup with a definitive breakdown.

The sizable transaction, detected by on-chain tracking platforms, comes at a critical juncture for XRP, as the token struggles to maintain stability amid fluctuating market sentiment and renewed whale activity. Large-scale transfers to centralized exchanges like Bitstamp are often viewed as potential sell signals, suggesting that holders might be preparing to offload substantial amounts of their assets. This latest move, therefore, has raised eyebrows across the XRP community, with some interpreting it as a sign of impending selling pressure, while others see it as a strategic liquidity maneuver linked to institutional activity. Market data shows XRP trading within a tight consolidation range, with the altcoin having shed off 19.8% of its value in the past week to trade at $2.44 per CoinGecko data . Despite short-term uncertainty, on-chain metrics indicate consistent accumulation by long-term holders, suggesting that confidence in Ripple’s broader utility narrative remains intact. Therefore, the $42.1 million XRP transfer to Bitstamp has reignited market speculation, underscoring XRP’s unmatched liquidity and testing investor sentiment. Whether it marks strategic accumulation or large-scale distribution, one thing is certain that XRP remains a central force shaping institutional strategy and the evolving digital finance landscape. Banks to Turn to Ripple as the Fastest Route to ISO 20022 Readiness by November 2025 According to renowned crypto researcher SMQKE, global banks are increasingly positioning Ripple as their preferred path toward ISO 20022 readiness ahead of the November 2025 deadline. The upcoming transition , mandated across the global payments ecosystem, requires financial institutions to adopt a standardized, data-rich messaging format designed to enhance transparency, interoperability, and efficiency in cross-border settlements. ISO 20022 is more than a compliance update, it’s a structural transformation that compels banks to modernize outdated messaging and processing systems. As legacy infrastructure struggles to adapt to the new standard’s demands, Ripple’s blockchain-based technology is emerging as the fastest, most cost-effective alternative. By leveraging the XRP Ledger and RippleNet, institutions can streamline transactions while maintaining full regulatory alignment. As SMQKE notes, banks are under mounting pressure to achieve ISO 20022 compliance without disrupting daily operations. Ripple’s modular technology delivers a plug-and-play upgrade path that slashes costs, accelerates integration, and ensures seamless interoperability. With unmatched speed, low fees, and full transaction visibility, Ripple stands out as the most practical bridge between legacy systems and real-time, blockchain-powered settlement networks, just as the November 2025 deadline draws near. Conclusion The $42.1M XRP transfer to Bitstamp spotlights whales and institutions steering market moves. While sparking short-term sell-off speculation, it underscores XRP’s deep liquidity and strategic role in the crypto ecosystem.

The selloff drove price as low as $1.64 before a partial recovery to $2.36, with volumes surging 164% above the 30-day average — a sign of forced deleveraging across corporate desks. What to Know • XRP fell from $2.82 to $2.36 between Oct 10, 01:00 and Oct 11, 00:00, posting a 16% daily loss. • Intraday volatility peaked at 43%, with prices briefly wicking to $1.64 during high-frequency liquidation sweeps. • Institutional futures open interest dropped from $9.0B to $8.85B as long liquidations hit $21M versus $2M shorts. • 320M XRP transferred to exchange wallets in the past week, confirming whale distribution pressure. • Late-session buying stabilized price near $2.35–$2.40, with accumulation volumes exceeding 12M in the final 15 minutes. News Background • Ripple’s ecosystem faces macro and structural stress: global trade tensions, diverging central-bank policy, and uncertainty over U.S. digital banking licenses. • Ripple’s National Trust charter deadline passed on Oct 7, heightening regulatory risk premiums around XRP-linked institutional products. • Despite the drawdown, on-chain data shows long-term holders adding below $2.40, suggesting value-based repositioning. Price Action Summary • XRP opened near $2.82 and sold off aggressively by mid-session, breaching key supports at $2.70 and $2.50. • The heaviest liquidation occurred between 15:00–21:00 UTC, when hourly volume hit 817.6M. • Low of $1.64 marked potential capitulation point; bounce to $2.36 capped at resistance around $2.84. • The final 60 minutes (23:41–00:40) saw a stabilization move from $2.31 → $2.38 (+2%), with algos breaking $2.35 on sustained bids. Technical Analysis • Support: Established around $2.30–$2.35; extended downside risk to $2.22 if volume dries up. • Resistance: Layered at $2.84–$2.90, with $3.05 as macro breakout trigger. • Volume: Up 164% vs. 30-day average — capitulation-grade turnover. • Trend: 75-day symmetrical triangle broken to downside; needs close above $2.90 to regain structure. • Momentum: RSI levels near multi-month lows; volatility bands expanding, signaling potential base formation. What Traders Are Watching • Whether $2.30 support zone attracts sustained whale accumulation. • Rebuild of open interest following $150M contraction in derivatives markets. • Regulatory clarity post-Ripple charter review, and its impact on corporate adoption. • Cross-asset spillover from BTC’s $125K rally — potential relief rotation back into XRP. • Technical confirmation above $2.90 to invalidate short-term bearish bias.",Markets|XRP|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-11 05:32:37

Bitcoin’s price, for example, took one of its most painful nosedives in recent history, dumping from over $122,000 to $105,000 on some exchanges and even to as low as $101,000 on others. The altcoins were obliterated as well, with massive double-digit price drops from the majority of them. Here’s what we know so far. Valuermarket’s report classified the event as the “largest single-day liquidation in the history of digital assets.” The initial numbers of $250 million in an hour and $900 million on a 24-hour scale when BTC had dipped to $117,000 pale in comparison to what happened next. Data from CoinGlass shows a violent picture of $19.30 billion wrecked in the span of a day. Naturally, longs represent the lion’s share, with nearly $17 billion. However, the crypto market’s minor recovery attempt since then has also harmed some short traders, with $2.5 billion in such liquidations. The number of wrecked traders is off the charts as well. It typically remains around 200,000 during a bad liquidation event, but has now skyrocketed to over 1,660,000. That’s more than 1.6 million traders. Liquidation Data from CoinGlass The most obvious reason for this calamity was Trump’s actions on Friday evening when he threatened China with a new set of substantial tariffs after saying that Beijing had been lying for a long time. The losses on Hyperliquid alone account for a big portion of the entire wipe-out. After all, the single-largest liquidation occured on Hyperliquid, with over $200 million gone on a ETH-USDT pair. I counted 1010 traders that are down $100k+ today and 206 traders that are down $1M+ today on Hyperliquid 358 of those accounts lost everything and have ~0 balance, including one person who lost all $19M+ in their account pic.twitter.com/aAHFwidXIG — Conor (@jconorgrogan) October 10, 2025 Despite the majority of traders in losses, there are some that made significant profits. According to MLM, one whale closed 90% of their BTC short and fully closed their ETH short, profiting around $200 million in just a day. In case you didn’t know – the BTC whale closed 90% of his BTC short and fully closed his ETH short, making around $190–$200M profit in just one day on Hyperliquid. The crazy part is that he shorted another 9 figs worth of BTC and ETH minutes before the cascade happened.

Many altcoins briefly lost over 90% of their value. IoTeX (IOTX), in particular, briefly dropped to $0, while Cosmos (ATOM) similarly plummeted to zero. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes offered a critical assessment of the crash. He stated that market rumors suggest that the sudden drop was triggered by the automatic liquidation of collateral tied to cross-margined positions by some major centralized exchanges (CEX). ATOM fiyatında yaşanan büyük düşüşü gösteren grafik. Chart showing the decline in IOTX price. Related News: BREAKING: Stablecoin That Lost Its $1 Peg During the Big Crash Issues Statement Arthur Hayes made the following statement: “Word on the street is that many altcoins fell sharply as major CEXs automatically liquidated collateral tied to cross margin positions. Congrats to those who bought on the dip, we won't see these levels again for a long time.” According to experts, such sudden “flash crashes” are typically caused by a lack of liquidity, algorithmic trading, and the chain liquidation of leveraged positions. Hayes's statements suggest that this market crash may have been caused by an automated liquidation chain rather than a systematic error or manipulation. *This is not investment advice.

This case adds to the growing list of lawsuits that big tech companies operating in the AI space have been hit with. The proposed class action, filed on Thursday by Susana Martinez-Conde and Stephen Macknik, professors at the SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in Brooklyn, alleges that Apple used illegal shadow libraries containing thousands of copyrighted books to train its AI system . The neuroscientists say that among those works were their own titles, Champions of Illusion: The Science Behind Mind-Boggling Images and Mystifying Brain Puzzles and Sleights of Mind: What the Neuroscience of Magic Reveals About Our Everyday Deceptions. The complaint claims that Apple utilized datasets made up of pirated and copyright-infringing materials scraped from the internet, without the authors’ consent. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and an injunction to stop Apple from further using their copyrighted works. Apple’s AI push and the ‘shadow library’ problem Apple Intelligence is Apple’s suite of AI-powered features built into its devices, such as the iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The complaint notes that the day after Apple officially announced Apple Intelligence, its market value rose by more than $200 billion, “the single most lucrative day in the history of the company,” the lawsuit said. The plaintiffs allege that Apple, like other AI developers, uses shadow libraries, which are massive online repositories that store plagiarized and unauthorized copies of academic, scientific, and literary works. The claimants say that their work was used without permission. Apple has not publicly disclosed the full range of datasets used to train Apple Intelligence. The lawsuit argues that this lack of transparency masks the company’s reliance on illegally sourced data, in contrast to its marketing emphasis on user privacy and responsible innovation. AI firms face a wave of copyright challenges In early September, a group of authors filed a copyright suit against Apple, claiming that their works were used without consent to train Apple’s AI tools. The company joins a growing list of technology firms, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Anthropic, that have faced lawsuits over the unauthorized use of copyrighted content to develop generative AI systems. As Cryptopolitan reported , Anthropic itself agreed in September to pay $1.5 billion to settle a separate class action lawsuit brought by authors over the training of its chatbot Claude. AI developers claim that the process they use to train their models qualifies as fair use because it transforms the data to learn linguistic or visual patterns rather than reproducing the original works. However, authors and publishers have a different view of the matter, as they maintain that the copying involved is extensive and commercial in nature, violating their rights and undermining their creative livelihoods. High stakes for Apple and the AI industry For Apple, which entered the generative AI race later than its rivals, the lawsuit threatens its effort to position Apple Intelligence as a privacy-focused, ethically trained alternative to other chatbots, especially when the accusations are in stark contrast to what it projects itself to be. Legal experts say the outcome of these cases could change how AI systems are built and trained. A ruling against Apple or similar firms could compel companies to license copyrighted works at scale, significantly increasing development costs and potentially slowing innovation. On the other hand, a ruling favoring tech firms could entrench the fair-use precedent and limit compensation options for creators.

A New Era For Crypto In Mainstream Finance The renewed interest in stablecoins comes in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s endorsement of the sector, which has reignited discussions about integrating blockchain technology into mainstream finance. Currently, the stablecoin market is heavily dominated by Tether (USDT), based in El Salvador, which accounts for approximately $179 billion of the total $310 billion in stablecoins circulating, according to data from CoinGecko. The banks involved in this new initiative, which also includes Santander, Barclays, BNP Paribas, MUFG, TD Bank Group, and others, have stated that the goal is to assess whether a collaborative industry offering could enhance competition and bring the benefits of digital assets to the market, all while ensuring compliance.

Analyst Charts Path To $0.60 Notably, France’s Societe Generale recently became the first major bank to issue a dollar-backed stablecoin through its digital asset subsidiary, although it has seen limited adoption, with only $30.6 million currently in circulation. In addition to this consortium, a separate group of nine European banks, including prominent names like ING and UniCredit, is also in the process of launching a euro-denominated stablecoin. Meanwhile, Citi has made strides in the stablecoin space by investing in BVNK, a company focused on stablecoin infrastructure. Demand For Stablecoin Solutions Grows Although Citi has not disclosed the amount of its investment, the co-founder of BVNK, Chris Harmse, told during an interview with CNBC, that the company’s valuation has surpassed $750 million, as reported in its latest funding round. Harmse remarked on the increasing demand for stablecoin infrastructure, particularly with the emergence of regulatory clarity through the passage of the GENIUS Act in the US. This has prompted major US banks to strategically position themselves in the crypto ecosystem. Citi’s CEO, Jane Fraser, has indicated that the bank is contemplating the issuance of its own stablecoin while also exploring custodian services for digital assets. However, Citi is not alone in its pursuit of digital asset integration; JPMorgan Chase has already launched its own stablecoin-like token, JPMD.

52978492,603797,1760162459,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52978492.jpeg,Chainlink (LINK) Price Builds Momentum as Reserves Grow and Jovay Network Integration Nears,https://bitcoinist.com/chainlink-link-price-builds-momentum-reserves-grow/,"Chainlink (LINK) is grinding higher above a key pivot, trading near $22.5 with a $15.25 billion market cap and roughly $1.68B in 24-hour volume. Positioning looks constructive as open interest has edged up to $1.38 billion (+0.43%), while derivatives volume climbed 10%, a combo that typically supports continuation when spot holds support. Funding remains modestly positive, suggesting bullish bias without dangerous leverage. On-chain flows echo that tone. The Chainlink Reserve , a program that accumulates LINK using protocol revenues, added 45,729 LINK this week, lifting its balance to 463,190 LINK (about $10 million at recent prices). Jovay Network picks Chainlink for CCIP and Data Streams Fundamentals continue to expand. Jovay Network selected Chainlink CCIP as its native cross-chain communication standard from day one and adopted Chainlink Data Streams to deliver secure, low-latency market data. For developers building tokenized asset markets and institutional-grade DeFi, that means simpler interoperability and cleaner market feeds, two real-world utilities that strengthen the LINK demand flywheel (node rewards, staking, and service payments). Beyond Jovay, Chainlink remains the leading oracle and interoperability stack across major chains, with expanding partner networks and cross-chain integrations. In prior cycles, a similar cadence in enterprise integrations preceded periods of relative strength for LINK versus the broader altcoin market. Price levels to watch: Can LINK Clear $25? Technically, LINK reclaimed the $22 zone and is testing it as new support. Holding that shelf keeps a breakout toward $23.00–$23.20 in play; a decisive close above that band opens the path to the $25.60 resistance cluster. A push through $25.60 would validate a bullish continuation from the current bull-flag structure and refocus buyers on $27.8 (prior high) next. On the downside, $21.50–$21.90 is the first defense. A daily close below $21.50 risks a deeper check of $20.70–$20.00; persistent weakness could revisit $19, where demand previously re-emerged. Until those lower levels break, the mix of rising OI, healthy spot volume, and Reserve accumulation favors buy-the-dip flows over a trend reversal. With reserves growing, derivatives steady, and Jovay’s CCIP/Data Streams integration adding another real-world pillar, Chainlink’s momentum base is firming. If bulls defend $22 and flip $23–$23.2 into support, a run at $25–$25.60 looks increasingly likely.

Those remarks, focused on escalating tariff considerations against China and abandoning a potential meeting with Chinese leadership, triggered sharp sell-offs—not only in traditional markets but also across digital assets. According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP has dropped 12% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $2.44. BREAKING: TRUMP TARIFFS DESTROY THE STOCK AND CRYPTO MARKETS BITCOIN TO ZERO NOW WOW https://t.co/XMs4CL1k2c — Wendy O (@CryptoWendyO) October 10, 2025 Impact of Presidential Trade Statements The Kobeissi Letter reported that the S&P 500 fell over seventy points within seconds of the President’s statement. In the message, he signaled potential increases in tariffs on Chinese imports and stated there was “no reason” to meet President Xi. These comments were interpreted as a hardening stance on international trade. For financial markets, such language signals possible disruptions to global supply chains, increased costs for multinational firms, and reduced investor confidence in near-term economic cooperation. The result was rapid repositioning by both institutional and retail participants. Traditional markets reacted immediately, and the risk-off sentiment quickly crossed into the cryptocurrency sector. As automated systems and derivatives markets adjusted, liquidity in major digital assets tightened. XRP’s Decline in the Broader Market Context XRP’s 17% decline must be viewed against the backdrop of an overall market retreat triggered by macroeconomic uncertainty. Large-cap cryptocurrencies often mirror broader financial sentiment during sudden geopolitical escalations. In this case, capital flowed out of risk assets, with traders opting for defensive positioning rather than exposure to volatile tokens. Unlike asset-specific events such as legal developments or ecosystem changes, today’s XRP price dump was macro-driven. There was no major internal update from the XRP ecosystem ; instead, its decline aligned with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other high-liquidity tokens facing coordinated sell pressure. Amplifying the Market Response Wendy O’s reaction brought further attention to how digital asset traders are processing this event. While her commentary emphasized the severity of the drop, it is crucial to separate sentiment from structural analysis. The Kobeissi Letter provided the factual basis: an abrupt market reaction directly tied to a major political statement. Influential voices within crypto then broadcast concern, reinforcing caution across exchanges. This amplification effect contributes to accelerated volatility. Social commentary, particularly from known figures, often influences short-term decisions among retail traders, which can intensify price movements already underway due to macro catalysts. With XRP now trading at $2.32, down 17% in 24 hours, market participants are shifting their attention to forthcoming policy signals.

President Donald Trump’s retaliatory tariffs caused the market’s downturn. Of the $9.55 billion lost, about $8 billion came from long positions and $1.55 billion from shorts, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being hit the hardest. Bitcoin leads with $1.37 billion in liquidations, followed by Ethereum at $1.26 billion. HTX also handled the biggest single wipeout: $87.53 million in BTC/USDT, according to CoinGlass. President Trump called on China to change its policy by November 1 Cryptocurrency prices plummeted after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans for an additional 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, along with new software export restrictions. Nearly all cryptocurrencies plunged in two major steps after Trump warned of the new levies. Bitcoin plunged more than 12% following Trump’s Truth Social announcement, pulling back from its fresh all-time high near $125,000 to around $113,000 as of Friday morning. It even touched an intraday low just below $102,000 late Friday before recovering slightly. Now the token is changing hands at $111,327. Ravi Doshi, co-head of markets at prime broker FalconX, commented, “A renewed trade war between China and the US erupted on Friday, causing uncertainty in markets and a rout in risk assets,” adding that the firm’s derivatives team saw a surge in interest for downside hedges during the session. Trump’s decision to announce new tariffs came in response to Beijing’s latest policy change. On Thursday, China’s Ministry of Commerce said foreign exporters will need licenses for products containing more than 0.1% of rare earth materials sourced from China. Some reports suggested Trump canceled his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. However, he later indicated he’s still open to meeting and might roll back the tariff plan if Beijing reverses its policy by November 1. Should the tariffs be called off, crypto spot prices may bounce back, but the liquidations would remain final. A whale managed to profit on Hyperliquid In terms of leveraged positions, the crypto market lost over $19 billion within 24 hours. According to CoinGlass data, longs accounted for the bulk of the losses, at around $16.75 billion, while shorts incurred $2.47 billion in losses. Again, the leading losses were incurred by Bitcoin at $5.34 billion and Ethereum at $4.39 billion, with Solana contributing $2 billion, and other altcoins accounting for an additional $1.5 billion. There have been warnings from analysts that, if sentiment does not quicken sooner rather than later, this huge wave of liquidations might deepen the downturn. Tech gauges – such as RSI and MACD – across most currencies remain heavily oversold, which suggests more short-term pressure will not be far off. Despite the widespread losses, at least one major player on Hyperliquid managed to profit, taking short positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum worth hundreds of millions and earning an estimated $190 million. Crypto trader by the domain name, mlmabc, who had been tracking the whale’s movements, confirmed , “The BTC whale closed 90% of his BTC short and fully closed his ETH short, making around $190–$200M profit in just one day on Hyperliquid.

According to data from ForkLog, BTC addresses holding less than 1 BTC sent more coins into exchanges in recent days, a classic sign of first-time buyer activity. Meanwhile, large capital flows continue overtaking headlines: global crypto ETPs logged $5.67 billion in net inflows last week, pushing Bitcoin beyond $126,000. That mix – heavy institutional interest and active small-scale participants, sets the stage for a new presale designed for accessibility: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Why now is ideal for small-budget investors It’s not just about access – risk control matters. Many retail traders are wary of moving into high-cap assets when volatility spikes, and swinging from ETH to memecoins feels like guessing. Instead, newcomers are gravitating toward projects that transparently advertise tiered entry, guided onboarding, and built-in audits as trust anchors. Analysts now suggest that cycles once dominated by whales may increasingly reward projects that welcome and retain small investors, especially when combined with tight tokenomics and consistent community engagement. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale: engineered for everyone Crypto’s biggest breakthroughs rarely start with large sums – they begin with conviction and timing. MAGACOIN FINANCE is redefining what’s possible for investors with small budgets, offering a clear and measurable growth path. At its $0.00051213 presale price and $0.007 target listing , the project embeds a 13.6× built-in upside that even first-time buyers can calculate instantly. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its transparency. Audits by CertiK and HashEx have confirmed its credibility, while its community-led marketing and patriotic brand identity keep engagement authentic and relatable. The presale’s rapid sellouts reflect more than hype, they represent a cultural shift, where retail traders are learning that discipline and timing often outperform speculation. For investors who missed DOGE or SHIB early, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides a chance to join a structured movement with both heart and strategy, proof that in crypto, starting small can still mean thinking big. Support, education, and clarity as retention tools What helps small-budget investors stay in, and keep participating, is support. MAGACOIN FINANCE emphasizes this by providing shared tutorials, live Q&A, and community feedback loops to address doubts early. Many projects leave newcomers to fend for themselves, but this one operationalizes mentorship. The presale interface is intuitive, starting with wallet setup, gas estimation, and allocation transparency, so first-time participants don’t feel like they’ve jumped into the deep end without a lifeline. Momentum builds confidence for new participants Beyond structure and support, momentum plays a psychological role. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s referral programs, community contests, and milestone reveals help amplify excitement while keeping it grounded in real metrics. Each new user who participates becomes a micro-ambassador, imaging what “small-budget early entry” truly means. As larger investors and institutions hold back in consolidation phases, these grassroots-driven narratives often become the breakout story, and they tend to attract waves of fresh capital. Bridging retail access with cycle timing While institutional flows dominate headlines, the next phase of growth often comes when the bigger players step back and leave room for retail-driven discovery. MAGACOIN FINANCE enters exactly at that pivot: many projects now are already too expensive or overextended. With $16+ already raised, verified audits, and accessible entry mechanics, it provides an opportunity for new participants to join before the narrative gets crowded. Crypto cycles reward those who enter with structure, not chaos. For small-budget investors ready to take the first step, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers clarity, community, and real upside, with the kind of door open access rarely seen in presale stages.

The ruling represents one of the biggest patent verdicts against the South Korean tech conglomerate in recent years. The jury ruled that Samsung’s Galaxy phones, laptops, and other wireless products employed technology that infringed on four patents owned by Collision Communications. The verdict came following a four-and-a-half-day trial and two hours of jury deliberation. The case was presided over by U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap at the Eastern District of Texas, a court known for handling major patent battles. Jury rules Samsung copied Collision’s network technology Collision said Samsung devices used its technology without permission or payment for the rights to use it. The company stated that Samsung has become very popular by utilizing technology that did not belong to it. At the same time, Collision struggled for years to bring that same technology to market independently. The jury reviewed evidence from Samsung’s own emails and technical documents that showed Samsung had known about Collision’s patents long before the lawsuit. Both companies discussed possible business partnerships and licensing deals for the patented technology between 2011 and 2014. Witnesses testified that the tech heavyweight’s engineers and managers clearly understood the value of the technology and even praised its ability to reduce interference and improve data speeds. These features could make Samsung’s products more competitive, but the firm walked away from the discussions without signing any agreement or paying for the technology. The company continued to release devices that used the same patented systems. The jury awarded $445,484,160 in damages to Collision Communications. It imposed a running royalty, meaning Samsung would be liable for additional payments in the future if it continues to sell phones, laptops, or other devices that utilize the same technology. Small U.S. firm wins major case after years of legal battle Collision Communications spent more than ten years fighting to protect its inventions from Samsung Electronics. Lead attorney Brad Caldwell from Caldwell Cassady & Curry in Dallas said the victory represented recognition and respect for honest, hard work. He explained that the founders of Collision had invested not only their time but also a significant portion of their savings and energy in developing their technology and keeping it alive through years of challenges. Caldwell described the trial as among the most challenging his team had worked on, devoting much of its effort to simplifying some complex concepts about how wireless signals are transmitted between wireless phones, cellphone towers, and routers, so that jurors could understand them. His team worked for months to write clear explanations that would make the science easy to understand. Samsung’s attorneys, Victoria F. Maroulis and Sean Pak of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, denied the allegations and contended that the patents were invalid. They said the smartphone manufacturer’s own engineers had independently developed their versions of the technology and had not copied Collision’s work. The jury found that the tech firm committed willful infringement because it was aware of the inventions but proceeded to use them anyway. Samsung and its lawyers have not yet publicly commented on the case, although they could still appeal the decision. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Ripple’s XRP didn’t go unscathed. In fact, it was one of the altcoins that painted massive red wicks, dropping to as low as $1.2 on the Binance perpetual contracts charts. That’s a 60% drawdown, which, not surprisingly, had a lot of traders liquidated. So much so that, in fact, almost $1 billion worth of leveraged positions were wiped out in the past 24 hours. Why is the XRP Price Going Down? While reasons remain unclear and speculative at best, the fact is that the total cryptocurrency market went through arguably its worst crash in years. As CryptoPotato reported , close to $20 billion worth of leveraged positions were liquidated in the past hours, as Bitcoin’s price dropped from more than $122,000 to $105,000 on some crypto exchanges. Naturally, and as it’s almost always the case, altcoins had it worst. Believe it or not, XRP wasn’t even amongst the worst performers. ATOM, for instance, saw close to 99% of its spot value deleted before bouncing back. XRP also bounced back and is currently trading at around $2.4 on Binance. Source: TradingView There is no specific reason that’s isolated to XRP relating to this market crash and its decline is likely attributed to the broader wipeout in the industry. However, the event highlights the dangers of leverage and, once again, shows how much more volatile altcoins are and how much thinner their trading order books are as opposed to Bitcoin’s.

CONY: Why Leverage Outperforms Covered Calls In Coinbase ETFs,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829242-coiw-vs-cony-why-leverage-outperforms-covered-calls-in-coinbase-etfs?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary Bitcoin’s long-term bullish outlook supports leveraged income ETFs like Roundhill COIN WeeklyPay ETF over covered-call strategies such as YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF. COIW benefits from active leverage management, balancing risk and upside capture better than CONY. CONY underperforms in flat or volatile markets, offering limited drawdown protection and weak upside participation. Overall, COIW is a Hold with better risk-reward; CONY is downgraded to Sell. As I look at Coinbase and its two different income generating wrapper ETFs, let me summarize my findings across my analyses on income plans and cryptocurrencies so far. My previous analyses in the bitcoin space and option based income plans have mostly concluded thus. One, bitcoin is going through a structurally supportive phase (therefore read bullish). Two, leveraged income strategies are better than covered call option based strategies in most cases - they are simpler and perform in the long run. The only thing they need is a long term bullish thesis on the underlying. And three, those option based income plans do better, that either save drawdowns significantly or capture upsides better - usually option ETFs do either of these well, not both, and they should be used tactically for their strengths. Some option strategies do neither, and needless to say are best avoided. In the crypto space, a spate of supportive legislations like the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts could bring in required transparency as increased crypto adoption drives demand. Recent news around funding for Strategic Bitcoin Reserve ( SBR ) starting anytime soon, for example, lends support to wider institutional recognition of bitcoin as a strategic asset, including state entities. A leveraged asset like the Roundhill COIN WeeklyPay ETF ( COIW ) needs to have a bull thesis on the underlying Coinbase in the long term to work out. Bitcoins do look like meeting that long term bullish thesis criteria. How about Coinbase? The Underlying Thesis - Coinbase In my last article about the option income ETF based on Coinbase - the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) - I have taken a cautiously bullish stance on Coinbase. That still holds. On the positive side, I like Coinbase's strategic positioning through the Deribit acquisition, making Coinbase one of the leading derivatives players in the crypto space. USDC based payments enablement and integration with Shopify and Stripe move Coinbase into payments infrastructure - more revenue diversification. The structurally supportive crypto ETF inflows also support long term crypto led growth for Coinbase. I ended up with a tactical Hold rating because of Coinbase's high beta, volatility, valuation concerns, and momentum-driven nature. Long term investors in COIW will need a bullish long term thesis in COIN. Unfortunately, the crypto space is still maturing, and a long term thesis is not really as foolproof as, say, in big tech. However, bitcoin is bullish long term. COIN should mature and stabilize along with that growth and expect no regulatory or competitive threats over the next few years. So, I would still position COIN as a cautious Buy - or Hold tactically for medium term investors. CONY's Stronghold In my earlier CONY analysis, I have shown how CONY is not the greatest option income performer even in what can be called flat markets end to end - this is because such flat markets for Coinbase are often extremely volatile, wherein CONY manages to lose several percentage points (9-10 percentage points) even when COIN is relatively flat at 2% on a close to close basis. The data below shows a flat period over a year, with upsides of up to ~80% in between. Data by YCharts The reason why CONY fails to do well in such prolonged and volatile but flat markets on a closing basis is the volatility and its inability to catch up with sharp upsides in COIN. In the below chart, we can see CONY's total returns are less than half of what has been a sharp rally in Coinbase. And this is expected - some option income ETFs write calls on smaller parts of the portfolio and capture upsides better through active management, not CONY. Data by YCharts But does CONY's upside underperformance get compensated on drawdowns? It does. For a prolonged drawdown period between December 2024 to April 2025, CONY saves 4-5 percentage points in total returns than COIN. However, the drawdown mitigation is not even close to the kind of opportunity loss we see on upsides. The net result is that CONY suffers even in flat markets - tracing almost all of the drawdown but capturing less than half of any upside run. Data by YCharts Scenarios and Why Leverage is Better CONY's apparently underlying-agonistic strategy does promise alpha and income even if the underlying does not move or undergoes mild corrections, in theory - however we have seen how that is not the case in real market conditions. CONY seems to need a bull thesis as much as the perceived underlying dependency of a straightforward strategy like COIW's, where a 20% leverage is applied on weekly returns. Before we move on to scenarios, I want to clarify that a 20% leverage is more conservative than it sounds. If say Coinbase crashes by 10% in two consecutive weeks, the total drawdown is 19% at the end of two weeks. COIW will be down by 12% each week i.e. 22.56% down in the same period. Now 22.56% is only 18.7% of the 19% drawdown in Coinbase cumulatively (not 20% as may seem apparent). This impact magnifies as we continue to compound returns or drawdowns over weeks. Now, even ignoring that more conservative than the headline 20% leverage, I have constructed three scenarios and compared COIW and CONY. Scenario 1: Coinbase corrects by 50% in 6 months - Here expect CONY to be down by ~45% as we have seen before. COIW will be down by 60% (assuming no compounding effect, while in reality the true drawdown should be closer to 55%). CONY definitely works in this scenario, but the gap with COIW is not huge. Scenario 2: Coinbase remains flat for 6 months - We have seen that unless Coinbase's volatility subsides, CONY is likely to be down by 5-10%. COIW should be flat. So even in neutral circumstances, COIW seems a better proposition than CONY's covered call mechanism. Scenario 3: Coinbase rallies by 50% in 6 months - CONY captures 25-30% of this rally at best. COIW rallies 55-60%. The difference here is much more material than the risks on the downside. Get a Bull Thesis Anyway and Choose COIW After looking at the scenarios, it should be clear that unless a call writing strategy is efficient and active, or the underlying optimally volatile (unlike in the case of Coinbase, where volatility is almost too high), it is better to rely on the underlying's bull thesis than on the option mechanics to generate income irrespective of the underlying moves. If there is a bull thesis, then a moderately leveraged income plan works out better - the performance differential is material in flat and rallying conditions. On the other hand, the leveraged plan surely underperforms the option plan on drawdowns, but the margins are thinner compared to the other two scenarios. For a bullish Coinbase thesis, I would conclude the following. I would recommend a Buy for the direct Coinbase stock and encourage a DIY style payout over time. This avoids the pitfalls of leverage and balances the risk reward best. Since, I am actually Hold to cautious Buy on Coinbase in the medium term, conscious of valuations and volatility, I would recommend a Hold on COIW - it carries its risks although it balances them well with rewards on rallies. The Hold rating looks reasonable particularly because I am not bearish on Coinbase. The rating that needs correction in the light of this thesis on COIN and COIW, is CONY's. I have rated it Hold thus far because of tactical use cases in drawdowns. But that use case also yields hardly a few percentage points at best. I think, to align ratings meaningfully, I will need to downgrade CONY from a Hold to Sell. COIW is a Hold and a better bet given its risk reward profile and a mildly bullish underlying thesis. CONY's performance neither captures upside, nor adds meaningful drawdown benefits. It even stutters in flat markets. COIW's Performance and Yields versus CONY Although I would expect COIW's leverage to show up at around ~15% due to compounding, actual performance shows COIW tracing COIN through both bullish and bearish market conditions. That implies the leverage is being actively managed, most likely no leverage most of the times. That gives me greater confidence in COIW by removing the constant 20% leverage overhang and risks thereof, although COIW retains the ability to employ the full 20% leverage in conducive markets. Data by YCharts The other thing I like about COIW is its more conservative yield compared to CONY. COIW has paid out ~$18 in 32 weeks. That translates to an annualized yield of ~$29.5 i.e. ~63%. This is still aggressive and comes with NAV erosion concerns too, but is much lesser than the CONY's $10.25 payout in the past year, that translates to a yield of 133% of current prices. COIW does stand a chance of maintaining its NAV in bullish conditions in comparison to CONY, whose NAV erosion appears to be irrespective of market conditions because of the very high yields. It also helps that despite the leverage, COIW's expense ratio is 0.99%, compared to CONY's 1.22%. This may, of course, increase in the future as COIW starts employing higher leverage compared to today's levels. All in all, COIW outdoes CONY in most market conditions. Its active leverage management means the downside is not drastically worse than CONY's. I would recommend COIW to any investor who has a bullish thesis on COIN. I will keep it a Hold because its leverage risks and also because COIN has a few pressures on its otherwise bullish thesis - i.e. valuations and volatility. But in most market conditions, it has better credentials than CONY, which I downgrade to a Sell.",COIN|COIW|CONY,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-11 06:56:17

Several altcoins have crashed between 20% to 40% as the market recoiled. Naturally, bulls may be wondering whether the recovery could be swift or take time. Understanding the process that follows a crash like this suggests the recovery is likely to be gradual, testing the patience of bullish investors. ""When the market turns like this, there’s usually a pretty straightforward playbook for the aftermath,"" Zaheer Ebtikar, chief investment officer and founder of Split Capital, said on X. Here's what a typical sequence looks like: Market bleeds and market makers pause The initial phase involves the market ""bleeding out"" or tanking deeper as liquidation orders flood exchanges, pushing prices lower. We saw that happen overnight as several altcoins, including XRP, DOGE, and others, crashed to multi-month lows. Amid this, market makers, the entities responsible for providing liquidity and ensuring orderly trading, usually step back temporarily to manage their risk and focus on ""refilling by first taking out big spot and perp abrs on assets,"" as Ebtikar noted. It means they address price mismatches between spot and futures markets with arbitrage plays involving opposing positions in the two markets. This process prevents an immediate rebound. Data feeds stabilize This phase refers to the period after a market crash, when information channels that traders and market makers rely on begin to work reliably again. During the crash, exchanges and the tech systems providing real-time updates, order book data, and order executions often see delays or outages due to high volatility. Once the data feed stabilizes, market makers and large traders start absorbing major sell orders to restore market equilibrium. These participants capitalize on liquidation orders, which receive priority in order books and facilitate bargain hunting. Given the sheer size of the forced liquidations observed overnight, this absorption phase can span several days. Market stabilization This stage involves dealers and market makers closing out their long positions, which they initially acquired at bargain prices while absorbing liquidation orders, to profit from a potential rebound. ""Once dealers fill long they will start unwinding spot and perp when the market is back to equilibrium. This is when the market hits a local maxima and the Dalai Lama chart starts hitting. Some assets that have tighter supply will look better than others,"" Ebtikar said. This process is usually slow, especially over the weekend when the spot ETF's don't operate, reducing the overall market liquidity. This lower liquidity makes it harder and slower for dealers to unwind large positions without causing big price moves, so unwinding tends to slow down during these periods. Market finds a floor Eventually, the market finds a floor, settling into a more stable range, and investor confidence dented by the crash begins to rebuild. To conclude, the large liquidations observed overnight will likely prolong the multi-step bottoming process, involving strategic buying of liquidation orders by market makers, liquidity challenges over the weekend, and new price anchoring. All this being said, if the headline risk — continued U.S. - China trade tensions — doesn't subside, all bets are off as to when this will end.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|XRP|Solana|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|XRP|BTC|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-11 06:57:56

Vladimir Chistyukhin, the First Deputy Chairman of the Bank of Russia, highlighted that this cautious approach aims to prevent commercial banks from making cryptocurrency trading their primary focus. New Role Of Banks In Crypto Assets Chistyukhin emphasized the need for strict capital and reserve standards, asserting that while excluding banks from cryptocurrency transactions would be unjustified, it is essential to maintain conservative views on the banking sector’s involvement with digital assets. In his statement, Chistyukhin asserted: We hold conservative views and think about how appropriate it is for the banking sector to include cryptocurrency in its assets. After discussion with the professional banking community, we came to the conclusion that excluding banks from such operations would be unjustified. To mitigate risks associated with money laundering and terrorism financing, all transactions involving digital assets will be subject to existing anti-money laundering (AML) regulations . Chistyukhin noted the importance of transparency in these transactions, stressing that all parties involved must be adequately identified and that the sources of funds must be clear. This regulatory framework aims to ensure that banks, brokers, and exchanges are held accountable for monitoring illegal transactions, with strict penalties for those who fail to comply. Chistyukhin added: The international community and the Russian professional community have become very clear that crypto assets have an increased risk associated with money laundering and the financing of terrorism. We believe that all anti-money laundering mechanisms should also apply to investing in crypto assets. Bank Of Russia To Conduct Major Digital Asset Audit In a related development, the Bank of Russia is planning a comprehensive audit of the nation’s cryptocurrency holdings and activities, set to take place in early 2026. As reported by Bitcoinist earlier this week, this audit will assess investments in digital assets by regulated financial institutions and investigate any lending or financing associated with crypto businesses. The central bank intends to cross-reference data from various sources, including miners, exchanges, and the Federal Tax Service, to identify discrepancies between reported activities and actual transactions. But while Russia continues to develop its regulatory landscape for digital assets, a divide has emerged among government agencies. While some ministries advocate for clearer regulations and taxation for crypto operations, the central bank appears to favor a more cautious approach, prioritizing financial stability over rapid integration.

But in a video shared on his X account, he argued that this event also carries a deeper meaning for XRP holders. Linking the new liquidity injection to a symbolic message from Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, he suggested that the timing is not a coincidence. Ripple Bull Winkle pointed to Schwartz’s past decisions as a source of guidance for investors. He recalled how Schwartz once sold 40,000 ETH at $1 each to fund the installation of solar panels on a house he no longer owns. That amount of Ethereum would have been worth over $100 million later on, yet according to Bull Winkle, the real takeaway is not regret. David Schwartz’s SECRET MESSAGE TO #XRP HOLDERS pic.twitter.com/MYX3hrb5qQ — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 10, 2025 Learning from David Schwartz Bull Winkle emphasized that Schwartz’s story serves as a warning, not a mistake. “He’s telling us XRP holders, do not sell too soon ,” he said, describing the experience as a cautionary example against early exits during critical turning points. He added that the community should “hold strong” as he believes the asset’s pivotal moment is approaching. This perspective comes at a time when market activity is intensifying and XRP continues to attract speculation about its next move. Bull Winkle connected Tether’s large-scale minting with what he views as early signals of a major financial shift . “Tether’s the smoke. Bitcoin is your distraction,” he declared, adding that “XRP, it’s the bridge.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz’s Departure and Renewed Confidence in XRP The comments gained greater significance in light of Schwartz’s recent announcement that he will step down as Ripple’s CTO at the end of the year. For many within the XRP community, this development represents a defining moment. After years of contributing to the design and development of Ripple’s core technologies, his upcoming exit is seen by supporters as the completion of a long-term mission . With Schwartz preparing to depart, Bull Winkle’s interpretation of his past remarks has taken on new urgency. While the broader market remains focused on Bitcoin’s potential rally, Bull Winkle’s message aims to redirect attention to XRP’s position in the next phase of digital finance. He views Schwartz’s experience as a message of patience to the XRP community, and those who listen might profit significantly when XRP starts to climb.

The Cardano community has likened the Ethereum Foundation’s new privacy-focused initiatives to the Midnight network associated with the Cardano ecosystem. The Ethereum Foundation previously announced the expansion of its privacy efforts. The statement announced the creation of a new “privacy cluster,” comprised of 47 researchers, engineers, and cryptography experts. This cluster encompasses various subprojects, including Secret Read and Write, Secret Proof, Hidden Identities, Privacy Experience, the Enterprise Privacy Task Force (IPTF), and Kohaku. The foundation's statement aims to enable users to conduct private payments, voting, and transactions without the risk of surveillance or data leaks. It also includes projects like zkID (zero-knowledge identity), which will prevent unnecessary information sharing during identity verification processes. Related News: Binance Founder CZ Speaks Live: This Altcoin's Price Skyrocketed The Ethereum Foundation made the following statement regarding these studies: “Privacy deserves to be a top-notch feature of the Ethereum ecosystem. We are committed to making this vision a reality for both individuals and institutions.” However, the Cardano community likened the announcement to the Midnight Network, which Cardano has been developing for a long time. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson also joined the discussion, making a direct reference to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin: “Sorry Vitalik Buterin, some things you can't copy. Midnight was built for the fourth generation, and adapting Ethereum's first layer (L1) to it is not possible without fundamentally changing its tokenomics.” Midnight in the Cardano ecosystem is described as a network that stands out with its “secret smart contract” architecture, aiming for a structure that is compliant with regulations while protecting data privacy. *This is not investment advice.

Demand from institutional investors for ETFs is increasing, and macroeconomic fundamentals are in favor of coins, with overall crypto market capitalization going above $4.2 trillion. Conversely, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an Ethereum-based DeFi protocol that is becoming popular as one of the top investments below $1. Already in Phase 6 presale, MUTM has a price of $0.035, with more than 60% of the phase tokens in this phase already sold out. A total of more than $17.1 million in the presale has been raised so far, with estimates placing the return at a value of 20x. Mutuum Finance provides a two-layer lending protocol with peer-to-contract (P2C) pools of accessible assets and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending for meme tokens. It aims to deliver diversified streams of profits to users. Mutuum Finance favors diversification of profit streams in the crypto space. Bitcoin (BTC) Maintains Bullish Bias Above $122,000 As the crypto space is stabilizing, Bitcoin (BTC) has risen once again above $122,000, which shows strong institutional demand and a healthy on-chain setup. Coinbase Premium Index is still in positive territory, which suggests that professionals are still accumulating even during price consolidation. Spot Taker CVD is still aggressive accumulation, and moderately positive funding rates suggest well-contained optimism. NVT Golden Cross has recovered +38%, and on-chain indicators are in favor of real utility rather than speculation. Institutions are leading and retail is following, and BTC is poised for its next leg up with prudent hands on the wheel. Mutuum Finance Presale Soaring as Investor Appetite Hits ATH Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going full steam ahead, having already raised over $17.1 million in Phase 6 of presale and having gained 16,840 individual holders. Over 60% of Phase 6 has already been sold, presenting investors with a relatively brief timeframe in which to sign up before the phase comes to close. Early bird investors are setting themselves up for potentially huge paydays when MUTM reaches the open market. Mutuum Finance protocol relies on a close-order book architecture for market risk management and illiquidity protection. Central components like close-level conditions, liquidation levels, and liquidator incentives are highly precisely dynamically adjusted to allow safe and reliable lending. The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and liquidation parameters dynamically adjust in relation to asset volatility, with more risky assets being treated in a stricter loan condition. Further, risk-weighted multipliers are applied across asset classes for stability, security, and resilience, even under stressed market conditions. Mutuum Finance Prepares Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance is preparing to roll out its lending and borrowing protocol , Version 1, on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025. The protocol will include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be supported on day one for lending, borrowing, and collateralization, creating a multi-purpose, easy-to-use DeFi platform with a focus on convenience, security, and simplicity. Leading Sub-$1 Crypto While Bitcoin Reaches $122K With Bitcoin (BTC) surging past $122,000 and institutional demand on the rise, investors are also looking at growth assets, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading the charge. It’s only at $0.035 in Stage 6 of its presale, yet the project already has raised over $17.1 million from 16,840+ purchasers with 60% of the tokens sold out. Leveraging the Ethereum platform, Mutuum’s two-tier lending protocol leverages peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) configurations to create hedged yield. With risk-weighted collaterals and adjustable LTV percentages, along with forthcoming Q4 2025 lending protocol, Mutuum is one of the top DeFi plays. For investors seeking the next break-out sub-$1, Mutuum Finance is the best buy as Bitcoin pushes on towards mastery.

While many felt the pain of being liquidated, others seem to profit. In the span of just 12 hours or so, the entire market went from a capitalization worth $4.120 trillion on TradingView to $3.3 trillion, which meant a wipe-out of almost $900 billion. This pushed the metric down to its lowest levels since July, erasing months of gains, before it recovered to $3.670 trillion as of press time. Crypto Market Cap. Source: TradingView What We Know Whenever such crashes occur, the cryptocurrency community rushes to offer different views on the matter, trying to explain what happened and provide some insights on what might follow. The current collapse is no different, as Crypto X is full of various opinions and speculations on the matter, especially since it became the single-largest liquidation event in the digital asset market. The most talked-about reason is, surprise, surprise, US President Donald Trump. In what felt like a deja vu, the POTUS alleged China of deception in certain areas and threatened to impose a new set of tariffs on Friday, which triggered the first wave of market-wide declines. He made it official a few hours later, confirming that these tariffs will begin on November 1. The Kobeissi Letter, though, indicated that markets were “LOOKING” for a good reason to correct, given the massive amount of leverage, especially in crypto. The blatant reality: Heading into President Trump’s 100% China tariff announcement, markets were LOOKING for a catalyst to pull back on. Leverage was through the roof and we had not seen a 2%+ decline in the S&P 500 for 6 months. President Trump’s post became THE REASON to… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) October 11, 2025 Bull Theory alleged that one of Bitcoin’s oldest wallets might have known what was about to happen as they opened big short positions on BTC and ETH a day before the announcement and doubled down as events started to unfold. They closed all shorts with a profit of roughly $200 million in just a day. Bull Theory added that this wasn’t a retail-driven dump, as it has been on some occasions in the past. Instead, they noted that it “felt structural, as if a fund or a desk was forced to unwind positions all at once.” What’s Next? Naturally, after trying to explain what happened, the next step is to offer a prediction of what’s to come. The majority of the crypto community seemed adamant that this is a proper buy-the-dip moment, as similar crashes are typically followed by large moves in the opposite direction. “So yes, the headlines scream Market Crash. But zoom out the structure didn’t break. It just reset. The whales already took their entry. Retail panic is peaking. And history says, that’s exactly when the next leg begins,” said Bull Theory. CZ concurred, indicating that this could be the next “COVID crash,” when BTC dumped to $4,000 but exploded in the following months. https://t.co/4O6i3MsfIA — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 11, 2025 However, Crypto Bully outlined a different projection, which is a lot more painful if Trump proceeds with the tariffs: “- Unless Trump changes his statements immediately on Monday, this will not be a V reversal. Most alts with 50-70% wicks will bleed down and fill them or partially fill it before reversal.” Different Perspective While most are focused on price drops, reasoning, and future behavior, Cobie highlighted a different perspective on the situation. The popular X user believes such collapses are a perfect example of why investors should avoid taking leveraged positions, as they can wipe out years of gains. Instead, they need to focus on building a long-term portfolio by holding only assets that they are bullish on and believe in. This means steer clear of speculative tokens that only chase hype without actual utility. “When everyone is making hilarious amounts of money I am always tempted to start using leverage again. It is almost impossible to fight the feeling that you’re not making enough, or everyone else is outpacing you. Good reminder that fighting that feeling and avoid the wipeouts is worth it in the end. Don’t let a leverage blowup dictate your long-term views. The future is bright, good things to come, patience is rewarded.” The post Crypto Market’s Massive Meltdown: What We Know and What’s Next appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Top News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|BTC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-11 07:43:29

This bearish pressure started when rumors of a trade war between the United States and China emerged in the early hours of Friday. The downward pressure intensified after US President Donald Trump declared that the US would impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods. As a result of this announcement, over $5.5 billion was liquidated from the crypto market in less than an hour, with the Bitcoin price briefly falling to as low as $101,500. Is This BTC Whale Linked To The US Government? In a recent post on X, on-chain analyst Maartunn highlighted a specific Satoshi-era Bitcoin investor who might have expected this downturn way before it happened. A look at the trader’s market moves suggests that the large BTC holder almost always knows something the market doesn’t. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Are Back: Three Indicators Suggest A Run Toward $130,000 While the price of Bitcoin steadily dropped towards $117,00 during the day, blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that this Bitcoin OG kept piling up their short positions up to $1.1 billion. Following the BTC crash below $110,000, this large investor made a profit of over $160 million, leading to speculations about them having insider information. Maartunn went further to highlight the large holder’s activities in the past few months. According to the analyst’s post on the social media platform X, this Bitcoin OG started selling part of their 86,000 Satoshi-era BTC stash when prices peaked around August 2025. Similarly, the BTC whale took to shaving off their holdings again when the Bitcoin price ran up to new highs in early October. What’s more interesting is that the Satoshi-era investor soon opened leveraged short positions on both Bitcoin and Ethereum on the Hyperliquid platform. Maartunn thought that the timing of these trades might be interesting, especially as the general crypto market soon witnessed a downturn due to President Trump’s tariff announcement. The on-chain analyst then concluded that the “Satoshi-era OG have insider ties to the US government.” Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $113,250, recovering swiftly from the plunge to around $101,500. However, the premier cryptocurrency is still down by nearly 7% in the past 24 hours.

52980555,603447,1760169604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52980555.jpeg,"Dogecoin Adoption: Holders Cross 8.1 Million, Ahead Of XRP & ADA",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-adoption-cross-8-1-million-ahead-xrp-ada/,"On-chain data shows Dogecoin holders have broken the 8.1 million milestone. Here’s how other cryptocurrencies like XRP and Cardano compare. Dogecoin Holder Count Above Other Altcoins, But Still Below Bitcoin & Ethereum In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared about how the various coins in the cryptocurrency sector currently compare in terms of the Total Amount of Holders . The Total Amount of Holders is an indicator that measures, as its name suggests, the total number of wallets carrying some non-zero balance on a given network. When the value of this metric rises, it means new investors are joining the blockchain and/or old ones who had sold earlier are investing back into the asset. Existing users creating new wallets to distribute their holdings also contribute to the trend. In general, all of these factors can be assumed to be at play at once to some degree, so some net adoption of the asset can be considered to have occurred whenever the Total Amount of Holders goes up. On the other hand, the indicator witnessing a decline implies some investors may have decided to exit from the cryptocurrency, so they are clearing out their wallets. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Total Amount of Holders for some of the top assets in the sector: As is visible in the above graph, the Total Amount of Holders has generally gone up in the cryptocurrency sector during the past year, indicating that new investors have been coming in. Many coins have shown a steady growth rate, but the trend has fluctuated for others. Dogecoin saw some explosive growth earlier in 2025, but the memecoin’s adoption has since taken a slow approach. Today, the Dogecoin network hosts around 8.1 million users. This is more than XRP (7.1 million), Cardano (4.5 million), USDC (4 million), and Chainlink (802,500). DOGE being above XRP in particular is interesting, as the latter’s market cap is more than four times the former’s, showcasing the reach that the memecoin has among retail traders . Ethereum has continued to dominate the list with over 160 million holders, far ahead of Bitcoin with its 56.9 million count. USDT rounds out the top three with a metric value of 8.9 million. Historically, adoption is something that has been constructive for any cryptocurrency network, as a wider userbase means a more solid foundation for future price moves to grow on. In this view, the uptrend in the Total Amount of Holders among Dogecoin and other assets can be a positive signal. DOGE Price While Dogecoin is continuing to attract retail users, its price has struggled recently, being down around 18% from its September high to $0.25.",Dogecoin|ADA|Cardano|Doge|dogecoin|dogecoin adoption|Dogecoin holders|XRP|XRP holders,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|ADA|XRP|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-11 08:00:04

The clip featured entrepreneur and host Patrick Bet-David speaking with two guests about outdated financial systems, the limitations of traditional money transfers, and how technology, such as XRP, could transform global transactions. Patrick Bet-David just dropped a bomb! The world deserves a faster, cheaper, smarter payment system. SWIFT is outdated $XRP is the evolution. Ripple’s tech moves money instantly across borders with record-breaking efficiency and a fraction of the cost. pic.twitter.com/G4ZpdIVk0o — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 9, 2025 Examining the Old System During the discussion, Bet-David referenced the differences between the Automated Clearing House (ACH) and traditional wire transfers. He noted the irony that ACH, a newer system, operates more slowly than wire transfers, leading to a broader question about inefficiencies in global banking infrastructure and setting the tone for a conversation about the need for modernization. One of his guests explained the operational limits of the SWIFT system, calling it “a very antiquated system ” and emphasizing that it functions primarily as a messaging platform between banks rather than a tool that actually moves money. He added that transferring large sums internationally remains a slow and costly process, a gap that blockchain-based solutions are now attempting to fill. XRP’s Growing Appeal for International Payments Bet-David then shifted the discussion toward Ripple and XRP, acknowledging the increase in investment interest around the asset. “And you saw how much money was put into Ripple just in the last couple of days,” he said, describing it as a “record-breaking” period for the company and its native token. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He continued by linking that momentum to a broader industry conversation about which technology could ultimately replace SWIFT . Bet-David mentioned that he and his co-host recently met with an individual involved with another blockchain project, highlighting how the competition to modernize financial networks is expanding. Still, the core of his point centered on XRP’s reputation as a faster and cheaper system for international transactions. Industry Consensus Shifting Toward XRP Throughout the exchange, Bet-David emphasized that growing numbers of investors and professionals share the belief that systems like Ripple’s could eventually become the foundation for more efficient financial transactions. The discussion backed XRP’s ability to facilitate instant settlements across borders at a fraction of the cost of legacy systems. As more financial institutions explore digital alternatives to traditional banking infrastructure, conversations like Bet-David’s highlight both the limitations of the current model and the promise of innovation through blockchain solutions.

Most of the selling bias was triggered as BTC got rejected near $124,500, where a bearish engulfing candle on the daily chart confirmed heavy profit-taking and a potential short-term trend shift. The move coincided with broader macro jitters, driving the Crypto Fear and Greed Index down to 35 (Fear), its lowest in over a month. This drop mirrors the risk reset across global markets, with the total crypto market cap slipping to $3.7 trillion and 24-hour trading volumes nearing $497 billion. Crypto Enters Risk-Off Territory The latest downturn underscores how Bitcoin remains closely tied to broader market sentiment. Correlation with U.S. equities climbed again this week as risk assets sold off amid renewed trade and inflation concerns. Bitcoin: $110,705, down 8.59% in 24h Ethereum: $3,764, down 12.94% BNB: $1,092, down 13.6% Solana: $183, down 16.3% XRP: $2.41, down 14.0% The Altcoin Season Index dipped to 37, confirming a renewed shift toward Bitcoin dominance. At the same time, the CoinMarketCap 20 Index, tracking major tokens, slid 10.5% to 235.1, highlighting broad selling pressure across the sector. CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index – Source: Coinmarketcap Investor psychology has also turned defensive. Historical Fear and Greed data shows sentiment has deteriorated from neutral (54) last week to fear (35) now, the steepest weekly decline since March. BTC/USD Bearish Butterfly Pattern Played – Source: Tradingview As we discussed in our previous Bitcoin price predictions , the bearish butterfly pattern completed its first target, triggering a sharp selloff. Now, let’s take a look at the fresh analysis and where Bitcoin could head next. Bitcoin Chart Outlook: Key Levels to Watch Technically , Bitcoin’s drop below its ascending trendline from April signals a weakening bullish structure. The RSI (38.8) indicates that BTC is entering oversold territory, while the MACD has crossed bearishly into negative momentum. The $108,000–$110,000 zone remains a crucial support area that has repeatedly attracted long-term buyers since June. Candle formations over the last three sessions, marked by long lower wicks, indicate dip buyers defending this level. A Doji or spinning top near this region could mark the early stages of a reversal, particularly if confirmed by a rebound above $117,000, which aligns with the 50-day moving average and prior resistance zone. If this recovery holds, Bitcoin may attempt another retest of $124,000, followed by a medium-term target near $126,000–$130,000. Alternatively, failure to stay over $108,000 could expose downside targets near $103,000 and $98,200, where historical demand zones reside. #Bitcoin – As noted in our previous forecast, BTC completed the bearish butterfly’s first target before tumbling 9% to $110K. Price now tests key support at $108K–$110K. A rebound above $117K could trigger recovery toward $124K–$126K, while failure risks deeper pullback to $103K. pic.twitter.com/4D4spTnEqX — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 11, 2025 Market Sentiment and Trading Setup Despite the selloff, technical analysis signals it as a healthy reset rather than the start of a new bearish trend. With the Crypto Fear and Greed Index at 35, market sentiment now mirrors early accumulation phases seen in prior cycles. With that said, a potential buy-the-dip setup emerges near $108,000, with stop-losses below $107,500 and upside targets at $124,000–$126,000. This aligns with both Fibonacci retracement and moving average confluence, offering a favorable risk-reward ratio for swing traders. If momentum improves, Bitcoin could resume its uptrend toward $130,000 in Q4, especially as institutional flows, ETF demand, and blockchain adoption continue to offset macro volatility. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $23 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.013095—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

The total crypto market capitalisation also hit a record high, swelling to $4.37 trillion earlier in the week. However, by Friday, those gains had been erased, with the market cap falling back to around $4.24 trillion. Risk appetite weakened as the week drew to a close, with the crypto fear and greed index retreating to 64, hovering near the lower end of the greed zone. Most top altcoins gave up nearly all of their weekly gains, while only a handful managed to hold on to double-digit profits during late Asian trading hours on Friday. Why is Bitcoin price down? Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high earlier this week, fuelled by surging institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted over $2.7 billion in inflows. But just as the rally appeared to be gaining steam, sentiment began to shift. A mix of macro headwinds, profit-taking, and mounting regulatory uncertainty dragged prices lower, triggering a broad market pullback. One of the main pressure points came from renewed caution around the Federal Reserve’s stance on inflation. Comments from Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr signalled that the central bank remains hesitant to pivot toward rate cuts, suggesting policymakers are not yet convinced that inflation is under control. Adding to the uncertainty, the ongoing US government shutdown has stalled several regulatory processes, particularly those involving new ETF products. Optimism had been building around the possibility of spot ETFs for other major tokens like XRP and Solana, but with federal agencies now working at limited capacity, the timeline for approval has become less clear. This has taken the wind out of one of the more bullish narratives that had been supporting the broader market in recent weeks. As liquidity thinned, a wave of profit-taking swept through the market. After pushing to new highs, Bitcoin holders began locking in gains, triggering a cascade of selling that added to the downward pressure. Selling pressure accelerated on Thursday as more than $600 million in leveraged positions were wiped out, with the momentum carrying into Friday, where it deepened the pullback and pushed Bitcoin down to repeatedly test the $120,000 support zone. Will Bitcoin price go up? As of late Asian trading hours, bulls were vigorously defending the $120,000 support level, which remains crucial if the rally is to continue. A pullback after hitting a fresh all-time high is quite common and often seen as healthy when it comes to sustaining long-term rallies, but only as long as key support levels hold firm. With the current macro environment clouded by uncertainty, the next few trading sessions are likely to prove vital in determining the direction of the rally, and all of it primarily hinges on Bitcoin’s capacity to hold above $120k. According to the weekly liquidation heatmap, Bitcoin appears to be trapped within a tightly contested range, with heavy liquidation clusters visible just above the $126,000 mark and dense support zones forming slightly below $120,000. Bitcoin weekly liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. The concentration of liquidation levels between $124,000 and $126,000 suggests this region could act as a major upside resistance if bulls manage to regain control. Several failed attempts to break through this zone earlier in the week have already triggered minor pullbacks, and any fresh rally would likely need strong volume to force short liquidations and clear the overhanging sell order. On the downside, the heatmap shows consistent liquidation interest just under $120,000, with bright yellow bands indicating stop-loss zones and leveraged long positions at risk. This confirms the importance of the $120,000 level as a short-term support floor. Repeated tests of this area have so far held firm, but a decisive breakdown below it could open the door toward deeper retracements, especially with limited liquidation density showing between $117,000 and $119,000. For the rally to move upside, bulls need to decisively reclaim the $123,000–$124,000 support area, which could pave the way for another push toward the highs, but failure to hold above $120,000 may tilt momentum further in favour of sellers.

At the same time, the Altcoin Season Index, which tracks how well altcoins are performing relative to Bitcoin, fell from 63 on Oct. 6 to 50 at press time, suggesting that momentum in the altcoin market may be starting to fade once again. Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin by market share, jumped 6.6% from $4,450 to notch a weekly high of $4,747. However, the rally lost steam as profit-taking took hold, pulling the price back down 4.5% to $4,270 by the end of the week. Other heavyweights like XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Tron (TRX), and Cardano (ADA) saw moderate gains of 3% to 8% during the same period. BNB (BNB) defied the broader bearish market trend, posting an 8.5% gain. Zcash (ZEC) led the pack among the top 99 altcoins by market cap, surging nearly 61% over the week while Bittensor (TAO) and Starknet (STRK) followed behind with more modest gains of around 22% and 12%, respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap Zcash : ZEC rallied to a 4-year high of $264 this week, marking one of its strongest performances in recent years. The surge is part of a broader resurgence in privacy-focused coins, fueled by growing concerns over blockchain surveillance and regulatory overreach. High-profile endorsements such as Venture capitalist Naval Ravikant calling Zcash “insurance against Bitcoin,” while Helius Labs CEO Mert Mumtaz publicly expressed support for the project, have also helped lift market sentiment for ZEC. Institutional demand has also played a major factor, with asset manager Grayscale opening its private Zcash Trust to eligible investors earlier in October after months of dormancy. The fund has already accumulated around $84.7 million in ZEC as of press time. Grayscale’s increased activity has also led to speculation of a potential Zcash ETF in the future, further fueling investor demand for the token. Bittensor : The main catalyst driving TAO’s gains this week is the launch of two flagship funds by Yuma Asset Management, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG). The funds are designed to give accredited and institutional investors streamlined exposure to Bittensor’s ecosystem of AI-powered subnet tokens. Such a development provides a fresh on-ramp for capital inflows into the network, with DCG backing the initiative through a $10 million initial investment, which serves as a strong vote of confidence from one of crypto’s most influential firms. Another major tailwind for TAO has been the renewed momentum across the broader AI token sector, which picked up after news broke that AMD is partnering with OpenAI. As part of the deal, AMD will supply chips to OpenAI, while OpenAI will reportedly take an equity stake in the chipmaker. For Bittensor, the partnership between the two AI powerhouses serves as validation of the intelligent compute narrative, precisely the niche that TAO is building for. Starknet : Retail demand for the Starknet token picked up after the network rolled out its new Bitcoin staking integration near the end of September. The feature allows users to stake tokenized versions of Bitcoin, such as WBTC, and earn STRK rewards directly on Starknet. So far, more than $63 million in BTC has been staked, accounting for roughly 25% of the network’s total consensus power. Starknet also launched a 100 million STRK reward pool as part of its “BTCFi Season” program, via which the network expects to draw in more Bitcoin liquidity into the ecosystem. STRK’s gains were further supported by recent protocol upgrades that enhanced both the efficiency and decentralization of the network.

Analyst and former community partner of the defunct exchange FTX, Benson Sun, noted on social media that many altcoins lost more than 60% of their value last night. According to Sun, while previous waves of excessive liquidation saw liquidations of around $1-2 billion, this time the volume has reached tenfold. The analyst argued that the US stock market can be expected to follow suit, but the short-term market loss experienced in the altcoin market cannot be explained by “normal leverage liquidation.” Related News: Last Night, the Prices of Two Major Altcoins Officially Dropped to $0 on Binance - An Unbelievable Event Sun explained that the situation stemmed from a sudden and deep market vacuum caused by large market makers actively withdrawing liquidity. According to the analyst, this decline was even more severe than the crashes of March 12 and May 19. “The deleveraging in this cycle is the most comprehensive yet. The market bubble has completely deflated, and risk leverage has fallen to zero,” Sun said, but still painted an optimistic picture for the fourth quarter of 2025. *This is not investment advice.

Experts tracking emerging DeFi projects are naming MUTM among the top crypto assets with over 400% upside potential, driven by its unique stablecoin mechanism and dual lending model. As investors seek safer yet high-performing alternatives, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s design offers a strong balance between innovation, utility, and sustainable returns — making it one of the standout projects to watch this year. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending model and stablecoin foundation The project’s presale continues to gain traction, raising approximately $17.12 million so far. Phase 6 tokens are priced at $0.035, and over 62% of the 170 million supply for this phase has already been sold. The next phase will raise the price to $0.040 — a 15% jump. With more than 16,850 holders and over 12,000 Twitter followers, the community continues to expand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also introduce a dual lending structure combining variable-rate and stable-rate borrowing. This model will let borrowers choose between predictable payments or flexible rates tied to market conditions, appealing to both institutional and retail users seeking optimized capital efficiency. At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized stablecoin system pegged to $1. The stablecoin will be minted only when users borrow against approved collateral such as ETH or USDT and will be burned once loans are repaid or liquidated. This mechanism ensures every token in circulation is backed by overcollateralized assets, preserving long-term stability and market trust. Interest rates for the stablecoin will be governed dynamically by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s decentralized governance process. When its price rises above $1, borrowing costs will be lowered to expand supply. When it dips below $1, rates will be raised to tighten circulation. This constant balancing process will anchor the stablecoin around its $1 target while maintaining system safety. A target to 400% The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) development team will deliver its Version 1 rollout through the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The early release will feature lending pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the automated liquidator bot — initially supporting ETH and USDT for collateral and borrowing. Later on, this beta testing phase will align with expected exchange listings, giving users real access to platform features and marking the first major utility wave for MUTM tokens. Analysts projecting a 400% price increase emphasize four core growth drivers supporting Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The first is its Reserve Factor, which redirects a portion of borrower interest into the protocol’s reserves. This feature will act as an on-chain safety buffer, strengthening solvency and supporting long-term value creation linked to future governance and token utilities. The second is its Deposit and Borrow Caps. These limits will protect the system from overexposure to volatile assets, creating trust among larger investors. By controlling capital inflows responsibly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will attract more institutional liquidity post-launch, indirectly boosting demand for MUTM. The third catalyst lies in Enhanced Collateral Efficiency. Correlated and low-volatility assets like stablecoins will enjoy higher borrowing limits. This improvement increases total lending volume, generating more interest income, which in turn funds MUTM buybacks and mtToken staking rewards. Finally, upcoming exchange listings on platforms such as Binance and Coinbase are expected to expand accessibility and liquidity worldwide. These listings will expose MUTM to a broader audience and accelerate volume growth, giving it the visibility needed to sustain a steady upward trajectory. A simple numerical projection underscores how early investors benefit. A Phase 2 participant who invested $1,500 at $0.015 now holds tokens valued more than $3,500 at the current Phase 6 price. Once the 400% projection materializes post-launch, that same investment will exceed $7,500, showing the tangible upside early buyers are already witnessing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also integrates a robust safety architecture. Every loan will be overcollateralized to maintain solvency under market volatility. Liquidation thresholds and reserve parameters will ensure timely repayment enforcement and protect liquidity providers. The Stable Interest Rate Model will offer borrowers predictable costs, while the Reserve Factor will sustain protocol longevity. Together, these mechanisms will create a stable and secure environment that appeals to both individual and institutional investors. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at a key point right now since the DeFi industry is growing quickly, and crypto charts show that investors are excited again. It has an edge over other DeFi protocols because it makes genuine yield, has automated stability procedures, and meets institutional-grade safety criteria. Phase 6 of the presale is now nearing completion, and the 15% price increase to $0.040 is fast approaching. Analysts see this as the last chance to get in before listings raise demand. For people who follow expert selections and data-driven crypto predictions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the best mid-term chances in decentralized finance. It has both structural depth and the ability to grow quickly.

The service, “Send Crypto, Receive MXN,” aims to facilitate near-instant, low-cost payments to Mexico, one of the largest global remittance markets, according to a press release shared with Finbold on October 11. The new feature reportedly allows users to convert cryptocurrency into Mexican pesos almost instantly, offering a cheaper alternative to traditional money transfer methods. “Cryptocurrencies enable financial inclusion in a way no other asset class ever has. But the real value is in being able to spend, send, and receive crypto as easily as local currency. This launch in Mexico demonstrates our vision to accelerate global financial inclusion.” said RedotPay CEO Michael Gao. The stablecoin -based payment firm noted that the system reduces transaction fees to below 1%, compared with an industry average of around 6.5%. Mexico’s emerging payment hub It is worth noting that the new service comes at a time when Mexico has emerged as a major global payments hub, receiving a record $64.7 billion in remittances in 2024. However, this growth has come at a cost, with high transfer fees and long settlement times remaining persistent challenges. To address this, RedotPay’s integration with CPN aims to streamline the process by utilizing blockchain infrastructure to enhance the efficiency of cross-border transactions. Notably, the Mexico rollout follows RedotPay’s earlier “Send Crypto, Receive BRL” service in Brazil and coincides with the company’s recent fundraising efforts, including a $40 million Series A round and $47 million in strategic investment . Looking ahead, the firm plans to extend its crypto-to-fiat payment solutions to additional emerging markets as part of its global expansion strategy.

According to the authorities, most of those targeted failed to disclose profits from their digital assets on the crypto exchange platform Binance. The authorities claimed that many have failed to disclose digital assets held on offshore exchanges in the hopes that they could escape the tax liabilities attached to them. The Income Tax department is now actively tracing these undeclared trades. In their statement, the department claimed that it is going after users who hid their crypto trades on Binance between 2022-23 and 2024-25. The users identified have evaded tax on their profits, with many failing to disclose the digital assets in their wallets in various exchanges overseas. Indian tax authorities target crypto tax evaders According to sources familiar with the matter, an internal communique has been released to this effect. The investigation wing of the Income Tax (I-T) department across different cities has been tasked by the apex body, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), to report actions by October 17. According to reports, many traders with high net worth moved their assets to offshore platforms, driven by a belief that they would escape tax on their crypto profits. Under the old I-T regime, users were expected to pay a total tax on profits on every sale, which could vary from 33% to 38%, or as high as 42%. This is besides the 1% tax dedicated at sources (TDS) on every crypto sale. “The tax department is empowered to issue a summons to confirm if due reporting is being done while filing the return of income by the taxpayer. If taxpayers had taken an aggressive position and not reported the income, the option to rectify through filing of an updated return would be available at an extra tax cost,” said Siddharth Banwat, a Mumbai-based chartered accountant. In the issue of multi-layered transactions, Indian authorities acknowledge that many digital transactions are carried out on-chain and not sold for cash. This is one of the grey areas of crypto tax evasion, and investors may run the risk of evading taxes without prior knowledge. For example, traders purchase USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the United States dollar, and transfer the digital asset through a blockchain network to their digital wallets on Binance . Binance to share information after FIU registration Subsequently, traders exchange the USDT for Bitcoin. USDT is seen as the widely accepted token to purchase other cryptocurrencies. Here, the seller may sell the Bitcoin and use the profits to purchase USDT , which can then be used to purchase other digital assets. Alternatively, residents can use the banking channels to move money from local accounts to an account opened with banks overseas under the liberalized remittance Scheme of the Reserve Bank of India, where they can invest about $250,000 in foreign assets annually. Investors do not always disclose the end-use of funds to the banks, considering that most banks obtain an undertaking from clients that the funds remitted under LRS will not be invested in digital assets or securities tied to digital assets. Such investors never disclose the overseas crypto holdings under the Schedule ‘Foreign Assets’ (FA) column in the I-T Return form. While most of them will feel it would go unnoticed, they have forgotten that Binance is required to report to India’s FIU after undergoing registrations with the body. India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is the central agency dedicated to collecting and processing information on money laundering deals. The arrangement between the body and Binance also paves the way for the exchange to share information with the Indian government. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

52982593,603885,1760173221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52982593.jpeg,Morgan Stanley Opens Crypto Doors: All Clients Welcome To Invest,https://bitcoinist.com/morgan-stanley-opens-crypto-doors-clients-welcome/,"Morgan Stanley, one of the largest investment firms in the US, announced on Friday that it will broaden access to crypto investments for all clients, including those with retirement accounts. This shift, reported by CNBC, allows financial advisors to present cryptocurrency funds to any client starting October 15, moving away from the previous restrictions that limited access to individuals with a minimum of $1.5 million in assets and an aggressive risk tolerance. Morgan Stanley Broadens Crypto Access This decision marks a notable evolution in the firm’s approach to digital assets, especially following the US government’s changing stance on cryptocurrencies under President Donald Trump’s administration. Throughout the year, the Republican Party, spearheaded by Trump’s vision of making America the ‘crypto capital of the world’, has taken significant steps towards this goal. These include the passing of the GENIUS Act for stablecoins and the appointment of Paul Atkins as the new US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair. This has also led to the dropping of several enforcement cases which targeted industry giants like Coinbase, Binance, Uniswap, among others. As a result, Morgan Stanley recently indicated that it would enable trading of THE market’s largest cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL), through its E-Trade subsidiary. Furthermore, the firm has consistently demonstrated a willingness to adapt to market trends, particularly as competition from platforms like Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) intensifies. As it eliminates eligibility requirements for crypto funds , the bank plans to implement an automated monitoring system to ensure that clients do not become overly concentrated in these investments. Major Banks Explore Stablecoin Launches The global investment committee at Morgan Stanley has recommended a cautious approach, suggesting a maximum initial allocation of up to 4% to cryptocurrencies based on individual investment goals ranging from wealth preservation to opportunistic growth. Lisa Shalett, the chief investment officer for wealth management, emphasized that while cryptocurrencies are increasingly popular, they remain “speculative assets” that not all investors will choose to pursue. Currently, advisors are limited to offering Bitcoin funds from established firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. However, Morgan Stanley is actively observing the evolving landscape for potential expansions in its offerings, including broader crypto options. This initiative comes as major US banks, such as Bank of America and Citibank, explore the launch of stablecoins, signaling a transformative shift in the financial services sector. Morgan Stanley is also monitoring developments in the stablecoin market. CFO Sharon Yeshaya has acknowledged the potential applications of stablecoins for their clientele, although she noted that it is still too early to assess their full impact on the firm’s operations.

The company is converting its Bitcoin mining facility located in Texas into a mega artificial intelligence data center. Galaxy Digital sells 12.78 million shares Galaxy Digital issued 9.03 million shares and sold them to a large, private investment firm at a price of $36 per share. In addition, the company’s executives , including Mike Novogratz, sold 3.75 million shares to the investment firm. The company will use the investment proceeds to boost the buildout of its Helios data center facility, located in Dickens County. The artificial intelligence data center is expected to deliver 133 MW in the first six months of 2026 to power “critical IT load.” This milestone is considered to be the first part of Galaxy Digital’s lease agreement. “Strengthening our balance sheet is essential to scaling Galaxy’s data center business efficiently while maintaining the financial flexibility to support future growth,” said Mike Novogratz, Founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital. He added , “Having one of the world’s largest and most sophisticated institutional investors make such a significant investment in our company will support our strategic vision and our ability to build leading businesses across digital assets and data centers.” The company’s stock, GLXY , reached an all-time high of over $44 on the private investment news. The stock closed trading at $39.38, dropping by 6.73% after Trump announced imposing additional tariffs on Chinese products. The investment agreement between Galaxy Digital and the private investor is awaiting approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange and is expected to come into effect on October 17 . Galaxy Digital raised $1.4 billion In August, Galaxy Digital announced raising $1.4 billion through debt financing to retrofit and expand Helios, its computing facility , located in West Texas. The company is converting the mining facility into a large-scale AI data center as part of its lease agreement with CoreWeave. The deal inked with CoreWeave in March will last for 15 years. During this period, Galaxy Digital will provide 800 MW of electricity to CoreWeave . This will power CoreWeave’s artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) operations. The Helios computing facility covers 160 acres in Dickens County, Texas. It is considered one of the biggest data centers in the United States. Galaxy Digital acquired Helios from Argo Blockchain back in December 2022. At the time, the facility had a capacity of 180 MW of Bitcoin mining load. In a report from late 2024, Galaxy Digital explained that Bitcoin miners are the perfect fit to capitalize on the growing AI demand . The report explained that such mining facilities have access to “large-scale power infrastructure and critical components needed for data center operations.” Bitcoin mining is less profitable now. After the halving event, which reduced mining rewards to 3.125 BTC, it became increasingly difficult to maintain profit margins. Bitcoin miners have pivoted to supplying computing power to AI companies in an attempt to diversify revenue sources.

The clip featured crypto commentator Naga Beau delivering a fiery message directed at Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, capturing the emotion of investors who have waited years for XRP to reach its true potential. Malena’s post amplified the tension between short-term frustration and long-term belief in XRP’s potential, a dynamic that has followed the digital asset for much of its history. While some investors express anger over the lack of immediate results, others continue to point to Ripple’s leadership consistency as the reason to remain confident. Beau stated in the video that XRP will either turn out to be a scam or its investors, including himself, will all become very rich. Malena, who is known for his support of XRP, noted that many investors have put their life savings into XRP, but asked the community to keep loading tokens as he is confident in the asset’s future.

When the case questioned the nature of XRP’s classification, Ripple stood firm, eventually securing clarity for the digital asset . Throughout that process, Garlinghouse maintained his focus on Ripple’s core objective of transforming global payments through efficient blockchain-based systems. His leadership ensured that the company expanded partnerships with financial institutions while maintaining transparency in its operations. Rather than retreating during regulatory headwinds, Ripple continued to develop its technology and global presence.

Despite these opposing views, Ripple’s roadmap has remained consistent under Garlinghouse’s direction. Ripple’s efforts to improve cross-border payments have evolved from proof-of-concept to real-world use, with several banks and payment providers adopting its solutions. By emphasizing practical utility rather than market speculation, the company has positioned itself as one of the few blockchain firms with tangible institutional engagement. This strategy reflects Garlinghouse’s view that the long-term value of XRP depends on adoption and trust, not hype. Garlinghouse has proven to be a trustworthy figure over the years, and while many skeptics still exist, his track record and XRP’s growth suggest that more will come, and the asset could dominate global finance.

The collapse followed the US government’s announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and sent both traditional and digital markets reeling. Investors bailed out of risk assets, and all major cryptos, including XRP, tanked. The token hit $1.77 before finding some stability. Volatility is nothing new to crypto, but the scale and speed of this drop show how closely digital assets are tied to macro and geopolitical events. Geopolitics Shake Up the Crypto Market This week’s crash reminded investors that cryptocurrencies are not immune to macro headwinds. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all fell in tandem with global equity indices, reinforcing their growing correlation with traditional markets. Bitcoin dropped nearly 9%, falling toward the $110,000 mark. Ethereum tumbled over 12%, slipping below $3,800. BNB and Solana both recorded double-digit losses, reflecting widespread risk aversion. For XRP, the tariff news triggered a massive liquidation wave, with short-term traders rushing to cut exposure. The result was a fast-moving sell-off that broke several support levels and negated weeks of consolidation. As panic selling subsides, long-term investors are seeking new entry zones, but uncertainty remains high. XRP Triangle Breakdown Signals Deeper Correction XRP price prediction remains bearish as XRP’s structure has weakened after breaking below a symmetrical triangle that had guided price action since mid-July. The breakdown followed multiple failed retests of the upper boundary near $2.80–$2.85, where sellers stepped in aggressively. The bearish engulfing candle on the daily chart confirmed a decisive momentum reversal. XRP now trades below the 100-day SMA ($2.63), a signal of short-term weakness. Meanwhile, the RSI at 35 indicates oversold conditions, but no clear bullish divergence has emerged yet, suggesting further downside risk. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Recent candlesticks show long lower wicks, reflecting buying interest near the $2.30-$2.32 range. This zone marks a key battle line between bulls and bears. A rebound from this level could lift XRP back toward the $2.70 resistance, which coincides with the lower boundary of the broken triangle and the 100-day SMA. If this relief rally fails, downside targets lie near $2.02, a critical Fibonacci support, and $1.77, where historical accumulation zones could attract buyers again. Trade Setup and Market Outlook For traders, the technical setup is cautious but rewarding. A sustained bounce above $2.30 could be a short-term long entry with targets $2.70-$3.18 if volume confirms. If it fails to hold $2.30 could open up $2.02 and keep the bearish bias. XRP’s chart is at a crossroads: Bearish engulfing candle confirmed momentum loss. RSI = 35 (oversold zone). Key supports: $2.30 → $2.02 → $1.77. A bounce from here could mark the start of the next recovery phase. #XRP pic.twitter.com/1mzHWX9wk9 — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 11, 2025 Despite near-term turbulence, XRP’s broader uptrend remains structurally intact. The current correction may serve as a market reset before new institutional inflows and ecosystem developments reestablish confidence heading into late October. If macro conditions stabilize and investor sentiment improves, XRP could reclaim lost ground, potentially retesting the $3.18-$3.60 zone by year-end.

Key Takeaways: Over 1.66 million traders were liquidated in 24 hours, erasing $19.33 billion in crypto positions. Bitcoin and Ethereum led the losses with $5.38B and $4.43B liquidated. Analysts warn it was one of the year’s most severe deleveraging events. The sell-off followed escalating macro uncertainty after President Donald Trump reaffirmed his plan for 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, spooking risk markets. Bitcoin, Ethereum Lead $16.8B Long Losses Long positions accounted for the bulk of the damage, totaling $16.83 billion, while $2.49 billion came from shorts. Bitcoin and Ethereum led liquidations at $5.38 billion and $4.43 billion, respectively, followed by Solana ($2.01B) and XRP ($708M). Hyperliquid saw the largest single liquidation, an ETH-USDT position worth $203.36 million, as total exchange liquidations topped $10.3 billion. Analysts noted that the wipeout marked one of the most severe deleveraging events of the year, highlighting the extreme volatility still present across crypto markets. This is likely the largest liquidation event, in $ terms, in crypto history. pic.twitter.com/NcpTnSISOr — CRG (@MacroCRG) October 10, 2025 Notably, the global crypto market cap fell over 9% in 24 hours, sliding to $3.8 trillion as prices tumbled across major assets. Bitcoin dropped from above $122,000 on Friday morning to around $113,600, wiping out all gains since August, and briefly dipped below $102,000 later that evening. The sell-off accelerated after Donald Trump threatened a “massive increase in tariffs” on Chinese imports, responding to Beijing’s new export restrictions on products containing over 0.1% rare earth elements. Trump later confirmed plans for 100% tariffs, though hinted he could reverse them if China changes course before Nov. 1. Analysts say a tariff reversal could trigger a short-term recovery in crypto markets, though liquidation losses remain locked in. Still, one major Hyperliquid whale reportedly shorted nine figures worth of BTC and ETH, earning an estimated $190 million profit, according to on-chain analyst @mlmabc, who suggested the trader may have influenced Friday’s crash. In case you didn’t know – the BTC whale closed 90% of his BTC short and fully closed his ETH short, making around $190–$200M profit in just one day on Hyperliquid. The crazy part is that he shorted another 9 figs worth of BTC and ETH minutes before the cascade happened. And this… pic.twitter.com/QhmUpesG0j — MLM (@mlmabc) October 10, 2025 Trump’s Approval Hits New Lows amid Government Shutdown US President Donald Trump’s approval rating has fallen sharply , with just 40% of Americans approving and 58% disapproving, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. The drop follows growing criticism of his decision to militarize law enforcement. A separate HarrisX survey showed a slightly higher 46% approval, underscoring the deep partisan divide across the country. The decline comes amid an ongoing government shutdown triggered by Congress’s failure to pass spending bills by the October 1 deadline. Trump blamed Democrats, saying he would target their programs in future budget cuts. Meanwhile, on the Polymarket prediction platform, 86% of traders expect the shutdown to continue past October 15, reflecting waning confidence in Washington’s ability to compromise. Trump’s pro-crypto stance, a central theme of his 2024 campaign, is also drawing scrutiny. Senator Elizabeth Warren has warned that Trump’s crypto involvement could pose ethical risks if he profits from related ventures while in office.

The culprit? US President Trump’s surprise announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting November 1, plus some new rules on critical software exports. Investors freaked out, worried a full-blown trade war was back on, and all those leveraged crypto positions started getting liquidated left and right. And it wasn’t just Bitcoin as Ethereum, Solana, and other big altcoins got dragged down too as traders scrambled to get out of risky bets. Bitcoin crash: Crypto meltdown follows Trump’s tariff shock After Trump dropped the tariff bombshell, Bitcoin went into freefall. It had been cruising above $120,000 earlier in October but slid all the way down to around $102,000 on major exchanges like Binance, its lowest point since mid-2025. In just 24 hours, more than $19 billion in leveraged crypto positions got wiped out, taking down about 1.6 million traders in one of the biggest single-day liquidation events the crypto world has ever seen. According to data from Coinglass, a whopping $16.8 billion of that came from long positions, a clear sign that overleveraged investors were completely blindsided. Ethereum tanked over 16%, Solana slipped under $190, and some smaller tokens lost nearly half their value. The entire crypto market shed close to $500 billion, dropping from $4.27 trillion to around $3.84 trillion as panic selling kicked in. Social media and trading platforms lit up with chaos as automated liquidation systems kicked into overdrive, triggering even more forced sales and pushing prices down even further. Even stablecoins weren’t spared as USDe briefly lost its dollar peg during the chaos, adding to the panic. The whole episode was a harsh reminder of just how sensitive the crypto market still is to big macro and geopolitical shocks, especially with so much money tied up in leveraged trades. What analysts say According to market experts, Trump’s tariff shock was really just the spark that set off a much bigger wave of risk-off sentiment across global markets. As per Cryptopolitan , a Blockscope Research analyst said the 100% China tariff “instantly priced in global recession fears,” pushing investors to dump risky assets, Bitcoin included. Several analysts even compared the crash to past black swan events, calling it one of the most brutal shakeouts in recent years. Still, not everyone’s panicking. An analyst from BitMEX pointed out that while Bitcoin’s drop was steep, its long-term fundamentals haven’t changed, and the crash had created rare buying opportunities. EconSphere Advisors economist added another layer of concern, he warned that the new tariffs and export controls could seriously mess with global supply chains, especially in areas like semiconductors and AI. That, he said, could put even more pressure on already fragile risk markets if the trade fight keeps escalating.

During yesterday's drop in Bitcoin's Turkish Lira pair, BTC/TRY, the price momentarily dropped to 51,600 Turkish Lira. This means that the price, which was hovering around 4.9 million Turkish Lira at the time, lost approximately 99% of its value in a very short period. This unusual event is likely attributed to the lack of liquidity in the Turkish Lira pair and the sudden liquidation of positions.

It subsequently reached its current levels due to both the rise in the dollar exchange rate and the explosive rise in the BTC price. The price of Bitcoin broke its all-time high this week at ₺5,252,196 in Turkish Lira. It is currently trading at ₺4,750,283. Yesterday's price drop came after Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on China.

The scams have led to losses in millions of dollars, with the scammers now increasing their scope. In that regard, there have been moves to ban the machines, or at least increase oversight to prevent people from falling for these scams. According to reports, one South Hadley business owner put a crypto ATM in his store as a source of passive income. They get $200 monthly as a rental fee and a cut of the withdrawal fee on each transaction, making it seem like the best revenue stream to offset sales on a bad day or add another stream of income. The business was going well until one of his employees received a call from a scammer posing as the owner. The scammer demanded that they put $11,000 into the crypto ATM, a scam the employee fell for, and the police have been unable to recover the funds since then. Crypto ATM scams on the rise in Massachusetts The $11,000 loss by the owner of the business was just one of the many crypto scams that have occurred in the state. According to authorities , one resident lost $48,000 to scammers, while another one lost $4,900, with authorities saying the funds are usually difficult to locate. “We’re finding that these are irreversible, untraceable, nearly impossible for us to investigate, but we spent dozens and dozens and dozens of hours [investigating],” Police Chief Jennifer Gundersen said. Crypto ATM scams have grown into a nationwide crisis, with Middlesex County Sheriff Peter Koutoujian telling legislators some weeks back that there has been a surge in crypto ATM scams across the country. He claimed that overall, there have been more than 11,000 complaints to the FBI in 2024, specifically reporting crimes involving crypto kiosks. The victims, he claims, lost a combined $247 million, a 99% increase in the number of complaints, and a 31% rise in reported losses from 2024. Meanwhile, the Joint Committee on Financial Services held a hearing on Tuesday regarding legislation to establish consumer protection guidelines for machines that allow users to buy or sell digital assets for cash (H 1247/S707). Under the guidelines, operators will have to be licensed as money transmitters, register each kiosk with the commissioner of banks, and file quarterly reports with the location of their kiosk. In addition, the new bill will impose a daily transaction limit of $1,000 per customer. South Hadley wants to ban the machines With the bill still currently making its way through the legislature, Gundersen is proposing an official ban on crypto ATMs in South Hadley. Based on the same ordinance passed in Waltham and Gloucester, business owners would have about 30 days to remove the crypto ATMs before they are met with a $300 fine per day. The Select Board favored the measure, with moves now in place to vote on it by members at the November 5 special Town Meeting. Currently, the town has only two businesses with these machines, but Gundersen claims that the new ordinance will prevent the machines from growing. “I spoke today to the Waltham police chief, and they went from four machines to 14 machines in a couple of months,” Gundersen said. “Waltham did report that some of the store owners very likely knew that there was a senior citizen in their store being scammed, but because they were going to get a portion of that money, they actually assisted them with their transaction.” Northwestern Assistant District Attorney Nicholas Atallah said he has received a couple of requests every month from municipal police departments to help them investigate scams involving crypto ATMs. Describing the scams, Atallah noted that the criminals usually pretend they are from law enforcement or authorities and ask victims to send money using the machines. He claimed that while it is possible to track these transactions, it remains incredibly difficult.

The decline came as part of a broader crypto selloff, triggered by global market jitters and nearly $19 billion in liquidations, one of the biggest single-day wipeouts this year. Despite the shock, some market signals suggest that Ethereum’s latest pullback could present a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors. Derivatives Market Shows Contradictory Signals Ethereum’s open interest increased as the price decreased. This means people are opening new positions rather than closing, so they must be confident or accumulating ahead of a bounce. Historically, when open interest goes up during a downtrend, it often precedes a period of high volatility or a reversal. Ethereum Interest Rates – Source: Cryptoquant Meanwhile, the funding rate, which is the cost of holding long or short positions in perpetual futures, flipped from +0.0029% on October 9 to -0.019% on October 11. This is negative, so shorts are now paying longs, so most people are betting on further down. Ethereum Funding Rates – Source: Cryptoquant However, when shorts become too crowded, even a small upward move can trigger a short squeeze, forcing bears to close their positions and accelerating the price upward. In short: Rising open interest = more traders taking positions. Negative funding = bearish sentiment building. Both combined = setup for a potential volatility spike or rebound. Ethereum’s Technical Outlook: Key Levels to Watch Ethereum price prediction seems bearish; however, ETH is attempting to stabilize around $3,840 after rebounding from its intraday low of $3,720. The 4-hour chart shows ETH breaking free from a descending channel, hinting at a short-term recovery if resistance levels hold. The RSI recently bounced from an oversold reading of 24, suggesting selling pressure is easing. At the same time, the MACD histogram is flattening out, a typical early signal that bearish momentum may be fading. Fibonacci retracement levels reinforce these patterns. Ethereum is hovering near the 23.6% retracement ($3,719) and now eyeing the 38.2% to 50% retracement range ($3,847–$3,951). If Ethereum can break above $4,055, it could invalidate the short-term down trend and lead to $4,330-$4,393, where the 100-day MA is. On the flip side, a close below $3,720 could lead to $3,511, which is a key psychological support. Ethereum Trade Setup and Market Outlook For traders, the short-term setup looks cautiously optimistic. A buy-on-dip opportunity could emerge between $3,720–$3,800, with a stop-loss near $3,680 and profit targets around $4,050–$4,390. Ethereum holds above $3,720 after a 11% slide. RSI rebounds from 24, hinting at cooling momentum. Watch $4,055 (61.8% Fib + key resistance) — a breakout there could open $4,330–$4,390. Below $3,720, risk extends to $3,511. pic.twitter.com/3yPHWvl7E5 — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 11, 2025 The broader trend remains intact, supported by sustained open interest and evidence of early accumulation at lower price levels. If macro volatility eases and funding rates normalize, Ethereum could regain momentum and retest $4,500 later this month. For long-term holders, the recent flash crash might represent not panic, but potential value. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

Altcoins that have good fundamentals and real-world applications are gaining the widest backing. XRP is holding critical levels of support and is showing signs of a likely breakout, and Solana (SOL) enjoys transaction speed and increasing developer action. Aside from these veteran names, early-project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trending among investors due to its asymmetric potential for gain. Already, in Phase 6 of presale, the token value is at $0.035. Over 60% of this phase is already sold out, and over 16,840 investors have purchased. Its two-layer lending architecture, USD-pegged stablecoin, and audited smart contracts bring actual utility, which makes it a good challenger like XRP and SOL for crypto millionaires for the first time ever in 2025. XRP Awaits Breakout to the Top as 4-Hour Support Holds XRP has reached the 4-hour order block area of $2.81-$2.86, and that is a crucial area where there is strong demand for purchasing. Remaining above this level could bring a prolonged bullish trend. Signs are in favor of growing momentum, and a breakout above current resistance levels may make entry possible to explore higher liquidity areas. The first important level above is at $3.10, where a cluster of prior highs and order flow is suggestive of possible selling pressure. If XRP is able to close above that, then the next possible area of the upside could be $3.20–$3.25. To the downside, the inability to hold $2.81–$2.86 could cause testing of support around $2.70, which is where there has been an area of demand in the last few trading days. Solana (SOL) Maintains Bullish Trend At Key Technical Levels Solana (SOL) continues to advance steadily within its channel of rising uptrend with contained upside pressure. A move above the 20-day EMA at $222 would affirm dip buying and may open the door to the channel resistance at $227–$230. On the downside, a drop below the 50-day SMA of $216 would affirm weakness that can take SOL down to $191 or even to $175 if the pivotal support is violated. Though SOL is still a strong contender in institutional and retail interest vigilant traders, investors that are considering Mutuum Finance as well with bigger potential in 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Strong Momentum Mutuum Finance is trending in the DeFi market, with its presale receiving funding from over 16,840 investors and raising over $17.1 million so far. Already in Phase 6, which is 60% subscribed, the price stands at $0.035 per token, indicating robust market demand and growing investor confidence. The platform is soon to launch its lending and borrowing protocol . V1 will be live on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will feature major features such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, along with a liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be supported for borrowing, lending, and collateralization at launch time, providing a multi-asset, plug-and-play DeFi experience. The protocol aims to provide institutional and retail users secure, efficient, and simple decentralized finance products. Mutuum Finance 2025’s Top Millionaire-Making Altcoins XRP and Solana (SOL) may have solid technical setups, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is turning out to be the dark horse with the highest potential. At a Phase 6 price of $0.035, the project has already attracted over $17.1 million from 16,840+ investors and 60% of tokens sold. Its two-tier lending protocol, USD-pegged stablecoin, and audited smart contracts deliver real DeFi utility rather than speculation. With its Sepolia Testnet going live in Q4 2025, Mutuum Finance could be one of the badge-of-honor stories of the next bull run. Early investors only have a limited window of time to jump aboard before the next price rise.

Ethereum (ETH) , the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is leading this sentiment shift after large holders stepped in to buy the recent dip. Analysts expect a possible 25% rebound from current levels as ETF staking activity and institutional inflows support stronger fundamentals. Alongside Ethereum’s recovery, newer digital assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE are catching investor attention. The project’s rising adoption and strong community presence have placed it among one of the best cryptos to buy , being tracked by analysts in late 2025. Ethereum Whale Activity — Medium Holders Take Profits, Whales Buy the Dip After rising toward $4,700 on Tuesday, ETH saw a rejection, dropping nearly 8% over the past three days as prices pulled back toward the $4,300 level. The decline saw medium-scale holders (wallets holding 1K-10K ETH) initiating a massive distribution, depleting their collective balance by 1.22 million ETH since Monday, according to data from CryptoQuant. Over the same period, whale wallets holding between 10K-100K ETH grew their collective stash by 200K ETH. The move suggests that the recent price drop was spearheaded by profit-taking activity from medium-scale holders. Ethereum Price Chart: CoinMarketCap This is evidenced by the gradual rise in profit-realization over the past four days. Investors have booked nearly $2.5 billion in profits since Monday, per Santiment data. Selling activity was evident across all coin ages, but mainly from short-term holders. Historically, pullbacks triggered by medium or small-scale holders often end up as brief corrections if whale wallets continue to accumulate. Meanwhile, Grayscale accelerated the staking of coins with its spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since enabling the feature on Monday, creating further scarcity for ETH. The firm staked 857,600 ETH worth $3.83 billion on Wednesday, according to data compiled by smart money tracker Lookonchain. New Altcoin Project Gains Investor Traction Amid Market Rotation As Ethereum regains momentum from whale accumulation, investor attention is also shifting toward promising early-stage altcoins showing strong fundamentals and market activity. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the standout examples of this shift, driven by consistent presale growth, transparent communication, and a fast-expanding community. The project has built credibility among traders who are diversifying into smaller yet high-potential digital assets while the broader market consolidates. With its steady adoption curve and active ecosystem development, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the best crypto to buy poised to benefit from renewed interest in quality altcoins as 2025 approaches. Conclusion Ethereum’s recent whale accumulation points to growing confidence in the market’s next uptrend. With profit-taking from smaller holders subsiding and ETF staking reducing available supply, analysts expect ETH to regain momentum toward a 25% rebound in the near term. At the same time, one of the like MAGACOIN FINANCE show that the search for early-stage opportunities remains strong among investors. Following a comprehensive Hashex audit , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a 100% verified and trusted crypto presale, earning confidence from both retail investors and leading analysts.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $4,795.01 and a minimum price of $4,195.63. By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $7,791.89 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. In September 2020, Binance introduced BNB Smart Chain, which was initially designed for trading and transferring tokens and runs parallel to Binance Chain and What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis.

Cryptocurrency lost 13.65% of its value. BNB bulls look to secure support around $1050. On October 11, 2025, the Binance Coin is showing a highly bearish daily trend. The price analysis reveals the coin has been in a free fall for a third consecutive day since it corrected from its new all-time high of $1,330.51. The coin dropped below the key psychological level of $1,000, touching $860, and has since stabilized near $1,100 ($1,092.17 to be exact) in recent hours. This enormous correction has brought a loss of 13.65% in value. As BNB seems to be in a free fall, selling options to prevent further losses is also suppressing the levels. BNB/USDT price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of Binance Coin confirmed a downward trend in the market. The cryptocurrency’s price crashed below $1000 due to massive selling pressure following Trump’s tariff announcement. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify bearish control in the market and continued price decline. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance is high, leading to increased volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating resistance, has shifted to $1,325.36, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $867.79. BNB/USDT Price Chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the central neutral region. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 50.60 in the past 24 hours. This decrease confirms rising selling activity in the market. BNB price analysis on a 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of Binance Coin also confirmed the presence of selling pressure on the altcoin. The BNB/USD price decreased to $1,087.02 in the past few hours. A momentary dip to a low of $860.04 was also observed a few hours back. The Bollinger Bands are diverging, resulting in increasing volatility levels. The increasing volatility signifies a higher chance of an upcoming reversal or further price decline. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $1,374.40, indicating a resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $1,133.78, marking a broken support level. BNB/USDT 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI is in the oversold area for now. The indicator’s value decreased to 29 in the past few hours as it dipped into the oversold region. The downward curve of the indicator suggests the presence of selling pressure in the market, which is a concerning sign for investors. However, as the indicator is in the oversold region, it can give a buy call anytime.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin also corrected down to $1092.17. If traders continue selling assets, the BNB price might see a further dip and plunge to 1,050. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $7,791.89 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found resistance, and the price moved toward $1092.17, as bears target $1,050. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 13.65 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? BNB price has already touched $1000 in 2025 and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2027, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $7,791.89 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB achieved the mark of $1,079.07, and in October, it discovered a new all-time high price of 1,261.53 and is trading above the $1,200 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-11 09:35:56

With Bitcoin nearing the $110,000 support level, analysts believe it could be headed for a blow-off top, a rapid, steep price surge driven by frenzied buying, typically followed by a sharp correction. Specifically, in an X post on October 11, Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Alleman, who use the pseudonym Negentropic , noted that the flash crash highlights Bitcoin’s resilience. Their outlook pointed to a short-term breakdown at $118,000 but emphasized that this event is only a temporary bump in the road. They predict that volatility will persist over the coming days, but prices are likely to climb higher by the end of the month. This flash crash creates an even stronger case for a blow off top. If you look at $btc it has just proven its resilience. This is a prelude to the correction that we will get when the actual top sets in. Our flash crash signal on @bitcoinvector showed the short term… — 𝗡𝗲𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗰 (@Negentropic_) October 10, 2025 Clearing the way for blow-off top On the other hand, macroeconomist Henrik Zeberg echoed this view, describing the crash as a clearing mechanism that could set the stage for a blow-off top. He warned that investor FOMO (fear of missing out) may drive a surge in buying, creating a dynamic that could push Bitcoin even higher before a market correction occurs. Overall, experts recommend long-term strategies, such as dollar-cost averaging (DCA), to navigate the turbulence. 100% agree! In its own weird way…. The flash crash cleared the path for the BlowOffTop. Market top is NOT in. And now investors will FOMO in which will create a new Dynamic. Strange – and unbelievable? Perhaps! But – that is what I see https://t.co/eAfZAc0xo7 — Henrik Zeberg (@HenrikZeberg) October 11, 2025 This outlook comes after Bitcoin led the cryptocurrency market in wiping out over $400 billion in 24 hours as investors reacted to a new trade war escalation between the United States and China. Notably, after appearing to make progress, both countries are now considering new retaliatory tariffs, which have spooked investors.

On Saturday, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index slid to 27, a “Fear” reading, a sharp 37-point fall from the previous day’s “Greed” reading of 64. Leading crypto trading platforms, such as Binance and Coinbase, among others, failed the crucial test, facing significant congestion during this correction. Most trading platforms faced widespread technical issues during the largest liquidation event in crypto history. Users reported frozen order books, app lag, and temporary lockouts during peak volatility as markets plunged. The top cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, even momentarily dropped to $102,000 on Binance perpetual futures following Trump’s tariff announcement on Truth Social. Trump has vowed to impose new 100% tariffs on China next month, claiming Beijing is taking “very hostile” actions by limiting rare earth exports, which are crucial to American manufacturing. The disruption demonstrated the toll on exchange infrastructure during wild price swings and essentially amounted to a real-world stress test for the entire crypto trading ecosystem. Sentiment index hits an intraday low of -2.8 According to analysts, the tariff shock has shaken investor confidence worldwide, leading many traders to de-risk after weeks of optimism. Bitwise, European head of research, Andre Dragosch, stated that their company’s intraday Crypto Asset Sentiment Index has just flashed a strong contrarian buy signal. He commented , “Our intraday Cryptoasset Sentiment Index just generated a strong contrarian buying signal! The index reached an intraday low of -2.8 standard deviations – its lowest level since the “Yen Carry Trade Unwind” in the summer of 2024. Stack accordingly.” The last time sentiment was this weak was April 16, when Bitcoin fell to $77,000 as trade tensions escalated, before recovering more than 30% weeks later. Just days ago, the Index even reflected “Greed” as Bitcoin climbed to a record $125,100. Although analysts have observed that Bitcoin’s recent surge past $125,000 failed to generate the same excitement that typically accompanies its earlier peaks. Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan noted that social media engagement on the token was low. Speaking on the Thinking Crypto podcast published to YouTube on Thursday, he commented, “It was like a modest, run-of-the-mill reaction from the crypto audience.” He added, “Really wasn’t much of anything. It’s not nearly as euphoric as some of these previous ones.” Some analysts, however, have argued that the tempered mood might actually be a healthy sign, suggesting a firmer price base is forming amid subdued retail activity. Even so, escalating macroeconomic uncertainty and Trump’s tariff threats have left risk sentiment across all markets on edge as we move into October. Wall Street has plummeted drastically after Trump’s announcement On Friday, Wall Street also saw steep losses after President Trump’s renewed clash with China stoked worries of a fresh round of trade hostilities. The S&P 500 ended down 2.7%, marking its biggest single-day loss since April. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 1.9% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6%. The chipmaker Nvidia , valued at around $2.5 trillion and currently the world’s largest public company, also saw its stock sink by about 5%. Overseas markets weren’t spared either — the FTSE 100 in London fell 0.9%. China still controls over 90% of global rare earth processing and magnet production, and this week, the country expanded its rare earth export controls to cover five more materials. The last expansion in April also caused supply shocks across global markets before diplomatic measures helped restore balance. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Rather than chasing short-term hype, the project has focused on steady fundraising, transparent operations, and a clear roadmap centered on real utility. That disciplined approach is now paying off. With Phase 6 more than halfway complete, Mutuum Finance is increasingly being viewed as one of the most credible and well-structured presales of 2025. A Purpose-Built DeFi Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance is not a meme coin or a vague blockchain experiment. It positions itself as an Ethereum-based, decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol designed exclusively for lending and borrowing. The mission is clear: build efficient on-chain markets where every action—whether supplying liquidity, borrowing against collateral, or staking mtTokens—feeds directly into demand for the MUTM token. This tight integration between platform activity and token value is central to its design. Investors aren’t simply buying a token in anticipation of future utility. They are joining a system where real usage, lending volume, and protocol revenue work together to support the token’s value from day one. Structured Presale Growth The presale has mirrored the platform’s structured design. Phase 1 launched at just $0.01, offering a rare low entry point early in the cycle. From there, the token price has steadily climbed through five completed stages to reach $0.035 in Phase 6. For early participants, that represents 250% growth so far. Each presale stage comes with a fixed price and allocation, rising by roughly 20% at every step. This creates a transparent and predictable appreciation curve, rewarding early buyers while motivating new participants to act before the next price increase. It’s a deliberate system meant to build momentum gradually rather than through artificial spikes. Phase 6 is already more than 60% sold, with the next stage set at $0.04, another near 20% step upward. The token’s exchange listing price is locked at $0.06, positioning Phase 1 buyers for potential 500% gains at launch, while even Phase 6 participants could see close to a 2x increase. The numbers underscore the scale of this fundraising effort. Over $17.1 million has been raised. More than 750 million tokens have been allocated. The holder count has surpassed 16,800. Few DeFi presales this year have achieved this level of consistency. Broad Participation and Strong Foundations Mutuum Finance’s distribution strategy spreads ownership widely instead of concentrating it in a handful of wallets. This approach reduces whale dominance and helps create healthier liquidity when trading begins. It has attracted both retail investors and larger players. Recent whale inflows of about $100,000 in single transactions suggest early accumulation from strategic buyers who recognize the potential before broader market attention catches up. The platform’s fundamentals reinforce this momentum. Mutuum employs a buy-and-distribute mechanism, where a portion of revenue from lending fees is used to purchase MUTM on the open market. The purchased tokens are then redistributed to users who stake mtTokens. This system creates continuous buying pressure on MUTM while rewarding active participants, directly linking token performance to real platform activity. Security and Transparency Measures For many investors, trust matters as much as token price. Mutuum Finance has placed a strong emphasis on security and transparency from the outset. The protocol underwent a CertiK audit, earning a 90/100 Token Scan score, which places it among the more secure DeFi projects currently in presale. To strengthen this further, the team launched a $50,000 tiered bug bounty program, encouraging white-hat hackers and developers to identify vulnerabilities before launch. On the community side, a $100,000 giveaway brought in thousands of participants, while a real-time presale dashboard let users track allocations, connect their wallets, and follow progress at every stage. A Top 50 leaderboard rewarded the biggest contributors with bonus MUTM tokens, turning the presale into an engaging and transparent experience. Beta Platform Launch and Roadmap Unlike many presales that launch tokens months before their platforms are ready, Mutuum Finance plans to release its beta platform at the same time as the token listing. This ensures immediate utility. At launch, users will be able to interact with Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, supplying mainstream assets like ETH and stablecoins to earn yield, while borrowers can access instant liquidity. Alongside these pooled markets, Peer-to-Peer isolated agreements will support less liquid or riskier tokens, widening credit access while containing systemic risk. Borrowers can choose between variable interest rates, which adjust with liquidity conditions, or stable rates, which lock in repayment costs at a premium for predictability. All borrowing remains overcollateralized, backed by strict loan-to-value thresholds and liquidation parameters. Looking ahead, the roadmap includes the launch of an overcollateralized stablecoin, Layer-2 integrations to reduce fees and expand reach, and the integration of multi-oracle price feeds (including Chainlink) to ensure pricing accuracy and system stability across chains. With $17.1 million raised, 60% of Phase 6 complete, 750 million tokens sold, and 250% growth since Phase 1, Mutuum Finance stands out as one of 2025’s most credible DeFi presales. Its disciplined fundraising model, transparent community engagement, and focus on utility-first development make it a project that both retail and institutional investors are watching closely.

52984609,603935,1760176818,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52984609.jpeg,Coinbase CEO Warns Crypto Industry ‘Won’t Accept’ Senate Democrats’ Crackdown On DeFi,https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-ceo-crypto-democrats-crackdown-defi/,"Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, has criticized Senate Democrats’ controversial proposal to regulate the DeFi sector, which has reportedly stalled bipartisan talks on the long-awaited crypto market structure legislation. Coinbase CEO Slams Democrats’ Proposal In a Friday X post, Coinbase’s CEO warned that the crypto industry “absolutely won’t accept” the Senate Democrats’ proposal on DeFi regulation as it “would set innovation back, and prevent the US from becoming the crypto capital of the world.” For context, crypto journalist Eleanor Terret reported that Senate Democrats and Republicans were allegedly quarreling behind the scenes over a leaked proposal to regulate DeFi platforms in the upper chamber’s version of the crypto market structure bill, the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA). The six-page document, named “Preventing illicit finance and regulatory arbitrage through decentralized finance platforms,” proposed establishing a “clear” regulatory framework for DeFi platforms by “defining accountability, clarifying oversight, and preventing the misuse of decentralized protocols for illicit finance, sanctions evasion, or to bypass market guardrails.” Jake Chervinsky, Variant CLO, called Democrats’ proposal “deeply unserious,” affirming that the drafted suggestions are “basically a crypto ban,” with many “fundamentally broken and unworkable” aspects. The lawyer argued that the changes to RIFA’s draft text would effectively kill the bill, as it would make everyone in crypto an intermediary, force front-end providers to apply Know Your Customer (KYC) rules to their users, and give agencies “unchecked power for selective regulation.” “It lets Treasury regulate anyone with ‘sufficient influence’ in a DeFi protocol and also lets Treasury define ‘sufficient influence’ however it pleases,” Chervinsky explained. “It creates a ‘restricted list’ for protocols and front-ends that Treasury thinks are too risky, and then makes it a crime for anyone to use them. There is no limiting principle, defense, or recourse. Treasury is all-powerful.” “The RFIA draft got a few key things right,” he stated, a sentiment shared by other industry leaders like Uniswap’s CEO, Hayden Adams. Variant’s CLO highlights that the Senate Banking Committee’s draft protects software developers from unjust regulation and criminal prosecution, “preventing future administrations from returning to the era of Gary Gensler. Without this, there is no bill.” Crypto Market Structure Bill At Risk? Coinbase CEO affirmed that legislation is a process and pledged to continue fighting for the rights of investors and developers and to “preserve economic freedom.” He also added that Coinbase leadership is “committed to engaging and helping Congress get it right.” Amid the backlash, some have debated whether the market structure bill can arrive at President Donald Trump’s desk before the end of the year. Eleanor Terret reported for Crypto In America that Senate Republicans are “frustrated” that Democrats have allegedly offered “little substantive feedback” on the two published discussion drafts on the legislation and have been reluctant to set an official date for the legislation’s markup session. A Senate Banking Committee Communications Director, Jeff Naft, said that “What was sent to Republicans was not a legislative offer; the document was not written in legislative text, included multiple incoherent policy ideas, and was not a good-faith effort to engage on market structure.” As a result, negotiations have reportedly stalled. However, anonymous sources told Terret that the leaked proposal was “meant as a starting point for discussions, not a final position,” and Democrats are seemingly frustrated that the document was made public. Jacques Petit, Director of Communications for Senator Ruben Gallego, stated that “Their demand to set a markup date before text is agreed to is like setting a wedding date before the first date. It’s nonsensical.” Terret noted that the longer this incident drags on, the more likely the crypto legislation won’t arrive at the President’s desk this year.

This followed the U.S. President Donald Trump’s move, which has ignited fears of a full-blown trade war with China. Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Prices Are Crashing The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are down today, according to CoinMarketCap data. The flagship crypto has dropped to as low as $104,000 over the last 24 hours, wiping out its early October gains that led to a new all-time high (ATH) above $126,000. Ethereum dropped to as low as $3,400, while Dogecoin broke below the psychological $0.2 level and fell to $0.11. Related Reading: Institutions Dump Massive Amounts Of Bitcoin And Ethereum As XRP And Solana Buying Ramps Up This massive crash in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin followed Trump’s Truth Social post, in which he announced that the U.S. will impose a 100% tariff on China, over and above any tariffs they are currently paying, starting on November 1. He added that they will also impose Export Controls on any and all crucial software from China starting on November 1. Notably, Trump had earlier in the day threatened to massively increase tariffs on China, while stating that the country was becoming hostile. This initial threat caused Bitcoin to sharply drop below $120,000 from a high of around $122,000. Meanwhile, the Ethereum and Dogecoin prices also faced sharp declines. Bitcoin was trading around $116,000 when Trump announced a 100% tariff on China, which sent the crypto market into a spiral. BTC’s further decline also pushed Ethereum and Dogecoin to intraday lows of $3,400 and $0.11, respectively, extending their market losses. Meanwhile, these massive declines for the crypto assets contributed to the largest liquidation event in crypto’s history. CoinGlass data shows that $20 billion has been wiped out from the crypto market in the last 24 hours, driven by crashes in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices. This liquidation event was larger than the COVID-19 crash and the FTX bankruptcy crash. Exchanges May Have Contributed To The Crash BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes suggested that crypto exchanges may have contributed to the crash in the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices. In an X post, he stated that the word on the street is that big CEX’s auto liquidation of collateral ties to cross-margined positions is why many altcoins “got smoked on the move down.” He congratulated those who bought the dip, stating that market participants are unlikely to see those levels again anytime soon on many high-quality altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Prediction: Why The Price Will Cross $140,000 By The End Of October Crypto analyst Kevin Capital opined that the drop in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices was caused by serious issues across top exchanges like Robinhood, Coinbase, and Binance. He added that what makes it even worse is that these exchanges didn’t let people buy the dip at the lowest point.

The certification, shared by crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) on X, includes an official report titled “Sharia Analysis – Ripple.” The document lists the SRB as a licensed Sharia advisor under Bahrain’s central bank, affirming that Ripple’s framework aligns with Islamic financial principles. This development is more than an internal validation. Ripple now holds a certification that positions it for deeper engagement within Islamic banking networks and cross-border payment systems that adhere to Sharia law. Such certification plays a decisive role in determining whether a financial technology platform can operate within Islamic finance environments, where adherence to ethical and interest-free principles is mandatory.

By securing a Sharia compliance review, the company opens XRP and its infrastructure to banks and financial institutions across regions such as the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeast Asia, all areas with strong Islamic finance frameworks. This move could enable Ripple to integrate with financial institutions that previously hesitated due to compliance uncertainties. For XRP, the digital asset used in Ripple’s liquidity solutions, this creates a potential increase in adoption and transactional use within compliant financial systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Shariyah Review Bureau’s involvement carries particular weight. As an organization licensed by the Central Bank of Bahrain, it provides regulatory oversight and Sharia certification for numerous financial entities. This gives Ripple and XRP a form of institutional legitimacy within markets that prioritize both technological advancement and adherence to faith-based financial standards. Ripple’s Strategic Positioning and Market Impact The timing of this certification aligns with Ripple’s broader efforts to establish XRP and its underlying technology as a trusted framework for cross-border settlements . Many financial regulators and banking entities in Islamic countries require confirmation of Sharia compliance before allowing digital assets or blockchain technologies to operate within their systems. Ripple’s clearance in this regard provides a pathway for partnerships with banks and fintech providers seeking compliant digital solutions. Ripple now stands positioned to offer XRP-powered payment solutions to a wider market that values both innovation and compliance.

Key Takeaways: Economist Timothy Peterson predicts Bitcoin could rebound up to 21% this week. Since 2013, October has averaged 20.1% gains, making it Bitcoin’s second-best month behind November. Despite a brief plunge to $102,000 after Trump’s tariff announcement, analysts remain bullish. “Drops of more than 5% in October are exceedingly rare,” Peterson wrote on X Friday , noting it has only happened four times in the past decade, in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021. In three of those years, Bitcoin rallied immediately afterward, gaining 16%, 4%, and 21%, respectively, while only 2021 saw a minor decline of 3%. October Lives Up to ‘Uptober’ Hype as Bitcoin’s Second-Best Month on Record October’s reputation as “Uptober” continues to strengthen. Since 2013, it has been Bitcoin’s second-best performing month, delivering an average return of 20.1%, behind only November’s 46% average. Peterson’s comments followed a dramatic market correction on Friday when Bitcoin briefly dipped below $102,000 after US President Donald Trump confirmed plans for a 100% tariff on Chinese imports. The market has since stabilized, with Bitcoin trading near $111,700, recovering from an earlier high of $125,100 set on Monday, according to CoinMarketCap. Drops of more than 5% in October are exceedingly rare. This has happened only 4 times in the past 10 years. Oct 24 2017 Oct 11 2018 Oct 23 2019 Oct 21 2021 What happened next? 7 days later bitcoin was 2017: up 16% 2018: up 4% 2019: up 21% 2021: down -3% pic.twitter.com/mbFs19RbwL — Timothy Peterson (@nsquaredvalue) October 10, 2025 If Bitcoin mirrors its strongest October rebound, the 21% surge seen in 2019, a similar move from Friday’s low would push the price back to around $124,000, just shy of its recent record. Despite last week’s turbulence, many Bitcoin advocates remain bullish. Samson Mow, founder of Jan3, reminded traders that “there are still 21 days left in Uptober.” Meanwhile, Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, called the latest dip “the bottom of the current cycle.” Others have taken a broader view. The Bitcoin Libertarian argued that massive liquidation events are part of the asset’s natural evolution, predicting that even when Bitcoin trades near $1 million, similar volatility will persist. In a few years #Bitcoin will crash from $1M to $0.8M in a few hours and we’ll all be talking about a new record high amount of liquidations Let history repeat — The ₿itcoin Libertarian (@TheBitcoin__) October 11, 2025 Analyst Warns Bitcoin Faces Decisive 100-Day Window Bitcoin may be nearing a critical turning point, according to trader Tony “The Bull” Severino, who believes the next 100 days could determine whether the cryptocurrency enters a parabolic rally or ends its current bull cycle. Severino pointed to the Bollinger Bands indicator on Bitcoin’s weekly chart, which has tightened to levels unseen before, often a precursor to sharp price moves in either direction. Severino cautioned that “head fakes,” or false breakouts, are common during such setups. He noted Bitcoin recently failed to break above the upper band with strength after briefly touching $126,000, suggesting a potential dip before any sustained rally. Currently, BTC trades around $122,700, hovering below its record highs as volatility compresses further. While some analysts fear a looming breakdown, others argue that Bitcoin’s cycles are getting longer, hinting at more room for growth.

Is Conflux a good investment? As CFX price has a solid user base in the Chinese crypto community, we might see profitable returns in the long term. As a result, it can be a good investment option in the future. Why is the CFX price down today? Following Trump’s 100% tariff announcement on China, the crypto market crashed heavily. This resulted in a significant drop in the CFX price chart. Will CFX Recover? If buyers hold the $0.1 level strongly, we might see buying demand above $0.15 in the CFX price chart. What is the expected value of Conflux in 2025? In 2025, CFX price might reach a maximum value of $0.4773. Will CFX price hit $1? According to our predictions, we might see the CFX price hitting the $1 mark by 2027. Will CFX price hit $5? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, the $5 milestone for CFX price is a distant dream. However, we expect the coin to attain this value by the end of 2050.

Fiscal 2025 revenue grew 168% to $501 million, with adjusted EBITDA up nearly 400% to $270 million and margins at 54%. The company expanded its AI Cloud fleet from 1,900 to 23,000 GPUs, targeting over $500 million in annualized AI Cloud revenue by 2026. With 2.9 GW of secured power at 0.035/kWh, IREN maintains one of the lowest-cost energy bases in the AI industry. IREN Limited ( IREN ) has achieved one of the most dramatic turnarounds in the digital infrastructure sector. Once written off as a Bitcoin mine, the company has transformed itself into a vertically integrated AI infrastructure giant. IREN stock going from $16 from my first bullish call to $60 indicates more than euphoria in the markets, and implies a re-rating of its very DNA. IREN now plays at the intersection of two short resources defining the AI decade, power and compute. With $501 million in FY2025 revenue and $270 million in EBITDA, it has transformed its mining cash flywheel into an internally funded moat driving one of North America’s largest expansions of GPUs. Despite its sharp bull run, IREN remains a buy on pullbacks, as its accelerating AI Cloud growth, low-cost power base, and expanding GPU capacity continue to outpace its valuation re-rating. Scaling Compute While the World Is Running Out of Power Fiscal 2025 results highlighted the revenue leverage in IREN’s business as revenue rose 168% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA rose almost 400% , and margins hit 54%. With the shift in business mix to AI Cloud from Bitcoin mining, profitability will likely increase further. AI workloads are inherently power-dense and margin-intensive, and with average power prices at $0.035/kWh and no third-party colocation charges, incremental GPU additions could maintain high EBITDA margins. The rate of scaling of operations has been outstanding. Within a single year, IREN’s AI Cloud fleet expanded from 1,900 to 23,000 GPUs , 19,000 of which are NVIDIA B200 and B300 and more than 1,000 AMD MI350Xs. These deployments form the basis of an objective of more than $500 million annually in AI Cloud revenue by early calendar year 2026, a nearly 20 times increase in twelve months. Over 11,000 GPUs are already under multi-year contracts, locking in an estimated $225 million of recurring revenue by year end 2025. This contracted base provides near-term cash visibility while retaining pricing upside in a highly tightening GPU supply environment. FY25 Results Presentation Behind this growth is IREN’s 2.91-GW energy portfolio across Canada and the United States, of which 810 megawatts are already in operation. Its Canadian data centers in British Columbia gain world-class power usage effectiveness close to 1.1 based on inexpensive hydroelectric power, and its enormous Childress and Sweetwater facilities in Texas provide multi-gigawatt scale in energy-rich areas. Most importantly, IREN owns its buildings and does not lease, which provides unparalleled power autonomy, and margin control. FY25 Results Presentation These benefits make IREN a structural winner in the AI power economy. While hyperscalers fight over access to the grid and administrators discuss data center energy ceilings, IREN has already contracted the electrons that will power the next cycle of AI growth. Each new megawatt deployed directly equates to margin expansion, not cost escalation. While infrastructure cost escalation is the new taxation in a sector, IREN is practically immunised. Eventually, IREN’s rally constitutes the first nod from the market to its renaissance, but not its end. Now, the company finds itself at the nexus of energy, infrastructure, and intelligence, as a power utility as well as a digital compute platform. As the world has a short supply of GPUs and gigawatts, IREN’s control over both may well make it one of the AI decade’s landmark infrastructure compounders. Investing In Innovation And The AI Utility Model Birth Capital discipline to match its engineering. In October 2025, IREN issued $875 million of zero-coupon convertible notes due 2031 , which included a 42.5% conversion premium and a $120 capped call. The transaction essentially issued nearly a billion dollars of debt with no interest cost and minimal dilution, an uncommon achievement in a capital-intensive business. Along with single-digit lease financing on GPUs, IREN has designed something it calls synthetic equity with debt that acts like growth capital but compounds shareholder value instead of devouring it. This funding approach has engendered a negative-carry growth cycle. Bitcoin mining flows give the liquidity to fund GPU leases, which in turn increase capacity and prospective cash flow. As those AI assets build towards higher usage, they return capital quicker than it’s being deployed. It’s a snowballing cycle, a unique combination of digital coin monetization and real-world infrastructure scaling. It’s what distinguishes IREN from its rivals that it uses capital so effectively. While CoreWeave ( CRWV ) and other private players rely so much on equity dilution and venture debt, IREN growth capital fund supports itself organically, supplemented by mining profits and disciplined leverage. Even at a $17 billion market cap, IREN’s valuation falls behind in its peer category, which are venture-backed AI infrastructure companies that are listed and command higher revenue multiples and lower operating cash flow. What makes it exceptional is that it combines growth, profitability, and capital efficiency, placing it squarely on the cusp of a new asset class, an AI infrastructure utility. IREN’s Valuation Appears Rich, But It’s Worth Every Penny Of A New Age Of AI Infrastructure Supremacy IREN’s rise from $16 to $60 does not mark the end of the opportunity, but the beginning of a structural repricing. As the energy shortage emerges as the new oil shock and GPUs the new gold rush, IREN has positioned itself as among the few players who will be able to turn electrons into exponential profits. Its next page will not be written in hash rate or teraflops, but in megawatts, and between the margins and scale and scarcity. IREN’s valuation multiples are based on historical metrics, but they are a function of the company’s evolution from a cyclical Bitcoin mining company to a growth-oriented AI infrastructure provider. With an EV/sales of 35x and an EV/EBITDA of 88x, IREN quotes well above the sector median, but estimates reveal a different picture. On a projected FY2026 revenue of over $1.0 billion and EBITDA and possible FY2027 EBITDA of over $1.2 billion, forward multiples converge drastically, to EV/Sales below 8x and to EV/EBITDA around 15x, aligning more closely with capital-intensive infrastructure peers. This re-rating path relies on scaling its current 23,000-GPU fleet towards 60,000+ units . During the next 18–24 months, investors can anticipate valuation rationalization due to compounding cash flow and maturing AI deals. Data by YCharts Risks: Ambition Scales Meets Execution Reality Though IREN’s renaissance story is enticing, its aggressive growth brings various risks to the company, including both operational and financial. Its greatest near-term challenge rests in execution, as it must scale from leveraging 23,000 to over 60,000 GPUs in a variety of locations and do so while delivering liquid-cooled data centers, infrastructure, and networking. Any construction, delivery, or commissioning of GPUs may delay revenue recognition and stress near-term cash flows. IREN customer concentration also creates risk. A few AI customers are already the majority of its contracted revenue, and thus the company is exposed if demand slows or renewals are not successful. While GPU financing arrangements, normally 24 to 36 months, need to be tightly aligned with customer contracts to prevent mismatches in liquidity, IREN, having good non-dilutive financing and good balance-sheet flexibility, has strong balance-sheet flexibility. However, its leverage increases if cash conversion slows when it’s undertaking aggressive expansion. On the outside, Bitcoin volatility of prices still constitutes an indirect threat. Though growth is now AI-led, Bitcoin mining still provides significant cash flow for reinvestment. A sudden drop in prices of cryptos may limit liquidity. Last but not least, data centre energy use and cross-border GPU supply chain shifts in regulation may disrupt IREN’s cost leadership. Ongoing discipline in execution and diversification still constitute important de-risking of this hyper-growth phase. Final Take For investors, IREN is a very unusual combination of profitability, scalability, and scarcity leadership in the age of AI. With 23,000 GPUs installed, 2.9 GW of contracted power, and over $500 million AI Cloud ARR in sight by 2026, it is transforming into an AI infrastructure utility. With its zero-coupon debt and 0.035/kWh power prices, it builds a stranded moat. As gigawatts and GPUs become increasingly scarce, IREN’s leadership in both places makes it a generational compounder in the AI power economy.",IREN,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-11 10:50:52

The EDF Exaion acquisition gives MARA access to Tier-4, GDPR-compliant AI data centers and European enterprise clients. IREN re-rated on visible GPU contracts, while MARA awaits AI revenue from Exaion and TAE Power integration. Despite record Q2 results, $238.5M revenue, $1.2B EBITDA, $808M net income, MARA trades at only ~9x EV/EBITDA. Successful AI monetization could double MARA’s valuation, closing its 53% discount to peers trading near 20x EV/EBITDA. Investment Thesis Since my previous coverage , Marathon ( MARA ) is up by 32%, but it only trades at ~9x EV/EBITDA, well below peers. The market only sees it as a pure Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner, failing to recognize the transition into an AI-prepared energy infrastructure firm. With owned capacity of 1.1 GW, $0.04/kWh tied-up energy costs, and partnerships with TAE Power Solutions as well as EDF’s Exaion, MARA is developing variable, low-cost compute capacity that is able to serve AI workloads. Once the said assets come online to have recurring AI revenues, MARA’s multiple is able to re-rate fast, catching up with the likes of IREN ( IREN ) and propelling the next leg of the supercycle. Why MARA’s AI Bull Case Remains Hidden, But May Explode Soon Consensus argues the data-center gold rush has only taken any miner with megawatts and a press release. The stock market has only been rewarding the companies that have already demonstrated an ability to convert power interconnects into contracted, GPU-monetized cash flows, before the next capacity constraint, not those with big Bitcoin treasuries or theoretical “AI optionality.” That’s why MARA's meteoric operating performance hasn't translated into a commensurate multiple while the IREN has re-rated sharply. IREN approved a dual-engine architecture, Bitcoin mining supplemented by an AI cloud business with labeled GPUs, liquid-cooling roadmaps, and fresh multi-year contracts, behind 810 MW of currently operating data-center capacity and 50 EH/s by mid-2025. Its SEC filing also records thousands of H100/H200 operational and Blackwell-class GPUs on order, with short-term commissioning targets. That hardware-plus-contract proof, multiplied by an out-year convert zero-coupon, out-priced amid strong demand, has created a reflexive loop within IREN’s equity. MARA, meanwhile, has produced record profitability and a balance sheet fortress, $238.5 million of Q2 revenue (+64% YoY), $1.2 billion adjusted EBITDA, $808 million net income, 57.4 EH/s, and 49,951 BTC treasury, but the quarter's profit was overshadowed by an unexpected $1.2 billion non-cash mark-to-market gain on digital assets. Equity markets have relegated MARA to the “levered Bitcoin beta” category while they await P&L visibility on AI/HPC dollars, rather than strategy slides. Q2 2025 UPDATE Management is taking the right steps. It raised capital through 0% convertible notes due 2032 , invested in behind-the-meter wind power, and is building partnerships focused on grid management and AI edge computing. Further, MARA agreed to buy a 64% stake in Exaion , an EDF subsidiary, the French energy giant, in August 2025 for $168 million, with the option to take ownership to 75% by 2027. Exaion runs HPC and artificial intelligence cloud data centers under partnership with Nvidia ( NVDA ), Deloitte, and 2CRSI, with business from enterprises and governments. This deal is a transformational step for MARA, it moves the company from pure Bitcoin mining into AI and cloud infrastructure, giving it access to Tier-4, GDPR-compliant data centers and European enterprise clients. In short, it turns MARA’s cheap power and grid flexibility into monetized, AI-ready capacity. However, monetization is still early. If MARA completes the EDF/Exaion deal and turns its flexible energy capacity into real AI or enterprise contracts, its valuation could rise quickly. Until then, the stock remains closely tied to Bitcoin prices and mining difficulty. Is MARA’s Formula Really Similar To That Of IREN’s? They appear the same on the surface with low-cost power, humongous data centers, and AI optionality. Their business approaches, however, are very different. IREN is GPU-centric. It’s already deploying thousands of Nvidia chips and has sealed multi-year AI cloud deals. With liquid-coupled expansion and ERCOT interconnects on the horizon, investors take IREN as a miner cashing in from the AI already. That’s why the recently raised 0% convertible was so well tolerated, the market believes in its AI business but not speculatively. MARA is grid-focused. It’s deploying mining revenues to construct versatile, inexpensive power infrastructure capable of powering AI data centers. Running 1.1 GW of operational capacity at only $0.04/kWh, MARA is making its power headway into a future moat. The cooperation with TAE Power Solutions is attempting to make the flexible energy load offered by Bitcoin viable for AI demand, while the upcoming Exaion deal has the potential to provide MARA direct access to European sovereign and enterprise customers focused on AI. Q2 2025 UPDATE In short, both companies raised 0% converts, but MARA’s capability to generate yield from its Bitcoin stack allows it to finance growth without fresh dilution. Thus, so long as investors continue to pursue visible GPU revenue, IREN remains the simpler story. But if the market pivots toward energy versatility and sovereign AI infrastructure, MARA’s thesis is poised to re-rate quickly. Why MARA Still Trades Below Its True Power Value At approximately $20 per share, MARA is valued at about 11.6x trailing earnings, 63% off the industry median of 31.2x, and 9.0x EV/EBITDA compared to 19.4x for the group. Cheap by these trailing figures, much backed by all-time-high profitability and benign energy prices. However, forward estimates paint a murkier picture. Analysts expect $0.48 EPS for FY2025, implying a forward P/E near 42x , and revenue of just under $1 billion, translating to a forward P/S of around 7x, about 2x higher than the sector average. This valuation discrepancy is driven by skepticism over the sustainability of current earnings on an eventual normalizing of non-cash Bitcoin revaluations and shutting post-halving mining margins. The Street obviously doesn't count on one-time marks-to-market benefits that fueled the Q2 $808 million net income . Nevertheless, on an EV/EBITDA basis, however, MARA continues to screen nicely, pricing below half the peer multiple, hinting the underlying business still appears undervalued compared with the sector’s growth names such as IREN or CleanSpark ( CLSK ). Data by YCharts Between the Halving and the Hype: MARA’s Tightrope Risk MARA's greatest risk remains that of economic dependence on Bitcoin. Revenues still directly result from the mining of over 90% of the Bitcoin supply, so the profits are extremely dependent on the price of Bitcoin and the difficulty level of the network. Any sustained decline in the BTC or increase in the global hash rate will quickly constrict margins despite the MARA's low $0.04/kWh power cost . The mining reward decrease coming up in April 2024 has already cut block rewards by half, so the future viability is dependent on the growth of the fee from transactions or other efficiency gain. MARA's 10Q Another critical risk is execution on its transition to AI and HPC. The TAE Power Solutions joint venture and planned acquisition of Exaion are strategic but have not yet generated visible revenue. If integration is stalled or if the market for AI compute is anemic, the market may continue to only value MARA as a Bitcoin miner, capturing multiple expansion. Takeaway Marathon’s narrative is no longer solely bitcoin’s. MARA is still only ~9x EV/EBITDA, well behind peers, as the market only sees miners. However, its 1.1 GW inexpensive power, Exaion agreement, and AI partnerships put it in an ideal place to transition into enterprise-caliber compute, realizing an impressive re-rating in the next 12 months.",BTC-USD|IREN|MARA,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-11 10:54:37

This was its best quarter ever. Its competitors, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin, on the other hand, hardly kept up. However, while Ethereum’s meteoric rise is fueling excitement, market experts are now turning their attention to a new sensation, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a meme coin that analysts believe could skyrocket 66x in Q4 2025. Ethereum’s 66% Surge Leaves Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin Behind According to Coinglass data , Ethereum rose 66.55% in the third quarter of 2025, following a 36.5% rise in the second quarter. In contrast, XRP went up almost 31% from July to the end of September. Ethereum Quarterly Price Change | Coinglass Solana had a hard time keeping up with Ethereum, and Dogecoin’s climb was very little compared to Ethereum’s huge gain. But now, many who invest are waiting for the next token that will increase quickly and make them a lot of money. That’s where Little Pepe (LILPEPE) enters the spotlight. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Poised for a 66x Breakout in Q4 Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is rapidly emerging as the most anticipated token of Q4, with many analysts predicting a 66x return potential based on its current presale momentum and strong investor demand. The project’s community-first approach and transparent ecosystem have made it one of the standout meme coins in 2025. During its presale, LILPEPE raised over $25.47 million by the end of Stage 12, selling out ahead of schedule. The current Stage 13 is priced at $0.0022 and has already raised over $1.30 million, reflecting a surge in community participation and confidence. Investors are treating LILPEPE as the next big meme revolution on the Ethereum blockchain. With an enthusiastic community, solid tokenomics, and real-time engagement incentives, it stands as a project capable of making early backers smile all the way to the bank. To celebrate the presale success, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) launched an extraordinary $777,000 giveaway, where 10 lucky winners will each receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens, which has already drawn over 439,000 entries. But the excitement doesn’t stop there. A new mega giveaway is also running across presale stages 12–17, rewarding the top 3 biggest buyers with 5, 3, and 2 ETH, respectively. This event will continue until Stage 17 is fully sold out, motivating strong early participation. Such marketing strategies have amplified LILPEPE’s visibility and attracted investors eager for a project that blends fun, fairness, and real potential for exponential growth. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is More Than Just a Meme Coin LILPEPE’s roadmap paints an exciting picture. The project playfully refers to its current phase as the “pregnancy stage,” humorously describing itself as “Cooking in the cryptowomb with Mumma Pepe got a baby on the way!” This creative branding has captured the internet’s attention, driving a viral following across social media. LILPEPE has been fully audited by CertiK, achieving an impressive security score of 95.49%, a major milestone for investor confidence. Few meme tokens can boast such credibility this early in their lifecycle. Exchange Listings and Future Plans The Little Pepe (LILPEPE) team has already confirmed a listing on CoinMarketCap, signaling growing recognition within the crypto ecosystem. Plans are in motion to list on two major centralized exchanges (CEX) following the presale, with an ambition to secure a spot on the largest global exchange soon after. These upcoming listings could trigger a surge in trading volume and visibility, potentially aligning with the projected 66x price growth analysts are forecasting for Q4 2025. Conclusion With Ethereum outperforming Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin last quarter, the stage is perfectly set for the next explosive meme coin to capture the spotlight. As Little Pepe (LILPEPE) continues to climb through its presale stages, early adopters could be positioning themselves for one of Q4’s biggest success stories. If Ethereum’s 66% surge impressed you, keep your eyes on Little Pepe (LILPEPE), because this token could 66x in Q4 and rewrite the meme coin narrative forever.

Moving beyond standard measures such as downloads and transaction counts, Elkaleh describes how this trial intends to reveal true on-chain user behaviours, providing fresh insights into discovery, engagement, and project growth across worldwide markets. Here are the excerpts from the interview: Metrics and results from Spindl Invezz: Measuring results: What specific metrics do you expect to gather from the pilot with Spindl, and how do these differ from traditional Web3 adoption indicators? What’s exciting about this pilot is that, for the first time, we can look beyond surface-level metrics like downloads or transaction counts. With Spindl, we’re trying to understand who our users are on-chain — not their identities, but their behavioural patterns. We’ll be able to map wallet addresses to different types of activity, see how they discover projects, what they interact with first, and how that changes over time. It’s less about raw numbers and more about understanding real user journeys in Web3, something traditional adoption metrics just don’t capture. Regional expansion Invezz: The release mentions a focus on Asia—what particular markets in the region are you prioritising, and how do user behaviors there differ from those in other regions? This partnership aligns with Spindl and Base’s broader expansion strategy in Asia, where on-chain adoption is accelerating. But from Bitget Wallet’s side, our focus is truly global — we now serve over 80 million users worldwide, with strong user growth in regions like Africa, Europe, and Latin America alongside Asia. What’s unique about this pilot is that it gives us the chance to observe how users discover and engage with projects in very different contexts. That said, the integration is still very new, so we don’t yet have enough comparative data across regions. Over time, we hope these insights will help us better tailor how discovery and attribution work for users everywhere, not just in one geography. Invezz: How might this attribution model change the way smaller or emerging projects compete for visibility within Bitget Wallet? For smaller or emerging projects, attribution really levels the playing field. Instead of guessing which campaign worked, they can see, in a privacy-safe way, which channels led to actual on-chain actions. It helps projects spend smarter and build more direct relationships with users, which is crucial in a crowded ecosystem like Web3. Base integration and privacy Invezz: Since Spindl is now part of Base, are there already concrete plans for deeper technical integrations beyond this pilot, such as identity solutions or interoperability tools across ecosystems? Spindl is now part of Base, so this partnership naturally creates a bridge for future collaboration. Right now, we’re focused on getting the fundamentals right, consistent event standards and comparable metrics across projects. But we do see potential down the line for deeper integrations, whether that’s around interoperability, data portability, or shared attribution frameworks that work across ecosystems. Invezz: What safeguards are in place to ensure that this type of user attribution does not compromise privacy, given the emphasis on on-chain traceability? We’re taking a very privacy-first approach here. Everything we measure is tied to pseudonymous wallet activity, which means there’s no personal data involved. What makes Spindl’s model strong is that it uses on-chain transparency to verify outcomes, not to expose users. Users should still feel fully in control while projects get better insights into what’s actually working. Business impact Invezz: Do you anticipate this new approach to attribution and discovery becoming a monetisation channel for Bitget Wallet, or will it primarily serve as an added value for users at no direct cost? For now, this isn’t about monetisation at all. We see attribution as a way to add value — helping users find quality projects and helping projects reach the right users more efficiently. There’s no direct cost to users, and no plans to turn it into an ad channel. It’s more about improving the overall discovery experience and making Web3 growth measurable in a healthy way.

The initiative marks Ethereum’s commitment to integrating privacy as a native feature throughout its ecosystem and promotes collaboration amongst developers. Led by Igor Barinov, founder of Blockscout and Gnosis Chain, the cluster currently has 47 engineers, cryptographers, and researchers. With the support of the institutional privacy task force (IPTF), the team will ensure the organization works in compliance with global privacy requirements. Since the announcement, developer participation in various Ethereum privacy projects has already increased by 12%. Interestingly, as Ethereum narrows its focus back to privacy and security, another emerging project, MAGACOIN FINANCE , has gained positive attention for doing the same at a much earlier adoption stage. Ethereum Foundation’s New Privacy Initiative The launch precedes several crucial privacy product debuts, including Kohaku, a privacy-focused browser wallet and SDK that allows secure private transactions. Kohaku will launch at EFDevcon in late November with zero-knowledge reliance Ethereum wallets. According to Nicolas Consigny, the Foundation Coordinator, Kohaku is a “set of primitives that gives wallets security and privacy.” The SDK provides full and selective integration options for developers to choose according to their privacy needs. Kohaku is a fork of the Ambire wallet created for devs and users who place a high value on privacy on decentralized applications. Its implementation will launch on the Ethereum mainnet, then layer 2 networks supporting progressive scalability principles. Kohaku Enhances Wallet Security and Customization Kohaku’s plugin architecture allows developers to choose privacy modules that are suitable for their projects. The first phase is Helios light client, which facilitates users’ local validation of blockchain data without relying on third-party RPC providers. This limits exposure to centralized endpoints while enhancing transaction integrity. Kohaku also supports private payment, traffic obfuscation, IP masking, and multi-layered balance aggregation over privacy systems. Developers have also introduced RPC hijack defenders, meaning that dApps cannot override user settings. Each wallet connection creates a new address by default, reducing data linkage. In addition, the Foundation is developing a Wallet Connection Kit, a privacy-first protocol that establishes a peer-to-peer JSON-RPC connection between wallets and decentralized apps. Advanced Privacy Features and Security Innovations Ethereum’s privacy spectrum is in the process of testing zero-knowledge recovery tools, such as ZKemail, ZKpassport, and Anon Adhar. The tools hope to standardize recovery processes using low intermediaries. Developers have additionally implemented a Post-quantum killswitch, which permits users to switch up to quantum-resistant accounts utilizing Falcon or Dilithium encryption. The technology is also developed to protect assets from anticipated future attacks from quantum computing. In addition to software, the Foundation is working on a zero-knowledge hardware signer implementable in many privacy schemes such as Jubjub and Bandersnatch curves. The SDK contains transaction controls that place a limit on spending per signer and optional peer-to-peer broadcasting to bypass centralized RPC nodes. Developer Growth and Post-Launch Roadmap The privacy cluster has already led to a 12% boost in developer engagement, highlighting the increasing interest in leveraging privacy for innovation. In the post-launch roadmap, the Foundation intends to publish a native Ethereum browser that will support secure access to decentralized applications. This browser will allow IPFS-based interfaces, enhanced peer-to-peer networking, and AI-enabled local risk assessment. The system, dubbed local AI transaction scoring, will enable users to detect risky smart contracts without the need to leak sensitive data outside. Future work will focus on the development of zkPOAPs (zero-knowledge proof badges) and privacy-preserving recovery mechanisms. The Foundation anticipates complete privacy integration once native account abstraction has been accomplished, projected for 2026, through the use of ZK-EVM and ZK-RISC-V systems to provide full privacy verification on the client. While Ethereum’s Foundation sharpens its focus on privacy and security, another project is quietly building a similar reputation from the ground up, MAGACOIN FINANCE. Still in its early stages, the team has taken an uncommon step for a new entrant: completing a full smart-contract audit by HashEx , one of the most trusted blockchain security firms. The report’s verdict was decisive; the code is clean, secure, and free of concealed threats. That outcome has boosted investor confidence and sent a strong signal to the wider market that MAGACOIN FINANCE is not chasing hype but engineering trust. Analysts see this as more than a box-checking exercise. For a young project, early transparency and risk control indicate discipline rarely found at launch. By embedding security at its core, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping itself into a long-term contender, one capable of matching the industry’s best practices while charting its own course toward a safer, community-driven blockchain future. Conclusion The Ethereum Foundation’s new cluster represents a major step toward building a privacy-first blockchain ecosystem. With initiatives like Kohaku and the upcoming Ethereum browser, privacy is evolving from a feature into a standard. At the same time, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrate that Ethereum’s influence is spreading beyond its own ecosystem. By embracing early audits, transparent development, and strong security foundations, it echoes the values driving Ethereum’s own roadmap. As privacy and compliance become essential to blockchain’s next phase, Ethereum and newer projects are setting the tone for a safer, more trustworthy digital future.

According to documents shared by crypto commentator SMQKE on X, Ripple’s integration into the European financial system is through a partnership with SIA, an Italian payments infrastructure provider known for supporting many of the European Central Bank’s systems. From SWIFT To The Eurosystem Ripple has always positioned itself as a challenger to SWIFT in global payments with its RippleNet blockchain solution that promises faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border transactions. Its technology has been adopted by several financial institutions, especially in the Middle East, but its quiet introduction into Europe’s financial backbone through the Eurosystem could be Ripple’s most consequential achievement yet. Documents show that Ripple has been formally integrated into the Eurosystem through its strategic partnership with SIA, an Italian payments infrastructure provider that connects hundreds of European institutions via its SIAnet and SIAchain frameworks.

The interoperability between crypto asset platforms and… pic.twitter.com/OTKu7bGHDi — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 7, 2025 SIAchain, developed by SIA, is a private blockchain network that connects more than 580 institutions globally using the SIAnet secure communication layer. The platform supports multiple distributed ledger technologies, including Ripple. Ripple’s presence within SIAchain effectively builds a bridge between Europe’s most important payment systems like TARGET2, TIPS, and the European Collateral Management System, and blockchain technology. This connection allows tokenized assets and central bank money to flow within the same secure environment, including Ripple. The DLT-TARGET Initiative This integration is part of the Eurosystem’s DLT-TARGET initiative. DLT-TARGET is a program that’s designed to link blockchain networks with the European Central Bank’s settlement systems. The pilot phase has already processed more than 200 transactions valued at over €1.6 billion, showing the system’s readiness for real financial operations. Therefore, SIAchain’s structure effectively allows the use of Ripple’s technology to facilitate interoperability in the European Union without compromising the Eurosystem’s regulatory or operational standards. The Bank of Greece has been a major contributor to the Eurosystem’s DLT efforts. Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras noted on September 29 that stablecoins, which is now a $250 billion market, cannot be ignored, as they have become a substantial part of the financial ecosystem. As such, they must be integrated into mainstream financial systems under proper oversight. The institution’s work focuses on connecting tokenized assets with central bank money, a step aligned with Ripple’s technological framework and the broader European blockchain strategy. The aim is for central bank money settlements for DLT-based transactions in relevant platforms to be ready by next year. Europe’s financial system is gradually moving to a future where blockchains and central bank infrastructure will work hand in hand. Ripple and XRP are well positioned to take advantage of this movement.

UiPath's new alliances are expected to accelerate ARR growth, with management guiding for the first positive ARR inflection in years by Q4. Valuation remains attractive, with forward revenue multiples below historical averages and potential for further upside if growth accelerates as forecasted. Insider selling is a concern, but UiPath's improved positioning in the AI ecosystem supports a bullish investment thesis. Investment Thesis It’s been a while since I wrote about the automation platform company, UiPath (PATH). In May last year, I explained why I expected “the company’s revenue run rates to mature over time"" as its large enterprise customers would slow spending on UiPath’s platform. Since my previous coverage, UiPath’s shares fell, and without the lack of meaningful catalysts over the last 2-3 quarters, I did not feel compelled to update my thesis on the company. Exhibit A: Author’s coverage history of UiPath over the past year and ratings performance. (Seeking Alpha) But I have been following the company, especially the recent round of updates the company has shared, and I believe the company is set to see its first signs of meaningful inflection in its ARR by the end of CY25. The company has realized the value of industry partnerships in the age of AI and has been moving quickly. Per my observations, markets are discounting the coming inflection in its ARR, giving investors an opportunistic entry point in UiPath’s shares. I am upgrading UiPath to a Buy. What Is UiPath Doing Differently This Time? Investors are quite familiar with cloud services such as companies such as ServiceNow ( NOW ) or Snowflake (SNOW) that have done reasonably well for themselves in the age of AI versus most of the other players in the cloud services industry. In my view, one of the reasons these cloud services companies have succeeded when others have not is because they moved quickly to forge partnerships with important industry leaders in the same market or adjacent markets to create micro AI ecosystems. The big benefit of these industry partnerships in the age of AI is that it enhances mutual productivity and accelerate AI-powered innovations at scale, eventually becoming accretive to the revenue bases of all partners within the micro ecosystem, as MIT Sloan suggests . Companies like ServiceNow or Snowflake moved quickly to partner with other rapidly growing AI beneficiaries such as Nvidia ( NVDA ) or Microsoft ( MSFT ) early on. So far, UiPath has never really understood the value strategic partnerships could provide, in my view, and has relied on a legacy-based revenue-sourcing framework of completely leaning on GSIs (global system integrators). GSIs are business partners, typically value-added resellers and/or business consultants like Deloitte, Accenture ( ACN ), etc. When asked about the impact these partners were having on UiPath’s sales at a conference early last year , here is how management reasoned for the case of partnering with GSIs: GSIs, they are a great introductory into customers where they are in the midst of big transformation process projects of which automation can be an important part of that. Automation can play a key role in driving success and accelerating that migration. So, we're super excited. It's early stages, gone through enablement, education, there is a quota component, so they can retire quotas, as part of co-selling automation. In the same conference they even announced the hiring of Bronwyn Hastings , “a seasoned executive who has built very large channel and partner models.” 21 months later, Ms. Hastings appears to have moved out of UiPath, while the company’s ARR kept decelerating every single quarter, strongly indicating how the GSI sales strategy failed UiPath in lifting up their revenues & ARR. Exhibit B: UiPath’s ARR vs TTM revenue trends and management’s guidance indicates acceleration for the first time in Q4 this year. (Company sources) However, all of that has changed, based on the recent slate of updates that I noticed in UiPath’s IR page . Here are all the announcements UiPath made on a single day in September: Allowing customers to automate end-to-end processes using UiPath agents interacting with Microsoft’s Azure AI Foundry agents and models . Uniting UiPath’s Agentic Automation platform with Snowflake’s Cortex AI platform of AI agents Expanding UiPath’s Agentic Automation capabilities into Alphabet-owned ( GOOG ) Google Gemini. And the big one is collaborating with Nvidia ( NVDA ) to bring automation capabilities to Nvidia’s automation platform Nemotron as well as to Nvidia’s NIM, the microservices inference platform. All these partnerships indicate a pivotal shift in UiPath’s sales strategy in forming alliances with some of the largest beneficiaries of the AI ecosystem today, which I strongly believe will give the company’s ARR inflection a much-needed facelift. I cannot recall a time in the company’s history where UiPath has made such strong shifts away from its usual GSI-led revenue engine. I suspect management is already accounting for a small boost on the backdrop of these partnerships, which is why they have guided ARR to inflect higher and be positive for its first acceleration of many years in Q4 this year. UiPath is banking on its agentic automation product Maestro, which automates agentic orchestration and the process of building AI agents. Here is another way. I have charted the y/y growth in ARR and TTM revenues, which factors in management’s FY26 revenue guidance of $1.6B and FY26 ARR outlook of $1.8B. Exhibit C: UiPath's growth trends in ARR and TTM Revenues. (Company sources) If ARR inflects towards the trajectory that management has forecasted, I would not be surprised if UiPath’s FY26 revenues eventually come in higher than the $1.6B revenue guidance. Valuations Indicate UiPath’s Multiple Could Expand At the moment, UiPath’s shares trade at a forward-looking revenue multiple of 4.9x FY26 revenues of $1.6B, growing 10% y/y. This is slightly under the 24-month average forward revenue multiple of 5.1-5.8x forward revenues. Markets have also become optimistic about UiPath’s strategic shift away from GSI partners towards industry alliances with leading AI beneficiaries, which explains the ~30% expansion in revenue multiples in the past 30 days. Exhibit D: UiPath’s forward-looking revenue multiples for this year and next year. ( YCharts ) But if investors observe the forward-looking revenue multiple for FY27, they will observe that UiPath’s revenue multiple of ~4.5x FY27 revenues worth $1.7B, growing 8.5%, is still cheap. With ARR moving up, I suspect analysts will eventually upgrade their revenue outlook for next year, possibly expecting ~10% y/y growth in FY27 as well. That implies a forward valuation of 5.1-5.5x FY27 revenues, above the 4.5x UiPath’s shares currently trade at. This suggests a PT of $19.6 per share, or ~15% upside from current levels of ~$17. Risks & Other Factors To Note As optimistic as I’d like to be, I have to admit, I’m not fond of the broad-based insider selling that can be seen in UiPath’s shares. It does not echo conviction shared by management in their own shares at a time when I do see signs of an inflection in the business. It doesn’t stop my analysis from recommending a Buy rating but it is a risk investors should note nevertheless. Exhibit E: Trends of insider selling in UiPath’s shares (finviz.com) Takeaway I am beginning to like UiPath’s strategy to position itself as a beneficiary of the AI revolution. I think they have one of the best shots at regaining control of their growth narrative in the age of AI to offer their agentic automation products to customers. I am recommending a Buy rating on UiPath.",PATH,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-11 11:02:35

The stablecoin, called USDe , is supposed to stick to the value of the U.S. dollar, but then came during a brutal selloff that hit every corner of the crypto market, making all the wrong kinds of history. This happened just minutes after President Donald Trump lashed out at president Xi Jinping by announcing yet another ‘new’ 100% tariff on Chinese exports, triggering a market-wide panic that pushed traders into safe havens like gold and Treasuries, but not crypto. More than $19 billion in long crypto positions were liquidated in less than a day, with over 1.6 million traders getting wiped out, according to data from Coinglass. Trump’s China tirade pulled the rug from under a market already slipping. By Saturday morning, Bitcoin had dropped below $110,000, down over 14% from its all-time high of around $127,600. The pace of the crash overwhelmed exchanges, with Coinglass showing that Binance was only logging one liquidation order per second, so the real damage may actually be far worse than recorded. How amazing is that? Cryptopolitan believes the next support level sits at $100,000, and if that breaks, it could end the bull run that’s lasted nearly three years. Right now, the Bitcoin options market is showing the most put strikes at $110,000, with the next highest at $100,000, so yeah, traders are definitely bracing for deeper pain. The worst is quite literally yet to come. USDe collapses as traders flee risky assets With a market cap of $14 billion, USDe ranks as the third-biggest digital dollar in circulation. Binance, the largest exchange on the planet, confirmed in a blog post that “our team is currently conducting a thorough review of the impacted users, the details surrounding these liquidations, and the appropriate compensation measures,” specifically mentioning USDe and two other depegged tokens. Ethena Labs , the company behind USDe, said on X that the token is still over-collateralized, but that didn’t calm the markets. The model Ethena uses is built on a version of the basis trade, where the system tries to profit off differences between spot and futures prices. It works well when the market is moving up and funding rates, the fee paid by leveraged traders, are high. But when the bottom drops out like it did this week, that strategy turns to dead weight. The funding rate for Ether had collapsed to the lowest level seen since the yen-carry trade unwind back in August last year, which crushed the returns that backstop USDe’s 5.5% yield. It didn’t stop there. ENA, the governance token that runs Ethena’s protocol, tanked as much as 43% in 24 hours, based on data pulled from CoinGecko. Meanwhile, CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap still list USDe as a stablecoin, even after the peg broke, as is typical. Unlike USDT and USDC, which are backed by Treasury bills, USDe is tied to crypto strategies, strategies that can crumble during panic events like this one.

The announcement, attributed to crypto commentator Chad Steingraber, has rippled through newsfeeds and trading desks—and now demands a closer look at what it means, how it may unfold, and the risks that remain. The Signal from Steingraber Late in the trading day, Chad Steingraber published a post on X revealing that Grayscale had filed an amended registration statement and proposed a new ticker symbol, GXRP, for its XRP vehicle. His disclosure suggests that the firm is actively pushing to convert its private trust into a spot-based ETF. Steingraber’s post has since been echoed by other crypto analysts and community outlets, spurring fresh attention on the regulatory documents now entering the public domain. Though Steingraber’s post drew eyes, it did not provide full legal language or every amendment. As with all filings of this magnitude, investors and observers must confirm the changes directly from SEC filings and Grayscale’s own regulatory disclosures. Grayscale XRP Trust will convert to public ETF! Everything filed today at market close. GXRP —> Spot https://t.co/tclHL8SEMA pic.twitter.com/PWwpHbGEmw — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) October 10, 2025 Legal and Regulatory Journey to This Moment Grayscale first entered the public spotlight with its efforts to bring Bitcoin and Ethereum exposure into regulated ETF wrappers. The firm now appears to be turning that same machinery toward XRP . In January 2025, Grayscale filed a registration statement (Form S-1) to convert its XRP Trust into an ETF and sought a 19b-4 application from NYSE Arca to list the shares. That filing explicitly contemplates renaming the instrument “Grayscale XRP Trust ETF” and lists “GXRP” as the expected ticker, assuming regulatory approval. Yet, as of that registration, the NYSE Arca 19b-4 application was not approved, and Grayscale acknowledged that the listing could be delayed or never occur. In parallel, a broader wave of filings is reshaping the crypto-ETF landscape. At least six asset managers—Bitwise, Canary Capital, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and WisdomTree—have submitted amendments or new registrations for spot XRP ETFs, signaling growing conviction that the SEC may soon green-light XRP exposure within regulated funds. Moreover, the broader context is shifting. The SEC recently adopted revised listing standards that could streamline approvals for crypto ETFs, potentially reducing the timeline from 270 days to as few as 75 days for qualifying products. Grayscale’s success in converting its multi-asset fund (GDLC) into a spot ETF approved under accelerated review adds confidence to its approach and may serve as a precedent. How the Conversion Would Work If Steingraber’s S-1/A amendment is accurate, it likely outlines key details such as share creation/redemption, XRP custody, and potential investor fees or dilution. The trust would hold XRP directly, and shares would aim to closely track the value of those holdings (less expenses). Under current proposals, creation units would be issued in standard baskets (e.g., 10,000 shares) via authorized participants depositing XRP into the trust. Redemptions might operate similarly. The S-1 filing indicates the trust will rename itself on the effective date to reflect its new ETF status. Importantly, while this structure aims to deliver “spot” exposure, many ETF risks remain, including slippage, custody security, regulatory changes, and differential treatment of digital assets under U.S. securities law. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Impact and Market Significance If approved and listed, GXRP would let investors buy XRP through traditional brokerage accounts, retirement plans, and institutional channels, eliminating the need for crypto wallets or exchange accounts. That broader on-ramp could materially increase institutional demand for XRP. The credibility conferred by an SEC-registered structure would also elevate XRP’s profile as a regulated asset. The timing is notable: regulatory clarity around XRP has improved recently after legal developments involving Ripple and the SEC. Additionally, the approval of GXRP could accelerate approvals for other altcoin ETFs, creating a domino effect in the crypto investment landscape. What Comes Next and What to Watch First and foremost, confirmation of the S-1/A amendment is key. Readers should review the filing on SEC EDGAR to verify effective dates, exhibits, and risk disclosures. Then comes the SEC’s decision on the 19b-4 listing application: whether Arca can list shares under Rule 8.201-E (commodity-based trust shares) or under newly adopted generic standards. Note that a prior listing change proposal for the Grayscale XRP Trust was withdrawn in September 2025. The SEC timeline matters. Many XRP ETF applications—including Grayscale’s—are currently on clock deadlines set for October 2025, when the SEC must act or extend review. Delays have already been common in altcoin-ETF approvals. Market sensitivity will be high: filings, SEC commentary, exchange actions, and public comments may all move sentiment. Even approval will not guarantee smooth adoption—execution, liquidity, and competitive offerings will challenge early momentum. Chad Steingraber’s post may have pulled back the curtain on what many insiders suspected, but the path from amended filing to fully tradable instrument is complex and fraught with regulatory, legal, and operational hurdles. Still, if Grayscale’s conversion effort succeeds, it may become a watershed moment for XRP’s institutional integration.

52988430,https://invezz.com/?p=2920882,1760181557,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Wall street outlook: 5 factors that could shape the week ahead,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/11/wall-street-outlook-5-factors-that-could-shape-the-week-ahead-5/,"Wall Street is looking at a volatile week ahead as US President Donald Trump’s latest tariffs on China is expected to increase the uncertainties among investors. The ongoing government shutdown is already testing the nerves of the market, and adding geopolitical tensions to that will work as a perfect recipe for a storm. Q3 earnings reports will further change the dynamics with big banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo all set to share their performance next week. 5 factors that could shape the Wall Street week ahead 1. US President Donald Trump made a major announcement on Friday as he decided to impose additional 100% tariffs on China , taking the world back to a sort of trade war situation. China is yet to respond officially to the additional US tariffs, but the Asian country has signaled a tough approach in the past few days. This hike raises the total US tariffs on Chinese goods to around 130%. The move is a response to China’s recent export restrictions on rare earth minerals, crucial for tech, defense, and electric vehicle industries. To add more to the conflict, Donald Trump has also announced export restrictions on critical software. The announcement, which came late on Friday, shook the global markets with Wall Street indices shedding upto 900 points. 2. The US government has been in a shutdown since October 1, and it’s starting to hit federal workers hard. About 900,000 employees have been furloughed, and another 700,000 are having to work without pay while the budget deadlock drags on. Things took a sharper turn recently when the Trump administration started issuing mass layoffs, sending reduction-in-force notices to over 4,000 federal workers across agencies like Treasury and Health and Human Services. As negotiations remain stuck, President Trump has blamed Democrats for both the shutdown and the layoffs, calling the job losses “Democrat-oriented” amid all the economic uncertainty. 3. Next week is a big one for the US earnings season. Major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup will start releasing their reports, and investors will be watching closely for any signs about the health of the economy. Analysts are expecting the S&P 500 to show around 8% year-over-year earnings growth, which would continue its recent streak. It’s not just the banks; companies across tech, finance, and industrials, including Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, are also set to report. Traders will be paying attention not just to the numbers, but also to what companies say about the future, especially with trade tensions and the government shutdown potentially affecting consumer spending and corporate outlooks. 4. The investors on Wall Street continue to operate in the dark as the release of economic data remains suspended due to the ongoing shutdown in Washington. Key federal agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau have suspended operations, delaying critical reports, including the monthly jobs and Consumer Price Index data. Next week, critical data is scheduled to be released like retail sales, producer price index, industrial production numbers etc, but as the deadlock between White House and Congress continues, the traders have manage without any signals from the economy. 5. The crypto market took a huge hit this week, losing over $19 billion in leveraged positions after President Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese goods. Bitcoin dropped more than 8%, briefly falling to around $102,000 before bouncing back to $113,000. Ethereum and other major altcoins weren’t spared either; XRP, for example, fell by over 22%. This wild sell-off really showed how closely crypto markets are tied to Wall Street. Fear and uncertainty in traditional markets are spilling over into digital assets. While some people see it as just a market correction, it’s a clear reminder of how sensitive crypto can be to big geopolitical and economic shocks.

52987378,https://cryptonews.com/?p=436649,1760181600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52987378.jpeg,YZi Labs-Backed Perp DEX Aster Delays Airdrop Over Data Issues,https://cryptonews.com/news/yzi-labs-backed-perp-dex-aster-delays-airdrop-over-data-issues/,"Aster (ASTER), the decentralized exchange backed by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s investment firm YZi Labs, has postponed its upcoming airdrop after identifying “potential data inconsistencies.” Key Takeaways: Aster delayed its airdrop after uncovering potential data inconsistencies affecting some user allocations. The postponement follows user complaints about inaccurate results from the project’s “S2 airdrop checker” tool. DeFiLlama also suspended Aster’s trading data amid Binance-like volume correlations. Originally set for October 14, the airdrop will now take place on October 20, pending internal verification, the team announced on Friday . Aster Promises Fair Adjustments After Users Flag Airdrop Allocation Errors The Aster team said it would update “certain users’ allocations where needed,” noting that “for most users, allocations should not fall below the final snapshot RH% in each epoch.” The cause of the discrepancies was not fully detailed, but the decision follows user complaints about inaccurate results from the “S2 airdrop checker” tool released earlier in the day. One trader claimed an allocation of only 336 ASTER tokens despite having generated over $9 million in trading volume. In total, 153,000 wallets are eligible for the Aster Genesis: Stage 2 airdrop. Formerly known as APX Finance, Aster is a cross-chain perpetual futures DEX operating on Solana, Ethereum, Arbitrum, and BNB Chain. The platform, which aims to rival Hyperliquid, recorded more than $420 billion in trading activity last month, according to The Block. At the time of writing, ASTER is trading near $1.69, largely steady despite broader market weakness driven by renewed trade tensions following Donald Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. Last week, DeFiLlama temporarily removed trading volume data for Aster after detecting unusually high correlations with Binance’s perpetual volumes. Co-founder 0xngmi announced the delisting on October 5, citing data integrity concerns after Aster’s XRP/USDT and ETH/USDT pairs showed nearly 1:1 correlation ratios with Binance. The analytics site said it lacks the granular data needed to confirm potential wash trading, prompting the suspension until verification becomes possible. The move has divided the crypto community, sparking debate over whether the volumes were manipulated or simply reflected a liquidity migration from Binance to Aster. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT criticized Anndy Lian for downplaying the issue, while Lian argued that volume alignment across major projects is normal and that Aster’s activity mirrors broader market behavior. Such an awful take normalizing wash trading is bad for the industry “I am commenting on this fairly as an observer” >Zero posts about HYPE and only two posts mentioning HL which Aster was also referenced >Meanwhile almost every other post is about Aster Worst thing Aster… pic.twitter.com/UoE1WX4OHm — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) October 6, 2025 He added that aggressive spending to gain market share is a business decision, not necessarily manipulation. Aster Reimburses Traders After XPL Price Glitch Triggers Liquidations Last month, Aster reimbursed users in USDT after a sudden price spike in the XPL perpetual contract triggered forced liquidations. The anomaly, which occurred during the transition from pre-launch to live trading, saw the price of XPL briefly surge to over $4, well above its $1.30 average on other platforms. The exchange responded quickly, completing the first round of reimbursements within hours and compensating affected traders for liquidation and trading fees. While the exact cause remains unconfirmed, early speculation points to a misconfigured index price or missing sync with live market data. Aster has pledged to continue its investigation into the incident. The glitch followed the mainnet launch of Plasma, a stablecoin-focused Layer 1 whose native token XPL rapidly hit a $12 billion valuation.

Traders watched the token spike above $2.90 on double the average volume, only for profit-taking to reverse those gains sharply. As a result, a new supply area consolidated at $2.92 to $2.93, while macro headwinds such as Fed policy expectations and trade tensions weigh down on risk flows. Moreover, XRP closed at $2.85, down 2.5% from intraday highs amidst the volatility of crypto prices in general. This action highlights why these days investors pay attention to crypto predictions closely. Thus, the event highlights ongoing questions around why crypto is down today. XRP faces supply pressure Profit-taking reversed XRP’s intraday rally after it breached $2.90 resistance. The token peaked at $2.926 before sellers dominated, confirming a breakdown on low closing volume of 2.97 million. Consequently, support at $2.86 cracked, turning it into resistance. Now, $2.85 holds as the key floor, with a break risking a drop to $2.80. Moreover, high-volume rejection at $2.92 to $2.93 marks that zone firmly. Traders eye macro catalysts for clues on future moves. In fact, institutional accumulation lingers beneath the surface, yet short-term bearish momentum prevails. Therefore, crypto prices today reflect this caution, prompting shifts in crypto investment strategies. XRP tests critical floor XRP rallied 2% on October 8, jumping from $2.88 to $2.93 amid 86.6 million in turnover. That surge nearly doubled the 24-hour average, tied to central bank shifts and global tensions. However, U.S. close brought heavy selling, settling the token at $2.851. As a result, the 3% range between $2.85 and $2.93 exposed vulnerabilities. Furthermore, why are crypto-crashing patterns emerging here, with regulatory whispers adding weight? Thus, XRP’s path hinges on whether $2.85 endures or yields. In turn, this setup fuels debates on investing in crypto amid uncertainty. Mutuum Finance presale accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has drawn steady inflows as phase 6 of its 11-phase presale hits 60% full. Investors have raised $17,100,000 since the presale began, onboarding 16,840 total MUTM holders. Currently, phase 6 unfolds at $0.035 per token, a 250% rise from the phase one price of $0.01. Moreover, this phase sells out rapidly, narrowing the window for entry at these levels. Soon, phase 7 opens with a 14.3% hike to $0.04. At launch, MUTM reached $0.06, promising current buyers a 420% return. Consequently, crypto investing heats up around such structured gains. Mutuum builds lending protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently announced the development of its lending and borrowing protocol . Version 1 deploys to Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, featuring a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and liquidator bot among core elements. Initial assets are ETH and USDT, which will be used for lending, borrowing, or as a form of collateral. Furthermore, the team successfully completed its Certik audit, which granted it a score of 90/100 tokens, indicating strong security. In addition, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project launched the bug bounty program using CertiK, offering $50,000 USDT for critical, major, minor, and low-severity bugs. Thus, these steps enhance the integrity of the platform. Meanwhile, the MUTM team released a dashboard to keep track of the top 50 holders who receive bonus tokens for holding up their ranks. Mutuum increases engagement for users Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched the biggest giveaway in its history to celebrate the presale milestone. A total of $100,000 in MUTM will be given to 10 winners – $10,000 each. Participants provide a legitimate wallet address for the transfer of prizes. They do all quests meticulously to increase odds. Minimum presale investment of $50 required Moreover, this initiative spotlights MUTM’s utility in decentralized lending, where users earn yields on idle assets or borrow against holdings without custody loss. Borrow interest rates adjust via utilization, keeping liquidity balanced—low when abundant, higher when scarce. Stable rates lock predictability for borrowers, starting above variable levels. Overcollateralization safeguards positions, with liquidations incentivized by bonuses. Deposit and borrow caps limit risks for volatile tokens. Loan-to-value ratios cap borrowings at safe thresholds, like 75% for stable assets. Consequently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as a practical crypto investment amid XRP’s wobbles. XRP breakout fails, MUTM gains ground XRP’s rejection at $2.93 exposes frailties in current crypto prices, yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands firm as the crypto to buy now. Key supports teeter while MUTM’s presale surges with clear utility in lending protocols. Investors weigh these shifts carefully.

In 2027, the price range is expected to be between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, the range is expected to be between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings this year. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits later in the year. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $22.74 Market cap $9.6B Trading volume $3.04B Circulating supply 422.27M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $28.44 24-hour low $10.64 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 6.20% 50-day SMA $27.96 200-day SMA $22.90 Sentiment Bearish Green days 15/30 (50%) Fear and Greed Index 64 (Greed) Avalanche price analysis As of October 11, AVAX’s price dropped by 18.94% in 24 hours, underperforming the broader crypto market (-9.07%) and aligning with the broader altcoin momentum. Its trading volume rose (339.63%), showing trader conviction in the market trend. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView Earlier this month, AVAX attempted a recovery, which saw it rise from a low of $24.31 to a high of $36.16. It faced strong resistance at its 30-day macro supply zone ($34.00-$39.38). The coin is now reversing from the high and has made a sharp drop in the last 24 hours. The William Alligator trendlines show that its volatility is rising. The histograms (-1.08) show rising negative momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s run, which broke support at the 5-day SMA ($28.29), falling from $27.80 to $8.52. It corrected in the next hours and now trades at $2270 mark. The RSI indicator (27.62) shows it trades in oversold territory. The latest candle formation, consisting of three white soldiers, indicates a reversing market. Avalanche technical analysis: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 26.82 SELL SMA 5 28.29 SELL SMA 10 29.67 SELL SMA 21 30.32 SELL SM 50 27.96 SELL SMA 100 25.31 BUY SMA 200 22.90 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 29.41 SELL EMA 5 28.47 SELL EMA 10 26.95 SELL EMA 21 25.60 BUY EMA 50 24.12 BUY EMA 100 23.15 BUY EMA 200 23.70 BUY What to expect from the AVAX price analysis next? Technical analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish, as is consistent with the MACD histograms which show negative price momentum. The coin however trades in oversold territory, a sharp reversal is plausible. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX’s decline reflects profit-taking after a macro rally, technical resistance, and cooling altcoin demand. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Avalanche historic price sentiment Avalanche price history by CoinGecko In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any involvement in a shady deal with the Roche Freedman law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend from January to May, after which bears took control of the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025. The drop continued into January; by June, it had fallen below $20. In July, it traded at the $18 level and $23 in September. In October, it rose above $30.",Crypto Price Predictions|avax,EN,0,0,AVAX|TRADING|MARKET|ICO|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|FIL|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|APT|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-11 11:28:59

Price volatility has been shown with support at $0.92 and resistance of $0.95–$1, pointing towards a test being set to be placed on it. This is why investors are shifting their attention to groundbreaking DeFi project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to earn more. Mutuum Finance, at Phase 6 of its presale, is priced at $0.035 per token. More than 60% of this phase is already sold out with more than 16,840 investors on board. Its dual-layered mechanism of lending, USD stablecoin pegged, and audited smart contracts provide it with real utility, hence making it a possible contender for leaving behind established altcoins like ADA. Cardano Sees $1 Target as Network Reaches 1M Transactions Cardano (ADA) is higher by nearly 10% over the last seven days, supported by steady on-chain traction and mounting developer and user demand. The network just passed the milestone of more than 1 million transactions over the last 30 days, a sign of steady adoption even as ADA dropped from 9th to 10th market cap among Layer 1 peers. Analysts identify $0.90 as a point of significance, a breakdown of which could trigger additional buying interest and lead the way to $1.10. Technical setups, in the form of potential W-shaped formation, give credence to a short-term bull scheme, with institutional demand building while spot ETFs to put money into ADA are in the pipeline. While investors attempt to measure up ADA’s velocity, attention shifts to Mutuum Finance with sound fundamentals. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Builds Mutuum Finance is stirring up the hornet’s nest with its ongoing presale, where it has already raised in excess of $17.1 million from more than 16,840 investors so far. MUTM tokens during Phase 6 can be purchased at $0.035 per token, which reflects growing interest and investor confidence in the project’s prospects. For effective pricing and robust risk management, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to obtain real-time USD and base crypto prices like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracle tactics, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange TWAPs are employed by the platform to deliver periodic and high-quality valuations even in adverse illiquidity or during periods of market stress. Dynamic Interest Rate and Liquidity Mechanisms Mutuum Finance applies a floating interest rate regime to maintain the maximum utilization of liquidity. It borrows and lends at times of abundance of liquidity and low rates, and repays and introduces capital when demand is at a peak and rates are high. Fixed mechanisms are applied for the balancing of the liquidity and natural adjustments within the market without disturbing the system equilibrium. The platform will launch its lending and borrowing protocol , a crucial step towards building its DeFi stack. Sepolia Testnet will host Version 1 in Q4 2025 with liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will initially be supported for lending, borrowing, and collateralization, with users enjoying seamless, low-cost, and secure decentralized finance from day one. Mutuum Finance Set to Shine as Cardano Eyes $1 With Cardano (ADA) on its way towards the pivotal $1 resistance mark, investors wait with bated breath, but already, many are taking a leap of faith to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for added profit. At its current price of $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, the project has already raised over $17.1 million from 16,840+ investors, 60% of tokens sold. With a USD-pegged stablecoin and risk management through Chainlink, Mutuum delivers DeFi utility, not hype. And with its lending and borrowing protocol set to go live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, MUTM could easily be the breakout hit of the next cycle. Get early access now before prices increase.

The meeting signals Ripple’s strategic intent to expand within one of Europe’s most influential financial hubs. Luxembourg’s reputation for regulatory openness and its established financial infrastructure make it an important jurisdiction for digital asset firms seeking legitimacy and access to the European Economic Area (EEA). The EU led in creating comprehensive rules for digital assets – and nations like Luxembourg are leaning in. Thanks to Luxembourg Finance Minister @RothGilles and his team for a great meeting last week. @Ripple is excited about our future in Luxembourg and the EU. https://t.co/8vHbPBH7R0 — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) October 9, 2025 Ripple’s Meeting with Luxembourg’s Ministry of Finance Luxembourg Finance Minister Gilles Roth confirmed the meeting in a post on X, writing: “Great meeting with @Ripple, as they advance toward securing their license to operate in Luxembourg. We discussed their ambitions in Europe and Luxembourg, and I reaffirmed our commitment to digital innovation.” Ripple’s discussions centered on acquiring regulatory approval that would allow it to operate across the European Economic Area (EEA). The move would align with the company’s ongoing effort to comply with Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework . Ripple already maintains a corporate presence in Luxembourg and has previously indicated plans to register as an e-money institution there. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What It Could Mean for XRP Ripple’s pursuit of a Luxembourg license could strengthen the role of XRP in regulated European financial systems. Operating under EU supervision would enable Ripple to provide payment and liquidity solutions to banks and institutions across the region with legal clarity. Luxembourg’s financial ecosystem provides strong incentives for Ripple’s expansion. As one commenter pointed out , the country is home to Clearstream Banking Luxembourg, one of the world’s two largest International Central Securities Depositories, which connects more than 2,500 financial institutions in 110 markets. This infrastructure could provide a foundation for Ripple to integrate XRP into institutional payment and settlement networks . The combination of regulatory certainty and proximity to established financial infrastructure enhances Ripple’s ability to scale its technology for real-world use. It also positions XRP as a potential bridge asset for cross-border transactions under compliant frameworks. If Ripple secures this license, XRP could benefit from greater institutional acceptance , liquidity growth, and increased participation from European financial institutions.

Tokens tied to physical gold, including Paxos’ PAXG and Tether’s XAUT, were among the few to hold their ground, and even edge higher, as broader markets sank. Bitcoin lost 8.5% of its value in the last 24-hour period, while the broader crypto market plunged 12.75% as measured by the CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index. PAXG has meanwhile dropped just 0.23% to $3,998, while XAUt is up 0.2% to $4,010. A troy ounce of gold, which these tokens are backed by, closed near $4,018 . These coins are backed by reserves of the precious metal, offering crypto investors a refuge from volatility that mirrors gold’s historical role in traditional finance. Year-to-date, these tokens are up more than 50% amid gold’s historic rally. But while gold-backed crypto weathered the crash, there are signs that their underlying asset may be approaching fatigue. Gold has risen for eight consecutive weeks, which according to the World Gold Council’s Markets Monitor pushed the price into “overbought” territory. That’s across daily, weekly and monthly charts, raising the likelihood of a near-term reversal. “With the “typical” historical overbought extreme – 25% above the 40-week average – seen not far above here at US$4,023/oz. we would then be wary of the rally for this phase of the Gold bull trend getting exhausted, opening the door to a consolidation/corrective phase,” the report reads. “Net long positioning remains elevated but is not yet seen at an extreme.” In the broader crypto market, the path to recovery may now be a slow grind. Liquidity constraints, weekend ETF closures and a cautious return by market makers suggest a protracted bottoming process.

The banking giant plans to expand the portfolio of these products and expects a strong convergence between traditional and decentralized finance in the future, according to a top executive. Sberbank raises 1.3 billion rubles from nine derivative offerings Sber, the largest Russian bank by assets, has been quite successful in placing financial instruments based on the value of cryptocurrencies in the months since the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) approved them. The monetary authority authorized financial firms to offer crypto derivatives on the domestic market in May and the financial services behemoth was among the first players to occupy the new niche. Following the regulatory nod, Sberbank created various investment products for retail investors, in the form of both structured bonds and crypto-based digital financial assets (DFAs), First Deputy Chairman of its Management Board, Alexander Vedyakhin, said at a fintech forum. “More specifically, we offer tracker bonds, capital-protected bonds as well as DFAs on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) indices and DFAs on a basket of five infrastructure tokens: SOL, TRX, AVAX, and BNB,” the banker detailed in an interview that the Russian business news portal RBC published Friday. Speaking on the sidelines of the Finopolis 2025 conference, held this week in the Sirius federal territory on the Black Sea coast, Vedyakhin revealed: “We see investor demand for these products – 1.3 billion rubles ($16 million) have been raised in just nine issues.” The high-ranking Sber representative added that the bank intends to make more offerings, providing diversification and reducing the risks associated with cryptocurrency investment. “We understand that in the future, there will be a strong convergence of decentralized finance and traditional banking,” he also commented, noting the Russian bank is already testing different DeFi instruments. Sberbank is developing the tokenization of real-world assets on its proprietary blockchain platform, too, including real estate, gold, and commodities, among others. It is exploring the implementation of smart contracts for banking and payment services as well. Sber backs wider investor access to crypto in Russia Sberbank is working with the government on the integration of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies into the Russian economy through new regulations, Alexander Vedyakhin said, emphasizing: “This should include the legalization of cryptocurrency circulation and the improvement of the culture of working with them, based on proven business cases.” The Bank of Russia indicated this week it’s pushing for the adoption of a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto investments in 2026 and that it plans to allow banks to operate with digital assets, as reported by Cryptopolitan. When it permitted the offering of crypto derivatives earlier this year, the CBR made them available only to a small group of “highly qualified” investors, vetted based on relatively high minimum requirements for annual income and holdings in deposits and securities. The potential range of cryptocurrency investors could be broader, Vedyakhin now remarked, noting that crypto derivatives, which offer an opportunity to diversify their portfolios, are of interest to many market participants, including financial professionals, companies and banks. At the same time, he was clear that Sberbank favors the gradual expansion of investor access to these products. “In our view, making cryptocurrencies available to all categories of investors overnight is wrong,” stated the executive of the majority state-owned institution.

According to the high court, CoinSwitch has the right to secure assets stolen during the $234 million hack of the WazirX platform in July 2025. According to reports, the court dismissed an appeal from Zanami Labs, the operators of WazirX, after it challenged an arbitration order that directed the company to provide bank guarantees to secure claims arising from the cyberattack. The court also noted that the tribunal acted within its authority and that securing CoinSwitch’s claim was legally appropriate due to the scale of the breach . WazirX loses appeal, CoinSwitch wins favorable verdict The dispute began after hackers breached WazirX’s multi-signature wallets in July 2024, stealing ERC-20 tokens valued at $234 million. The hackers were said to have created a fake WazirX account, deposited tokens, and purchased GALA tokens. After draining the hot wallet, they also accessed the cold wallets. When the signatories accessed the wallet, the hackers altered the smart contract control. After it was modified, they gained full control and drained all the funds. According to reports , CoinSwitch maintained broker accounts of WazirX, losing a significant portion of its funds in the attack. After the breach, CoinSwitch and Nextgendev Solutions approached an arbitration panel seeking security for the stolen assets. The tribunal overseeing the proceedings issued orders on December 24 and March 2025, instructing Zanami Labs, the operator of WazirX, to deposit bank guarantees of about Rs. 45.38 crore in favor of CoinSwitch. However, Zanami Labs argued that the hack was beyond its control and blamed Binance for cybersecurity failures. Binance had previously managed WazirX’s infrastructure. The court ruled against the claim, rejecting it on the premise that the Broker Agreement between CoinSwitch and Zanami Labs carried clear operational obligations that could not be shifted to a third party. Justice Sundaresan mentioned that “the arbitral tribunal interpreted the contract reasonably and acted within its mandate,” meaning that Zanami Labs’ challenge is without merit. Next steps in the restructuring and rebuilding The ruling also addressed the assertion made by Zanami, which mentioned that its Broker Agreement with CoinSwitch was only a tax-related arrangement. It rejected the claim and affirmed that the agreement had major legal implications regarding operational responsibilities. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the crypto exchange has mentioned that it is complying with the order passed by the Singaporean court regarding the court-mandated deadline in the restructuring case that was attached to the cyber attack. Before then, the company unveiled a $70 million recovery program for its users. According to the announcement made at the time, CoinSwitch was tasked with distributing the funds to WazirX users over two years. Affected users will receive funds in INR or crypto without the option of lock-in, allowing flexibility in trades and withdrawals. The exchange said it plans to track claims once it reopens its crypto withdrawal system, noting that it was put in place to ensure fair distribution of funds based on user losses. With all submissions now filed, the High Court is expected to fix a hearing date. The decision will affect the future of WazirX and its restructuring plans, which aim to balance creditor claims with the exchange’s ability to recover and rebuild. In its recent update, the exchange claimed that 95.7% of its creditors and 94.6% of approved claims voted in favor of its amended restructuring proposals. The results were also confirmed independently by Alvarez & Marsal (SE Asia) Pte Ltd’s Joshua Taylor and Henry Anthony Chambers, who claimed that there is solid support for the adjusted plan.

Among them, the newest presale turning heads is the innovative DeFi altcoin, Paydax. Already being compared to established names like BlockDag (BDAG) and Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), it is making waves despite being just over two weeks into its presale. What makes Paydax Protocol (PDP) stand out in a sea of top crypto presales? Let’s find out. Why Paydax Stands Out In The 2025 Crypto Presales Race BlockDag (BDAG) focuses on security and scalability, while Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) aims to speed up transactions as a Layer-2 network on Bitcoin. However, neither directly tackles the biggest gap in global finance today: transparent, fair, and borderless borrowing, lending, and insurance. This is where Paydax Protocol (PDP) steps in, positioning itself as the first platform to bring fully decentralized banking and insurance on-chain. With Paydax, users can turn their crypto or real-world assets into instant liquidity, borrowing up to 97% of their value in stablecoins without ever selling or losing ownership. It integrates Chainlink’s live oracle feeds for both crypto and real-world asset pricing to ensure precision across its DeFi ecosystem. On the lending side, investors can fund these collateralized loans directly and earn yields of up to 15.2% APY—far beyond what traditional finance offers. Paydax’s unique approach turned heads from the moment it launched, earning massive attention and instant comparisons to leading crypto presales like BlockDag (BDAG) and Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER). Paydax Establishes Itself As The Most Credible Name In Crypto Presales Paydax Protocol (PDP) removes centralized control by replacing banks and intermediaries with audited smart contracts. Even before its presale launch, it established partnerships with some of the most trusted names in both finance and luxury asset verification, including: • Christie’s: The renowned auction house known for authenticating and valuing fine art and collectibles. • Sotheby’s: A global leader in luxury asset verification and fair valuation. • Brinks: A trusted name in asset security and logistics, providing safe custody for real-world collateral. • Onfido: A leading digital verification provider ensuring full KYC and compliance for transparent DeFi operations. Its Dapp v1.0 is already live, every core contract has been independently audited by QuillAudits, Hacken, and Rapid Innovation, and its leadership team is fully doxxed. With this level of transparency, execution, and credibility, Paydax is gaining strong traction over crypto presales like BlockDag (BDAG) and Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), as the only one with realistic 500x upside potential. Early Numbers Don’t Lie: Paydax’s Presale Could Be The Next 500x Story Just days into its presale, Paydax Protocol (PDP) achieved what many crypto presales take months to do — a CoinMarketCap listing. It has already raised nearly $1 million while selling tokens at just $0.015. Early investors aren’t just buying tokens; they’re securing 6%–41% APY in staking rewards , plus lower fees, higher payouts, and DAO governance rights that boost long-term value. While BlockDag (BDAG) is making headlines with its $420 million presale, Paydax’s fast traction is fueling speculation that it could become the next major success story among crypto presales. And with Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) focused solely on scalability, Paydax’s broader model — bridging crypto and real-world assets — positions it as the more versatile player. Don’t Watch The Next 500x Presale Pass You By — Join Paydax Now Among today’s most talked-about crypto presales, Paydax Protocol (PDP) clearly takes the lead. While projects like BlockDag (BDAG) and Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) have built impressive momentum, Paydax stands out as the true 500x contender with early-stage accessibility. At $0.015 per PDP token, the Paydax presale offers investors their best and lowest chance to get in early. With prices set to climb in the following stages and exchange listings on the horizon, momentum for massive growth is already building. Investors can also claim a 25% presale bonus with the promo code PD25BONUS, adding even more upside for early participants. Being part of the Paydax presale isn’t just about profit — it’s about being a pioneer in what many are calling the “People’s DeFi Bank”. This is your chance to join a financial revolution built on transparency, security, and true ownership. It’s not just an investment. It’s a statement — and it’s happening right now.

The firm, which manages approximately $225 billion in assets, claims that Bitcoin (BTC) has “no intrinsic value” and urges investors to stay away from the asset. The company stated that Bitcoin is an “extremely volatile” investment, despite occasionally providing positive returns in the long term: Bitcoin is an extremely volatile investment instrument that has experienced significant losses in value on numerous occasions. At Hargreaves Lansdown, we do not view Bitcoin as an asset class. We do not believe cryptocurrencies should be included in portfolios for the purpose of generating growth or income. Related News: Cryptocurrencies Have Shaken Up the World Political Stage: Allegations Under Investigation The statement also stated that performance assumptions for cryptocurrencies cannot be analyzed and that, unlike other alternative investment classes, they “have no intrinsic value.” Hargreaves Lansdown's warning follows similar recent statements from major financial institutions such as Deutsche Bank and Elliott Management. On the other hand, despite all these warnings, the company also announced that it will soon begin offering cryptocurrency buying and selling services to its customers. *This is not investment advice.

Dogecoin (DOGE), the granddaddy of memes, has already seen a 41% run in the quarter, fueling renewed optimism that a push to $0.50 could be within reach. But on the flip side, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is racing through its presale stages and setting an audacious target: over 17,000% returns for early buyers. The contrast between legacy meme and next-gen meme is stark—and it could define the most exciting chapter in meme coin history of 2025. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Resurgence: 41% Gains, and Still Room to Run Dogecoin’s rally during the last quarter grabbed attention. The price advance carried it through psychological ceilings and resistance clusters, stirring chatter among traders that $0.50 may not just be wishful thinking. Technical analysts point out that breaking above key resistance zones near $0.24–$0.25 would unlock a relatively clean path upward. What lends credence to the $0.50 possibility for Dogecoin is more than chart mechanics. Institutional interest, the meme coin’s cult status, and speculation about a DOGE ETF or integration into mainstream payment rails all serve as potential catalysts. Analysts at ICOBench have already published price forecasts pegging $0.50 as a target, especially if DOGE holds support around $0.22 to $0.23. The real question is whether DOGE can make the leap from viral meme to asset embraced by serious capital. If the broader crypto market cooperates—and if whales keep accumulating—the kind of leap to $0.50 is no longer hyperbole. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Presale Leader Chasing Astronomical Multiples While Dogecoin flexes its legacy strength, Little Pepe is surging from the ground up. Currently 94% into presale stage 13, priced at $0.0022, the project has already raised over $26.7 million across all presale phases. Reports confirm that more than 16.3 billion tokens have been sold to this point. LILPEPE’s pitch is not purely hype. It is structuring itself as a meme-centric Layer-2 network built on Ethereum, offering memecoin launchpad tools, zero trading tax, sniper bot protection, staking, and DAO governance. In many ways, it tries to bridge the gap between meme culture and infrastructure utility. The presale’s velocity and ambition suggest a valuation paradigm that’s not modest. Projections from tokenomics models and market commentary float return targets up to 17,536%. For investors entering early, those numbers carry magnetic appeal. If LILPEPE post-listing gains even a fraction of its projected potential, it may reshape how meme coins are judged. Clash of Generations: Safe Ascent vs Explosive Gambit Dogecoin represents stability within the meme genre. Its brand awareness is unmatched, its support base deep, and its infrastructure battle-tested. A move toward $0.50 would signal a return to meme dominance and reentry into speculative conversations at scale. Little Pepe attempts something different: to rewrite the rules. Rather than betting on brand recognition, it’s staking on architecture, launchpad potential, and presale scarcity. Its path is riskier, but the reward curve is steeper. From a risk-adjusted perspective, Dogecoin offers upside with structural support, though the multiple may be more measured. Little Pepe, by contrast, offers a shot at exponential gains—but only if execution, listing, liquidity, and sustained community engagement all align. Early adopters who accept that full pack of risks are targeting returns that dwarf what even $0.50 DOGE represents. Conclusion For those seeking a bullish play with relative safety, Dogecoin’s trajectory toward $0.50 remains a viable story—especially with its Q3 momentum. If capital flows back into memes, DOGE has the branding to capture it. In the collision of legacy meme and next-gen meme, both carry upside. But only one seeks to deliver multipliers on a scale that’s rarely seen even in crypto’s wildest chapters. Dogecoin may aim for half a dollar; Little Pepe is aiming for life-changing multiples. The market, in the coming months, will choose which story resonates—and which investors reward.

With Gold surging past $4,000 and Silver trading at multi-decade highs, precious metals look overheated at these levels. Historically, when gold starts to cool down, it passes the baton to Bitcoin. Crypto investors are looking for Bitcoin to make a new all-time high and fuel the next leg of the bull market. But where to position, is the perp DEX narrative already over with Aster plummeting 14%? Q4 is typically when rotations begin, and with capital flowing into crypto via DATs and Spot ETFS, the race down the risk curve could be violent this year. If history is the guide, soon presales and small caps start to outperform, and Digitap ($TAP) appears to be in this cohort, raising an impressive $650,000 after releasing its non-KYC visa card. Aster’s fall and the perp DEX wars Aster is down nearly 14% in the past fortnight, falling to make a new all-time high since it hit $2.40 in late September. A major reason for this underperformance and strong resistance at the $2.12 level is that the airdrop campaign finished on the 5th of October, leading lots of mercenary trading volume to leave the platform, not to mention stiff competition from Lighter and Hyperliquid . Source: https://x.com/0xngmi/status/1974801402456051868 Backed by CZ and positioned as a next-generation perp platform, Aster aims to become the on-chain Binance. But compounding its problems currently is the delisting from DeFiLlama and the uncertainty surrounding the actual trading volume taking place on the platform. Still, the airdrop campaign closing, and reports about dubious trading volumes explain the current weakness for ASTER. Why small caps could outperform in Q4 However, the conditions for small caps and presales look excellent with everything coming together to fuel a potentially euphoric sprint in classic late-stage cycle fashion. Global easing is underway, the M2 Money Supply continues to expand , and stocks are at all-time highs. Trump’s pro-crypto stance is another tailwind, but with the caveat that the focus has tilted towards projects solving real financial problems using blockchain solutions. Digitap raises $650,000 with non-KYC Visa card Digitap’s presale has passed $650,000 since launch, with its non-KYC Visa card being a primary driver. Positioned as the world’s first omni-bank, Digitap aims to make crypto spendable and eliminate the line between fiat and crypto assets. Anyone can sign up for a card today that allows users to spend crypto or stablecoins anywhere Visa is accepted (millions of merchants globally) with instant conversions handled in the app. Digitap is bringing digital assets onto traditional payment rails and offers a single platform where fiat, crypto, and stablecoins can coexist on a single dashboard. Digitap has already sold all its stage one tokens, with the $TAP token now trading at $0.0159, expected to jump 22% to $0.0194 in the next round. Driving this demand in part are the $TAP tokenomics, with 50% of platform profits directed towards burns and rewarding stakers. This link between platform success and token holders mirrors other successful projects like Hyperloquid’s buyback and burn campaign. And it appears the market is skewing towards rewarding tangible results instead of roadmaps. The excitement about Stablecoins as a gateway to global finance Stablecoins are arguably the most successful product crypto has created, moving billions in monthly volume. Digitap aims to become an interface for these digital dollars, allowing ordinary users to interact with them, with the comfort and usability of a standard neobank interface. The interesting comparison between Aster and Digitap is that while Aster competes with Lighter and Hyperliquid for an already crowded DEX market share, Digitap targets global payment corridors, with cross-border payments alone expected to reach annual volumes of $290 trillion in 2030 . If it can capture just a percentage of these flows, it would equate to a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem and plenty of burn pressure for the $TAP token.

52988691,603955,1760184028,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52988691.jpeg,Bitcoin Play Metaplanet Suspends Stock Warrants For 20 Days – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-metaplanet-suspends-stock-warrants-20-days/,"Japanese investment company Metaplanet today announced that it is temporarily pausing its stock acquisition rights. According to data from Coingecko, the firm currently holds 30,823 BTC on its balance sheet. Metaplanet Pauses Stock Sale, Committed To Buying Bitcoin According to an announcement made earlier today, one of the major Bitcoin treasury firms, Metaplanet, is poised to suspend the exercise of its 20th to 22nd series of stock acquisition rights. These rights, also known as Moving Strike Warrants, will be in suspension from October 20th to November 17th. For the uninitiated, Moving Strike Warrants are financial instruments that give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a company’s stock at a strike price that adjusts over time, usually based on the stock’s market price or other metrics. Today’s announcement means that Metaplanet is essentially temporarily halting the sale of common stock to fund additional BTC purchases. Seeing the company’s stock’s recent performance, this should hardly come as a surprise. Metaplanet’s shares have collapsed a massive 70% from their June highs. The following chart shows how Metaplanet’s stock is down more than 22% over the past month, trading at $550 at the time of writing. Besides the depressed price action, Metaplanet’s valuation now stands at 1.05x Net Asset Value (NAV), the lowest reading since the firm launched its Bitcoin treasury strategy. Metaplanet’s total share value is now just slightly above the total value of BTC it holds. The decision to temporarily halt additional share sale is likely taken to avoid further dilution of shareholders’ value. The seemingly incongruent behavior between rising BTC price and falling Metaplanet stock is not out of the ordinary. For instance, Michael Saylor-led Strategy – despite being the largest public company in terms of BTC held on its balance sheet – has had to struggle over the past few months. MSTR shares have tumbled over 4.5% over the past month. That said, Metaplanet reiterated that it remains committed to buying more BTC in the future. In its official announcement, the company said: We remain committed to our mission of expanding Bitcoin holdings and maximizing BTC Yield for the benefit of our shareholders. In support of this mission, we are also developing new financial instruments and advancing the sophistication of our capital policy. Crypto Adoption Continues To Grow While Metaplanet temporarily halting stock sales might spook some BTC bulls, the overall trend of corporate adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to grow. For example, NYSE-listed CleanCore recently revealed that its treasury now holds 710 million DOGE. Similarly, MARA Holding recently increased its corporate treasury by 373 BTC, surpassing $6 billion in holdings. Nation-states appear to be joining the bandwagon too, as Luxembourg stated that its sovereign wealth fund is set to invest in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). That said, some industry experts argue that the recent surge in corporate adoption of digital assets is not entirely organic. At press time, BTC trades at $117,672, down 2.7% in the past 24 hours.",Uncategorized|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Metaplanet|metaplanet shares|michael saylor|Strategy,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-11 12:00:28

According to market data, the crypto-linked investment products opened the week with a daily inflow record of over $1.21 billion. As of this writing, with data from Friday’s trading session yet to be included, the US-based Bitcoin ETFs are currently on a nine-day streak of positive inflows. However, a focused look into the inflows trend shows that this data point doesn’t fully tell the story. Do Bitcoin ETFs’ Performance Depend On BlackRock’s IBIT? In a recent post on the X platform, market analyst CryptoOnchain stated that the latest data shows a major divergence in the US-based Bitcoin exchange-traded fund market. According to the on-chain pundit, the capital flow has been mostly positive because of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Marks A Turning Point: Analyst Explains Why This Time Is Different Breaking down the trend with the Bitcoin ETFs, CryptoOnchain labeled BlackRock’s IBIT as the “market’s shock absorber,” mopping up the heavy sell-side liquidity. The largest Bitcoin exchange-traded fund by net assets has not posted an outflow day in October, with a $4.21 billion inflow so far. On the other hand, the second-largest BTC ETF Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) has had a mixed performance in recent days, signaling a trend of portfolio rebalancing amongst their investors. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC has struggled with muted capital performances, interspersed with some daily net outflows. CryptoOnchain also highlighted the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), which witnessed a major one-day outflow, which precipitated significant market pressure. However, the net positive activity of BlackRock’s IBIT kept the BTC price afloat at the time. CryptoOnchain noted that any slowdown in capital inflows for the iShares Bitcoin Trust could significantly weaken the bullish momentum of the BTC price. However, it is worth mentioning that the Bitcoin price is currently under intense downward pressure due to the looming trade war between the United States and China. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $112,143, reflecting an over 7% downturn in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin Institutional Demand Remains Steady: Glassnode Before the market downturn triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff rumors and eventual announcement, the Bitcoin price had managed to stay above $120,000. In an earlier October 10 post on X, Glassnode shared that the Bitcoin ETFs might have helped keep the premier cryptocurrency afloat. Related Reading: Bitcoin Foundation Has Changed: Cycle 4 Is Redefining Long-Term Market Trend – Here’s How According to the on-chain firm, the exchange-traded funds have continued to record capital inflows despite BTC’s mild pullback from its all-time high. “This suggests structural buying is still underpinning the market, helping to absorb volatility and stabilize price action,” Glassnode concluded.

It Was a Coordinated…,https://timestabloid.com/financial-strategist-to-xrp-holders-this-wasnt-a-correction-it-was-a-coordinated/,"When prices suddenly cave in—and across major crypto assets no less—most in the market reflexively call it a “correction.” But what if that label is misleading? What if the crash was deliberately orchestrated to trigger massive liquidations? Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, says exactly that—and his interpretation now warrants serious attention. The Claim: Disguised as Tariff Reaction In his X post, Aljarrah argued that the spectacle surrounding the trade-policy announcement was a cover story: “This wasn’t a correction. It was a coordinated liquidation, disguised as a ‘tariff reaction.’” He argues the XRP and crypto asset drop wasn’t just due to macro headlines, but was driven by actors who triggered a wave of forced exits, shaping the market narrative. This wasn’t a correction. It was a coordinated liquidation, disguised as a “tariff reaction.” pic.twitter.com/ahScUZUzbf — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 11, 2025 Patterns of a Liquidation Cascade Forced Exits and Amplification Effects A true correction typically evolves gradually. What we saw instead was a violent cascade: massive liquidations shutting down leveraged long positions en masse. Platforms tracking derivatives and order-book data confirmed billions of dollars wiped out in short order. In such events, thin liquidity and clustered stop-loss triggers act as accelerants, amplifying the move beyond what fundamentals would justify. XRP’s Suppression and Price Control Allegations Aljarrah’s assertion aligns with prior claims that XRP’s pricing is artificially managed . He has contended that “layered, coordinated” suppression operates across exchanges, regulatory infrastructure, and liquidity routing—ensuring that the token never fully reflects its purported utility. In his view, the same mechanisms that had held down XRP in calmer times were repurposed in the recent shock to achieve maximum structural disruption. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Distinction Matters to Holders If one believes this was a naked liquidation campaign rather than a macro slog, then strategy must shift from narrative to forensic metrics. XRP holders should monitor liquidity injections and how deep order books absorb recovery, abnormal on-chain flows—substantial wallet moves, derivatives funding rates, and basis spreads that hint at market stress, and exchange activity patterns for signs of market intervention or accumulation by large holders. By contrast, treating the drop as a simple “correction” invites complacency—assuming rebounds will follow classic technical behavior. That may misalign risk calibration in a manipulated environment. A Measured Verdict Versan Aljarrah’s claim—bold yet rooted in patterns observed in high-leverage markets—poses a compelling reframing of what happened. The abrupt, synchronized nature of the crash, paired with evidence of suppression around XRP, supports the possibility that powerful capital was involved. Still, proof beyond timing and correlation is elusive. What’s clear is this: the market did not stumble; it was forced. For holders, the path forward is not guessing the headline but deciphering the liquidity architecture beneath it. When the dust settles, the real contest won’t be between bulls and bears—but between those who understand the invisible hands guiding the markets and the rest.

The trader, identified by blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain as a “ Bitcoin OG ” who held 86,000 BTC from 2011, deposited funds into Hyperliquid starting October 9 to establish highly leveraged bets against the crypto market’s top two assets. As the market drops, this #BitcoinOG ‘s $1.1B+ short positions in $BTC and $ETH are now sitting on an unrealized profit of over $27M. Did he have insider information? https://t.co/m8eNLYH45P pic.twitter.com/nL9R9Zkecb — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 10, 2025 Whale Doubles Down 30 Minutes Before Trump Speech The whale’s positions include a 10x leveraged short on 6,189 BTC valued at $752.9 million with a liquidation price of $130,810, and a 12x leveraged short on 81,203 ETH worth $353.1 million with a liquidation price of $4,589. The timing sparked widespread speculation about insider knowledge, with the trader doubling down on shorts just 30 minutes before Trump’s tariff announcement that sent Bitcoin plunging from above $122,000 to briefly below $102,000. According to on-chain analyst @mlmabc, the whale closed approximately 90% of Bitcoin shorts and completely exited Ethereum positions at the bottom of the drop, pocketing between $190 million and $200 million in realized profits within a single day. In case you didn’t know – the BTC whale closed 90% of his BTC short and fully closed his ETH short, making around $190–$200M profit in just one day on Hyperliquid. The crazy part is that he shorted another 9 figs worth of BTC and ETH minutes before the cascade happened. And this… pic.twitter.com/QhmUpesG0j — MLM (@mlmabc) October 10, 2025 Lookonchain data shows the trader began accumulating the short positions on October 9 by depositing 80 million USDC into Hyperliquid, followed by additional deposits totaling tens of millions throughout the week leading up to the crash. The market collapse triggered over 1.66 million liquidations in 24 hours, wiping out $19.33 billion in positions according to CoinGlass data. Although Mlmabc argued that the “ liquidation figure floating around is fake, the real number is likely much higher, somewhere in the $30B-$40B+ range. ” Long positions accounted for $16.83 billion of losses, while shorts contributed over $2.49 billion. Bitcoin and Ethereum led liquidations at $5.38 billion and $4.43 billion, respectively, followed by Solana at $2.01 billion and XRP at $708 million. Hyperliquid saw the largest single liquidation, an ETH-USDT position worth $203.36 million. According to Mlmbac, Hyperliquid alone saw “ nearly $7B liquidated .” Satoshi-Era Holder’s Trading History Fuels Conspiracy Theories The whale’s identity traces back to 2011 when he accumulated 86,000 BTC during Bitcoin’s earliest years. On-chain records show he sold 35,991 BTC worth $4.43 billion starting August 20 to purchase 886,371 ETH valued at $4.07 billion at a 0.0406 exchange rate on Hyperliquid. The trader still holds 49,634 BTC worth approximately $5.43 billion across four wallets, maintaining substantial exposure despite the aggressive shorting strategy. On October 8, just one day before establishing the massive short positions, the whale sold 3,000 BTC for 363.87 million USDC at an average price of $121,291, positioning himself with significant stablecoin liquidity. He then deployed 80 million USDC to open a 6x short on 3,477 BTC worth $419 million with a liquidation price of $140,660, while depositing an additional 50 million USDC into Binance for potential similar trades. The whale continued scaling positions throughout October 10, depositing 30 million USDC to open a 12x short on 76,242 ETH valued at $330 million with a liquidation price of $4,613. Community speculation intensified after crypto researcher Maartunn noted the correlation between the whale’s Satoshi-era origins and potential government connections, suggesting insider ties may have provided advance knowledge of Trump’s tariff announcement. This Bitcoin O.G. > Held 86K BTC from the Satoshi-era (2011) > Sold near the top in August 2025 > Started selling again around $122K (now) > Opened short positions on BTC & ETH > Market dumped after tariff news Connecting the dots: Satoshi-era OG have insider ties to the U.S.… https://t.co/ryJpya3mxP pic.twitter.com/Wtzqgs5ElP — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) October 10, 2025 Social media erupted with accusations of market manipulation, with multiple analysts calling the sequence “ one of the biggest insider trades in history .” Critics pointed to the precise timing of position increases just before Trump’s speech, the whale’s exits at exact market bottoms, and the coordinated nature of linked wallets copying similar trades within hours. Trump Tariffs Trigger Historic Deleveraging Event President Trump announced the 100% tariff on Chinese imports scheduled for November 1 in response to Beijing’s new export restrictions on products containing over 0.1% rare earth elements. The tariff also includes new export controls targeting critical software industries. Trump later hinted he could reverse the tariffs if China changes course before the deadline, potentially triggering a short-term crypto market recovery. The global crypto market cap fell over 9% in 24 hours to $3.8 trillion as the sell-off accelerated. Bitcoin dropped from above $122,000 to around $113,600, wiping out all gains since August before briefly dipping below $102,000. Source: TradingView Ethereum and other major altcoins followed similar trajectories, with some assets declining 60% to 90% during the three-hour crash that erased approximately $1 trillion in market value. Analysts characterized the event as one of the year’s most severe liquidation episodes. Despite the whale’s profitable exits, the crash left 1.66 million traders liquidated and billions in losses locked in. Trump’s approval rating fell to 40% amid the ongoing government shutdown, with 86% of Polymarket traders expecting the shutdown to continue past October 15.

Source: Alternative[dot]me Tariff Shock Erases $1 Trillion in Three-Hour Cascade Bitcoin crashed from above $122,000 to briefly below $102,000, wiping out all gains since August, while Ethereum tumbled from $4,783 to $3,400 before recovering. The global crypto market cap fell over 9% in 24 hours to $3.8 trillion, with approximately $1 trillion erased in just three hours. More than $7 billion in positions were liquidated in less than one hour of trading on Friday alone. Long positions absorbed the bulk of damage, totaling $16.83 billion in losses compared to $2.49 billion from shorts. Bitcoin led liquidations at $5.38 billion, followed by Ethereum at $4.43 billion, Solana at $2.01 billion, and XRP at $708 million. Hyperliquid saw the largest single liquidation, an ETH-USDT position worth $203.36 million.

The $10B liquidation figure floating around is fake, the real number is likely much higher, somewhere in the $30B–$40B+ range. On Hyperliquid alone, nearly $7B was liquidated. Here’s the full breakdown for anyone interested: Total liquidations since 20:45 UTC: – Total Value:… — MLM (@mlmabc) October 11, 2025 The collapse dwarfed previous record events, including the March 2020 COVID crash that saw $1.2 billion in liquidations and the November 2022 FTX collapse with $1.6 billion. Friday’s event was approximately 20 times larger than the COVID crash, with Brian Strugats of Multicoin Capital noting the focus now turns to “ counterparty exposure and whether this triggers broader market contagion .” October’s Historical Strength Faces Unprecedented Test Yesterday, Economist Timothy Peterson noted that drops of more than 5% in October are “exceedingly rare,” occurring only four times in the past decade during October 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021. Following each previous drop, Bitcoin rebounded by 16% in 2017, 4% in 2018, and 21% in 2019, with only 2021 seeing a further 3% decline. October ranks as Bitcoin’s second-best performing month on average since 2013, delivering average returns of 20.10% and trailing only November’s 46.02% average gain according to CoinGlass data. Drops of more than 5% in October are exceedingly rare. This has happened only 4 times in the past 10 years. Oct 24 2017 Oct 11 2018 Oct 23 2019 Oct 21 2021 What happened next? 7 days later bitcoin was 2017: up 16% 2018: up 4% 2019: up 21% 2021: down -3% pic.twitter.com/mbFs19RbwL — Timothy Peterson (@nsquaredvalue) October 10, 2025 If history repeats and Bitcoin mirrors its strongest October rebound of 21% from 2019, a similar move from Friday’s $102,000 low would place the cryptocurrency around $124,000 within a week. However, Trump’s tariff announcement scheduled for November 1 in response to Beijing’s export restrictions on rare earth elements creates ongoing policy uncertainty. The president later hinted he could reverse tariffs if China changes course before the deadline, potentially triggering a short-term market recovery, though liquidation losses remain locked in. According to Bloomberg , Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, identified $100,000 as Bitcoin’s next major support level, below which “ would signal the end of past three-year bull cycle. ” Bitcoin options markets reflected this view with the highest number of put strikes at $110,000 and the next highest at $100,000, according to Deribit data. Source: Bloomberg Analysts Split on Whether Liquidation Marks Bottom or More Pain Ahead Jan3 founder Samson Mow maintained bullish sentiment, noting “ there are still 21 days left in Uptober. ” MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe called the event “ the bottom of the current cycle, ” comparing it to the COVID-19 crash that marked the previous cycle’s low. The Bitcoin Libertarian took a longer-term view, suggesting that “ in a few years, Bitcoin will crash from $1M to $0.8M in a few hours .” David Jeong, CEO at Tread.fi described in the Bloomberg report that the market is experiencing a “ black swan event ,” noting that many institutions likely didn’t expect this volatility level. Similarly, Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, said the rout was “ sparked by US-China tariff fears but fueled by institutional over-leverage ,” adding that crypto’s macro ties were now clear. The Fear and Greed Index reading of 27 compares to 64 yesterday, 71 last week, and 54 last month, marking one of the fastest sentiment reversals in crypto history, with Bitcoin also touching over a 6-month low within hours. Technical Analysis: Critical Support Tests for BTC and ETH BTC currently trades around $111,522 after bouncing from the $102,000 low. Immediate support sits at $110,000 to $113,000, with the $113,500 level identified as critical for triggering a relief rally. $BTC dumped to $102,000 level and nearly took down the entire market. Nearly $20,000,000,000 in long positions were liquidated which is the highest ever in crypto history. Right now, Bitcoin is trying to reclaim $113,500 level and if that happens, you could see a relief rally. pic.twitter.com/F0UPgeTep2 — Ted (@TedPillows) October 11, 2025 Resistance zones above current prices stand at $117,933, $124,475, and the recent high around $126,000. The $20 billion liquidation cleared extreme leverage, potentially removing selling pressure, though the sustainability of any bounce depends on fundamental improvements. Volume characteristics don’t demonstrate overwhelming conviction in either direction. ETH trades at $3,833 after testing $3,400, with immediate resistance at the $4,000 psychological level necessary for upward momentum. Support zones sit around $3,600 to $3,800, with failure to reclaim $4,000 likely triggering retests of these levels. Higher resistance stands at $4,080, $4,265, and $4,783. RSI indicators reached oversold levels historically associated with reversals, though these can remain depressed during genuine bear markets. Both assets face genuine uncertainty following the liquidation event. Bitcoin must reclaim and hold above $113,500 to validate recovery scenarios toward $117,000-$120,000, while failure would likely result in retesting $102,000 or potentially $95,000-$100,000. Ethereum needs sustained trading above $4,000 to trigger momentum toward $4,200-$4,500, with a breakdown risking moves toward $3,600-$3,800. The clearing of leveraged positions removes immediate selling pressure, though the unresolved tariff and potential for additional volatility suggest consolidation between current levels and recent lows remains the most probable near-term outcome before directional clarity emerges.

With Bitcoin still being the primary focus for the asset manager, Ethereum is now taking center stage for tokenization and the expansion of DeFi. Recent inflow in BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF highlights this change, where executives have praised the network’s efficiency in trading assets. Moreover, global networks such as SWIFT include Ethereum solutions, which bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized systems. However, prices of crypto are behaving erratically with increased crypto ETF activity, leaving people wondering if there are any undervalued opportunities. This institutional momentum changes the game for crypto investments, attracting capital to established chains while highlighting new protocols. Furthermore, as Bitcoin and Solana get support, Ethereum becomes the epicenter moving debates such as best crypto to buy now. BlackRock increases role of Ethereum Executives at BlackRock have recently highlighted Ethereum’s potential in the redefinition of finance. Jay Jacobs, head of U.S. equity ETFs, said the blockchain is the catalyst of tokenization. As a result, physical assets such as bonds become digital, and settlement times are significantly reduced. BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF receives strong inflows, indicating institutional crypto investment sentiment. This concentration is also consistent with the general trends of crypto ETFs, in which Ethereum has performed well during market volatility. Ethereum is at nearly $4,430, slightly lower, while analysts look towards positive trends via crypto charts. Thus, institutions make Ethereum the pillar of blockchain efficiency. Moreover, SWIFT, the dominant interbank network, advances Ethereum-based integrations. Joe Lubin, Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO, notes banks’ evolving stance on blockchain. Financial entities now build on Ethereum to link legacy systems with DeFi. This development marks a maturation in institutional adoption, easing prior crypto crash fears. Mutuum Finance gains traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) captures investor attention as presale phase 6 progresses at 60% capacity. The project has raised $17,100,000 since inception, amassing 16,840 holders. Current pricing sits at $0.035, a 250% rise from the initial $0.01 level. Phase 6 sells out rapidly, limiting access to this entry point. Soon, phase 7 opens with a 14.3% hike to $0.04. Launch targets $0.06, promising current buyers a 420% return post-deployment. Developers announce the lending and borrowing protocol’s buildup, deploying V1 to Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Core elements include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bots. Initial support covers ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral. Giveaway boosts participation Mutuum Finance unveils its largest giveaway, distributing $100,000 in MUTM to 10 winners at $10,000 each. Participants celebrate the presale milestone through simple entry steps. To join: Submit a valid wallet address for secure prize transfers. Complete all quests meticulously to boost odds. Confirm eligibility via a minimum $50 presale investment. This initiative heightens crypto investment interest, tying into why crypto is going up for utility-driven tokens like MUTM. Furthermore, borrowing interest rates adjust via utilization, balancing supply and demand dynamically. Abundant capital keeps rates low, spurring loans. Scarce funds raise them, prompting repayments and new deposits. Stable rates offer predictability, starting higher than variable rates for risk offset. Rebalancing occurs if variables exceed stability by 10%, ensuring equity. Overcollateralization mandates excess assets, triggering liquidations below thresholds. Liquidators claim bonuses on discounted collateral, preserving solvency. Deposit and borrow caps limit exposures, curbing manipulations. Loan-to-value ratios cap borrowings at 75% for stables, lower for volatiles. Reserve factors accrue from interests, buffering defaults at 10-35% based on risk. Institutional momentum returns to Ethereum BlackRock’s Ethereum emphasis, alongside SWIFT’s integrations, propels the best crypto to buy now narrative. Yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) trends stronger among savvy investors seeking utility in lending protocols. Crypto prices today favor such undervalued entries over hyped chains.

Schwartz outlined a scenario where global distrust between nations could lead to the adoption of a decentralized digital asset over any single country’s currency. In the video, Schwartz explained that while every major nation would like its currency to hold reserve status, only a few, such as the United States, the European Union, or China, have the economic power to sustain it. Yet, these same powers are viewed with suspicion by others, making their currencies politically difficult to accept as global standards. According to Schwartz, this geopolitical reality could eventually make countries more willing to adopt a neutral reserve asset not controlled by any government. Ripple's David Schwartz on how cryptocurrencies like $XRP could become a neutral reserve currency:""If that happens to make a bunch of cryptocurrency people rich, I don't think they're going to see that too much as a minus."" pic.twitter.com/pTZ3kKk9Qc — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) October 9, 2025 The Path Toward Global Agreement Schwartz emphasized that such a shift could represent the most realistic success scenario for digital assets. As the dominance of the U.S. dollar becomes increasingly uncertain, nations may prefer a system that no one controls. When asked how global consensus could be reached, Schwartz suggested that mutual self-interest could drive agreement, especially if the alternative meant falling under another country’s monetary influence. He added that if such an outcome made cryptocurrency holders wealthy, that would be a byproduct of the transition.

He noted that XRP’s efficiency and liquidity could enable it to function as a bridge currency in global finance , supporting the movement of value across borders in a system independent of traditional fiat currencies. He linked Schwartz’s remarks to the ongoing discussion around the potential decline of the petrodollar system, suggesting that while the U.S. dollar may not lose its status as the dominant national currency, its role in global settlement could diminish. In that scenario, XRP could become a central tool in facilitating international trade, requiring high liquidity and driving significant market capitalization growth. Schwartz’s comments and AllinCrypto’s analysis highlight a broader shift in economic thinking. As global markets continue to evolve, the appeal of a neutral, decentralized reserve asset grows stronger. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The development comes after industry concerns over timing and treatment of blockchain assets. The Monetary Authority of Singapore ( MAS ) mentioned that it would delay the enforcement of the new rules governing how financial institutions treat digital assets until 2027. According to the premier institution, the pushback in its original target of January 2026 became necessary following responses to a consultation on the changes. “We will continue to monitor developments in the cryptoasset landscape and global regulatory standards to ensure alignment and support responsible innovation,” the regulator said . Singapore moves crypto rules update to January 2027 According to reports, the updated rules are based on the standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. It will require banks to hold capital reserves against their crypto exposures in line with their risk classification. This means that digital assets seen as higher risks, such as those on public and permissionless blockchains, will attract higher capital requirements. Also, those seen as stable and backed by eligible reserve assets could see more favorable treatment. Meanwhile, assets considered as volatile will require capital buffers of up to 1,250%. Singapore was one of the countries that first introduced a framework for digital assets, implementing its initial rules in 2020. The country plans to balance innovation with financial stability, which has limited some forms of retail participation while encouraging adoption among institutional investors. Nevertheless, crypto remains a huge part of its financial landscape . According to a Straits Times report, about 26% of Singapore residents hold at least a form of digital asset as of April 2025. In addition, Web3 investments accounted for 64% of the total fintech funding in 2024, totaling around $742 million. Institutional appetite has also been on the rise, with 57% of local investors planning to increase their crypto allocations, according to the Future Finance report released by Sygnum Bank. Local banks, which the delayed rules are targeting, are also making a big push in the industry. Competition among countries in the Web3 industry grows With respect to the new rules, the changes are designed to clarify how banks account for digital assets in their capital, liquidity, and large exposure frameworks. This ensures that crypto exposures are effectively integrated into the existing prudential standards. MAS also proposed to update its scope of eligible reserve assets for stablecoins, further defining how lower-risk and higher-risk assets should be treated on the balance sheet. However, industry participants have argued that the initial plan to adopt the rules will make Singapore one of the jurisdictions to implement the Basel crypto asset framework, potentially exposing local banks to regulatory disadvantages. Respondents also warned that the proposed risk classifications could unfairly penalize assets built on permissionless blockchains, a move that could stifle innovation. One of the parties responding to the consultation was Coinbase , whose Singapore Country Director Hassan Ahmed noted that the regulator’s prudential requirements were aimed at strengthening the risk frameworks of banks, but noted that the move might lead to overcapitalization. “MAS has always prioritised user protection through cautious and measured regulation, and its latest response is another instance of this posture. Singapore has also been consistently pragmatic in finding the balance between innovation and protection,” he said. Ahmed also discussed the delay: “We are hopeful that this delay might signal a reconsideration of the contemplated prudential requirements for Singaporean institutions to better and more fully participate in innovative technology.” In addition, he mentioned the competition in the Web3 industry. “Although Singapore was early, the global regulatory baseline has equalised since the passing of the GENIUS Act, and with other leading hubs like Hong Kong, the EU, and the UAE embracing this technology,” he added.

In 2027, it will range between $2.47 and $2.80, with an average price of $2.54. In 2030, it will range between $7.94 and $9.64, with an average price of $8.17. Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will its price be in 2025? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031.

The market recorded less trading interest as trading volumes rose by 533.73%. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView APE fell below $1 in January and $0.5 in April. This month, it trades at the $0.4 mark after a sharp decline over the last two days. The MACD histogram shows its negative momentum rose over the last two days. Its volatility also rose over the same period. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights APE’s drop after it broke $0.560 support. Like the daily chart, its volatility is rising with negative market momentum. The drop forced APE into oversold territory with RSI at 20.41. A price reversal at these levels is plausible.

APE price analysis shows that the coin is bearish with rising volatility, on both timeframes. High rading volumes confirm high conviction in the current market Why is APE down? APE’s rally reflects NFT sector tailwinds as the BAYC market cap surged, event-driven speculation, and technical momentum. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. driven by the APE bridge to ApeChain and growing utility and applications, such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news While Solana’s low fees attracted new users, the dissolution of ApeCoin DAO (99.66% approval) alienated decentralization advocates. ApeCo’s 10M APE treasury allocation ($3.72M) added inflationary pressure. APE price prediction October 2025 The APE October price prediction ranges between $0.35 and $0.70, with an average of $0.59.

The plan is to use the wholesale segment of its central bank digital currency (CBDC) to issue and settle these instruments. Chief General Manager Suvendu Pati confirmed that the RBI is working with “a few banks” on the project and explained that the goal is to explore how blockchain-based crypto tokens can streamline traditional money market operations. Pati said, “From a regulatory standpoint for tokenisation of an underlying asset, we believe integrity and enforceability have to be established.” He added that while the process carries some level of risk, those risks “are manageable and can be addressed through regulatory guardrails.” Pati also revealed that the central bank is looking to expand this experiment to other money market instruments, such as commercial papers, as part of its broader digital initiative. The goal is simple: build a faster, safer, and cheaper financial system built on tokenized assets that can be traded within a tightly regulated environment in India. RBI moves ahead as India’s economy beats forecasts The pilot lands right after India reports a stronger-than-expected economic growth rate of 7.8% for the quarter ending in June. The increase was fueled by manufacturing, construction, and services, which grew 7.7%, 7.6%, and 9.3%, respectively. That performance beat the 6.7% expansion forecasted by economists in a Reuters poll. But even with the upbeat headline numbers, analysts warned that there are signs of slowing momentum beneath the surface. Nominal GDP, which doesn’t account for inflation or deflation, slipped to 8.8% during April to June, down from 10.8% in the previous quarter. Anubhuti Sahay, head of Indian economic research at Standard Chartered, said , “Nominal GDP growth is lower than previous quarters but because the deflator is so soft that the real GDP looks extremely strong.” The deflator, she explained, reflects how inflation affects total output. Despite those nuances, Sahay pointed out that corporate sector earnings in manufacturing have remained strong, keeping momentum intact. The combination of a resilient real economy and ongoing digital innovation from the RBI paints a picture of a country testing both its financial infrastructure and its growth limits. The new pilot sits squarely inside that experiment, marrying traditional financial instruments with blockchain-backed tokens to see what happens when the two worlds meet. India pushes deeper into financial inclusion At the same time, India is undergoing a massive transformation in personal finance. The country is trying to convert millions of low-income earners into stock market investors, pushing people who’ve relied on cash and gold into the world of equities. The initiative relies on bite-sized mutual fund plans that start from as little as 250 rupees ($3) per month. If this effort works, India’s $880 billion mutual fund industry could unlock a chunk of household savings large enough to fuel $9.5 trillion in new inflows into financial assets over the next decade, a projection shared by Goldman Sachs. The program began in February and is backed by India’s securities regulator. It’s targeting small savers across rural areas, enabling investments too small to interest traditional fund houses. The effect is already visible. Equity funds have seen 54 straight months of net inflows through August, with monthly equity plans averaging $3 billion in new contributions since April, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India shows. Data from Bloomberg shows that these record inflows have genuinely helped stabilize local markets against record foreign outflows this year and kept the NSE Nifty 50 Index far above its pandemic lows, even as global investors turn cautious. Now the effort is expanding even further, as the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) plans to partner with India Post to train about 20,000 postal employees in its first year. Their mission: to sell these bite-sized plans in villages that still lack basic access to financial products. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Analysts predict possible 200% returns in Q4, but what if these tokens go beyond that? A 200% surge would place XRP above $9, DOGE around $0.78, and LILPEPE in the $0.006 to $0.01 range, or even higher. Ripple (XRP) Eyes a Breakout Beyond $9 as Bulls Tighten Grip Ripple’s XRP is going through an exciting time that could break analysts’ predictions of 200% gains in the fourth quarter of 2025. XRP has seen a price rise again after rising by almost 10% in a week and 7.46% in the last month. XRP is now trading at about $3.01, down from its July high of $3.66. Source: TradingView Analysts are now closely monitoring key breakout levels around $3.30 and $3.60. If XRP breaks through these barrier levels, it might go past its $10 objective before the end of the year. Ripple’s steady growth on-chain means that XRP could easily increase by more than the expected 200%. Dogecoin (DOGE) Set to Grow by More Than 200% DOGE is at $0.26, after seeing a 12.45% rise last week and 18.54% last month. The meme coin’s ability to sustain this rally indicates growing strength in a market that has become increasingly competitive. Source: TradingView DOGE’s current pattern forms a channel-up formation that often precedes significant breakouts. If the price breaks above $0.30 resistance, potential targets between $0.58 and $0.83 become realistic in November. That translates to gains exceeding 230%, far beyond conservative analyst expectations. Social media trends and renewed community excitement around Dogecoin’s meme legacy continue to push demand, hinting at a potential return to mainstream attention as Q4 progresses. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Emerging Meme Coin For Explosive Gains Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is one of the most intriguing presales of the new digital assets of 2025. LILPEPE is a new meme coin that is built on a Layer 2 blockchain that focuses on speed, cheap fees, and good security. With Pepe’s meme legacy as inspiration, Little Pepe is positioning itself as the next major player ready to dominate the meme sector. The presale performance speaks volumes. LILPEPE just finished stage 12, which raised an incredible $25,475,000. Now it’s at stage 13, where tokens cost $0.0022. So far, more than $26.77 million has been raised, indicating that investors have a great deal of confidence in the project. There are only 100 billion tokens available, and 26.5% of them are reserved for the presale. This gives early buyers a big edge. Additional allocations include 10% for liquidity, 30% for chain reserves, 10% for DEX distribution, 10% for marketing, and 13.5% for staking and rewards, all with a 0% tax policy that appeals to active traders. Little Pepe’s roadmap includes listings on CoinMarketCap and two top centralized exchanges, with plans to debut on one of the largest global exchanges at launch. Investors can be assured that the project is safe and transparent, as it has a CertiK audit score of 95.49%. This makes it one of the most trustworthy new meme tokens in decentralised finance. Given its strong fundamentals, verified security, and enthusiastic community, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) could easily surpass analysts’ predictions of 200% returns in Q4. The presale’s rapid sellout pace indicates strong market demand, while its upcoming exchange listings could trigger a significant price surge, potentially reaching $0.01 to $0.05 or beyond. The Final Outlook If market momentum continues and investor confidence remains steady, these three assets could deliver returns exceeding 200%. The Little Pepe (LILPEPE) presale offers one of the most attractive entry points before what could be its defining breakout moment.

Leading the pack, SBI Holdings in Japan boasts over $10.4 billion in its XRP treasury, followed by significant positions held by Trident Digital and Webus International. Moreover, a strategic addition was made by Reliance Global in late September, as detailed in their press release . The company added XRP to its digital assets, signaling growing confidence in its utility and stability. This increasing interest in XRP from well-known institutions has prompted comparisons to the early days of Bitcoin when pioneering companies like Strategy and Block first introduced the BTC treasury model. The Rise of Paydax Protocol: A New Star in DeFi In contrast to the corporate sphere's focus on XRP, retail investors are showing a strong inclination towards the innovative DeFi solutions provided by Paydax Protocol (PDP) . This platform simplifies the borrowing and lending of both digital and real-world assets within a decentralized environment, ensuring security and transparency. By offering fixed APRs, Paydax Protocol makes financial planning more predictable for users, who can borrow against assets without the need to sell them, thus maintaining ownership while accessing necessary funds. Key Partnerships and Security Measures in PlacePaydax Protocol has secured partnerships with influential entities such as Crypto Astronaut and Brinks, enhancing its service reliability and trust within the community. Furthermore, artwork and collectibles backed by Sotheby’s increase its appeal by providing tangible asset options for users. Conclusion As XRP continues to gain traction among major corporations, platforms like Paydax Protocol are also setting new standards in the DeFi sector, attracting both individual and institutional investors. This marks a significant evolution in the blockchain and cryptocurrency landscapes, suggesting a future where multiple currencies and platforms coexist and compete on various fronts.

These Institutions Make Their Move With Billion-Dollar Purchases,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/xrp-treasuries-to-rival-bitcoin-these-institutions-make-their-move-with-billion-dollar-purchases,"New data shows that XRP treasury holdings among corporations have surged past $11.5 billion. Japan’s SBI Holdings leads the charge with over $10.4 billion in XRP Treasury assets. Trident Digital and Webus International ranked second and third, respectively, both committing to a billion-dollar XRP treasury move. In late September, Reliance Global announced it had purchased XRP to boost its holdings. This rapid accumulation has drawn comparisons to early Bitcoin (BTC) adoption. In 2020, Strategy and Block pioneered the BTC Treasury model that reshaped corporate balance sheets. Experts highlight that the corporate push that started with Bitcoin has shifted, with XRP Treasury strategies emerging as a serious contender. As XRP treasury systems continue to grow, experts argue that it could shake Bitcoin’s dominance with corporations. While Bitcoin and XRP treasury corporations grow, Paydax Protocol (PDP) is gaining massive traction as investors continue to purchase tokens rapidly in its groundbreaking presale. Institutions Bet Big on XRP Treasury, Retail Investors Turn to Paydax Protocol (PDP) As institutions pour billions into establishing an XRP treasury to rival Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance, retail investors are pouring money into the Paydax Protocol (PDP) presale , with the funds raised set to hit $1 million within days of launch. Paydax Protocol (PDP) offers a model that simplifies borrowing and lending in DeFi. Rather than relying on outdated systems, it enables users to securely borrow against cryptocurrencies like BTC and tangible assets, such as real estate or collectibles, within a decentralized, transparent framework. Consider Paydax Protocol a DeFi bank that provides access to cash without losing your assets. Instead of liquidating your tangible or digital assets, such as Bitcoin (BTC), to get cash, this digital asset platform lets you borrow against them, providing immediate liquidity. The Power of Partnerships and Security: Paydax Protocol (PDP) Is Built to Last The Paydax Protocol (PDP) has joined forces with significant industry partners to strengthen its foundation and expand its influence: Crypto Astronaut: Creates new avenues for growth and innovation while improving community involvement. Brinks: Guarantees the safety of collateral assets for loans within the platform. Sotheby’s: Supports tokenized assets, thereby boosting credibility and trust. The crypto space has seen numerous exploits and hacks worth millions of dollars over the years. A report by Crypto Crime highlighted the damage caused so far. Paydax Protocol has emphasized transparency and security over hollow promises and fleeting excitement. Audited by Assure DeFi to verify that the Paydax Protocol’s smart contract is both secure and reliable. The use of Gnosis Safe multisig wallets and Chainlink-compliant oracles for precise price feed tracking. The introduction of bug bounty programs to mitigate potential hacking threats. Paydax Protocol Redefines What DeFi Lending Should Be In traditional DeFi lending, interest rates fluctuate continuously in response to supply-and-demand dynamics. You might borrow at 3% one day, only to see it soar to 18% the next. Conversely, Paydax Protocol offers fixed APRs ranging from 5% to 7%, which is quite rare in the DeFi space. This framework enables borrowers to plan with confidence. When borrowing against assets like BTC, ETH, or even tokenized gold, the initial costs are both clear and transparent. This consistency is also advantageous for lenders. Fixed rates offer reliable returns, and through the Paydax Protocol’s (PDP) peer-to-peer system, lenders can attain yields of up to 15.2% APY. This greatly exceeds the returns from traditional banks, where savings accounts usually yield less than 1%. Paydax Protocol (PDP) Presale Kicks Off, Investors Are Moving Fast! While Bitcoin (BTC) sees its dominance shaken, this new DeFi bank has given many other presale projects a run for their money with its life-changing offerings. Interestingly, Paydax Protocol (PDP) is offering an exceptional 25% bonus for early investors. By applying the promo code PD25BONUS during your token purchase, you will instantly receive 25% more tokens. It’s essential to note that this generous bonus is available for a limited time only and will expire soon. Therefore, participating in the PDP presale now is crucial for maximizing potential benefits. Investors are encouraged to acquire as many tokens as they can before the opportunity closes.

Related Reading: Major Event Management Platform Raises $2M To Expand Stablecoin Payments Across Entertainment Industry Solana Pullback Eyes $200 Retest Solana fell from the $225 area and recorded a 6.6% intraday retrace below the $210 level for the first time in two weeks. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been trading within the $210-$245 levels over the past month, briefly losing this range during the late September pullback. As “Uptober” arrived and the overall crypto market recovered, the altcoin bounced from the recent lows, reclaiming the mid-zone of its local price range. Over the past week, SOL traded within the $220-$235 area, retesting both the upper and lower boundaries of this zone throughout this week’s volatile market performance. Multiple market watchers warned that losing $215-$220 area could determine whether SOL’s short-term rally was at risk. On Friday morning, the altcoin lost this crucial zone, hitting a one-week low of $207. Analyst Crypto Batman forecasted that Solana would likely head lower before bouncing, highlighting two key support areas. He suggested that the altcoin’ could retrace deeper into its Bullish Fair Value Gap (FVG), between $210-$220, which previously served as a key resistance level. However, if the price continues to fall, he pointed out that a retest of SOL’s two-month ascending trendline, currently around the $200 mark, would be possible. This trendline was tested as support in late September, when the altcoin fell to the $190 level. Similarly, Crypto analyst Man of Bitcoin had affirmed that holding the $216 level was crucial to preserve a bullish scenario in which the cryptocurrency rallied toward the $270 without major pullbacks. The analyst cautioned that losing this area would invalidate the bullish setup and likely push the price down toward the local range lows, potentially risking a drop to the $200 barrier. SOL’s Make-Or-Break Level Meanwhile, market watcher Follis recently stated that SOL has “one of the cleanest” high timeframe charts in the market. He noted that Solana’s 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) indicator in the daily chart holds “the key.” Notably, this indicator, currently sitting around the $200 area, has been tested as support and bounced from each time the cryptocurrency has failed to break a major resistance level since August. Based on its recent performance, if the altcoin holding the EMA100 on the daily timeframe could see a rebound and target the range highs. On the contrary, if this level is lost, the cryptocurrency risks falling to the September lows.

XRP, long known for its dramatic volatility, just printed one of those moments. Over the past 24 hours, the digital asset experienced an enormous “capitulation wick” — a massive downward candle followed by an equally fierce recovery — that has ignited comparisons to one of the most pivotal events in its history. The Historic Wick That Rocked the Charts On October 10–11, XRP’s daily chart recorded one of its most dramatic swings in years. Data from multiple market trackers showed the coin plunging sharply from highs near $2.80 to lows around $1.51 before rebounding strongly — an intraday swing higher than 45%. $XRP – second longest capitulation wick in history (possibly the largest if candle closes higher).. Last time (2017) we had the longest capitulation ""wick/crash""…. XRP made BIBLICAL history thereafter! Awaiting on the close to see if current wick is longer than 2017 wick … pic.twitter.com/4iVE8L0MAg — JD (@jaydee_757) October 10, 2025 Such moves, though rare, typically occur during intense market liquidations when leveraged positions are wiped out in quick succession. Market analyst JD, a respected figure among XRP traders, drew attention to this development on X, describing it as “the second longest capitulation wick in history — possibly the largest if the candle closes higher.” His post quickly gained traction, with many traders revisiting historical charts to validate the scale of the move. Why Traders Are Comparing It to 2017 The reference point to 2017 is no coincidence. That year marked the longest capitulation wick in XRP’s trading history — a brutal selloff that preceded one of crypto’s most legendary rallies. Following that crash, XRP embarked on a meteoric rise, soaring from fractions of a cent to over $3.80 within months, a gain that became the stuff of crypto folklore. JD’s observation has, therefore, stirred excitement among long-term holders who see parallels between then and now. The logic is straightforward: when fear is at its highest and liquidity at its lowest, it often signals the end of selling pressure and the start of a new buying phase. This setup has historically favored strong recoveries. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What This Means for XRP’s Market Outlook While it’s too early to declare a repeat of 2017, the technical signals are noteworthy. The deep wick implies that despite intense selling pressure, buyers stepped in aggressively to defend lower price levels — a sign of resilience and market absorption. If XRP’s candle closes significantly higher than its intraday low, it could validate JD’s hypothesis that this is not just a panic event, but a structural reset. However, analysts caution that macroeconomic conditions in 2025 differ sharply from those in 2017. XRP’s next big move will depend on regulatory clarity, institutional liquidity, and the changing digital payments landscape. A Potential Turning Point Whether this wick ultimately becomes the largest in XRP’s history or not, it has already reignited confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. The market now watches closely as XRP consolidates above critical support zones, with traders speculating that this could mark the beginning of another defining chapter in the coin’s legacy. As JD aptly hinted, the last time XRP experienced a wick of this magnitude, it “made biblical history.” If the pattern holds, XRP’s latest chart may once again be writing a story for the ages.

The meeting came as India continues its push to become a global hub for chip manufacturing and AI innovation. Modi said on X that: “It was a wonderful meeting with Mr. Cristiano R. Amon and discussing India’s strides in AI, innovation and skilling. Great to see Qualcomm’s commitment towards India’s semiconductor and AI missions. India offers unmatched talent and scale to build technologies that will shape our collective future.” Interestingly, the timing of their meeting coincided with an escalating situation abroad. Just a day before, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) launched an antitrust investigation into Qualcomm over its acquisition of Israel’s Autotalks, adding more pressure on the American chip giant as global trade tensions grow. The regulator said the probe would determine whether the company failed to legally disclose aspects of the $ Autotalks deal, which was completed in June after more than two years of reviews. China opens probe as Qualcomm stock falls Qualcomm’s stock had dropped by nearly 6% during Friday’s close after investors freaked out over China’s investigation. The Autotalks deal had been cleared months earlier, but Beijing’s regulators said Qualcomm might have violated China’s antimonopoly law by withholding transaction details. In a statement, the company said it is fully cooperating with the probe and remains “committed to supporting the development and growth of our customers and partners.” It continues to supply chips to Chinese firms such as Xiaomi, even as Washington and Beijing clash over control of semiconductor supply chains. The probe, announced just weeks before high-level U.S.-China meetings, puts the firm squarely in the crossfire of economic politics. While this was happening, India is positioning itself as an alternative manufacturing and research base for global chip companies. The government has offered billions in subsidies to attract investors into AI-driven and semiconductor projects. Qualcomm’s expanding presence in India fits into this plan as the country prepares new data and compute centers to support machine learning, robotics, and industrial automation. Qualcomm expands into robotics with Arduino acquisition Earlier on Tuesday, Qualcomm announced it would acquire Arduino, the Italian electronics company known for its low-cost programmable circuit boards used by robotics labs and hardware startups, though Qualcomm confirmed Arduino will operate as an independent subsidiary. The decision gives Qualcomm access to the grassroots level of the robotics industry, reaching developers, tinkerers, and startups that rely on Arduino boards for prototyping. Arduino’s kits, which come with chips preinstalled, aren’t used in commercial products but are vital for building and testing early-stage AI models and robotic systems. “You start to move towards prototyping, proof of concepts, and once you’re ready, you can go commercial, which is something we are obviously very familiar with,” said Nakul Duggal, Qualcomm’s general manager for automotive, industrial, and IoT. Tuesday’s announcement said Arduino will, for the first time, release a board with a Qualcomm chip. It’s called the Uno Q and, priced at $45 to $55, comes equipped with a Qualcomm Dragonwing QRB2210 processor. The Arduino acquisition is reportedly part of Qualcomm’s plan to diversify beyond smartphones as demand plateaus and Apple develops its own modem chips. Qualcomm’s IoT and automotive divisions already make up about 30% of its total chip revenue, and for smaller developers, the deal opens access to Qualcomm’s technology, which was previously limited to large enterprises. Rival Nvidia, meanwhile, has been selling its robotics developer kits directly to consumers for about $249, calling robotics its next big market after AI. Qualcomm’s latest deals suggest it’s ready to compete head-to-head in that space. As the company faces regulatory pushback in China, its alignment with India’s government-backed AI and semiconductor ambitions could become its strongest path forward. Get seen where it counts.

The scammer shilled a memecoin called Shanghai Composite Index, with the ticker SCI6900, which was created on the BSC chain around four days ago. Sammer rugs his followers twice According to crypto sleuth Dethective, the scammer who goes by the name SmokezXBT rugged his followers twice. At first, SmokezXBT began purchasing SCI6900, along with other crypto influencers. He then shilled the meme coin to his 60,000 followers and spent an hour dumping the coin. At around 4:44 AM UTC, SmokezXBT started buying SCI6900 again. The scammer got a stroke of luck as one minute and 34 seconds later, at 4:46 AM UTC, CZ commented on the post, “Is this real?” CZ’s comment pushed the meme coin’s market cap by 10X from $3 million to almost $30 million. The scammer pocketed $430,000 in under two minutes. The token’s price increased by a staggering 4,557%. SmokezXBT bragged about his bag and wrote, “Told you so.” He even responded to Dethective and wrote, “Keep hating bozzos.” SmokezXBT explained that he bought SCI6900 at a $90,000 market cap, held the coin, and never sold it. Then bought again at a $3 million market cap and sold after CZ’s post. SmokezXBT wrote, “You just witnessed a masterclass on aping memes.” On-chain data shows that SmokezXBT has 1,466 deleted coin addresses, according to Dethective. ZachXBT says the scammer is a known grifter Crypto sleuth ZachXBT commented on Dethective’s X post and said, “That influencer is a known grifter.” He linked to a post from 2023 showing that SmokezXBT rugged his followers through a memecoin named BLOOD. SmokezXBT shilled it for days, rugged his followers, and deleted all social media accounts. ZachXBT reached out to SmokezXBT, who admitted lying to his followers. He claimed that he created BLOOD, but then said that two devs hired him to act as a marketer and promote the memecoin. ZachXBT said the grifter was “playing victim and making excuses.” CZ has been active in the crypto memecoin space, particularly after launching the Meme Rush wallet , which provides users with early access to memecoins. A few days ago, the BNB meme season was at its peak, with 70% of investors in profit, according to a report by Cryptopolitan. However, memecoins on Binance have suffered drastic losses, especially after the crypto market witnessed its largest single-day liquidation , which wiped out $9.55 billion. Binance memecoins suffered a 20.4% loss in the past 24 hours. The overall memecoins market capitalization is down by 19.8 %, according to CoinGecko.

What to Know • DOGE dropped from $0.22 to $0.11 at 21:00 UTC on Oct 10 — a 50% flash crash followed by recovery to $0.19–$0.20. • Total intraday range = $0.14 (≈57% volatility), with 4.6 billion tokens traded versus 1.5 billion daily average. • Trump administration’s 100% tariff announcement on Chinese imports triggered broader crypto risk-off. • Late-session trading showed whales re-accumulating; exchange outflows topped $23 million and 2 billion DOGE were added to corporate wallets. • 21Shares launched its institutional DOGE ETF (TDOG), offering the first regulated exposure to the asset. News Background The move came hours after President Trump’s tariff escalation sparked a cross-market selloff, hitting equities and digital assets alike. DOGE briefly traded as low as $0.11 on Bitfinex before stabilizing above $0.19 as liquidity desks intervened. Market chatter tied the collapse to leveraged liquidations and automated cross-venue arb failures rather than fundamental deterioration. Institutional demand resurfaced around $0.19, aided by ETF flows and whale bids rebuilding long exposure. Price Action Summary • Flash crash at 21:00 UTC: DOGE $0.22 → $0.11 (-50%) on 4.6 billion volume. • Recovery to $0.19–$0.20 within hours as whales absorbed supply. • Follow-through selling seen at 11:18 UTC Oct 11 ($0.1935 → $0.1916, -4%), volume 32 million. • Session range of $0.14 (57%) marks year-high volatility for DOGE. • Final hour consolidation near $0.193 signals cool-down but no trend reversal yet. Technical Analysis • Support – Formed at $0.19–$0.20 as institutional flows absorbed panic selling. • Resistance – Immediate barrier at $0.22 pre-crash high; above that, next targets $0.25 and $0.30. • Volume – Peak 4.6 billion vs 30-day average 2.0 billion; capitulation-grade turnover. • Pattern – Double-bottom near $0.19 may mark accumulation zone. • Momentum – Oversold RSI and expanding Bollinger bands suggest short-term mean reversion. What Traders Are Watching • Will $0.19 hold as a reliable support floor or invite another liquidation wave? • Can ETF flows and institutional accumulation offset broader macro risk? • Whales adding ≈2 billion DOGE — signal of value buying or exit liquidity trap? • Volatility regimes post-tariff shock — does DOGE return to 0.25–0.30 range or languish below 0.20? • Confirmation of triangle rebuild above $0.22 would invalidate bearish structure.",Markets|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-11 13:17:47

An attacker might only need to spend about $6 billion to completely take down the Bitcoin network, according to new work by Duke University finance professor Campbell Harvey. Harvey noted that both Bitcoin and gold are seen as “hedges against currency depreciation,” but Bitcoin faces much greater risks than gold. Related News: Cryptocurrencies Have Shaken Up the World Political Stage: Allegations Under Investigation According to the research, an attacker could seize control of the Bitcoin network within a week. This would require purchasing approximately $4.6 billion worth of hardware, spending $1.34 billion to build data centers, and incurring $130 million in weekly electricity costs. The attacker could also short Bitcoin in derivatives markets, generating massive profits from the price decline, potentially more than offsetting the attack costs. However, some experts believe this scenario is overblown. Bitcoin USA President Matt Prusak argued that such an attack is nearly impossible to implement in practice, saying, “Accumulating and deploying mining hardware takes years. Furthermore, short transactions requiring large amounts of collateral are difficult, and exchanges may shut down transactions if they detect suspicious activity.” *This is not investment advice.

The trader made an estimated $192 million in under two hours as Bitcoin fell sharply after the announcement, according to on-chain data. To this end, Blockchain records linked to Hyperliquid, a decentralized derivatives exchange, show the account was opened only hours before the trade. Shortly after, the trader opened a heavily leveraged Bitcoin short position roughly 30 minutes before Trump revealed the tariff policy. The timing aligned precisely with the announcement that triggered the largest crypto liquidation event of 2025. 🚨 This Hyperliquid whale opened shorts just 30 minutes before Trump announced 100% tariffs on China. Closed the trades for $192 million in profit. These accounts were opened today and He have already Withdrawn most of the money Lucky whale or insider ? #crypto #trump #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/OhYYlAPrc0 — DONECOIN (@donecoinX) October 11, 2025 Additionally, on-chain data shows profits climbing from under $40 million to more than $104 million within hours, with a 24-hour realized PnL of $88.5 million. Transaction logs reveal rapid withdrawals shortly after the trades closed, including multiple USDC transfers of $9.99 million each, suggesting a deliberate attempt to move funds quickly. Profiting from violent crypto crash Notably, the gains were made during a violent correction in the cryptocurrency market following Trump’s tariff move targeting Chinese goods and technology exports. Bitcoin dropped sharply, threatening to lose the $110,000 support level as global markets sold off. The broader crypto sector saw more than $19 billion in leveraged positions liquidated in a single day, wiping over $400 billion from total market capitalization. As a result, the trader’s profit, earned by shorting Bitcoin ahead of the crash, has raised questions about access to market-moving political information. The scale and timing of the trade, combined with the account’s sudden creation, has sparked scrutiny across crypto circles. While the trader’s identity remains unknown, the precise execution and immediate withdrawals point to a highly sophisticated strategy or possible access to privileged information.

However, profit-taking overpowered the market, and the crypto asset retreated by 4%. by Friday. Then came the Trump-induced fear, and BTC plunged to $101,000 on some exchanges before it recovered to $112,000 as of press time. Despite this, new data suggest that the real bull market phase could still be ahead. Bitcoin’s “Warm Zone” Momentum Binance market data indicates that Bitcoin has entered an important phase in its post-halving cycle, and is showing signs of measured strength rather than a speculative bubble. As of this week, over 530 days since the April 20, 2024, halving, Bitcoin is trading near $112,000, which is an 85% increase from its halving-day price of roughly $63,800. The data positions the market at 35% through its typical four-year cycle, a midpoint historically characterized by steady but controlled upward momentum. CryptoQuant noted that the cryptocurrency remains comfortably short of overheating levels. The Z-Score, a metric used to gauge price deviation from historical averages, currently stands at 1.47. This places Bitcoin within a “neutral momentum” zone, well below the 2.5 threshold that has previously indicated speculative excess and impending corrections. In addition to that, the 30-day moving average sits at about $115,913, and reflects a stable ascent rather than a parabolic rise. Volatility indicators further support the narrative of a steady climb. Binance data shows Bitcoin’s 30-day standard deviation at approximately $4,540, indicating low volatility and potential price compression. Interestingly, these conditions often precede major directional moves if supported by renewed liquidity inflows. Historically, Bitcoin’s price peaks have occurred between 500 and 600 days after each halving, a window that saw major cycle tops in 2013, 2017, and 2021. With the current cycle approaching this range, traders are watching closely for signs of acceleration or deviation from past patterns. While long-term holders and institutions continue to consolidate positions, the market remains in a phase of balanced optimism. The coming months will test whether Bitcoin repeats its familiar boom-and-peak trajectory or matures into a steadier, less volatile growth phase. No Euphoria, Yet Bitcoin Vector’s analysis also echoed a similar sentiment. Although long-term holders moving coins to exchanges suggest some selling, which resulted in a mild pullback, the activity is moderate and persistent rather than excessive. The market shows no signs of euphoria. If this transfer spike eases while on-chain fundamentals remain strong, it would validate confidence in Bitcoin’s uptrend, supporting continued momentum through Q4.

Gone are the days when hype alone could drive attention. Today, credibility, trust, and timing decide which projects get coverage — and which fade into the noise. Behind many of the space’s biggest success stories are a handful of PR agencies quietly shaping narratives, managing crises, and building reputation. We looked at the leading players helping crypto companies communicate effectively in 2025 — and how they differ in approach, strategy, and results. Outset PR — Data-Driven Communications for the Crypto Era Website: outsetpr.io Outset PR has become one of the most analytically sophisticated players in the industry. While many agencies rely on relationships and intuition, its proprietary intelligence, Outset Data Pulse , tracks crypto media performance continuously. This data layer allows Outset PR to identify which outlets, storylines, and angles actually move the needle, helping clients design evidence-based campaigns rather than guesswork-driven ones. What makes Outset PR stand out, though, isn’t just technology — it’s culture. The agency’s senior team stays deeply involved in every engagement, ensuring campaigns feel personalized, responsive, and genuinely collaborative. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, Outset PR tailors its strategy to each company’s maturity, goals, and budget — whether that’s launching a new protocol, repositioning a brand, or building long-term executive thought leadership. Best for: teams that value strategic storytelling, data-backed insight, and a trusted partnership approach. Coinbound — The Crypto Influencer Powerhouse Website: coinbound.io Coinbound remains one of the largest crypto PR agencies. Known for its expansive influencer and publication network, it has helped dozens of blockchain projects amplify launches, token events, and rebrands. The agency’s strength lies in reach — it can deliver fast, wide exposure across both traditional crypto media and community channels like Twitter and Discord. That said, Coinbound’s focus on scale means campaigns may sometimes emphasize visibility over depth or narrative strategy. Best for: large token launches, NFT drops, or crypto brands seeking influencer-led awareness. Melrose PR — Veteran Storytelling in Web3 Website: melrosepr.com Melrose PR brings years of experience across the blockchain ecosystem. The agency is known for a classic, relationship-driven PR approach — prioritizing thought leadership, executive positioning, and consistent media relationships. They’ve earned a reputation for steady, long-term narrative management, especially for mature blockchain projects or companies straddling Web2 and Web3 sectors. The tradeoff: less emphasis on analytics or campaign-level optimization. Best for: established blockchain brands needing consistent reputation management and thought leadership. MarketAcross — Global Reach and Scale Website: marketacross.com MarketAcross is best known for its end-to-end media distribution model, which offers guaranteed coverage across a large network of publications. It’s particularly popular among projects seeking global visibility quickly — especially around token listings or announcements. While the approach favors scale over precision, MarketAcross remains a dominant player for campaigns requiring extensive regional reach or multi-language exposure. Best for: international crypto projects prioritizing global awareness and volume. Serotonin — Strategic Storytelling Meets Brand Design Website: serotonin.co Serotonin operates at the intersection of brand strategy and PR, often helping Web3 companies shape positioning, messaging, and go-to-market strategy alongside media relations. The firm’s design-first, advisory-led model gives it a unique edge for projects building long-term ecosystems. While not purely a PR firm, Serotonin’s strategic depth makes it a strong choice for teams looking to combine communications with branding and marketing execution. Best for: complex Web3 companies needing unified brand and communications strategy. Agency Core Strengths Unique Approach / Differentiator Ideal For Outset PR Strategic storytelling, media intelligence, thought leadership Combines boutique partnership model with data analytics via Outset Data Pulse; known for highly personal, founder-level engagement Crypto & tech companies of all sizes seeking a strategic, data-informed, and human PR partner Coinbound Influencer marketing, large-scale visibility, Web3 community reach Deep influencer network and social amplification engine Token launches, NFT projects, and campaigns focused on broad awareness Melrose PR Thought leadership, media relationships, executive positioning Veteran PR firm with strong journalist ties and traditional comms discipline Established blockchain or fintech companies needing consistent long-term reputation management MarketAcross Global media syndication, content amplification End-to-end media distribution network offering guaranteed placement packages Projects needing international reach and scale quickly Serotonin Brand strategy, marketing integration, ecosystem building Operates at the intersection of brand, product, and communications, not just PR Complex Web3 or Layer-1 companies looking for strategic brand alignment The Bigger Picture — How Crypto PR Is Evolving The PR landscape in crypto is shifting fast. The market no longer rewards noise — it rewards credibility, metrics, and message discipline. Data is replacing intuition: Firms like Outset PR are showing that analytics can make storytelling more effective, turning communications into a measurable growth function. Influencers still matter, but less: The era of “tweet and hope” is fading. Media relations, thought leadership, and expert positioning are back in focus. Narrative timing is everything: With regulatory shifts and market volatility, the best agencies aren’t just storytellers — they’re forecasters. Final Take Each of these agencies brings something different to the table — Coinbound’s reach, Melrose’s relationships, Serotonin’s strategy, MarketAcross’s scale. But what’s emerging is a new standard: PR grounded in data, performance, and insight. That’s where Outset PR stands out. Its integration of analytics through Outset Data Pulse signals where the future of crypto communications is heading — toward smarter, faster, and more accountable storytelling.

The premier cryptocurrency, which had been struggling all day on Friday, October 10, eventually succumbed to bearish pressure after United States President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. The rest of the cryptocurrency market also faced significant downward pressure, with the prices of other large-cap assets nosediving following the US tariff news. According to data from CoinGlass, nearly $10 billion worth of open interest was erased from the crypto market in the largest single-day liquidation event in history. Trump Imposes 100% Tariff On Chinese Goods In an October 10 post on the Truth Social platform, Trump declared a 100% trade tariff on Chinese goods, over and above any tariff that they are currently paying. Trump said the tariffs were in response to China’s attempt to place export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for creating computer chips. Trump said: It has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1, 2025, impose large-scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them. Trump claims that China’s decision to impose these export controls affects all countries and was a plan devised by them years ago. The US will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software on November 1, or sooner, depending on further actions by China, the President wrote on Truth Social. According to recent reports , Trump later said that he is still open to meeting with Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China. The US President said he could lift the trade tariff if China walks back on its decision before November 1. Trump first announced the imposition of trade tariffs on countries, specifically China, in April 2025, sending shockwaves through cryptocurrency and equities markets. This decision was followed by the downturn of the price of Bitcoin to around $77,000. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $112,581, reflecting a 7.6% decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is down by over 8% in the last seven days.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|BTCUSDT|crypto|President Donald Trump,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|ASIA|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-11 14:00:28

How Ripple’s Tokenization Campaign Is Sparking Utility,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-lead-400-trillion-revolution/,"Crypto analyst Levi Rietveld has claimed that a $400 trillion XRP revolution is underway, driven by Ripple’s expanding efforts in Real-World Assets (RWA) tokenization. With major partnerships reportedly forming between Ripple and some of the largest players in the financial sector, XRP’s role in bringing traditional assets onto the blockchain is gaining significant attention across the industry. XRP To Lead The $400 Trillion Tokenization Wave According to Rietveld, XRP is not just another digital asset but a cornerstone of a financial revolution worth more than $400 trillion. In a recent post on X social media, the analyst explained that XRP is breaking into a market defined by RWA tokenization—an emerging industry that could reshape how global value is exchanged, sold, and verified. Related Reading: Investment CEO Highlights Why Ripple’s XRP Has The Strongest Utility In The Industry Rietveld emphasized that some of the world’s most influential institutions are now aligning with Ripple to pursue this tokenization vision. He mentioned that BlackRock, VanEck, and Securitize have reportedly joined forces with Ripple to develop frameworks for RWA tokenization, which redefine asset management and exchange. Unlike Bitcoin, which lacks the Layer 2 flexibility and throughput needed for RWA settlements, Rietveld explains that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) boasts the scalability and speed required for global financial operations. He mentioned that XRPL can execute 40,000 transactions per second—a level of performance that makes it ideal for handling the vast volume of tokenized asset transactions expected to dominate the future of finance. XRPL’s architecture also enables instant settlements and interoperability, qualities that are essential for financial entities managing trillions in global assets. If the tokenization trend continues at its current trajectory, Rietveld suggests that the market could eventually reach a $400 trillion valuation. Additionally, XRP could play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between traditional markets and blockchain infrastructure. Moreover, the cryptocurrency‘s utility could evolve beyond a payment asset into a core component of global financial infrastructure. SWIFT’s ISO 20022 Shift To Fuel Another XRP Revolution Another key development that could shape XRP’s future comes from the global payments network, SWIFT. According to the team behind BeLaunch, a premier decentralized launchpad, SWIFT will retire its legacy MT messaging system and fully adopt ISO 20022 on November 22, 2025. This change is set to enhance how banks and financial institutions communicate, enabling better data exchange, stronger security, and faster automation across global transactions. Related Reading: XRP Is Already Penetrating SWIFT’s Network Through Multiple Entry Points, Expert Highlights How The XRP Ledger is already compliant with ISO 20022, giving it a potential advantage in future banking integrations. This compatibility means XRP can easily fit into systems aligned with the new global messaging framework. However, as BeLaunch noted, readiness does not equal adoption. XRP must still navigate challenges related to regulation, liquidity, and competition from stablecoins and private blockchain networks. Even so, the ISO 20022 transition represents an important step toward global financial interoperability—the very principle on which Ripple has built its ecosystem.

And Why It Matters for Your Strategy,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/how-crypto-press-releases-differ-from-other-pr-formats-and-why-it-matters-for-your-strategy,"Public relations in crypto has undergone a fundamental transformation. What worked five years ago—when a simple press release could generate meaningful coverage and a single announcement might spark investor interest—no longer delivers the same results. Yet PR itself hasn't become less important. If anything, it's more critical than ever. The shift isn't about PR losing relevance. It's about understanding that the methods of effective PR have evolved dramatically, while the underlying need for credibility, visibility, and trust has only intensified. Why PR Is Still Essential in Crypto In an industry saturated with new projects, inflated promises, and constant noise, the ability to stand out as credible and trustworthy in crypto has become the ultimate competitive advantage. Consider what founders actually need to achieve: attract users, secure partnerships, raise funding, recruit talent, and build community trust. None of these happen in a vacuum. They all require reputation—the kind that comes from being recognized, quoted, and referenced as a legitimate player in the space. This is where PR delivers tangible value. Not through vanity metrics like press release syndication counts, but through earned recognition. When a major publication quotes your CEO on regulatory developments, when your project is cited in market analysis, when journalists reach out to you for expert commentary—these moments signal credibility in ways that paid advertising or self-promotion simply cannot match. The crypto market is particularly unforgiving when it comes to reputation. Projects without established credibility struggle to gain traction, regardless of their technical merits. Conversely, crypto projects that successfully position themselves as trusted voices enjoy compounding advantages: easier fundraising, stronger partnerships, better talent acquisition, and more resilient communities. PR hasn't lost its importance. It's become more important—but only when executed with sophistication that matches today's media landscape. The New Role of PR in the Crypto Industry The traditional model of PR was transactional and episodic: something happens, you announce it, journalists write about it, you move on. This linear approach made sense when media gatekeepers controlled information flow and audiences had limited alternatives for discovering new projects. That world no longer exists. Today's crypto PR operates on an entirely different model—one built around ongoing participation in industry conversations rather than isolated announcements. The goal of modern crypto PR isn't to ""get coverage"" for specific milestones , but to establish your project and its leadership as credible, consistent voices that contribute valuable perspectives to evolving discussions. This shift manifests in several concrete ways: From milestone announcements to continuous thought leadership. Rather than speaking only when you have product news, effective crypto PR now means regularly contributing analysis and commentary on industry trends. When market volatility hits, when regulations shift, when technical innovations emerge—these are opportunities to demonstrate expertise and position your project within the larger narrative. From blanket distribution to strategic relationships. The spray-and-pray approach of sending press releases to massive media lists has given way to cultivating genuine relationships with specific journalists who cover your sector. These relationships are built on mutual value: you provide journalists with unique data, timely expert perspectives, and access to information they can't get elsewhere; they provide you with coverage that reaches engaged, relevant audiences. From formal statements to authentic narratives. Audiences have become highly sensitive to corporate speak and promotional language. Modern PR succeeds by telling authentic stories—about technical challenges overcome, lessons learned from failures, or honest perspectives on industry developments. This narrative approach builds trust in ways that polished announcements never can. From one-way broadcasting to multi-directional engagement. PR today integrates across channels—earned media, social commentary, community discussions, and direct founder communication all working together. A single news development might generate a press statement, founder Twitter thread, journalist briefing, community AMA, and analytical blog post, each format serving its specific purpose within the larger strategic narrative. The new role of PR is less about managing discrete announcements and more about ongoing positioning. It's the continuous work of ensuring that when people think about your sector, your project comes to mind as a credible, knowledgeable participant in the conversation. How Crypto Press Releases Differ From Other Communication Formats Understanding where press releases fit within this evolved PR landscape requires recognizing how crypto press releases differ from other PR tactics —and why those differences matter. A press release is, by definition, an official brand statement. It can cover almost anything: a new feature, a funding round, a partnership, or even a CEO's appearance at a conference. The key is that it follows a strict and recognizable structure—written in third person, answering the core questions of who, what, where, and why it matters. This formal structure serves specific purposes. It provides a citable official record. It ensures consistent messaging across stakeholders. It meets regulatory requirements when necessary. And it gives journalists a reliable reference point when they need factual details. But this same rigidity limits what press releases can accomplish. They're inherently promotional. They lack the narrative depth that builds real engagement. And because they're self-published statements rather than earned coverage, they carry less credibility with audiences. By contrast, other crypto PR formats play very different roles : Exclusives give one journalist or outlet priority access to a story, creating stronger incentive for coverage. Rather than distributing news widely and hoping someone picks it up, an exclusive offers a specific journalist something valuable—the first opportunity to break news their competitors don't have. This approach generates deeper, more thoughtful coverage because the journalist has time and motivation to develop the story properly. Expert commentary positions founders or executives as credible voices in ongoing conversations, tying their insights to current events or industry trends. When major market movements happen, regulatory changes emerge, or technical debates unfold, expert commentary allows projects to demonstrate knowledge and perspective without directly promoting themselves. This builds credibility through contribution rather than self-promotion. Analytical articles add depth and context, helping projects demonstrate thought leadership and connect their product to larger market narratives. These pieces explore industry trends, analyze data, or provide frameworks for understanding complex topics. They position projects as knowledgeable participants in the broader ecosystem, not just promoters of their own offerings. Media interviews and features offer third-party validation that self-published content cannot match. When a journalist independently decides your story is worth telling to their audience, that endorsement carries weight. The journalist's questions, framing, and editorial context add credibility that press releases inherently lack. In short, a crypto press release is the most formal and rigid format —useful for record-keeping and announcements—but it can't replace the credibility, nuance, or audience engagement that organic coverage delivers. The Strategic Hierarchy: When Crypto Projects Should Use Each Format Effective modern PR recognizes that different formats serve different strategic purposes. The key is deploying each where it delivers maximum value rather than relying on any single approach. Press releases work best for formal milestone announcements requiring official records: funding rounds, major partnerships, executive appointments, or significant product launches. They ensure consistent messaging and provide stakeholders with citable references. But they should be deployed sparingly and always as part of a larger strategy, not as standalone tactics. Exclusives work best when you have genuinely newsworthy developments and relationships with reporters who cover your sector. By giving one journalist priority access, you generate deeper coverage that often prompts follow-up from other outlets. The strategic trade-off—limiting initial distribution to gain higher-quality coverage—usually delivers better long-term results than broad press release distribution. Expert commentary works continuously, not episodically. When industry news breaks, having spokespeople who can quickly provide informed perspective makes your project a go-to source for journalists. This requires monitoring the news cycle, developing clear viewpoints on major developments, and responding rapidly when opportunities emerge. Analytical articles work best for demonstrating thought leadership on complex topics where your project has unique expertise or data. These pieces take longer to develop but generate lasting value, positioning founders as credible voices beyond just their specific product offerings. The most sophisticated crypto PR strategies integrate all these formats strategically. A funding announcement might include an official press release (for the record), an exclusive with a major publication (for primary coverage), founder commentary on what the funding means for the industry (for thought leadership), and follow-up interviews expanding on the strategic vision (for deeper engagement). Each format reinforces the others, creating a comprehensive narrative that reaches different audiences through their preferred channels while building cumulative credibility over time. The Bottom Line: Crypto PR Hasn't Changed, But Its Methods Have The fundamental purpose of PR remains constant: building credibility, generating visibility, and establishing trust. What's changed is how these outcomes are achieved. The old model—write press release, distribute widely, hope for coverage—no longer works because media consumption, journalist workflows, and audience expectations have all evolved. But the underlying need for reputation hasn't diminished. If anything, in crypto's increasingly crowded and competitive landscape, credible positioning matters more than ever. Success requires recognizing that crypto press releases are one tool among many , useful in specific contexts but insufficient alone. Real PR impact comes from consistent participation in industry conversations, strategic relationship-building with media, authentic thought leadership, and integrated multi-format communication. Projects that embrace this evolved approach—using press releases when appropriate but investing primarily in earned media and organic positioning—build the kind of lasting reputation that actually drives business results. Because ultimately, crypto PR hasn't become less important. It's become more sophisticated. And the projects that understand this difference are the ones that break through the noise.",More News,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-10-11 14:03:47

The recent sharp downturn across digital assets caught millions off guard — but as retail traders scrambled for access, reports surfaced that many couldn’t even buy the dip . Yet beneath the panic, something far more strategic appears to have taken place: a quiet accumulation by institutions and deep-pocketed investors while the masses were locked out. That’s the premise shared by renowned XRP analyst JackTheRippler, who claimed that during the chaos, “the big players entered the game.” Recent on-chain and exchange data suggest he might be right. The Unfolding Market Chaos Friday’s session was one of the most violent for XRP in months. Within hours, prices plunged nearly 40%, triggering a tidal wave of forced liquidations across major exchanges. Analysts described it as a “capitulation event,” similar to the dramatic shakeouts that often precede large upward reversals in previous XRP cycles. What a coincidence, most crypto exchanges didn’t allow retail investors to buy during the dip. #XRP THE BIG PLAYERS ENTERED THE GAME — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 10, 2025 Market trackers such as CoinGlass reported that billions in leveraged positions were liquidated , pushing futures open interest to its lowest level in weeks. Order books thinned rapidly, and spreads widened across major trading venues, intensifying volatility. Retail Traders Locked Out While institutional players often have access to direct liquidity and OTC (over-the-counter) channels, retail investors depend on centralized exchanges. During the XRP crash, however, multiple traders reported that buy orders were restricted or delayed on some exchanges at the height of the volatility. This aligns with JackTheRippler’s observation that “most exchanges didn’t allow retail investors to buy during the dip.” Although exchange status pages showed no universal outage, several platforms acknowledged temporary liquidity constraints and delayed order executions. For everyday traders, that meant missing out on what might have been the lowest XRP entry points in months. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Whales Move While Retail Waits While retail accounts were frozen or limited, blockchain analytics painted a different picture. Massive XRP transfers — some exceeding $20 million each — were detected between wallets associated with high-net-worth holders and institutional-grade addresses. Data from Whale Alert and Santiment revealed a spike in large XRP movements precisely during the market’s steepest decline. These transactions suggest accumulation at lower levels, a classic hallmark of “smart money” behavior. Institutional investors often capitalize on moments of panic when liquidity thins, allowing them to build significant positions before prices recover. A Turning Point for XRP? Historically, XRP’s deepest wicks and forced sell-offs have preceded strong rebounds . The 2017 capitulation, for instance, marked the start of XRP’s legendary bull run. If the current setup echoes that past event, it could signify the beginning of a major accumulation phase — this time led not by retail enthusiasm, but by institutional confidence. As the dust settles, analysts caution that while fear still dominates sentiment, the market’s structural indicators suggest consolidation and possible recovery. If large holders have indeed re-entered, their participation could redefine XRP’s trajectory heading into 2026. JackTheRippler’s statement that “the big players entered the game” captures more than speculation — it reflects a recurring truth in crypto markets. When volatility strikes, retail often retreats or gets locked out, while institutions quietly move in. If history is any guide, the aftermath of this latest shakeout might not mark the end for XRP, but the quiet beginning of its next major chapter.

52993125,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/when-a-crypto-press-release-works-and-when-its-just-wasted-budget,1760191719,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/52993125.jpeg,When a Crypto Press Release Works – and When It’s Just Wasted Budget?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/when-a-crypto-press-release-works-and-when-its-just-wasted-budget,"In crypto, attention is a currency—and it’s volatile. A press release can still move the market of perception, but only when it’s deployed with intent. Used indiscriminately, it burns budget, clutters feeds, and distracts teams from channels that actually convert. Used precisely, it anchors a milestone, supports SEO, and opens doors that are otherwise hard to crack. So, when does a crypto press release work—and when is it wasted budget? Think of the press release as a format, not a strategy. It’s a tool inside a broader communications stack that includes founder threads on X, long-form posts on Medium/Substack, community AMAs, thought-leadership op-eds, and direct journalist outreach. Each does a different job. The press release’s job is credibility through formality, searchable permanence, and scalable distribution—when you actually need those things. Before pulling the trigger, ask: What outcome are we buying? Proof-of-record? Backlinks? A repeatable cadence to fuel Discover? Third-party logos for fundraising? If you can’t answer in one sentence, you’re probably funding a vanity line item. TL;DR: Press releases still work in crypto—but only for (1) official records that trigger coverage, (2) SEO/link-building, (3) mass visibility tactics, (4) vanity proof points for stakeholders, and (5) prying open selective outlets. For everything else, spend elsewhere. 1) Activating a News Trigger When a project hits a true milestone—mainnet launch, major partnership, exchange listing, funding, token unlock framework, or a “we shipped it” moment—a press release serves as the official statement of record. It gives journalists, investors, and community sleuths a canonical source to cite later. Used this way, the crypto release is the foundation stone that later organic coverage can build on . But it’s not the only trigger. In crypto, owned channels can move faster and feel more authentic: A founder’s X thread that lays out what’s new and why it matters A detailed Medium/Substack post with diagrams, audits, and FAQs A GitHub tag + changelog for deeply technical audiences Choose the trigger that best fits your audience and the velocity you need. A release can follow to cement the record. 2) SEO and Link Building Newswire bundles that syndicate to dozens of smaller outlets are not about human readership; they’re about backlink authority. At scale, those links can support your search rankings and help your docs , blog, and landing pages surface more reliably. Treat this as a technical SEO play: Optimize anchor text and link targets (docs, feature pages, pricing, audit reports). Time releases around product launches so the link graph aligns with your narrative. Measure with search console metrics, not traffic from the wire itself. 3) Mass Posting for Visibility Some strategies prioritize surface area over depth—staying visible across Google Discover, reinforcing keyword presence, or maintaining regular brand mentions during competitive windows (e.g., pre-listing, hackathon season, ecosystem showcases). Here, the format matters less than frequency and consistency. This is about recall, not persuasion. If credibility is your primary gap, choose another tactic. If repetition and breadth are the goals, press releases can be a repeatable lever in the mix. 4) Brand Vanity and Proof Points Sometimes the job-to-be-done is social proof: putting recognizable media logos in a pitch deck, on a homepage, or in an investor update. These placements often live deep inside newswire feeds—rarely read, but visually persuasive for gatekeepers who equate logos with legitimacy. Used intentionally, that’s a valid reputational tactic. Used reflexively, it’s ego spend. Be honest about which one you’re doing—and price it accordingly. 5) A Key to Closed Doors Top-tier crypto outlets can be selective and favor organic commentary or exclusive stories. When owned contributions aren’t an option and reporter bandwidth is tight, a well-crafted release can serve as a bridge: it creates a verifiable footprint, gives editors a fact base, and sometimes earns you a minimal placement in outlets that otherwise wouldn’t engage. It’s not a substitute for relationships or newsworthiness, but it can be the only viable entry point in rare cases—especially for emerging teams without prior media track records. When It Is Just Wasted Budget If you can’t tie the release to a specific, measurable job—record, SEO, visibility, proof, access—you’re likely funding shelfware. Crypto audiences reward clarity, transparency, and community-first storytelling far more than a formal PDF pasted across syndication sites. The opportunity cost is real: those dollars could fuel founder-led content, AMAs, analyst briefings, or integrations that create actual usage and word-of-mouth. Quick Decision Framework Use this one-minute check before you greenlight a release: Outcome: Can you name the single primary outcome? (Record / SEO / Visibility / Proof / Access) Audience Fit: Who needs this format? (Journalists, algorithms, investors, gatekeeping editors) Timing: Is there a real milestone or narrative arc right now? Redundancy: Would an X thread or blog post accomplish 80% of the same job faster? Measurement: What exact metric will prove it worked? (citations, referring domains, impressions, logo usage in deals, editor responses) If you can’t answer these, don’t ship a release—ship a thread or a post. What a Strong Crypto Press Release Should Include (If You Do One) Clear headline + precise subhead (chain, product, integration, dates) One-sentence value prop in plain English Concrete proof (audit links, partner quotes, on-chain references, repos) Quotes that add context, not fluff (from founders and partners) Specific next step (docs, demo, testnet/mainnet URL) Media kit link (logos, screenshots, diagrams) Contact and attribution (including an official X account for fast follow-ups) Conclusion So—is a crypto press release worth it? Yes—when it serves a defined job; otherwise, it’s wasted budget. In a noisy, fast-moving market, formality without function is just drag. The press release earns its place when it anchors a milestone, strengthens your link graph, maintains high-frequency presence, supplies social proof, or unlocks selective outlets. Outside those lanes, it’s dead weight. Do it if you can point to one primary outcome, a defined audience who values the format, and a measurement plan tied to that outcome.Skip it if your news is soft, your audience is mostly community-first, or an owned narrative (thread/post) will outperform on speed and authenticity. Prioritize your spend like this: Ship the thing → 2) Explain it clearly on owned channels → 3) Brief key journalists/analysts → 4) Use a press release only if it advances the plan on record, SEO, visibility, proof, or access. Final take: In crypto, intent defines impact. A press release is neither magic nor malign—it’s a specialized tool. Use it when the job demands it.

Market movements have traders on edge, keeping a close watch for signs of potential recovery and future gains. This article delves into the shifting dynamics and reveals which tokens might be primed for a rebound. In times of heightened attention and shifting narratives, timing and visibility are crucial. Data-driven agencies such as Outset PR monitor both token movements and media momentum. Their Outset Data Pulse provides timely insights into crypto media performance, significantly enhancing the efficiency of PR campaigns. XRP Eyes Resistance Levels Amid Market Movements Source: tradingview XRP is trading between $2.82 and $3.11. It's trying to break past $3.25, its nearest resistance level. If it manages, it could rise to the next barrier at $3.54. This would mean a potential gain of about 13% from the current range. The coin has seen a 30.41% increase over the last six months, showing some room for confidence among investors. Despite a recent dip of over 7% in the past week, its current momentum and support around $2.67 suggest underlying strength. The RSI is nearing 50, hinting at a balanced market sentiment, while the Stochastic indicator at 72.10 reflects continued interest from traders. Cardano Price Eyes Potential Breakthrough with Growth Prospects Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is currently priced between the mid-seventy to high eighty cents range. It's showing slight down movements this week and month but boasts an impressive rise of nearly 24% over six months. The coin faces some challenges ahead with nearby resistance at ninety-five cents, although breaking through could open the pathway to the dollar-six mark. A steady support level exists at around seventy-two cents, safeguarding it from sharp declines. The market indicators suggest Cardano has room for more upward movement. If momentum builds, ADA could see significant growth, potentially rising by over 20% if it manages to surpass the current resistance levels. How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Conclusion XRP struggles to maintain its position as it nears $2.75, indicating a need for stronger buyer support. Meanwhile, ADA drops below a significant support level, highlighting potential challenges ahead. Both coins face critical moments that could dictate their short-term performance. Investors might need to watch closely for any signs of recovery or further decline. The market's reaction in the coming days will be crucial for both XRP and ADA.

Predictions are swirling around whether this momentum could propel Bitcoin to reach staggering new heights by 2026. The article will explore insights and possibilities surrounding this question and examine which cryptocurrencies might join Bitcoin in experiencing significant growth. In an environment of increasing scrutiny and evolving perceptions, both timing and visibility are paramount. Data-driven agencies like Outset PR track token activity and media engagement. Their Outset Data Pulse offers prompt analyses of crypto media effectiveness, thereby significantly boosting the impact of PR initiatives. Bitcoin's Steady Climb Sparks Hope for New Highs Source: tradingview Bitcoin is experiencing an upward trend, trading between approximately $114,810 and $128,022, marking a 9% increase over the last month. Investors are closely monitoring its approach to a significant resistance level around $133,042. Should Bitcoin successfully break past this initial resistance, it could target a second level near $146,254, representing a roughly 14% jump from its present range. This potential surge is supported by a robust 42.4% growth over the past six months. With a balanced market sentiment, Bitcoin is well-positioned for further gains if positive trends persist.

Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her role in the fight for democracy, saw a spike in bets on her victory on the prediction markets hours before the official announcement, Bloomberg reported. The spike was so notable that Polymarket’s official account posted on social media about it. A trader using the handle “ dirtycup ” placed a near $70,000 bet on Machado and walked away with about $30,000 in profit, without adding any other type of exposure. The account had been opened only weeks earlier and had no prior betting history, according to Polymarket data. Two other accounts also focused solely on Machado and earned a combined $90,000, local Norwegian outlet Finansavisen reported. “We take this very seriously,” said Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute. “It seems we have been prey to a criminal actor who wants to earn money on our information.” While the Nobel Peace Prize selection process is known for its secrecy, the committee had reportedly made its decision days earlier. The committee is now reviewing the situation. Polymarket allows users to bet on real-world events, from elections to celebrity gossip.

In a statement published on its website, the Bristol-based firm said bitcoin, despite its long-term price gains, “is not an asset class” and lacks the intrinsic characteristics that would justify including it in a portfolio for growth or income. Hargreaves Lansdown argued that the cryptocurrency’s price history shows periods of “extreme losses,” adding that performance assumptions are impossible to analyze and that the asset “shouldn’t be relied upon” to help clients meet financial goals. The company’s remarks come shortly after the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) ended its nearly four-year ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for retail investors. Hargreaves Lansdown said it plans to take several months to develop what it calls a “balanced client journey,” ensuring customers receive detailed risk warnings and pass an appropriateness assessment before being allowed to invest. Clients who qualify will typically face a 10% portfolio cap on crypto exposure under FCA rules. The firm also highlighted new regulatory conditions for the UK market. The FCA will only allow crypto ETNs that are physically backed by bitcoin or ether — meaning they are supported by reserves of the underlying assets — and that are listed on a Recognised Investment Exchange (RIE) such as the London Stock Exchange. These restrictions are intended to bring crypto products under the same disclosure, transparency, and investor-protection standards that apply to traditional securities. While bitcoin’s inclusion in conventional portfolios remains a step too far for Hargreaves Lansdown, it acknowledged that some clients will still want speculative exposure. The firm said it expects to launch access to crypto ETNs in early 2026, with offerings likely to include pound-denominated, physically backed products from issuers such as 21Shares, CoinShares and WisdomTree.",Policy|Bitcoin|Ether|UK|ETPs|FCA|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-11 14:28:19

According to Coinglass data, over 1.6 million traders were forced out of their positions, marking one of the largest market clearances since 2021. The trigger came after former U.S. President Donald Trump proposed a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, sparking widespread panic across financial markets and causing a sharp selloff in both traditional and digital assets. Source: X Market Mechanics Trigger Chain Reaction According to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, the sudden crash stemmed from how centralized exchanges manage margin trading. When altcoins used as collateral lost value, exchanges automatically liquidated them to cover margin deficits. This triggered a wave of forced selling across assets. Market analyst CrediBULL Crypto supported this view, noting that the liquidation cascade occurred due to altcoins’ limited liquidity. As positions unwound, each sale triggered another, amplifying the market downturn. He added that the extreme “wick lows” seen during the crash likely reflected forced selling rather than genuine market activity. Besides market structure, analysts pointed out that excessive leverage played a critical role. Many traders had opened highly leveraged positions in anticipation of continued gains. Once prices dipped, automated systems triggered a domino effect, draining billions from derivative markets within hours. Solana Faces Heavy Pressure but Network Shows Strength Amid the chaos, Solana (SOL) suffered a sharp decline of 17.5% over the last 24 hours, falling to around $183 . Its market capitalization now stands at $100.4 billion, with a circulating supply of 550 million tokens. However, Solana’s network performance surprised many. According to the core development team at Anza, the blockchain endured its most intense stress test yet, maintaining stability while processing over 100,000 transactions per second. The Agave validator client handled six times the usual peak traffic without any degradation, demonstrating Solana’s scalability under extreme conditions. Solana ETF Optimism Offers Hope for Recovery Despite the record losses, optimism remains for Solana’s long-term outlook. Recent regulatory adjustments have made U.S. ETF approval for Solana more likely, potentially opening doors for institutional investment.

The turbulence came after President Donald Trump announced that starting November 1, he will impose new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, which is on top of the 30% tariffs that he set in May. The announcement sparked a massive selloff on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recording their highest percentage loss since April, when Trump first started issuing tariffs to various countries in what he claimed were measures to fix trade deficits. The sell-off extended into global equity markets, with traders fleeing riskier assets amid uncertainty about the economic fallout, and the crypto markets weren’t left out. As global equities and crypto assets plunged, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like Aave and Uniswap handled record transaction volumes without major disruption. Aave’s automated resilience While much of the market was in chaos, Aave, a leading decentralized lending protocol, reportedly processed what the platform’s founder and CEO, Stani Kulechov, described as the largest automatic liquidation event in its history. “Today, @aave experienced the largest stress test of its $75B+ lending infrastructure,” Kulechov wrote on X . “The protocol operated flawlessly, automatically liquidating a record $180M worth of collateral in just one hour, without any human intervention. Once again, Aave has proven its resilience.” Kulechov’s comments gained traction among the crypto community as evidence that DeFi protocols can manage extreme conditions without freezing or requiring operator decisions. That stands in contrast to the temporary outages that have occasionally hit large centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase during previous market routs, with some users of the latter reportedly experiencing degraded performance in the heat of the liquidations that occurred on October 10. Uniswap’s $9 billion trading day Trading activities, while heavy on selling, soared in other parts of the DeFi market. Uniswap , the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) by volume, reportedly processed close to $9 billion in trades on the same day, a figure its founder Hayden Adams described as “well above the norm.” Replying to Kulechov’s post on X, Adams posted , “Large sell-offs are good reminders of how DeFi is simply built differently. Uniswap did close to $9b in trading volume today — well above the norm — with no stress or downtime.” The figures give credence to the claims that decentralized exchanges can handle enormous volumes without the risk of halts. According to on-chain analytics platforms such as Coinglass, DeFi protocols collectively processed billions in transactions during the sell-off without major incidents. That has strengthened perceptions of their reliability. The road ahead for decentralized finance The latest events have reinforced DeFi’s image as the “always-on” alternative to traditional finance. However, industry analysts warn that resilience in one dimension does not equate to invulnerability. A system that can liquidate hundreds of millions in minutes, some argue, could just as easily trigger instability if a coding flaw or network congestion emerged at the wrong moment. That vulnerability is often brought to the fore when DeFi protocols are exploited.

The final candidate is expected to be announced in January, but it has been reported that this candidate may not take over immediately. According to senior Treasury officials, the five finalists include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman, Vice Chair for Supervision, and Board Member Christopher Waller. The other candidates announced are National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock Chief Investment Officer Rick Rieder.

The fast transactions on the network and growing ecosystem have dominated the thoughts in mainstream minds, and it is one of the most watched cryptocurrencies this quarter. But with investors seeking alternatives to blue-chip tokens, a comparatively lesser-known project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking the spotlight with the promise to outshine even the titans of the industry. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), now in presale, has already obtained more than $17.1 million in capital from more than 16,840 investors. Its V1 lending and borrowing protocol, which launches on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, is making Mutuum Finance a high-utility DeFi contributor with potentially ginormous returns. Solana Eyes $250 as Market Momentum Builds Solana (SOL) is showing fresh bullish strength after the last several days in the region of $226 propelled it into $233–$240, barely away from the expected target. Now trading at approximately $222, the trend structure remains staunchly bullish, with future major targets being $247–$250+. Key metrics highlight Solana’s growing dominance: $15.3 billion in circulating stablecoins, just at an all-time high, reflects its status as fast-emerging liquidity hub, and on-chain demand in DeFi, payments, and consumer applications remains on the rise, showing good trust, scalability, and adoption. As the market takes notice of this rise, savvy investors are also beginning to consider Mutuum Finance that could accrue the same power in DeFi. Mutuum Finance Presale Frenzy Grows Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now the hottest thing in the world of DeFi, with early bird investors purchasing tokens at a discount. The presale is in Phase 6 and is $0.035 per MUTM token and has already secured more than $17.1 million from more than 16,840 investors. With more than 60% sold out in Phase 6, there is not much time left for the investors to invest, which is a reflection of growing global confidence in the future of the project and the vision of decentralized finance. Early investors will realize great potential gain when MUTM goes live on the open market. Mutuum Finance will also tokenise a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The token, unlike algorithmic stablecoins that fail during times of bear market, is overcollateralised and non-algorithmic such that it is stable and reliable even in times of volatile markets. Mutuum Finance Lending and Borrowing Protocol The platform will launch its new-generation lending and borrowing protocol , a major milestone for its DeFi platform. Version 1 will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be the first assets to be supported for lending, borrowing, and collateralization and will provide a safe, intuitive, and multi-asset DeFi experience. Mutuum Finance deploys advanced user protection features and ecosystem stability features. Its close-order book structure is designed to avoid illiquidity and control market risk through close-level terms, liquidation levels, and incentives to the liquidator tailored for secure lending. Its LTV ratios and liquidation parameters are calculated dynamically as a function of asset volatility with higher volatility assets and more stringent loan terms. Risk-weighted multipliers apply to all asset classes to confer stability, resilience, and security even during the most turbulent market conditions. While Solana (SOL) rockets towards $250, investors chasing more upside are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rapidly rising DeFi project built for real use case. Priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum already has over $17.1 million from 16,840+ investors, with 60% of tokens sold. Its new-generation lending and borrowing protocol, going live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, adds liquidity pools, mtTokens, and a non-algo USD-backed stablecoin to enhanced long-term stability. Risk-weighted lending secured with dynamic LTV ratios, Mutuum is designed for growth as much as resilience and is thus the quintessential candidate for 50x potential as DeFi adoption gains momentum.

AlphaPepe Emerges as Best Crypto Presale,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-btc-hit-60k-alphapepe-emerges-as-best-crypto-presale/,"Bitcoin is back in the spotlight after a brutal month of volatility. From soaring near $110,000 to tumbling below $105,000, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has left investors guessing what comes next. Now, many analysts are asking a chilling question — could Bitcoin really fall all the way to $60,000 before the next bull run begins? At the same time, a new wave of optimism is forming elsewhere. While institutional traders debate macro trends, retail investors are flooding into presales — and none are gaining as much traction as AlphaPepe (ALPE), which just set a new milestone with its second USDT pool surpassing $7,000, cementing its reputation as the best crypto presale right now. Bitcoin’s $60K Speculation The current Bitcoin correction has traders divided. Some see this as a short-term flush after months of overextended leverage, while others warn of a deeper drawdown toward the $60K zone — roughly a 45% correction from recent highs. That level, historically, has served as a “reset floor” during mid-cycle phases. The macro backdrop remains uncertain. Global markets are jittery amid trade tensions, and institutional flows have slowed. Bitcoin’s recent failure to hold above key resistance levels adds technical weight to the bearish argument. If the market breaches $100K decisively, momentum could easily accelerate to the downside. Still, the long-term view remains resilient. Exchange reserves continue to decline, suggesting whales are holding rather than selling, and on-chain metrics show that long-term holders aren’t panicking. A dip toward $60K — while painful — could simply represent the kind of deep correction that often precedes a major rally. The Calm Before the Retail Storm When Bitcoin enters these periods of uncertainty, the spotlight often shifts to the retail side of the market. This is where speculative energy gathers — and where new narratives are born. During previous cycles, massive drawdowns in Bitcoin sparked a wave of capital rotation into meme coins, presales, and community-driven tokens. Right now, that shift is clearly visible. Meme projects are regaining traction, and investors are searching for early-stage opportunities that can multiply when sentiment turns. The standout in that category is AlphaPepe — a project that has managed to combine the viral energy of memes with the credibility of real DeFi structure. AlphaPepe: The Presale That’s Breaking Records AlphaPepe isn’t your average meme coin launch. Built on the BNB Chain, it merges community culture with serious tokenomics. The project has already attracted over 2,300 holders, raised more than $295,000 in its presale, and — most impressively — just saw its second USDT pool surpass $7,000, setting a new internal record for the team. Its design emphasizes transparency and longevity. Liquidity will be locked indefinitely, the smart contract has been audited, and tokens are delivered instantly upon purchase. Staking rewards of up to 85% APR offer holders real yield potential, encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term flipping. While other meme coins rely purely on hype, AlphaPepe is building an ecosystem that merges humor, security, and passive rewards — a combination that’s proving magnetic during a market lull. Why AlphaPepe Fits the Moment In times of fear, traders look for hope. AlphaPepe represents that optimism — a high-risk, high-reward play that’s transparent enough to attract cautious investors and viral enough to energize retail crowds. The timing couldn’t be better. With Bitcoin’s trajectory uncertain, many retail traders are diversifying into promising presales rather than waiting for the next BTC breakout. AlphaPepe’s consistent growth through market turbulence proves it’s not just a speculative fad. Its rapid presale progress and community engagement suggest it’s positioned to dominate the meme coin narrative heading into 2025. The 2025 Bitcoin Reversal Scenario If Bitcoin does drop to $60,000, it could mark the last major shakeout before the next big rally. Historically, deep retracements have preceded massive bull runs — cleansing excess leverage and redistributing supply to stronger hands. Once the market finds its floor, risk appetite typically floods back into altcoins and meme coins first. That’s when projects like AlphaPepe tend to explode. By entering early, investors position themselves before the next retail wave hits. And given AlphaPepe’s track record — audited security, locked liquidity, active community, and record-breaking USDT pools — it stands ready to capture that momentum. Conclusion Bitcoin’s path toward $60K may sound daunting, but corrections like these have always been part of the crypto story. They purge greed, rebuild conviction, and set the stage for new leaders to emerge. While the market debates where BTC bottoms, AlphaPepe is quietly building a new chapter — a meme coin that’s already proving it can thrive even in uncertainty. With its second USDT pool surpassing $7,000, audited framework, and explosive community growth, AlphaPepe is redefining what a successful presale looks like. Whether Bitcoin finds support at $100K or plunges lower, the next big opportunity might not be in waiting — it might already be here.

Three Possible Scenarios",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-price-drops-toward-117000-what-lies-ahead-three-possible-scenarios/,"The Bitcoin price has experienced a notable decline of 6% from its all-time highs, leading to significant liquidation events that approached $200 million on Friday, while sparking renewed speculation about the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory. Analysts from The Bull Theory attribute the current slump to geopolitical developments, specifically President Donald Trump’s announcement of substantial tariffs and export controls on Chinese goods, particularly affecting key industrial and strategic materials. How Tariff Risks Are Impacting The Bitcoin Price The implications of these tariffs, according to the analysts, are multifaceted, introducing risks that could disrupt supply chains, accelerate inflation, and slow global trade. Related Reading: Why The Dogecoin Price Could Surge 3,690% To $9.8 This Bull Cycle Several factors are contributing to Bitcoin’s sell-off at this time. First, there is a notable risk rotation occurring, with investors seeking refuge in safer assets such as cash and gold. Second, the looming tariff risks could lead to rising inflation, potentially delaying anticipated rate cuts. Third, the unwinding of short leverage positions is impacting alternative cryptocurrencies and leveraged Bitcoin holdings, exacerbating the downward trend. Lastly, the uncertainty surrounding trade policies has created an “uncertainty premium,” prompting markets to demand a discount until a clearer picture emerges. Drawing parallels to past market behavior, the analysts recall that threats of tariffs in 2025 precipitated a significant crash in the Bitcoin price and other cryptocurrencies. These recent moves appear to serve as liquidity probes, testing the market’s resilience and flushing out weaker hands before a potential recovery phase. Analysts Predict Positive Outlook For BTC Looking ahead, The Bull Theory suggests market participants should be vigilant about BTC’s nearest key support zone, particularly around the $116,000 mark, where buyers have historically returned. Additionally, they assert that the reaction of policymakers will be crucial; if the Federal Reserve (Fed) signals a willingness to ease monetary policy, a sharp rebound could follow. Conversely, if Trump’s rhetoric regarding tariffs diminishes or becomes more defined, it is expected that confidence in the market may be restored. In the short term, analysts anticipate continued downside volatility with potential retests of support levels. However, the medium-term outlook suggests that savvy investors may begin accumulating Bitcoin as the prevailing narrative weakens. Long-term, with anticipated rate cuts and the historically strong performance of markets in the fourth quarter, the prospects for the Bitcoin price appear promising. As liquidity returns and market momentum builds, the path forward for Bitcoin often trends upward. BTC At $130,000 By Month-End? Market expert Timothy Peterson has also weighed in, noting that half of Bitcoin’s gains for October may have already been realized, according to artificial intelligence (AI) simulations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Who? XRP Leads Coinbase Search Charts, Beating The Giants The analysis presented earlier this week a 50% chance that the Bitcoin price will finish the month above $140,000, and a 43% probability it would end below $136,000. However, following the recent Bitcoin price drop, the updated AI forecast suggests an expected month-end value of around $130,000, representing an 11% increase from the current price of approximately $117,300.

What began as a quiet hour turned into a cascade of forced liquidations and wild swings, culminating in a dramatic intraday reversal. While observers like Austin Hilton emphasized the human narrative — “flash crash, bounce back and buying opportunity”, the full picture is defined by macro tides, technical structure, and market psychology. The Anatomy of the Flash Crash The selling spiral was triggered not by anything intrinsic to XRP, but by a sudden escalation in U.S.–China trade tensions. In a surprise announcement, President Trump revealed plans to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting November 1, sparking a sharp reaction in equity and crypto markets. The Dow plunged nearly 900 points, the Nasdaq shed about 820 points, and Bitcoin buckled — dragging altcoins in its wake. As XRP attempted to hold support near $2.70–$2.50, large leveraged positions were wiped out: over $150 million in futures long positions were liquidated. The cascade pushed XRP’s price down to a wick or low of $1.64 before the market began absorbing the pressure. Trading volume surged — about 164 % above its 30-day average — as buyers and sellers scrambled. Austin Hilton, speaking about the move, framed it as a moment of forced volatility: “We had an XRP flash crash, XRP moved down to $1.50 and bounced back. This is a macro-market condition.” His tone captures how traders viewed the event: not a collapse of fundamentals, but an extreme replay of leverage mechanics in a stressed market. XRP Flash Crash Today! XRP Already Bounced Back! Where Will XRP Go From Here? pic.twitter.com/PSwNW6slxg — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) October 10, 2025 The Rebound and Short-Term Battle Zones The recovery was swift but halting. After bottoming near $1.64, XRP consolidated upward and closed the day in the $2.30–$2.40 range. That rebound suggests that many participants viewed the deep wick as an overextension. This wasn’t a instant full recovery, but rather a test of whether buyers can absorb selling pressure or if sellers will push back. Support zones to watch include $2.30–$2.35, with an additional floor near $2.20 if momentum weakens. On the upside, there’s resistance between $2.80 and $2.90. To regain lost ground, the price would need to break above $3.00 and stay there. If Bitcoin and macro risk stabilize, the bounce could carry XRP toward $3.50 in the medium term. Ongoing uncertainty from macro news suggests a slower, more gradual price bottom is more likely. CoinDesk strategists point out that $16 billion in leveraged long positions were liquidated across major tokens, which can delay market recovery. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Macro Tailwinds, Risks, and Market Psychology While the flash crash may feel idiosyncratic, it is squarely rooted in macro cracks. The tariff escalation reignited systemic risk aversion, and crypto — as a high-beta asset class — was vulnerable. Hilton’s framing that “there is nothing inherently wrong in the XRP ecosystem, this is a broader market pullback” echoes the view that this was not a token-specific breakdown. Yet macro clouds remain heavy. If the trade war escalates further, or if Bitcoin fails to reclaim its footing, XRP could come under renewed pressure. Hilton even concedes: “We could have some more downside risk here across all major altcoins, including XRP.” On the positive side, XRP retains strengthening catalysts. Expectations around spot XRP ETF approvals and institutional flows may provide a buffer. Regulatory clarity post-Ripple’s legal battles has improved the risk profile in recent months. Outlook and Key Signals to Watch As tomorrow unfolds, the path for XRP will largely depend on two overarching axes: Bitcoin’s Stability & Risk Sentiment: If BTC can hold support and recapture momentum, it may drag alts, including XRP, higher. If investors become more risk-averse, XRP’s price could drop further Volume and Open Interest Rebuilding: The $150 million purge of long positions leaves significant structural holes. For a durable rally, fresh inflows and derivative interest must rebuild. Macro News Flow: Any de-escalation in U.S.–China tensions or dovish surprises will help. Conversely, further tariff escalation or macro surprise could reignite panic. Hilton’s idea of an emotional reset and opportunistic buying resonates with traders tracking price movements, but the real test is whether market conditions will sustain any potential bounce. For now, the $2.30–$2.80 band is where battle lines are drawn — and whichever side holds it first will likely chart XRP’s near-term direction.

Grok 4 Fast has entered General Availability, and Oracle is describing it as a speed- and cost-optimized version of xAI’s flagship Grok 4 model. It is reportedly designed to be faster and more efficient, cutting down latency with a rapid time-to-first-token and higher output rates, built specifically for real-time AI applications. Businesses across supported regions can now access the model directly through the xAI playground and review all supported regions and features in Oracle’s Generative AI documentation. If Elon is to be believed, his AI model’s main mission is to deliver speed without compromise, catering to industries that rely on immediate feedback, live interactions, or instant content generation. According to the richest man on earth, he is targeting developers and enterprises who need on-demand performance without paying premium prices for compute power with Grok 4 Fast. xAI strengthens its Oracle partnership with enterprise Grok models Back in June, Oracle and Elon’s xAI confirmed a deeper partnership to roll out Grok models across Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, enabling broader use cases like content creation, scientific research, and business process automation. xAI said it would use Oracle’s scalable and high-performance cloud systems to train and run inferencing for its next-generation Grok models. xAI co-founder Jimmy Ba said, “Grok 3 represents a leap forward in AI capabilities and Oracle’s advanced data platform will accelerate its impact on enterprises.” That statement came as xAI was building momentum toward its next model lineup. Greg Pavlik, executive vice president of AI and Data Management Services at Oracle, added, “By bringing xAI’s cutting-edge Grok models to our customers, we are expanding the possibilities of AI in the enterprise.” This partnership places Grok at the center of Oracle’s AI ambitions. Oracle emphasized that its cloud infrastructure is designed to bring AI closer to enterprise data while maintaining security, scalability, and adaptability. The company said this structure allows clients in healthcare, finance, and manufacturing to integrate AI directly into their business logic without exposing sensitive datasets. Thousands of developers are already running their AI workloads on OCI’s bare metal GPU instances, which support intensive tasks like generative AI, natural language processing, computer vision, and recommendation systems. For Elon, this deal ensures that xAI’s Grok models get the same industrial-grade backbone as OpenAI’s systems, but with greater emphasis on real-time speed and cost performance. Oracle’s GPUs give Grok 4 Fast the infrastructure it needs to deliver quick inference cycles while keeping compute bills lower than rival cloud setups. When Elon released Grok 4 Fast, he said: “Grok 4 Fast features state-of-the-art (SOTA) cost-efficiency, cutting-edge web and X search capabilities, a 2M token context window, and a unified architecture that blends reasoning and non-reasoning modes in one model.” Oracle’s deployment of GPT5 intensifies the Musk-Altman AI rivalry The timing of this release fuels the long-running feud between Elon and Sammy Altman, the CEO of OpenAI. Just two months ago, Oracle rolled out OpenAI’s GPT-5 across its entire database portfolio and SaaS suite, including Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications, NetSuite, and Oracle Industry Applications such as Oracle Health. Oracle described GPT-5 as OpenAI’s “smartest and fastest model yet,” built for code generation, debugging, and reasoning across business workflows. “GPT-5 will bring our Fusion Applications customers OpenAI’s sophisticated reasoning and deep-thinking capabilities,” said Meeten Bhavsar, senior vice president, Applications Development, Oracle. “The newest model from OpenAI will be able to power more complex AI agent-driven processes with capabilities that enable advanced automation, higher productivity, and faster decision making.” Sam’s GPT-5 gives developers more control over complex data pipelines and orchestration. Elon’s Grok 4 Fast, on the other hand, focuses on speed and live response, targeting companies that value real-time AI interaction. Both are now competing within Oracle’s cloud ecosystem, turning Oracle into the one platform where both rival AIs coexist.

Known for its robust technological foundation, Ozak AI combines AI with Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), setting a new standard in the crypto world. In the recent market valuation, with an entry price of just $0.012 per token, an initial investment of $10,000 could potentially balloon to an impressive $833,333 if the token price escalates to $1. This remarkable growth trajectory is bolstered by the token's expanding application range and verified strategic partnerships. Technical Backbone and Functionalities of Ozak AI Ozak AI's infrastructure is anchored in its proprietary DePIN technology, which leverages IPFS nodes for secure, redundant data storage. This decentralized model not only enhances data reliability but also prevents single points of failure in data delivery across its networks. The Ozak Stream Network (OSN), an integral part of the platform, harnesses real-time, tamper-evident data from various blockchains. This feature feeds into AI models that perform trusted and accurate financial analytics and autonomous decision-making processes. The introduction of the Ozak Prediction Agent marks another milestone, enabling both businesses and individuals to access instantaneous insights without depending on intermediaries.

Yet, the project's core strengths remain robust. This article dives into how the need for reliable oracles could ignite a recovery. Discover which cryptocurrencies might be poised for growth and why Chainlink's fundamentals could signal a coming bounce. Chainlink's Price Dips: Is a Bounce-Back Possible? Source: tradingview Chainlink (LINK) currently trades between around $21 and $23 after a recent dip. In the past week, LINK dropped over 21%, contributing to a month-long decline of nearly 25%. Despite this, the price has surged over 40% in the last six months. The nearest resistance sits a bit above $24, and clearing it could push values toward the $26 mark. On the downside, support at approximately $20 protects against further losses. With an RSI of nearly 36 signaling it's not oversold just yet, there's room for potential growth. If the price climbs to the second resistance, it could represent a bounce of around 20% from the lower end of the current range. Conclusion LINK has dropped 21%, but its core elements remain strong. The demand for oracles could lead to a recovery. As oracles continue to be crucial for blockchain projects, LINK's role appears essential. Future interest and integration could help reverse the current trend. The ongoing need for reliable data feeds may boost LINK’s value.

The agency said automakers have either directly stated or quietly implied that the new tariffs will erase more than one-fifth of the operating profit these companies earned in 2024. Margins are set to shrink by 100 to 150 basis points, and the financial damage will become clearer when automakers begin reporting third-quarter earnings later this month, according to Moody’s Ratings. The agency’s prediction reportedly factors in Trump’s trade deals with the European Union and Japan, which offer limited stability. But negotiations with Mexico and Canada are still stalled, leaving uncertainty for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Talks with South Korea, where automakers Hyundai and KIA are headquartered, are also unresolved. The delays have left manufacturers guessing about future costs, production strategies, and export limits. Automakers respond with cost cuts and price hikes Automakers are scrambling to cushion the blow from the tariffs, often turning to blunt tools that hit both their products and customers. “Automakers will continue to try to offset tariffs by reducing amenities in their vehicles and raising prices, which are less complex to implement and make more sense while the situation remains fluid,” Moody’s Ratings said . In simple terms, consumers will likely pay more for less, and car companies know it. Several major automakers, including Volvo, Hyundai, Kia, and General Motors (GM), have already adjusted their production lines and localized more of their manufacturing to reduce exposure to tariffs. GM said it plans to invest an additional $4 billion to expand U.S. production and add new vehicle models to its domestic lineup. But Moody’s warned that these fixes come at a cost: “Implementation of these more structural mitigation measures takes an extended period of time and likely requires additional investments by automakers and their suppliers.” That means while these companies may dodge some tariff pain in the future, they’re paying heavily for it now. Each new investment delays returns and cuts into capital that might have gone to electric vehicles or research. And for now, the tariff squeeze remains an expensive balancing act. Profit hits mount as trade wars grind on The total tariff impact for major global automakers has already reached $11.7 billion, based on Yahoo Finance’s review of financial disclosures from the June quarter. Toyota tops the list with the largest exposure, followed by Volkswagen, GM, Ford, and Honda. Chinese automakers were not included in the count since they don’t operate in the U.S., but the trade ripple still affects their parts supply chains globally. Even Tesla, which builds all its vehicles in the U.S., has been caught in the crossfire. The company said tariff costs rose by around $300 million last quarter due to duties on imported EV components such as batteries. That impact is expected to grow as Trump’s trade measures spread through suppliers. Moody’s said carmakers will continue adjusting their operations as they get more clarity on future tariff levels. “We expect that as automakers gradually gain clarity over future tariff levels, they will continue assessing and implementing more long-term structural measures, such as adjusting supply chains and production footprints,” the agency said.

Crypto markets have experienced broad declines across major assets in the past week, driven by macroeconomic uncertainty, deleveraging pressures, and weakening risk appetite. In response, Phemex is introducing practical incentives and cost-saving measures to help users maintain disciplined strategies and long-term confidence amid volatility. Running from October 11 to October 31, 2025, the campaign supports both new and existing users through incentives that promote disciplined participation rather than emotional reactions to market conditions. The initiative is part of Phemex’s broader commitment to providing confidence in every market through practical tools, transparent processes, and responsible trading support. The campaign includes: Zero-Fee Trading Slots — 5,000 limited spots available, covering trading fees for eligible users during the campaign period. 20% Deposit Cashback — Up to 200 USDT in bonus rewards for new users making qualifying deposits, available to the first 1,000 participants. Referral Rewards — Users can earn up to 50 USDT per valid referee by sharing the campaign with friends, encouraging community engagement and broader access. “Market downturns can be defining moments for disciplined traders,” said Federico Variola , CEO of Phemex. “This campaign embodies our belief that true confidence comes from preparation and access — not speculation. Alongside trading incentives, we remain focused on empowering users with knowledge and perspective, helping them navigate volatility with clarity and discipline. Phemex builds tools for resilience — not just when markets rise, but especially when they are tested.” This campaign follows a series of recent product enhancements from Phemex like Multi-Assets Mode, all designed to give users greater capital control. As market sentiment recalibrates, Phemex continues to reinforce its mission of building a future where crypto trading remains accessible, efficient, and grounded in trust.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday, Marszalek urged authorities to “conduct a thorough review of fairness of practices,” questioning whether trading platforms had malfunctioned or failed to uphold compliance during the sell-off. “Regulators should look into the exchanges that had most liquidations in the last 24 hours,” Marszalek wrote. “Any of them slowing down to a halt, effectively not allowing people to trade? Were all trades priced correctly and in line with indexes?” Data from CoinGlass shows that Hyperliquid led the market with $10.31 billion in liquidations, followed by Bybit with $4.65 billion and Binance with $2.41 billion. Other platforms including OKX, HTX, and Gate reported smaller figures of $1.21 billion, $362.5 million, and $264.5 million, respectively. Binance faces backlash after user losses The wave of forced liquidations came alongside a separate issue at Binance, where several tokens—including Ethena’s USDe, BNSOL, and WBETH—experienced a price depeg, triggering unexpected losses for some traders. Binance said it is reviewing affected accounts and will offer “appropriate compensation measures” where platform errors are confirmed. One trader claimed that the exchange mistakenly closed a short position while keeping a long open, resulting in total losses. The user argued the issue was unrelated to Binance’s auto-deleveraging system and noted that similar trades on other platforms had not been affected. Binance co-founder Yi He publicly apologized, acknowledging the “significant market fluctuations and a substantial influx of users.” She confirmed that Binance will compensate users for losses caused by confirmed technical errors but clarified that “losses resulting from market fluctuations and unrealized profits are not eligible.” Crypto market wipeout surpasses historical crashes According to data compiled by crypto analyst Quinten François, the recent $19.31 billion in liquidations surpassed previous market downturns by a wide margin. For comparison, the COVID-19 crash saw $1.2 billion in liquidations, while the FTX collapse led to $1.6 billion—making the latest event more than ten times larger than any prior wipeout. Trump’s tariffs spark fresh market volatility The timing of the crash coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of new economic measures, including 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports beginning November 1. The move was a response to China’s recent restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, which are essential to global manufacturing and technology sectors. Beijing stated that any product containing more than 0.1% Chinese rare earth content will require an export license starting December 1. Trump denounced the policy as “a moral disgrace” and suggested he might cancel a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit. The combination of geopolitical tension, unprecedented liquidations, and technical issues across major exchanges has reignited concerns about the stability and transparency of the cryptocurrency market—raising pressure on regulators to ensure fair trading practices in a rapidly evolving landscape.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BNB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-11 15:20:15

On the basis of a core that combines artificial intelligence and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), Ozak AI ($OZ) is creating a splash for its practical uses and mathematically determined presale returns. As per the recent value of $0.012, if anyone makes an investment of $10,000 then it could reach up to $833,333 after the token hits the $1 mark. This simple potential for growth with increasing applications and verified collaborations makes Ozak AI a key player in the AI-crypto space. Ozak AI’s Foundation and Technological Structure Ozak AI operates as an AI-powered crypto project designed to merge blockchain intelligence with decentralized data infrastructure. The platform relies on DePIN technology, where data is stored on nodes with IPFS for safe and redundant storage. This decentralized approach eliminates any point of failure and facilitates better and more reliable delivery of data on its networks. The platform also runs Ozak Stream Network (OSN), which pulls real-time, tamper-evident data from multiple blockchains. This supplies predictive AI models with trustless and verifiable input, so it's suitable for financial analytics and autonomous decision-making. With its Ozak Prediction Agent, the network autonomously processes proprietary and public data, allowing businesses and individuals to gain access to real-time insights without intermediaries. Presale Growth and ROI Calculation Ozak AI’s presale has seen consistent price appreciation since launch. The first stage began at $0.001, followed by $0.002, and then $0.003 in stage 3. The current stage is still ongoing; the $OZ is currently priced at $0.012. Over these stages, early participants have already gained 1,100% returns. The next phase is set at $0.014, with a final target of $1 at launch. As of the latest data, Ozak AI has sold 933 million $OZ tokens, raising $3.6 million. The presale allocates 3 billion tokens from the total 10 billion supply, with 70% dedicated to the community and presale distribution. The remaining tokens are allocated to liquidity providers, advisors, and ecosystem development in the long term. With a $0.012 token value, an investment of $10,000 can earn approximately 833,333 $OZ tokens. At a token price of $1, the investment will be worth $833,333, a 200x return. Ecosystem Expansion and Strategic Partnerships Ozak AI continues to advance by establishing partnerships that continue to advance its blockchain and AI features. Its integration with the Pyth Network delivers real-time financial data across blockchains, enabling faster and more accurate predictive analytics. Through SINT, users gain access to one-click AI upgrades, cross-chain bridges, and voice interface tools that simplify real-time execution of market signals. Additional collaborations with Hive Intel provide multi-chain data APIs, enhancing Ozak AI’s ability to analyze NFT, DeFi, and on-chain activities. The partnership with Weblume allows developers to integrate Ozak AI analytics into decentralized applications using no-code tools, making real-time data deployment more accessible. The ongoing collaboration with Dex3 further strengthens liquidity and trading experience across supported platforms. Ozak AI has also introduced the Rewards Hub, a live staking and rewards system that allows users to earn returns through participation and governance. Alongside this, the project has passed listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and is undergoing a Certik audit to enhance its smart contract security. Conclusion: The Road to $1 and Beyond Ozak AI’s structure, transparency, and real-world integrations give clear context to the projected $1 price target. Its phased presale, technical depth, and confirmed partnerships establish a framework for long-term adoption. Based on current pricing, the math behind the title’s claim remains straightforward—$10,000 at $0.012 could become $833,333 at $1. As the crypto market moves toward its next bull cycle, Ozak AI’s blend of AI analytics and decentralized infrastructure marks it as a significant player in the evolving digital economy.

BlockchainFX has collected $8.28 million, but its direction and technology remain unclear. Maga Coin thrives on meme popularity and Binance discussions, yet offers no detailed roadmap or proven development effort. Both projects draw short-term attention but lack visible progress or long-term credibility. BlockDAG (BDAG) , however, has crossed $420 million in presale funds, secured a multi-year collaboration with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team, and already launched real tools such as the X1 miner app and Awakening Testnet. With the special $0.0018 price still open for a few days, BlockDAG stands out as the best presale crypto for 2025. BlockDAG’s Real-World Delivery Outpaces Presale Hype BlockDAG goes beyond typical presale buzz by combining working technology with mainstream exposure. Its partnership with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team has brought it into global view, aligning blockchain innovation with elite motorsport. While other projects only talk about building partnerships, BlockDAG is already engaging fans through simulators, hackathons, and blockchain-powered race events. With over $420 million raised and 27 billion coins sold, BlockDAG continues to gain traction. Though the current Batch 31 price sits at $0.0304, users can still grab the coin at $0.0018 using the “TGE” code. reflecting a 2,900% ROI since Batch 1. The upcoming Genesis Day on November 23, 2025, will mark its next major milestone with new integrations tied to Alpine’s global fan platforms. The code “TGE” allows early access at launch depending on your rank: Rank 1–300 receive an instant airdrop; Rank 301–600 receive their airdrop after 30 minutes; Rank 601–1000 after 60 minutes; Rank 1001–1500 after 2 hours; Rank 1501–2000 after 4 hours; Rank 2001–5000 after 6 hours; and those ranked above 5001 receive their airdrop after 24 hours. This tiered access structure builds anticipation and rewards early participation, making every second of the countdown significant. BlockDAG’s progress shows that execution outweighs promotion. With millions of X1 miner app users and an active Awakening Testnet supporting smart contracts, it has already delivered what many projects only plan. For those comparing options, its proof-driven growth and real-world partnerships make it the best presale crypto choice today. BlockchainFX: Momentum Without a Defined Roadmap BlockchainFX has drawn attention with $8.28 million raised and a message centered on secure transactions and DeFi compatibility. While the raised amount indicates interest, the overall project direction remains uncertain. The platform has yet to release detailed documents explaining its technical model, coin structure, or plans for developer integration. Its timing may be its biggest advantage. As crypto enthusiasm grows in Q4, presales with strong branding can benefit from renewed market optimism. However, there is still no confirmation of a beta release, testnet schedule, or a clear strategy to attract users beyond initial fundraising. For those considering it as a possible best presale crypto, BlockchainFX appears promising but unfinished. It stands between two categories: not casual enough to be a meme coin, yet not transparent enough to inspire trust within the developer community. Whether it sustains growth or loses traction post-listing remains uncertain. Maga Coin: Hype Without Technical Depth Maga Coin joins the expanding list of meme-driven crypto coins fueled by political culture and online trends. Its exposure in Binance circles and social groups has generated strong short-term interest, but that attention lacks technical backing. The project has no whitepaper, no audited smart contracts, and no confirmed development team with blockchain credentials. While meme coins continue to draw attention from those seeking quick market moves, calling Maga Coin the best presale crypto would be premature. Its current strength lies in community-driven hype rather than functionality. Viral buzz can lift prices in the short term, but sustaining long-term engagement requires more than social traction. Compared to BlockDAG, which combines live testnet tools, verified audits, and global partnerships, Maga Coin feels like a speculative move driven by sentiment rather than structure. Bottom Line When reviewing BlockDAG, BlockchainFX, and Maga Coin, the difference is unmistakable. BlockDAG delivers working products, verified security, and real partnerships, while the others remain either undefined or driven purely by hype. With over $420 million raised, 27 billion coins sold, and a batch 31 price now set in crypto presale , BlockDAG has separated itself from short-term projects. Its limited-time $0.0018 price and confirmed collaboration with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team show that it is shaping up as a serious contender for adoption. Among this group, only one project combines credibility, delivery, and visibility. For those analyzing real progress in crypto, BlockDAG represents structure and proof, not speculation.

Despite this mayhem, prominent market analyst Ali Martinez is backing SUI’s bullish potential, projecting the altcoin to establish a new all-time high before 2025 ends. Related Reading: Bitmine Receives 23,823 Ethereum From BitGo As Institutional Accumulation Continues SUI’s Path To $7 In an X post on October 11, Ali Martinez shares an in-depth market analysis indicating that SUI may be on the verge of a major breakout. Notably, the daily SUI/USDT chart reveals a tightening price pattern, suggesting an impending significant price upswing provided the cryptocurrency can achieve a breakout from its current consolidation range. Based on Martinez’s analysis, SUI is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern that has been developing since early 2025. This structure is typically characterized by converging trendlines, representing lower highs and higher lows, which reflect a period of declining volatility preceding a decisive price move. According to the chart above, a confirmed breakout above the $3.59 (0.618 Fibonacci retracement level) would trigger a sharp bullish wave. The projected path, based on Fibonacci extension targets, places potential resistance points around $4.25 (0.786 Fibonacci extension), $5.28 (1.0 Fibonacci extension), and ultimately $6.97 (1.272 Fibonacci extension) – $7.00. Therefore, this move could represent a 100% market gain on current SUI prices. However, investors should also note that a failed breakout or rejection near the upper boundary could lead to renewed weakness. A dip below the $3.18 (0.5 Fibonacci) level would invalidate the bullish setup and expose SUI to potential declines toward $2.82 or even $2.44.

Meanwhile, daily trading volume has surged by 295%, signaling heightened market activity as traders react to the sharp selloff. On the broader time frame, SUI has lost 27.85% over the past week, extending its bearish momentum. The downturn in SUI mirrors the broader crypto market, which has reacted sharply to recent geopolitical developments. Markets tumbled after US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, a move framed as retaliation against China’s reported intentions to introduce sweeping export controls on a wide range of products. In the aftermath of the announcement, the global cryptocurrency market has dropped 9.75% in the past 24 hours, with total market cap now hovering around $3.75 trillion.

This all comes just months after U.S. President Donald Trump hammered Vietnam with a sweeping 46% tariff on imports, branding it a “reciprocal” penalty for what he called an unfair trade advantage. Despite that blow, Vietnam has not only kept its economic engine running, it’s accelerated. And according to Bloomberg, it’s also managed to strike some kind of deal with Trump’s administration, though no one in Washington or Hanoi is sharing the fine print. This week, the VN Index surged to an all-time high after Vietnam got reclassified as an “emerging market” by FTSE Russell, upgrading it from “frontier” status. That move came after years of market reforms pushed by the ruling Communist Party. Party General Secretary To Lam, who took power last year after the death of his predecessor Nguyen Phu Trong, is behind the reforms. The change from “frontier” to “emerging” means Vietnam is now seen as less volatile and more reliable, opening the floodgates to big global investors who were previously sitting on the sidelines. Lam, 68, has been busy since stepping in; he’s dismantled huge chunks of Vietnam’s bloated public sector. Ministries have been merged. Thousands of bureaucrats have either been laid off or nudged into early retirement. An entire level of local government has been disbanded . And the state-controlled media has been trimmed down. Lam first gained national attention leading a massive anti-corruption campaign that forced out two presidents and three deputy prime ministers. That purge is still rolling. And while some businesses are cheering for more transparency, others are paralyzed by fear of stepping on the wrong toes. Lam ramps up economic reforms before party congress Lam’s biggest move so far is pushing through “Resolution 68,” a new doctrine approved by the Communist Party Central Committee in May. It declares the private sector “one of the most important driving forces of the national economy.” That statement shook up the old order, but not everyone knows what it actually means yet. Some companies are waiting for clearer rules before moving forward with deals or hiring. Lam’s team now faces the challenge of preventing the recent shake-ups from clogging decision-making and slowing down investment approvals. That uncertainty comes at a time when foreign direct investment is still climbing. Disbursed FDI hit $18.8 billion between January and September this year, an 8.5% increase over the same period last year. Most of that went into manufacturing, where factories scrambled to hit export targets before Trump’s tariffs kicked in this August. Those emergency production sprints helped drive GDP growth up 8.23% in the third quarter. It’s Vietnam’s highest quarterly jump since 2022. Vietnam’s trade surplus with the U.S. is also getting Trump’s attention. It stood at $123.5 billion last year, trailing only China and Mexico. That’s one of the reasons Trump slapped on the 46% tariff, calling it a fair response to what he claimed were lopsided trade flows. He also set a 20% levy under a still-unpublished bilateral trade agreement and proposed an additional 40% penalty on trans-shipped goods, products that pass through Vietnam on their way from China to the U.S. That last measure is vague, and even American officials don’t seem to know how it will be enforced. Stock market surges while IPOs attract global attention Despite the trade tension, Vietnam’s capital markets are booming.IPOs from Vietnamese companies have raised more money this year than new listings in London. And Hanoi just passed a fresh batch of reforms aimed at loosening rules for international investors. That includes eliminating foreign ownership caps in some sectors and simplifying listing procedures to draw in more global capital. The party congress, which happens once every five years, is set for January. Lam’s future will likely be decided there. Until then, the government is walking a tightrope between speeding up reforms and not scaring off officials who still hold power in various ministries. Le Dang Doanh, a former government adviser based in Hanoi, said departments are stuck in limbo. “Improving the quality of public investment is important,” he said, “but there has to be a clear embrace of openness and transparency.” Vietnam is now positioned as a real rival to China for manufacturing and exports, but it’s got a balancing act to pull off.

The timing and lack of transparency have sparked controversy, prompting legal experts and market observers to call for a thorough investigation. One such voice, prominent pro-XRP attorney John E. Deaton, has publicly urged an investigation into what may be more than just a volatile market outcome. The Claim: Suspicious Timing and Huge Profit The story first surfaced thanks to a post by crypto analyst Vivek Sen, who claimed that an account opened earlier that day locked in a colossal short position roughly 30 minutes before the Trump administration announced new tariffs. The post included screenshots purporting to show the trade and its closure at peak profit. The magnitude and timing stirred widespread suspicion of privileged information or coordinated market action. At the moment of the tariff revelation, the crypto market convulsed. Bitcoin plunged, triggering massive liquidations of leveraged positions—industry trackers estimate that over $19 billion worth of crypto positions were forcibly closed in a single day, including multibillion-dollar waves within single hours. If true, this needs to be investigated. https://t.co/8HDj3Qk6ap — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) October 11, 2025 The conditions were ripe for a perfectly timed short: heavy cascading sells, thin liquidity at the margin, and panic trading. In that environment, the alleged $88 million shortcut would not be impossible—but it raises red flags. John Deaton Weighs In John E. Deaton, a lawyer known for his advocacy on behalf of XRP holders, reposted the claim and added: “If true, this needs to be investigated.” In saying so, Deaton elevated what could have remained an internet rumor into a matter of public interest — pushing market participants, exchanges, and regulators to take notice. Deaton’s involvement is significant not only because of his legal standing but because he often frames crypto controversies in terms of fairness, transparency, and accountability. He has long expressed concerns about excessive regulation, unclear enforcement, and the need for clearer rules in cryptocurrency markets. This latest statement suggests the short trade might be more than just speculation, potentially warranting official investigation. Forensic Clues & Industry Reaction Independent crypto investigatory groups and trading analytics teams have begun to examine on-chain data, order book snapshots, and clearing records for telltale signs of manipulation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Some experts highlight the trading account’s quick activation before the tariff announcement, concentrated derivative positions, and coordinated trades across instruments as signs that warrant further investigation. Others are more cautious, pointing out that much of the evidence is circumstantial and that only exchange and platform records can verify counterparty identities and trade timing. In the media, analysts emphasize that while extreme gains such as $88 million are within the realm of possibility under perfect conditions, they are exceedingly rare and typically accompanied by anomalies, including sudden liquidity gaps, abrupt order book shifts, and signs of front-running or insider access. The crypto space has long wrestled with questions of whether certain market actors enjoy informational advantages or privileged latency—this incident, if validated, would be a stark demonstration. Implications & What Comes Next If a credible investigation is launched, it could become a landmark case in crypto regulation and enforcement. Exchanges may be compelled to reveal timestamps, matching engines, and KYC logs. Regulators may come under pressure to increase oversight of derivatives platforms that were previously operating with little or no regulation. Yet for now, the story remains unproven—and ideally, it should be treated as a serious allegation, not a confirmed fraud. Deaton’s public call underscores the need for transparency: the crypto community; both institutions and retail participants, deserves clarity about whether one trader, at least, stood with foreknowledge and capitalized while the rest were exposed to carnage. Until that deeper review unfolds, observers should watch whether any credible entities respond: Do exchanges defend their systems? Will regulators open formal probes? Will on-chain analysis converge toward a plausible searchable trail, or remain a web of hints and doubts? Whatever the outcome, this event is fast becoming a test case for accountability in a market whose rules are still evolving.
