The interview came hours after President Donald Trump announced new tariff threats against China, once again rekindling the threat of retaliation from China. Luckey says the broader economy is at risk As far as Luckey is concerned, the US has become too reliant on China for critical resources like rare earths and semiconductors, and that dependence poses a significant risk to national security. He claimed that Anduril has been able to distance itself from Chinese supply chains, a fact he implied was not true for many other American companies. According to him, the reasons for its decision to distance itself from Beijing’s supply chain have to do with sanctions and the need for independence in defense manufacturing. He said: “We have to get off the Chinese supply chain. We need to reindustrialize. We need to have our own rare earth supply and make our own chips and computers,” adding that China already holds “too much leverage” over the US, particularly where critical materials essential for military hardware are concerned. Luckey has called for the re-industrialization of the US to reduce dependency on China, advocating for domestic production of essential technologies to strengthen the economy and national defense. This is crucial especially since geopolitical tensions with China are now part of the new reality for American companies, Anduril Industries Inc. Chief Executive Officer Brian Schimpf said on Friday. “I think it’s going to be a long-run conflict with China, and that’s just something that we’ve got to be prepared for,” Schimpf said . Anduril and Palantir are working to transform US defense Anduril is part of a growing crop of defense technology startups aiming to modernize the US military with artificial intelligence, software, and autonomous vehicles like drones, fighter jets and submarines. Schimpf expects the company’s revenue to double this year and boost production of its products by 400%. However, there are a few kinks it will need to work out. For example, an internal Army memo reportedly highlighted “fundamental security” issues with the NGC2 battlefield communication platform that Anduril received a $100 million contract to develop. The NGC2 prototype aims to enhance battlefield communications by connecting soldiers, sensors, and commanders. However, the memo claims it is “very high risk” and susceptible to vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized access to sensitive information. “We cannot control who sees what, we cannot see what users are doing, and we cannot verify that the software itself is secure,” the memo says. In its defense, Anduril has said the memo reflects an outdated state of the program, while Palantir asserted that no vulnerabilities were found in their platform. Both companies have seen their valuations surge under Trump’s presidency, with Anduril recently signing a $159 million deal for an initial prototyping period to develop a night vision and mixed-reality system as part of the Soldier Borne Mission Command. In comparison, Palantir signed a $480 million contract for Maven, an artificial intelligence tool with the ability to sift through images and sensor data to provide battlefield analysis.

52960440,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=836452,1760133636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52960440.jpeg,From $254M To $78.5B:  Tron USDT Growth Drives Network Valuation,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/tron-trx/from-254m-to-78-5b-tron-usdt-growth-drives-network-valuation/,"Tron (TRX) is at a decisive moment after retracing to key demand levels that could determine its next major move. Bulls, who have been in control since late March, are now working to defend support and prepare for a possible breakout. However, to confirm a bullish continuation, Tron must overcome the current supply zone and regain strong upward momentum — a challenge that will test the strength of the recent rally. Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Drops 50%: Is The Rally Built On Weak Fundamentals? Adding context to Tron’s long-term growth, top analyst Maartunn shared striking on-chain data revealing that TRON’s USDT supply has surged 309x in just six years. What began as a modest 254 million USDT on the network has now expanded to a staggering $78.5 billion, marking one of the most dramatic liquidity expansions in the crypto industry. This massive increase highlights the network’s role as a core hub for stablecoin activity and underscores how liquidity growth has historically correlated with TRX’s price performance. As Tron trades near a critical juncture, both onchain strength and market structure will play a decisive role in shaping its direction. If demand holds and liquidity continues to flow in, Tron could be gearing up for another leg higher in the weeks ahead. Tron Unprecedented Growth: The Power of Liquidity and Network Effects According to Maartunn, the story of TRON is a perfect example of how fast the crypto industry can evolve. “Time in crypto has a strange rhythm,” he notes — what feels like a lifetime of change in traditional markets can unfold in just a few years on-chain. Six years ago, Justin Sun proudly celebrated a major milestone for TRON: reaching 254 million USDT on the network, with 300 million “coming soon.” At that moment, it represented a remarkable achievement for a still-developing ecosystem. Fast-forward to today, and TRON’s growth has been nothing short of exponential. The network now hosts $78.58 billion in circulating USDT, a staggering 309x increase since that post. This transformation underscores TRON’s evolution from a niche blockchain to one of the most important infrastructures for stablecoin liquidity worldwide. Over the same period, TRX’s price rose from $0.0155 to $0.338, reflecting how price action and liquidity expansion often move hand in hand. Maartunn emphasizes that this correlation between USDT supply and TRX price illustrates a broader truth about crypto markets — liquidity drives adoption and valuation. When infrastructure, user demand, and network effects align, growth compounds at an astonishing pace. The key takeaway, he adds, is to zoom out: short-term volatility can obscure the far more powerful story of long-term innovation, adoption, and capital rotation. TRON’s rise proves how quickly a well-positioned network can become indispensable to the digital economy.

The chart shows that after reaching a local high near $0.36, the price entered a sideways range, with buyers defending the 50-day moving average (blue line), currently acting as dynamic support. This region has proven crucial in maintaining the bullish market structure. The 200-day moving average (red line) remains well below the current price, confirming a long-term bullish bias, while the 100-day MA (green) continues to serve as mid-term support around the $0.32 zone. As long as TRX holds above this area, the broader uptrend remains intact. Related Reading: Coinbase Premium Gap Signals Strongest Bitcoin Accumulation Since ETF Launch – Details However, a clear breakout above $0.35–$0.36 is still needed to confirm renewed bullish momentum and open the door toward $0.38 and $0.40, levels not seen since early 2022. On the downside, a decisive drop below $0.32 could invite further corrections, potentially testing the $0.30 psychological level. Overall, Tron’s chart structure remains healthy. Consolidation above support suggests that buyers are accumulating, waiting for stronger market conditions to push the price into a new bullish phase aligned with the broader crypto trend.

His remarks emphasized Ripple’s professionalism, XRP’s use case , and the company’s commitment to building a lasting financial infrastructure. XRP Framed As The Coin With The Strongest Use Case Crypto analyst John Squire has drawn fresh attention to Ripple and XRP after sharing a video of Gilbertie praising the token’s real-world utility on X social media. In the interview, the Teucrium CEO discussed why the company chose XRP , calling it the digital asset with the strongest utility across the crypto market. He said his confidence in XRP stems from Ripple’s focused mission to achieve its goals of building a robust and sustainable financial system . Gilbertie commended the Ripple team’s disciplined mindset and deep technical expertise—qualities that set the crypto payments company apart from other blockchain firms. These strengths, he added, are key reasons Teucrium selected XRP, viewing it as a transformative technology with real utility rather than merely a speculative token. “The Ripple team, from the interaction we’ve had with them, they’re really professional, they act like investment bankers over there. They know what they’re doing, and they will make this work,” Gilbertie said in the interview. The Teucrium CEO’s high praise of Ripple reflects confidence in XRP’s potential as a settlement tool . He explained that while Bitcoin serves as a store of value, XRP distinguishes itself by solving tangible problems within the global payments landscape. He clarified that his statement was not a price prediction, but rather a reflection of his belief that XRP possesses the most utility among all the cryptocurrencies in the market. Gilbertie’s remarks about Ripple come shortly after Teucrium’s XRP ETF went live on the market , providing regulated exposure to the altcoin. Although the fund did not receive explicit approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) amid the ongoing government shutdown , the company proceeded with the launch. According to one expert, the SEC’s lack of response signaled implicit consent, noting that “silence is compliance.” Analyst Calls XRP “The Plumbing” For The Next Financial System In a separate report, crypto market commentator X Finance Bull urged investors to rethink how they evaluate XRP, insisting it should not be compared to corporate stocks. He described XRP as “the plumbing” for the next global financial system—one that connects institutions, governments, and decentralized ecosystems through tokenized infrastructure. From his viewpoint, Ripple’s objective is not to chase company valuations but to develop a framework that enables global money movement, covering $200 trillion in annual cross-border payments, trillions in tokenized assets, CBDCs , DeFi rails, and Real-World Assets (RWAs) . He added that capturing even 1-2% of this value could change the price of XRP forever. The analyst also highlighted Ripple’s expanding institutional network, noting recent collaborations with Luxembourg’s Ministry of Finance and its growing presence across Bahrain, Dubai, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) .",XRP|Altcoin|CBDCs|DeFi Rails|John Squire|real-world assets|ripple|RWAs|Sal Gilbertie|Teucrium’s XRP ETF|US SEC|US Securities and Exchange Commission|X Finance Bull|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-10 22:00:50

Nearly $1 billion in liquidations slammed the Bitcoin market within 24 hours, based on CoinGlass data, while Ethereum remains under $4,000 at press time, after following Bitcoin’s crash the first time. Binance data shows that Bitcoin actually dropped to a 24-hour low of $101,516.5 before recovering to $110,563.5, down 7.03% on the day. Ethereum (ETH) fell to a low of $3,400.00 and is now trading at $3,722.30, a 9.11% decline. Total liquidations over the past 24 hours reached approximately $706.2 million, with long positions accounting for $648.5 million, the largest single-day long liquidation so far this year. This meltdown follows Trump’s latest rant on Truth Social, where he said China sent “an extremely hostile letter to the World,” revealing plans to launch massive export controls on nearly everything they produce. Trump called the decision “unheard of,” “a moral disgrace,” and claimed it would impact all countries without exception. He vowed that the U.S. would answer with a 100% tariff, plus software export bans aimed squarely at Beijing. Trump cancels Xi meeting, reignites crypto panic This wasn’t Trump’s first warning shot today. Just three hours before, Cryptopolitan reported that the US president had said: “I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so.” He went on to accuse China of lying, saying they’re “becoming very hostile” with restrictions on rare earth metals, a critical ingredient in everything from smartphones to missiles. That post kicked off the initial selloff, but Friday’s update blew the doors off. The fallout spread to stocks quite fast. The SPY ETF dropped 2.7%, the QQQ sank 3.5%, and BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF fell 3.7%. The CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF also dropped 3.9%, showing there was nowhere to hide—not even in mining stocks, which had looked strong just days earlier. Despite the crash, some miners still walked away with gains over the week. HIVE ended the week up 40%, even with the sharp downturn in Friday’s session. Right behind it, BitFarms closed the week with a 31% gain. Over the last month, mining stocks have been some of the wildest movers in the market. Between September 10 and October 10, both HIVE and BitFarms doubled their value. Another name, IREN, nearly did the same, starting at $30.68, closing just under $60. The average one-month return for top miners came in at 73.26%. But that trend may be breaking now.

Bitcoin Faces Key Test Near $126K Trendline,https://cryptopotato.com/wall-breaking-bitcoin-faces-key-test-near-126k-trendline/,"Bitcoin is trading near $121,600 after reaching a new all-time high above $126,000 earlier this week. The asset has slowed and is now moving sideways just below a major diagonal resistance that has capped the price for several months. Analysts are watching to see whether Bitcoin can break through or if it will be rejected once again. Meanwhile, the market is holding near a key level while open interest remains high in the futures market. Bitcoin Struggles Near Long-Term Resistance Bitcoin is facing resistance at a trendline that has held firm since earlier cycle tops. The latest weekly candle shows another rejection near $126,000, followed by a pullback of around 5.5%. Earlier this year, similar rejections led to drops of nearly 10% and close to 30%. The difference this time is the size of the pullbacks. Each rejection has been smaller than the last. Rekt Capital pointed out that “this trendline looks to be a weakening point of rejection,” suggesting sellers may be losing strength at this level. Source: Rekt Capital/X On the lower timeframes, Bitcoin is holding just above $121,000. This zone is marked by a previous support level and lines up with a Fibonacci retracement near $119,550.

The trend remains bullish overall. A confirmed higher low would support another leg higher, especially if resistance breaks. Bearish Scenario Still in Play While short-term sentiment remains positive, some market participants are still cautious. Analyst Ali Martinez shared a scenario where Bitcoin gets rejected at $124,000 and begins a correction toward $96,000. If that level fails, the next major support is around $70,000. Source: Ali Martinez/X The projected path shows a slow recovery beginning in late 2026, with Bitcoin climbing back toward $90,000. This scenario reflects a broader retracement, not a trend reversal, and suggests long-term structure could still remain intact. Futures Market Remains Heated Data from Glassnode shows that futures open interest is still elevated. This means that many traders are positioned on both the long and short sides. Sharp moves in either direction have triggered liquidations. Glassnode said the market is undergoing “ a leverage reset ” as volatility flushes out excess positions. With Bitcoin sitting just below resistance and leverage still high, traders are watching closely. A move above the current range could open the way toward $130,000. If resistance holds, another pullback could extend the current consolidation. The post Wall Breaking?

Ethereum Foundation, Keyring Network Raise Funds According to an October 10 announcement , the two organizations have launched fundraising efforts to “pioneer open-source legal defense funding.” The announcement also states that the first three months of fees from zkVerified permissioned vaults on the Ethereum mainnet will go to Storm and Pertsev’s legal defense. “We believe privacy is a fundamental right, and that open-source developers should not face criminal liability for writing code,” said Alex McFarlane, CEO of Keyring Network. “By donating our early protocol fees to the defense of Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, we’re signaling that zkVerified DeFi can uphold compliance, safety, and privacy while standing in solidarity with the builders who paved the way,” he added. Following the news, Pertsev took to X to say he is “beyond grateful” for the donations.

Federal prosecutors alleged Storm laundered and concealed more than $1 billion through Tornado Cash—including hundreds of millions for the Lazarus Group, North Korea’s state-sponsored malware collective. “Roman Storm and Roman Semenov allegedly operated Tornado Cash and knowingly facilitated this money laundering,” then-U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in an August 2023 press release.

With Ethereum (ETH) holding strong above the $4,000 mark , meme coins tied to its ecosystem are getting a boost. As the second-largest meme coin , SHIB is well-positioned to ride Ethereum’s upward trend and attract renewed attention from traders looking for the next big move. Data from CryptoQuant shows that transaction volumes have been increasing while active addresses on the Shiba Inu blockchain have continued to rise. In addition, exchange netflows, a metric that indicates the amount of tokens flowing in or out of exchanges, has turned negative. This means that investors are withdrawing SHIB to cold storage – a move that is commonly interpreted as a bullish signal. These positive on-chain metrics could be an early indication that investors are jumping back on the market to scoop up SHIB at this lower price. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB ETF Could Ignite Rally to $0.000021 In the past 7 days, Shiba Inu has retreated by 3% as the crypto market as a whole has taken a breather. SHIB has once again found strong support at $0.000012 and could soon bounce off this level to retest its trend line resistance and the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Trading volumes have subsided lately, meaning that the selling pressure could be easing. Moreover, growing institutional adoption could result in the launch of a Shiba Inu exchange-traded fund (ETF) soon. A bullish breakout above $0.000015 could set off a rally toward $0.000021, with above-average trading volumes confirming such a move. New projects have outperformed legacy meme coins during this cycle, and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could be one of those hidden gems that is ready to explode. This top crypto presale has raised nearly $3 million in a heartbeat to build a strong community of like-minded degen traders. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Combines the Power of Meme Culture with High-Leverage Trading Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a meme coin that connects retail traders who aren’t afraid to trade at 1000x leverage to seize the moment and make the most out of this bull market. Token holders can share alpha , compete to make it to the top of the leaderboard, and access strategies typically reserved for whales . Weekly competitions reward top ROI hunters, while gamified challenges like Max Ripped and Max Gains will keep the community engaged through attractive and highly rewarding challenges. Finally, the Maxi Fund allocates up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds on the most promising tokens of this cycle with leverage to boost returns. The earnings from this fund will be used to further promote $MAXI and push the token to the top.

Bitcoin's price quickly plummeted to $102,000, leaving investors confused by the perception that October is typically a bullish month. Cryptocurrency analyst Timothy Peterson shared a striking analysis, noting that this decline is historically rare. According to Peterson, drops of more than 5% in October have only occurred four times in the last 10 years: October 24, 2017 October 11, 2018 October 23, 2019 October 21, 2021 Related News: Bitcoin Partially Recovers After Major Drop, But Liquidations Are Severe!

However, Trump has softened his stance in recent statements. Trump stated today, “The meeting with Xi has not been canceled,” indicating that potential contact between the two leaders has not been completely ruled out. He also said that “other options for export controls may be considered.” However, Trump also stated, “I don't know if I will meet with Xi.” Related News: HOT MOMENTS: Expert Analyst Reveals What Happened to Bitcoin After Historical Declines in the Previous Octobers In a post on Truth Social the day before, Trump noted that China had announced that it would impose comprehensive export restrictions on “virtually all products” starting November 1, 2025, calling the decision “unprecedented in the history of international trade and morally shameful.” In his post, Trump also announced that in response to China’s move, the US would impose 100% additional tariffs on China starting November 1 and impose export controls on all critical software. *This is not investment advice.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $776.48. In 2031, AAVE will range between $1,164.73 to $1,261.79. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $218.09 Market cap $3.51B Trading volume (24-h) $729.53M Circulating supply 15.25M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $279.24 24-hour high $173.32 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.18% 50-day SMA $300.81 14-Day RSI 43.29 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Green days 17/30 (57%) 200-Day SMA $259.84 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE dropped 21% in one day, breaking below key support. Heavy volume and strong MACD divergence confirm deep bearish control. Immediate support for bulls to defend is $200. Aave 1-day price chart As of October 10, AAVE has suffered a brutal 21.45% daily drop, falling from $273 to $215, its lowest level in weeks. The daily candle is large and red, decisively breaking below the lower Bollinger band at $242.59. This move signals a deep oversold condition and a potential panic-driven selloff. Volume surged to 68.8M, confirming heavy participation in the breakdown. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD deepened into bearish territory with a widening separation between the signal and MACD lines, indicating growing downside momentum. Unless the price swiftly reclaims $242–$250, sentiment will likely remain bearish. The next significant support zone lies near $200, followed by $188 if selling pressure continues. Aave 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart confirms intense downside pressure, with AAVE falling as low as $215 before stabilizing slightly at $218. The Alligator lines are sharply fanned downward, showing a strong bearish trend with no signs of flattening yet. RSI has plunged to 17, indicating a highly oversold market, but that doesn’t guarantee an immediate bounce as momentum remains overwhelmingly negative. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView While a minor technical rebound toward $230–$235 is possible, the dominant trend remains downward until the price reclaims at least $250. Traders should expect further volatility, as sharp bear moves are often followed by brief but violent relief rallies.

Momentum remains firmly bearish across all timeframes. While an oversold bounce could emerge, recovery will likely face heavy resistance near $250. Traders should avoid catching the falling knife until stability or a confirmed reversal pattern forms above that zone. Is AAVE a good investment?

Its protocol went live in 2020, and by August, its total value locked had reached $1 billion. The coin reached an ATH of $666.86 in 2021 but slumped afterward. Aave v3 launched in March 2022, driving prices back up to $261 before fluctuating between $50 and $100 later that year. In 2023, AAVE saw steady growth, ending the year at $109.

As Cryptopolitan previously reported , the surge in bets happened just after midnight in Oslo, raising suspicion that someone leaked the result before the official announcement. Trader 6741 turns a late-night gamble into $50,000 profit Roughly 12 hours before the Nobel announcement, a mysterious trader using the handle “6741” started buying huge positions on Machado’s victory. At that point, she was considered an unlikely choice. But within 2 hours, the trader’s activity transformed the quiet market into a frenzy. When the winner was announced the next day, “6741” walked away with more than $50,000 in profit. What turned heads was how fast her odds jumped from 5% to nearly 70% overnight, all traced back to a newly created Polymarket account. Another Polymarket user, known as “GayPride,” began betting heavily once the early wagers caught attention on social media. With odds swinging between 60% and 71%, that user ended up pocketing over $85,000. For many traders, it was a jackpot. Neither Polymarket nor the Nobel Institute responded to detailed questions from journalists, and The Wall Street Journal reported it couldn’t reach “6741” for comment. Polymarket operates offshore and is technically banned for U.S. users, so it doesn’t outlaw insider trading. That’s why even if someone inside the Nobel process tipped off traders, it’s unclear whether the bets actually violated any law. Harvard professor Jason Furman, who once advised President Barack Obama, reacted to the situation online. “The other day a student asked me about the prevalence of insider trading in prediction markets. I now have an answer,” he posted on Bluesky, attaching a screenshot from Polymarket’s Nobel betting page. Trump’s campaign, Polymarket’s $8 billion boom, and the legal gray zone This year’s Nobel Peace Prize carried extra attention because Donald Trump publicly campaigned for it, which made the prize itself a trending topic, drawing more bettors to prediction platforms like Polymarket. Earlier this week, the Intercontinental Exchange, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, announced plans to invest $2 billion in Polymarket, in a deal valued the latter at $8 billion and signaled how mainstream prediction markets have become. Polymarket was founded just five years ago by the relatively mysterious Shayne Coplan and got in trouble with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2022, which ended with Shayne agreeing to block American users. The crypto betting platform got really popular last year when bettors correctly predicted Trump’s second presidential win and even pop cultural moments, like a user named “romanticpaul” betting on Taylor Swift’s engagement hours before it went public. In September, Cryptopolitan reported that Polymarket acquired a small CFTC-licensed exchange, as part of its plan to re-enter the U.S. Economists remain divided, with some arguing that insider trading improves accuracy, while others call it unfair manipulation. One potential growth area for Polymarket in the U.S. is sports. Kalshi now offers betting contracts on football, basketball, and other professional sports, encroaching on the turf of established sportsbooks such as DraftKings and Flutter Entertainment’s FanDuel.

Ethena stated that USDE is experiencing volatility in the secondary market due to sudden market fluctuations and widespread liquidations. The protocol asserted that its minting and redemption functions are functioning smoothly and that USDE remains overcollateralized.

Historically, this month (dubbed “Uptober” within crypto circles) has served as one of the most favorable months for digital assets, frequently marking the start of extended rallies. As U.S. regulators move closer to rolling out comprehensive frameworks to strengthen domestic crypto activity, DeepSeek’s data-driven dreams could come to fruition… XRP ($XRP): DeepSeek AI Sees Path to $10 by Year-End DeepSeek anticipates that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could reach $10 before the end of the year, representing a nearly fourfold increase from its present price, $2.82. Now in its thirteenth year, the cross-border payment token has continued to show strong resilience. Following Ripple’s courtroom win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after a drawn-out five-year dispute, investor confidence surged, sending XRP to $3.65 on July 18, its first new all-time high since 2017. According to DeepSeek, should XRP decisively move beyond that July peak, the token could realistically surpass $10 by January, assuming favorable macroeconomic and regulatory developments. Over the past 12 months, XRP has appreciated by 437%, making it the strongest-performing non-stablecoin among top crypto assets. For comparison, Bitcoin rose 100%, while Ethereum gained 82% over the same period. Technical data reveals three separate bullish flag formations throughout 2025, two of which appeared this summer, signaling a potential breakout as the year winds down. Market watchers now anticipate that October’s seasonally bullish pattern, coupled with pending ETF approvals and the potential for a comprehensive crypto legislative framework in the U.S., could act as major upward catalysts. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): DeepSeek Sees Potential 8× Upside Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) is Dogecoin’s closest rival, now capitalizing $7 billion of the market. Currently trading at $0.00001203, SHIB remains virtually unchanged in the last 24 hours, mirroring the broader market’s stasis. From a technical perspective, SHIB has not yet broken out of either a falling wedge or a bullish flag pattern this year. Surpassing the sticky $0.000025 level by November could pave the way for DeepSeek’s ambitious year-end price range of $0.00005 to $0.0001, just over 8x its current value. Beyond its meme-driven origins, Shiba Inu offers real-world functionality via Shibarium, the project’s Layer-2 network that delivers fast, low-cost transactions, decentralized applications, and enhanced privacy, differentiating SHIB from competing meme assets. Dogecoin ($DOGE): DeepSeek AI Thinks Doge Can Blast Past Traditional $1 Target Originally launched as a parody in 2013, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into a top-10 cryptocurrency, boasting a $38 billion market cap within the $80 billion meme coin sector. Its long-standing success stems from a passionate community and increasing use in real-world payments. Although Dogecoin’s price often tracks Bitcoin’s trends, its deep liquidity and loyal retail following have allowed it to withstand several market downturns. Currently priced near $0.25, DOGE has more than doubled in value over the past year, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. With its RSI hovering around 50 and trending upward, the data suggests growing investor accumulation. Over the last 24 hours, DOGE actually gained 1.1%, beating out leading coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, all of which shed 1%. Chart patterns also highlight multiple bullish patterns forming over 2025, a potential indicator of a major upside breakout. DeepSeek estimates that DOGE could close the year between $1.50 and $3, although its upper bound is a real stretch target, considering Dogecoin peaked during the 2021 bull run at $0.7316. A run up to $0.50 is achievable in normal market conditions, with $1.50 standing as a reasonable bull target. Adoption trends also continue to strengthen: Tesla still accepts DOGE for merchandise purchases, while PayPal and Revolut now support Dogecoin transactions within their payment ecosystems. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin Riding a Wave of Community Excitement Although DeepSeek AI’s forecasts primarily focus on leading established tokens, a newer entrant, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , is gaining notable traction within meme coin circles, having already secured over $2.8 million in early presale funding. Promoted as Dogecoin’s wilder, more speculative cousin, Maxi Doge embraces his degen identity while celebrating both fitness culture and meme-powered virality. After years of living in Dogecoin’s shadow, MAXI is carving out his own brand with high energy and unapologetic flair. Built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, MAXI encourages active participation through Telegram and Discord communities, trading competitions, and upcoming strategic partnerships. Out of 150.24 billion total tokens, 25 percent are allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” which will be used for marketing, collaborations, and community growth. Staking is live during the presale, offering up to 119% APY, though returns diminish as the number of stakers rises. Presale tokens are currently priced at 0.0002615 dollars, with incremental increases as fundraising milestones are met. Investors can participate using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

With U.S. regulators nearing completion of long-awaited crypto legislation, and what many believe could be the final major bull run before mainstream adoption, XRP, Pi Network, and Cardano are well placed to lead the next bull run. Ripple (XRP): 2025’s Cross-Border Payment Powerhouse Has Plenty of New ATHs to Come XRP ($XRP) , the native digital asset of Ripple’s fast, low-cost payments network, has long touted itself as a modern alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. Endorsements from the UN Capital Development Fund and partnerships with several major U.S. banks have propelled XRP to the third-largest crypto by market capitalization, now around $169 billion. Ripple’s introduction of RLUSD, a dollar-backed stablecoin, underscores its intent to capture a leading share in the fast-growing stablecoin sector. Over the past year, XRP has skyrocketed by 437%, setting its first new high in seven years at $3.65 on July 18, before pulling back around 22.5% to its current $2.81, still far outpacing Bitcoin’s 100% gain over the period under examination. Currently holding a relative strength index (RSI) near 43, XRP has headroom for recovery after its 7% decline over the past week. The broader $4.24 trillion crypto market remains unchanged in the last 24 hours as a brief midweek selloff wraps up, cashing in on strong start-of-week rallies. Technical data highlights dual bull flag formations on XRP’s summer charts, which have yet to break out. With ETF approvals anticipated in mid-October, favorable news could lift XRP to the $5–$10 range, or even higher. Pi Network ($PI): Can the Mobile Mining Trailblazer Hit $1 Before Year-End? Pi Network changed the game by pioneering a mobile-friendly “tap-to-earn” mining model, allowing users to mine crypto without expensive hardware or high electricity costs. By simply opening the app and tapping once a day, users can participate in mining, dramatically lowering barriers for newcomers entering the crypto space. Pi’s RSI is sub-30, indicating the token is undervalued right now after recent selling. For investors who want to go long, this makes today a prime dip-buying opportunity. A falling wedge pattern identified earlier this year points to a potential breakout by December. Should sentiment improve, Pi could hit $1 by Christmas, reaching a seven-month high and quadrupling from its current price near $0.24. The Pi team is also currently deploying major updates, gradually ushering in version 23, a crucial milestone toward its long-awaited mainnet release. With its intuitive app interface and proprietary Layer 1 blockchain, Pi is strategically placed to capture market share as crypto adoption continues expanding globally. Cardano ($ADA): The Sustainable Smart Contract Platform Looking Toward 2026 Cardano ($ADA) continues to demonstrate resilience and investor trust through 2025, having risen 142% over the past year, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana alike. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is built on a philosophy of scientific research and energy efficiency, utilizing a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. Its approach has even influenced parts of Ethereum’s ongoing development roadmap. Now capitalizing roughly $30 billion, ADA would need to triple in price to challenge Solana and mount a serious challenge to Ethereum’s dominance. Trading near $0.814 today, ADA has gained 0.5% in the past hour as it looks set to lead a market rebound. Supportive macro and policy trends could drive it toward $1.50 by fall and potentially move to challenge its $3.09 ATH by year’s end. Even without major regulatory breakthroughs, continued steady growth could still see ADA reach $2 within the same timeframe. Additionally, from a technical standpoint, ADA formed a bullish flag pattern over the summer, typically a precursor to large upward moves. The token looked set to break out at the end of summer but lost its steam in a generally bearish September. Key resistance sits near $1.15, with solid support established between $0.85 and $0.90. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The Meme-Driven Bitcoin Layer-2 to Watch in 2025 Finally, one of 2025’s most exciting newcomers, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , is quickly drawing tens of millions in presale investments by enhancing Bitcoin’s scalability and capability with a proprietary Layer-2 protocol inspired by the viral energy of meme culture. The HYPER presale has already netted around $23 million, with analysts predicting potential 10x+ returns post-launch. Built using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER delivers high-functionality smart contracts, low-cost and high-speed transactions, and a Canonical Bridge for near-instant Bitcoin transfers, dApp compatibility, and integrated meme token functionality. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed zero vulnerabilities, strengthening investor confidence. The HYPER token fuels the platform’s ecosystem, powering governance, staking, and transaction fees. Early investors can earn up to 51% APY through staking while enjoying DAO voting rights. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

The meme coin is now expected to rise by 40% should buying pressure increase, as market structure and on-chain data suggest an early parabolic formation. This surge is a reflection of the DOGE past pre-breakout stages of the earlier bull cycles. Interestingly, as DOGE plan its next upward leg, MAGACOIN FINANCE has come into the spotlight as another competitor, with over 500% ROI potentia l. Dogecoin Price Holds $0.24 Support Dogecoin price is holding above the weekly support level of $0.24, indicating stability in the volatile market. Technical analysts noted DOGE recorded higher lows since June 2025, confirming its bullish structure. This support is a launchpad to the past rallies and the present arrangement is an indication that buyers are back in charge. In the market data, it is shown that exchange reserves have declined by almost $23 million worth of DOGE traded out of key trading hubs. Historically, these outflows are associated with periods of whale accumulations as huge investors transfer holdings into cold storage. The trend reflects growing conviction that Dogecoin may be preparing for another sharp move higher. DOGE Inflow/Outflow Chart | Source: Coinglass Meanwhile, volume trends continue to support the bullish case. On-chain activity shows consistent inflows to non-exchange wallets and steady liquidity retention near current levels. If Dogecoin maintains its support above $0.24, analysts anticipate a breakout toward $0.30 , marking a 40% upside move in the near term. Sustained momentum above that range could extend gains toward the 2021 highs over the coming months. Smart Money Signals $0.30 Breakout Technical structures on the 4-hour DOGEUSDT chart indicate a strong reversal setup. Multiple Breaks of Structure (BOS) and Changes of Character (CHoCH) confirm that buyers are gradually reclaiming market dominance. Analysts identify repeating fractal wave patterns consistent with Dogecoin’s past parabolic cycles. DOGEUSD 4-Hr Chart | Source: TradingView These formations suggest that once DOGE clears the $0.30 barrier, the next resistance may not appear until $0.45–$0.50. Furthermore, smart money accumulation continues to build. Volume profile data shows that institutional-scale wallets and experienced traders are entering positions during every dip, taking advantage of consolidation phases. The trendline breakout from Dogecoin’s long-term downtrend has also been confirmed through multiple retests. Analysts highlight that such accumulation patterns often precede extended rallies in assets like DOGE. As these structural signals strengthen, traders expect the meme-coin to spearhead the next bullish wave. Similarly, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the top “smart money” picks of the quarter, showing comparable accumulation among large crypto wallets. MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops Analyst Picks in Q4 MAGACOIN FINANCE presale is one of the most successful launches of 2025. The project, which is a multi-stage presale, is based on the Ethereum network and gives early adopters a chance to have discounted access to the altcoin before exchange launches in Q4 2025 . Its clear roadmap, proven presale platform and rising community traction are regarded by analysts as strong signs of legitimacy and sustainability. Therefore, MAGACOIN FINANCE price trend in 2025 continues to attract a lot of optimism among industry experts. The initial comparisons to Shiba Inu and DOGE breakout years are creating investor confidence that MAGACOIN FINANCE will be able to give 500X ROI as soon as the exchange trading begins. Analyst reports highlight that the prelaunch amount of presales is generally not this large, which demonstrates that the project has strong credibility. Its design compensates early adopters and has fair distribution, appealing to both retail and institutional investors. Conclusion The fact that Dogecoin remains above $0.24 and that its exchange outflows are at $23 million is a solid turning point for bullish traders. Analysts estimate a 40% rally towards $0.30 in case the momentum accelerates, which is in line with repetitive technical and on-chain signals. Simultaneously, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming an opportunity with 500x ROI , attracting the attention of smart money and resembling the initial Dogecoin hype.

Analyst Charts Path To $0.60,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/is-the-dogecoin-low-chart-path-to-0-60/,"Dogecoin’s structure “is still trying to turn around,” according to a market technician More Crypto Online who argues that both the higher-time-frame and intraday counts now permit a constructive path toward $0.60—provided a handful of support and breakout thresholds hold. In a new video, the analyst describes a market that is “printing higher highs and higher lows,” but cautions that the advance is “choppy, slow… boring and very fragile,” language that underscores how conditional the bullish setup remains. Dogecoin Breakout Loading On the daily chart, the crux of the thesis is the integrity of August’s corrective low, labeled as the wave-2 pivot. “From a daily chart point of view [price] should really… ideally hold above the wave 2 low that formed here in August,” the analyst says, calling that local invalidation line at $0.189. A decisive violation would force a re-marking of the larger structure: “If we break below this red line, the idea that a B-wave bottomed in June will have to be revised.” Even so, the commentator preserves a secondary bullish path, noting that an extended B-wave could still be in play as “a broader A-B-C structure,” with the market attempting another reversal “from the lower support area” thereafter. Related Reading: Is It Too Late To Buy Dogecoin? 3 Analysts Reveal What’s Next Upside conviction rotates around September’s swing high. “Once we break above the last swing high from September, we might be on our way to $0.49+,” the analyst says. That level functions as the first high-time-frame gateway: a clean breach would confirm that the move out of the September trough has transitioned from corrective to impulsive character, validating the notion that June’s B-wave low has already printed. The lower-time-frame evidence is doing some heavy lifting. On the one-hour chart, price action out of the late-September base is described as a motive sequence: “The move to the upside from the September low appears to be a five-wave move up. This allows for the interpretation that we have already bottomed in the B-wave.” The decline from the September 13 local high is, in contrast, framed as a completed three-leg retracement. If that count holds, the present pullback should remain corrective and terminate above clearly defined micro levels: “Upper micro support is between $0.23 and $0.245 with an additional key level… at $0.233,” the analyst notes. The condition is crisp: “Ideally we’re holding above $0.23 in this pullback. If we see an impulsive reaction from here to the upside, then this could be the beginning of a third-wave rally up.” Related Reading: Rounded Bottom Formation Shows When Dogecoin Price Will Begin ‘Flying’ Risk management and location remain central. The broader support shelf that cushioned September’s local bottom sits above the daily invalidation line and is expected to remain active on any deeper shakeout: “This support area is still relevant… we might get another test… probably in the area around $0.21 to $0.20,” the analyst says, adding that this band nests within the larger $0.227–$0.20 zone. Lose $0.23 decisively and “it increases the probabilities that we are still caught in this B-wave,” he warns—a shift that would postpone, not nullify, the bullish roadmap so long as $0.189 endures. What would carry Dogecoin beyond $0.49 toward the headline target of $0.60? The blueprint the analyst lays out implies an impulsive third-wave advance once micro support holds and September’s swing high gives way. In classical Elliott terms, a confirmed third wave often stretches beyond the initial motive leg, and the technician explicitly flags the setup: “If we see an impulsive reaction… this could be the beginning of a third-wave rally up.” Moreover, the $0.49 handle—identified as the first destination after a breakout—would be a staging area rather than a terminus. After a fourth wave correction, DOGE could start a fifth wave which the analyst places in the $0.60 region. The message, however, is emphatically conditional rather than euphoric. “It’s always important to zoom out,” the analyst reminds viewers, stressing that while Dogecoin is “moving up step by step slowly,” the advance is not yet an emphatic impulse. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.25.

At the same time, new data shows that corporate XRP treasuries have climbed above $11.5 billion following a fresh purchase from Reliance Global. Ripple Expands Into Bahrain, Strengthening Its Middle East Presence According to the press release , Ripple has entered the Kingdom of Bahrain through a new partnership with Bahrain Fintech Bay (BFB), the country’s leading fintech incubator and ecosystem builder. Ripple and Bahrain Fintech Bay plan to run accelerator activities and take part in local events to boost blockchain innovation across the country. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, said Bahrain was one of the first jurisdictions in the world to regulate crypto assets. According to Merrick, Ripple aims to help strengthen the local blockchain industry in Bahrain and eventually introduce its custody solution and Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin to financial institutions in the country. Suzy Al Zeerah, Chief Operating Officer at Bahrain Fintech Bay, described the collaboration as a key step in connecting global innovators with Bahrain’s financial ecosystem. Ripple currently holds more than 60 regulatory licenses and registrations worldwide, including its DFSA license from March 2025, making it the first blockchain-enabled payments provider licensed by the Dubai Financial Services Authority. Ripple is taking part in Fintech Forward 2025 in Sakhir on October 8 and 9, an event organized by Economist Impact that will bring together key players from banking, fintech, and government. XRP Treasuries Cross $11.5 Billion as Corporate Adoption Surges Corporate interest in XRP continues to rise as large firms add the token to their balance sheets. According to corporate disclosures compiled by Crypto Treasury Tracker, combined XRP holdings across institutions in the U.S. and Japan now total more than $11.5 billion, showing a significant rise in blockchain-based asset adoption. The growth follows Reliance Global’s purchase of $17 million in XRP, which the company disclosed in a filing with the SEC on September 30, 2025. SBI Holdings leads global XRP holdings with around $10.4 billion in reserves. Other notable corporate treasuries include Trident Digital, which plans to raise $500 million for XRP reserves, and Webus International, which filed with the SEC for a $300 million XRP-focused treasury. In Japan, Gumi Inc. allocated $13.5 million of its $38 million raise to XRP under its Digital Asset Treasury initiative, while VivoPower added $19 million to its holdings. Companies are turning to XRP for its fast settlement time, low transaction cost, and ability to improve cross-border liquidity. Adding to the momentum, a well-known finance bull on X shared that Ripple won “Best Initiative with Digital Currencies” at the PAY360 Awards, calling it a significant recognition of XRP’s real-world utility.",XRP|ripple|Ripple news XRP Ledger|XRP Ledger Adoption|XRP Ledger news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-10 23:00:15

Multiple sources allegedly told FOX Business’ Charles Gasparino that the conversation has picked up in recent weeks. They say the Trump team is treating it like a real option, though perhaps for the tenth time this year. The crypto community’s beloved CZ ran into trouble with the feds back in 2023. He cut a plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice, admitting guilt to money laundering charges, which also forced him to step down as CEO and cost Binance a massive $4.3 billion in fines. On top of that, CZ personally had to cough up $50 million and serve four months in prison. He got sentenced in April 2024, did time at a low-security federal prison in California, then finished up at a halfway house. He got out in September 2024. Trump’s team pushes back on crypto crackdown According to Charles, many inside Trump’s circle think CZ got railroaded. They’re calling it political, part of what they describe as the Biden administration’s war on crypto. The pardon idea fits into a bigger plan most of them have been pushing all year: a hard pivot toward pro-crypto policies. They believe the former administration deliberately treated crypto leaders like criminals instead of innovators. Even some critics of Binance think the government went overboard. The original case claimed CZ let the exchange process illegal transactions, including those involving sanctioned parties, and failed to set up strong anti-money-laundering systems. But whether the punishment fits the crime has always been a hot topic. Some argue that CZ was made into an example during an election season. CZ still owns the biggest single stake in Binance. A pardon could bring him back into formal leadership. He started the company in 2017, and under his watch it became the world’s largest place to trade Bitcoin and other cryptos. Right now, he’s not in charge, but his influence remains strong behind the scenes. A cleared name would change everything. Still, nothing moves fast in Trump world. His attention is stretched across several global fights: Ukraine, Gaza, and even China, where trade tensions are flaring up again. People familiar with how clemency decisions are made say they often take longer than expected, especially with this kind of case. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

These three altcoins are all in positions where they could rally strongly very soon, with each boasting strong fundamentals that will support longer term increases. We’ll examine these three in the following article, while we’ll also be discussing a new token that is showing enough potential to surge when it lists later in the year. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Bullish Fundamentals and Oversold Technicals Predict Big Incoming Rally Despite having crept up to $2.82 in the past few hours, XRP remains down by 7% in a week and by 5% in a month. On the other hand, it boasts an impressive 435% increase in the past year, with the altcoin having been one of the chief beneficiaries of Donald Trump’s second term as U.S. President. Ripple has finally ended its long-running case with the SEC in recent months, freeing up the company to sign new partnerships, make acquisitions and expand into new territories. This has boosted demand for XRP, which will see another boost in the next few weeks, as the first XRP ETFs are likely to launch. It’s in this hugely positive environment that the coin finds itself in an oversold position, as highlighted by its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) indicators. Source: TradingView Because XRP has been oversold for a couple of months, it’s now overdue a big rebound, something which the launch of XRP ETFs could trigger. As such, we may see the coin reach $3.50 by the end of this month, while it could pass $5 in December. Crypto Price Prediction: BNB Coin ($BNB) – Bull Market Will Push Binance’s Token to New Highs BNB has dipped by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, yet its current price of $1,259 represents a 16% gain in a week and a 42% increase in month. Clearly, BNB is one of the market’s hottest top-100 coins at the moment, and it doesn’t look like the token will run out of steam anytime soon. Its indicators remain within bullish ranges, and while there’s an argument that it may be nearing overbought territory, this has been the case since late July. Source: TradingView And with the market likely to become even more positive in the next few weeks, as more altcoin ETFs come online, BNB is in a prime position to ride the wave. Because it’s the native token of Binance, the market’s biggest exchange (by quite some distance), it will directly benefit from any increase in trading activity. For this reason, it could reach $1,500 by the end of October, while it rise above $2,500 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Sui ($SUI) – Network Growth and Canary ETF Ready to Set Altcoin Alight SUI has risen to $3.46 in the past couple of hours, and while it’s down by 3.5% in the past week, it boasts a decent 9% increase in a fortnight. While SUI is up by 90% in a year, it remans 35% down from its all-time high of $5.35, which it set back in January. It therefore has some catching up to do, although the MOVE-based cryptocurrency (and Libra offshoot) has the fundamentals to retake and then eclipse its current ATH. Sui is currently the ninth-biggest blockchain in terms of total value locked in , which stands at $2.6 billion, having risen by 163% in the past year. It’s witnessing encouraging growth as a smart-contract platform, while its chart today suggests that a rebound may be coming soon. Source: TradingView Its MACD is about to turn positive, indicative of returning buying pressure, while it has also been trading within a bullish pennant. This pennant is close to a convergence point, implying that the SUI price could break out very soon. And with Canary planning to launch a SUI ETF , the altcoin could surge towards the end of year, with its target being a bullish $8. $1.8 Million Raised As PEPENODE Prepares to Launch Mine-to-Earn Platform As good as the tokens above look right now, traders may also want to diversify into smaller, newer tokens, since these can often outperform the market during bull rallies. This may include investing in presale coins, which often have the advantage of generating momentum prior to listing on exchanges. One such coin with lots of momentum is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has raised just over $1.7 million in its sale. Never Mine in the Dark. Let PEPENODE show you the light with the World’s first MINE-TO-EARN Memecoin. https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/U2B7p5W1XY — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 9, 2025 What’s interesting about PEPENODE is that it’s launching a mine-to-earn platform, which will provide users with the chance to run their own virtual mining rigs. Users can expand their rigs by buying new nodes with the PEPENODE token, with more nodes equalling greater rewards. The platform will pay rewards out in the form of other popular meme coins, such as Fartcoin and Pepe. This could provide a strong incentive to buy and hold PEPENODE, which investors can also stake. They can join the token’s presale by visiting the PEPENDOE website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. Visit the Official Pepenode Website Here PEPENODE is currently available at $0.0010962, although this price will rise every three days until the sale ends.

According to a statement released Friday, Dominari Securities, the investment banking arm of Dominari Holdings, is working directly with Hemi, a blockchain project built on top of Bitcoin, to increase the usage of the Hemi token. Dominari is involved at multiple levels. American Ventures, where Dominari holds the majority stake, also made a strategic investment in Hemi. The exact amount wasn’t made public. Dominari helps launch Tron, invests in Hemi, and links up with CZ’s circle Hemi, which just raised $15 million in fresh capital from backers like YZi Labs, Republic Digital, and Crypto.com, is now positioning itself as a key Bitcoin-layer solution with institutional interest. Co-founded by Matthew Roszak, a long-time crypto backer and close ally of CZ, the project is now tied into a wider political and financial web. Dominari’s headquarters sits inside Trump Tower in Manhattan, and the firm has played a visible role in deals tied to the former president’s circle. Its parent company brought in Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump as advisers. In June, the firm got involved with SRM Entertainment, a struggling toy company, and helped flip it into a new entity called Tron Inc. That firm plans to start accumulating TRX, the native token of Justin Sun’s Tron blockchain. Justin, too, has poured money into Trump-linked crypto projects and coins. CZ, who stepped down from Binance leadership after a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. regulators, served four months in prison. He’s publicly said he applied for a pardon. This partnership means Dominari is expanding beyond advising Trump-friendly ventures. It’s now funneling capital and institutional clout into projects that sit directly on Bitcoin’s base layer. The plan is to create access points for ETFs and regulated crypto exposure, but with roots in Trump-affiliated money and CZ’s post-Binance ecosystem. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

In a recent post on X , Coach JV revealed that he stores his family’s earnings in these two digital assets, citing the consistent depreciation of the U.S. dollar as his primary motivation. He noted that the dollar has lost nearly all of its value over the past century, arguing that inflation continues to erode household savings year after year. The Case Against the U.S. Dollar According to Coach JV, inflation has stripped the U.S. dollar of about 96–97% of its purchasing power since 1913. This, he said, represents a gradual but damaging process that undermines long-term financial security. He contends that conventional money systems inherently lose value over time, whereas digital assets with capped supplies provide stronger preservation of wealth. Why do I store my family’s hard-earned money in XRP and Bitcoin? Because since 1913, the U.S. dollar has lost 96–97% of its purchasing power. Inflation silently robs you every single year. There’s only one way out of poverty, getruthlessly accountable and convert your earned… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) October 8, 2025 He emphasized that assets like XRP and Bitcoin operate on a fixed or limited-supply model, unlike fiat currencies that can be expanded without limit. This fundamental difference, in his view, allows these cryptocurrencies to maintain, and potentially increase, their value relative to the dollar. Limited Supply as a Hedge Against Inflation Coach JV refers to Bitcoin and XRP as “fixed-supply, deflationary assets” that resist inflationary pressures. Bitcoin’s total supply is capped at 21 million coins, while XRP’s is fixed at 100 billion tokens. By contrast, central banks can create new currency indefinitely, contributing to steady declines in real value over time. Statistical comparisons illustrate this point. Over the past decade, the U.S. dollar has lost roughly 37% of its value due to average inflation of 3.2% per year. In real terms, $10,000 in 2015 now has the same purchasing power as about $7,300 in 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has surged from around $600 in October 2015 to about $126,000 in October 2025, an increase that exceeds 20,000%. XRP’s growth over the same period has been even more striking, climbing from $0.0045 to roughly $3, representing a gain of more than 65,000%. Such performance, according to Coach JV, explains why more investors are choosing digital assets as a store of value rather than relying solely on fiat-based systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Growing Support for XRP and Bitcoin as Financial Havens Coach JV’s views echo a broader sentiment within the crypto community. Last month, market analyst Zach Rector projected that XRP could eventually reach $100 , citing weaknesses in the U.S. economy. Rector pointed to a decline in job creation, higher unemployment, and persistent inflation as signs that investors are losing confidence in traditional markets. He added that recent discussions at the Federal Reserve regarding potential interest rate cuts could further boost interest in cryptocurrencies. Historical data support this perspective. XRP rallied by 580% following the 2016 U.S. election, with similar upward movements observed in assets like XLM and HBAR during comparable macroeconomic shifts. In May, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also predicted significant long-term upside for Bitcoin, estimating that its price could reach $1 million by 2028. Hayes based his outlook on weakening U.S. Treasury demand and growing financial fragmentation worldwide, factors he believes will push investors toward borderless digital assets like Bitcoin. Concluding his remarks, Coach JV underscored his personal priorities: “God, family, and protecting your ecosystem at all costs.” He encouraged his audience to take proactive steps in managing and preserving their wealth, particularly as global inflation and economic uncertainty continue to challenge traditional financial systems. For him, Bitcoin and XRP represent more than investment vehicles; they are instruments of financial protection designed to safeguard family assets from the slow erosion of value caused by inflation and monetary expansion.

According to a recent press release, the company has already acquired 2 million SOL , valued at over $440 million , and appears poised to continue adding aggressively to its position. “By utilizing Coinbase’s suite of products, STSS can enjoy the institutional-grade infrastructure, deep liquidity, and competitive pricing required to effectively manage a leading Solana treasury,” commented the head of the company, James Zhang. Through Coinbase, they will also be able to stake Solana to earn yield on their investment. As of today, the staking rewards for this token sit at 6.8%, meaning that its treasury could produce up to $30 million per year. Solana Price Prediction: Ascending Price Channel Favors Bullish Outlook for SOL The daily chart shows SOL is trading within an ascending price channel, a classic bullish setup that supports the case for a Solana price prediction targeting $270 in the short term — and potentially new highs once it breaks above its January all-time high. The $210 level stands out as a key demand zone, backed by both previous highs and trend line support. If SOL pulls back to this area and bounces with volume, it could trigger a breakout toward $270 , followed by a stronger move to $300 . Looking ahead, as institutional adoption accelerates and Wall Street continues to embrace Solana , the long-term target could reach $600 — a 172% gain from current levels. While Solana leads among large caps, the best crypto presales could deliver even bigger returns this cycle. One of the most promising contenders is SUBBD ($SUBBD) , a decentralized content platform that’s raising money at the presale stage. SUBBD ($SUBBD) Presale Launches the First All-in-One AI Creator Platform SUBBD ($SUBBD) is disrupting how content is produced, managed, and monetized by creators.

Bybit, Binance, and other major exchanges do. The now-trending perp decentralized exchange Aster had also minted 8 billion ASTER tokens to a multisig. All these go to show how popular multisignature crypto wallets have become. Multisig wallets balance between security and joint custody of crypto assets. They are much harder to screw up compared to regular wallets, like MetaMask, Phantom, etc., which are single-signature by design. But multisigs are not without some risks. Earlier this year, Bybit lost $1.5 billion to hackers, and UXLINK recently lost $11.3 million , all of which was a result of compromised multisig wallets. Starting with a breakdown of what multisig wallets are and how they work, we’ll show you the upsides and downsides of using one, and some of the best multisig wallets in 2025. Multisig Wallet Definition Multisig is short for multiple signatures. A multisignature crypto wallet is one that requires two or more signatures to sign off on a transaction. The way a Bitcoin multisig wallet works may differ from that of Ethereum multisig wallets or Solana multisig wallets. However, the idea of requiring multiple signatures to make a transaction remains the same. When you initiate a crypto transaction on-chain, a digital signature is required to prove your ownership. That signature is basically a mathematical construct of your Private Key and the hash of the transaction you are making. In the case of multisignature wallets, you will need more than one signature to send a transaction. The wallets are designed to allow multiple signers, each with their own unique private keys, to approve the transaction. Multisigs can be set such that a minimum or all of the signers are required to authorize a transfer from the wallet – more on this later in the article. How It Differs From Standard Wallets Standard wallets like Trust Wallet, Phantom, and MetaMask, including Ledger devices, function as single-signature wallets. That means they only require a single private key or signer to authorize a transaction from the wallet. Single-signature wallets are just perfect for personal use, interacting with dApps, daily transactions, and holding small amounts. On the other hand, multi-signature wallets require many signers. No one signer can fully confirm a transaction without the other, which removes the single point of failure in regular wallets. That is why multisigs are the preferred choice for crypto firm and institutions that manages large crypto treasuries. Individual investors can also decide to use multisigs, especially when dealing with a large amount of money, only that it adds an extra layer of friction where you have to share and require another signature from a trusted third party to spend your money. Analogy With Traditional Bank Signatures The concept of signature in crypto is not entirely new. One can even argue that it’s borrowed from traditional banking. Your handwritten signature does the same work as a cryptographic signature, which is to authorize transactions. For instance, when signing a cheque, you are telling the bank, “I authorize you to write this change (debit) on my account.” The teller then compares the signature to the one on file. If verified, the bank accepts the cheque, and the transaction is written permanently into its records. Traditional banks also have their own system for distributing control to eliminate a single point of failure, i.e., multisig. In joint and corporate accounts, banks can be instructed to require the signatories of some or all authorized persons before greenlighting a payment. How Do Multisig Wallets Work? Multisig wallets work very differently from regular wallets and are more technical to set up. But we can break it down into three segments, which shall include the public/private key generation, setting of the M-of-N threshold, and then the transaction authorization process. Public and Private Keys in Multisig During the setup, each participants first create their own standard private key, which is used by the wallet software to calculate their corresponding public key. Using a script/smart contract, the wallet owners then merge their public keys and agree on the M-of-N configuration on how many keys should be required to sign a transaction. The script is then used to generate the multisig receiving address, where the funds are sent. M-of-N Signature Model The M-of-N signature model is the configuration used to decide the number of keys that are required to send a transaction from multisig wallets. The N represents the total number of keys that can sign a transaction, while the M represents the minimum number of signatures required to validate a transaction. There are three types of multisig wallets based on this model: 1-of-2 Two public keys are paired in this type of multisig wallet, but only one is required to sign a transaction. Such wallets are best suited for personal portfolio management or shared access between two trusted parties. 2-of-3 Only two signatures out of three total keys are required to make transactions from this multisig wallet. In the case of one key loss, the funds can still be accessed. 3-of-5 Multisigs of this type required a minimum of three out of the five total keys. You could still access your funds even if you lost two private keys. N-of-N Multisig wallets can also be set to require all key holders to sign a transaction. In numbers, it would look like this: “2-of-2.” If a dApp with two co-founders sets up a multisig wallet with such a configuration, this means that both founders would have to sign every time a transaction is initiated from the wallet. But this is a risky practice, given that access to the wallet may be impossible if one of the founders loses their private key. Transaction Authorization Process The process of authorizing a transaction from a multisig involves the initiator and the signers, all of whom are key holders of the wallet. In the case of a 3-of-5 multisignature crypto wallet, when one of the key holders initiates a transaction to send, e.g., 1 BTC to another address, it remains pending and is passed to the other key holders, with only two signatures needed to authorize the transfer. The other holders verify the details of the transaction and then add their signature, which goes to show they are aware and approve of the transfer. Once the transaction has collected a total of three signatures from the key holders (the initiator and two signers), it is then marked as fully authorized and broadcast to the network. Benefits of Multisig Wallets There are some good reasons why crypto firms and security-conscious investors choose to use multisignature wallets over standard wallets. 1. Enhanced Security Against Hacks Requiring many signatures adds an extra layer of security to crypto wallets. Multisigs enforce a system where no single individual can move funds in the wallet, which removes the single point of failure inherent in regular crypto wallets. So, if hackers manage to gain access to one of the private keys, they cannot do much with it. With some wallets, you have the option to remove the compromised key, replace it, or add new key holders. 2. Protection Against Key Loss With threshold signature wallets like 1-of-2, 2-of-3, etc., you can still access your crypto assets even with a key loss. This is unlike Phantom, MetaMask, and other single-signature wallets, where losing your one private key makes your assets impossible to recover. 3. Shared Control for Teams and Organizations The M-of-N configuration of multisig wallets is ideal for shared control, which is why it is very common among teams and firms. With it, no single person is a custodian of the funds, and no transaction would be processed without the knowledge of other team members enlisted as key holders. 4. Governance and Trust in DAOs Multisig wallets are usually how Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) get to manage their crypto treasury transparently and trustlessly. The community doesn’t have to trust that one key holder acts in good faith and not run away with their funds. Also, the DAO’s funds remain “SAFU” even if one key holder acts maliciously or becomes unavailable. Risks and Limitations of Multisig Wallets Despite having fantastic security benefits, there are a few limitations or downsides to using a multisignature wallet. 1. Complexity in Setup and Use From our breakdown earlier, you will agree that setting up and using multisig wallets can be complex. It’s usually technical, and that’s why many don’t recommend it for beginners or simple day-to-day spending. 2. Potential Delays in Transaction Approvals The fact that multiple signatures are required to make a transaction presents its own problem. You can make a payment with just a few clicks on single-signature wallets, but multisigs require a certain number of key holders to review and approve the transaction, which delays processing time. 3. Smart Contract or Software Bugs The wallet software is prone to bugs, which can be exploited to compromise the wallet. This was the cause of the $1.5 billion Bybit hack in February, where the exploiters musked a transaction UI to change the smart contract logic of the wallet, leading to the theft. 4. Limited Support Across Platforms Most multisig wallets are built for specific blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means a team or DAOs using a Bitcoin multisig, for instance, would need to set up a different wallet for crypto tokens based on Ethereum or Solana. Popular Use Cases for Multisig Wallets These are some of the popular cases where it makes more sense to use a multisig wallet. 1. Business and Institutional Funds Management Multisig setups like 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 make it easier for businesses and institutions to manage large crypto assets, in that a consensus must be reached among key executives before funds can be moved. 2. DAO Treasury Management Multisig wallets are how DAOs establish trustlessness and the safety of funds. Even if a key holder goes rogue, the community treasury remains intact. 3. Joint Crypto Accounts (Families, Partnerships) A 2-of-2 multisig wallet can be used by partners to collectively manage funds, where transactions can only be approved if/when both partners agree on it. 4. Escrow Services The 2-of-3 setup is usually employed for escrow services, involving a buyer, seller, and a mutually agreed-upon third-party arbitrator. If a dispute arises, the arbitrator intervenes to release funds to the right party. Examples of Leading Multisig Wallets in 2025 Below are some of the best multisig wallets in 2025 used by the top crypto companies and high-net-worth crypto profiles. 1. Gnosis Safe Gnosis Safe is now known as Safe. It is specifically built for the Ethereum ecosystem, meaning it can only be used to manage assets on the Ethereum blockchain, and other EVM-compatible chains can use it. 2. Casa Casa provides a multisig wallet for Bitcoin, often called vaults. It was co-founded by Jameson Lopp and also supports a few stablecoins. 3. Electrum Multisig Electrum Multisig is another Bitcoin-focused multi-signature wallet. It may not be the friendliest for beginner users, but it’s quite popular among Bitcoiners due to its compatibility with Ledger, Trezor, and other hardware wallets. 4. BitGo BitGo manages and also provides multisignature wallets for institutional clients using smart contracts on programmable networks like Ethereum. BitGo wallets support both multisignature and multi-party computation (MPC) signature schemes. Multisig vs Other Security Solutions Here is how multisig wallets compare with other wallet solutions like MPC, Ledger, and MetaMask. Multisig vs Single Private Key Wallets Most of the standard wallet is designed as single private key wallets, including hardware wallets. So, Ledger, Trezor, Trust Wallet, MetaMask, and so on, fall under this category. This means that they require one and only private key to sign off on a transaction. Multisigs like Casa, Safe, etc., can have more than one private key and require multiple signatures to approve a transaction. Multisig vs Hardware Wallets Although hardware wallets are under the single private key umbrella, they also vary from multisig counterparts in that they are physical devices. However, multisig wallets are usually smart contract-based software. Oftentimes, both can be combined to achieve optimal security. Multisig vs Multi-Party Computation (MPC) With multisignature wallets, a certain number of private keys are generated, which are used for signatures. But in MPC, only one private key is generated and is split into a certain number of encrypted shares held by multiple parties. The goal with MPC is to remove a single point of failure of a single private key, while still allowing transactions with a single signature. The Future of Multisig in Crypto Security Most crypto companies and teams use multisig crypto wallets, especially for the use cases mentioned earlier, like shared crypto wallets management, escrow, etc., and it will likely remain so. Integration With DeFi and DAOs Multisigs have become the gold standard for DAOs and DeFi teams to manage treasuries. Multi-signature solutions will be an ongoing practice in DeFi. Multisig + MPC Hybrid Solutions Multisig + MPC solutions could become popular in the future. We could see more firms adopt such hybrid solutions for high-frequency institutional operations. Growing Institutional Adoption Over the past few months, several organizations have announced plans for a digital asset treasury. As this continues, we could see more adoption of multisignature wallets across different networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.",Learn Crypto: Beginner Guides,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|WALLET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-10 23:40:59

The South American country’s government revealed the developments on Friday, indicating that a letter of intent has been signed for the project, that could be one of the most significant technology and energy infrastructure initiatives in the history of Argentina. The Argentina project fits into OpenAI’s growth strategy According to a Reuters article, the project will entail the development of a large-scale facility with a capacity of up to 500 megawatts meant to power advanced artificial intelligence computing. A government statement indicates this mega project will be structured under the country’s RIGI tax break initiative, which went into effect last year as an effort to attract foreign capital. In a social media post, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirmed the development, officially naming the project. “We are proud to announce plans to launch Stargate Argentina, an exciting new infrastructure project in partnership with one of the country’s leading energy companies, Sur Energy.” Altman. Altman also emphasized the project’s importance being the first of its kind ever to be developed in Latin America, a region which he described as “full of talent, creativity and ambition.” The announcement comes at a time the AI startup is experiencing exponential growth. OpenAI which now has 800 million weekly users for its ChatGPT service recently concluded a secondary share sale, solidifying its position as the world’s most valuable startup with a $500 billion valuation. Its recently launched AI-powered video generating tool, Sora is experiencing fastest growth within a week of its launch surpassing ChatGPT. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , Sora massive demand reaching 1 million downloads. Although its access is currently limited to the US and Canada on an invite only basis, market data shows that Sora saw 627,000 downloads on iOS downloads during its first seven days of availability while ChatGPT recorded 606,000 downloads in its first week. This growth also comes at a cost, high energy consumption. The colossal computational power needed to train and operate the startup’s AI models necessitates a global expansion of its AI infrastructure. The Argentina project also seem to be an instrumental part of that strategy. The development also come after the startup’s developer conference earlier this week, where OpenAI showed off a series of new partnerships with huge brands like Spotify, Zillow, and Mattel, together with a suite of new tools aimed at expanding its application ecosystem. As for the Argentina project, while the letter of intent represents the early stages, successful implementation of the project would provide a significant boost to Argentina’s economy and position the Latin American country as a critical hub for AI development in that region.

The meme coin now sits at a critical level, where the next move could either confirm a deeper correction or set up a high-conviction buy-the-dip opportunity. Whale wallets are clearly leaning bullish — the top 100 holders added over 2.7 trillion PEPE in the past week, according to Nansen . Still, short-term sentiment remains shaky, with CoinGlass reporting a 13.6% drop in open interest , showing a decline in speculative demand. Pepe Open Interest. Source: Coinglass. Those who remain engaged appear to be betting on a bounce, with the funding rate almost tripling to 0.0095 over the past 24 hours, suggesting traders are retaking long positions. Yet optimism persists among active traders. The funding rate has nearly tripled to 0.0095 in the past 24 hours, suggesting traders are retaking long positions amid the retest. Pepe Funding Rate. Source: Coinglass. PEPE Price Analysis: Deeper Slide or Bounce Ahead? Pepe now sits at a crucial confluence of support around $0.000009: a historical demand zone aligning with the lower boundary of a 7-month bullish pennant pattern. This level marks the final threshold before a breakdown, with momentum indicators signaling caution. The RSI has slipped below the neutral line, showing sellers in control, though a reversal around 40 could hint at buyers stepping back in. The MACD histogram paints a similar picture. While a death cross suggests downside risk, the narrow gap between the lines shows bearish momentum remains fragile. In a breakdown scenario, the next key support sits 40% lower at $0.0000055. However, with market participants positioning for a bounce, focus could shift back to a breakout. The key threshold remains the $0.0000125 supply zone. However, if momentum flips bullish, a bounce could put a breakout back in focus. The key threshold sits around a past supply zone at $0.0000125. Flipping this level into support would validate the pennant pattern and target a 215% move toward $0.000029. But under stronger demand with continued U.S. interest rate easing into 2026 and growing potential for TradFi exposure through ETFs, the rally could extend 430% to $0.00005.

The price has since entered a consolidation phase, hovering near the $120,000 level as traders search for fresh demand. Market sentiment remains divided — some analysts expect Bitcoin to stabilize and prepare for another leg up, while others warn of a possible drop below current levels as momentum cools. This raises the question that’s echoing across the market: Could this be the first truly different Bitcoin cycle? According to top analyst Darkfost, traditional patterns may not apply this time. “Some claim that a -80% to -90% bear market will occur as usual,” he explains, “but certain data points suggest that this cycle is being built on new foundations.” Unlike previous cycles driven by retail speculation, this one appears increasingly influenced by institutional participation, ETFs, and long-term holders, all contributing to reduced volatility and deeper market maturity . While corrections remain part of Bitcoin’s DNA, structural changes in demand and liquidity may be redefining how this cycle unfolds. Whether Bitcoin breaks higher or faces a major retracement, one thing is clear — this market is evolving faster than ever before. Bitcoin’s Fourth Cycle: A Stable and Mature Market Phase According to top analyst Darkfost, Bitcoin’s current cycle stands out as the most stable in its history. During this bullish phase, BTC has not experienced a single correction exceeding 28%, a stark contrast to previous cycles where violent retracements were common. Most drawdowns have remained within a modest 10%–20% range, and only four corrections have surpassed 25%, marking this as the least volatile Bitcoin cycle so far. For perspective, between 2020 and 2022, Bitcoin endured multiple 50% drawdowns, creating sharp waves of fear and euphoria that defined the market’s rhythm. Today, the picture is very different. Volatility has dropped to its lowest levels since the last bear market, reflecting a new level of market maturity. As Darkfost points out, this decline in volatility has also led to a tightening of the Bollinger Bands’ standard deviation, signaling growing price stability and disciplined market behavior. This shift suggests that Bitcoin’s market structure has fundamentally evolved. It no longer mirrors the chaotic, retail-driven cycles of the past. Instead, adoption continues to climb, regulation has become more favorable, and, most importantly, the investor base is changing. Large institutional players and corporate treasuries — particularly in the United States — are entering the market, absorbing selling pressure that once triggered deep corrections. As a result, Bitcoin’s fourth cycle is rewriting the rulebook, built on deeper liquidity, stronger hands, and long-term conviction rather than speculation. This may be the first cycle where Bitcoin transitions from a volatile asset to a globally recognized, maturing store of value. Price Consolidation Continues Around $121K Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $121,800, consolidating after a volatile week that saw strong resistance near the $126,000 all-time high. The 4-hour chart shows that BTC is moving sideways within a narrow range, struggling to reclaim the short-term 50 EMA (blue line), which has now turned into dynamic resistance. The immediate support level sits near $120,000, while the key horizontal level at $117,500 — highlighted in yellow — remains the most crucial zone to maintain the broader bullish structure. As long as the price holds above this area, the uptrend remains intact, with potential for a renewed push toward the $124,000–$126,000 zone. Momentum indicators suggest that buyers are still defending critical support, though market indecision dominates. The 100 and 200 EMAs (green and red lines) continue trending upward, reinforcing mid- and long-term bullish sentiment. However, failure to close above $122,500 in the coming sessions could expose Bitcoin to deeper retracements, with eyes on $118,000 as the next demand area. The chart suggests a healthy consolidation phase after a major breakout. A decisive move above $123K would confirm renewed bullish momentum, while a breakdown below $120K could mark the beginning of a deeper correction phase.

His comments follow recent market turbulence that saw XRP lose ground while other major cryptocurrencies posted stronger performances. Over the past week, Bitcoin and BNB briefly rallied before the momentum cooled across the market. XRP, however, failed to keep pace, struggling to maintain its position above the $3 threshold. At the time of reporting, the token trades near $2.79, reflecting a mild correction alongside the broader market decline. Market Uncertainty This retracement has sparked renewed concern among retail traders. According to recent on-chain data from Santiment, sentiment toward XRP has reached its lowest level in six months. The growing unease reflects broader frustration among investors, as the token has lagged behind competitors during the latest market recovery phase. I don't understand those who are getting scared, all structures are still in place and XRP is just moving sideways. pic.twitter.com/44jkq6ASzr — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) October 8, 2025 However, analysts like Mr. Xoom argue that this negative sentiment is misplaced. In his latest market update, the chartist noted that XRP’s technical framework has not been compromised, describing the asset’s current position as a normal consolidation phase. He added that, from a structural perspective, XRP remains well-positioned for a potential continuation of its upward trend once current pressures subside. Key Technical Levels Identified To support his assessment, Mr. Xoom outlined several critical areas on XRP’s daily chart. His analysis identified three main zones of interest, two resistance levels, and one support region that define the token’s short-term trading outlook. The first resistance zone lies between $3.00 and $3.12, which he described as the immediate level to watch for a potential breakout. A successful move above this range could signal renewed bullish strength. Beyond that, the second resistance band, positioned between $3.52 and $3.62 , aligns with XRP’s July high near $3.66 and represents a key threshold before any move toward new all-time highs. On the downside, Mr. Xoom highlighted the $2.70–$2.72 region as a vital support level. This area has acted as a strong base in previous market cycles and currently forms the lower boundary of a descending triangle pattern visible on XRP’s daily chart. With the token still trading comfortably above this support, the analyst sees no indication of structural weakness. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Analyst Maintains Optimism Mr. Xoom reiterated that XRP would only enter a bearish phase if the price fell below the $2.70 support and closed decisively beneath that range. Until that happens, he maintains that the asset is simply consolidating within its established structure, waiting for the next directional move. In his view, many investors are misinterpreting short-term fluctuations as trend reversals, when in reality, XRP’s broader setup continues to mirror healthy technical behavior. With similar optimism, other market observers have urged investors not to overreact to XRP’s short-term underperformance. Market analyst Zach Rector, for example, recently addressed investor anxiety following BNB’s brief rise above XRP in market capitalization rankings. Rector reminded traders that despite temporary setbacks, XRP has still delivered impressive performance since the U.S. elections, recording gains of nearly 488% over the period. Overall, the consensus among seasoned analysts remains largely positive. While market sentiment has weakened and price action has turned sluggish, most experts agree that XRP’s long-term structure remains positive and its next major move will likely depend on broader market stability and renewed trading volume.

Once trapped under legal uncertainty, XRP has begun to reclaim attention thanks to favorable legal developments and the anticipated launch of Spot XRP ETFs. However, XRP’s current valuation is significantly below that of the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. But what if XRP were to rise to the same market capitalization as Bitcoin? Data from MarketCapOf offers a glimpse into how much each XRP token would be worth if it reached Bitcoin’s current market cap. Linking XRP’s Price With Bitcoin’s Market Cap Bitcoin’s market capitalization has reached heights that rival and even surpass some of the world’s largest multinational corporations. Notably, Bitcoin’s current market cap of $2.415 trillion places it shoulder to shoulder with tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is the eighth-biggest asset by market cap, just behind Silver and Amazon, and well ahead of Meta Platforms, Broadcom, and Saudi Aramco. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Why XRP Has Not Followed Bitcoin’s Trajectory In 7 Years, And Why Everything Is About To Change XRP is currently the third biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, but its market cap is far below Bitcoin’s lead. However, many analysts and market commentators believe XRP stands out as one of the few assets capable of challenging Bitcoin’s dominance. This belief originates from XRP’s alignment with traditional finance. Its established partnerships with banks and payment providers give it a practical use case that most cryptocurrencies do not have. At the time of writing, XRP has a market cap of $168 billion, not even up to one-tenth of Bitcoin’s market cap. According to MarketCapOf, if XRP were to reach Bitcoin’s current market cap, each token would be worth approximately $40.68. Given XRP’s circulating supply of about 53.4 billion tokens, this price prediction represents an increase of over 14,000% or 14.35x, from its current level of around $2.8. In practical terms, an early investor holding just 1,000 XRP today would see their holdings valued at more than $40,000 under this scenario. What This Means For XRP Holders The comparison provides a valuable perspective on XRP’s long-term potential and the scale of value transfer possible within the crypto market. It also shows how far XRP needs to go in order to reach Bitcoin’s current level. Related Reading: XRP Could Mirror 2017 Style Surge: Here’s How High The Price Will Go If It Happens Bitcoin’s dominance today is due to its first-mover advantage and its acceptance as a store of value. However, XRP is growing in remittances and real-world asset tokenization, and Ripple’s stakeholders are working to challenge SWIFT. This gives the cryptocurrency a utility foundation that could cause the growth of its market share. If Ripple continues to secure partnerships with central banks, payment providers, and institutional investors, as Ripple has increasingly done in regions like the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, then the idea of XRP closing even a fraction of the gap with Bitcoin becomes less far-fetched. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.83. Another factor that could contribute to this projected price growth is if Spot XRP ETFs are launched in the US and they perform well.

In an X post on October 10, Russell Vought, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, confirmed that “RIFs” — short for reductions in force — have officially commenced. The administration had previously warned that such measures could be implemented across federal agencies. Regarding the layoff, the White House did not state the exact number of federal employees to be affected by the layoff. However, officials hinted at departments that would be affected. This includes departments such as Treasury and Health. These widespread layoffs have raised concerns among individuals as they anticipate that they might significantly increase the economic-related risks associated with the government shutdown . During usual shutdowns, federal employees labeled as non-essential go on furlough and can receive payment for their lost wages once funding resumes. Trump’s decision to lay off federal workers raises heated debates among individuals Earlier, Trump made public his intention to permanently terminate federal employees from the workforce and threatened workers who were furloughed that they would not receive back pay. The president’s statement has worsened the shutdown’s effects on government employees and the economies they support. Vought, who offered assistance in writing the Project 2025 plan for Republicans to gain control of the White House, strongly advocated for reducing the number of federal workers and making changes to the federal government. On the other hand, Lee Saunders, the president of AFSCME, a powerful group representing government workers, referred to the mass firing as an illegal act and cautioned the Trump administration that implementing such an act could result in devastating effects. “Whether these federal employees are food inspectors, public safety workers, or perform many other public service roles that enable America to keep running, federal workers should not be used as pawns in this administration’s political games,” Saunders stated. He further mentioned that they will investigate every legal choice to stop the Trump administration’s illegal attacks on the rights and jobs of public service workers. Democrats have also commented on the situation. They swiftly criticized the layoffs, with Chuck Schumer, the Minority Leader of the United States Senate, alleging that this is deliberate chaos in America. According to Schumer, the Trump administration has thoughtlessly decided to harm people — the workers who protect their nation, check their food, and offer help during emergencies. US Democrats call for an extension of health insurance subsidies Some Republicans also appeared uneasy about the move. Senator Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, said she strongly opposed Vought’s announcement and warned that it would hurt families in her state and elsewhere. The shutdown began on October 1, when Democrats declined to back a temporary proposed bill that Republicans had hoped would fund the government until late November. Concerning the proposed bill, Democrats pointed out that they would support it only if Republicans committed to negotiating an extension of health insurance subsidies scheduled to expire at the end of the year, which could potentially increase medical coverage costs for tens of millions of Americans. Additionally, some Republicans, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, a representative from Georgia, started to raise concerns about their party’s stance, stating that a solution for the expiring healthcare subsidies needs to be found. Greene shared an X post highlighting that Democrats created this problem in 2010, which worsened in 2021, while Republicans never addressed it.

ChainLink faced a sharp drop after traders dumped thousands of tokens, sparking fresh bearish sentiment. On the other hand, Stellar continues to fight within a downtrend, and its weak social buzz has scared off traders who fear another drop may be lurking around the corner. With so much uncertainty, the crypto crowd is scrambling to spot what could be the next big move. The market keeps proving that altcoins can flip direction faster than a penguin sliding on ice. Prices pump. Then dump. Then repeat. This is why crypto investors are shifting toward opportunities that offer real upside potential while also rewarding long-term believers. Many are asking one simple question. Where is the next breakout that can create real wealth instead of crumbs and peanuts? That is why meme coins keep dominating crypto conversations. Meme coins went from a joke to a financial revolution that turned small wallets into bull-powered moon rides. The hype cycle is back, and MoonBull has entered the arena at full speed. Most importantly, MoonBull Presale is live now, and it is cooking with insane growth potential. It offers structured tokenomics and real returns instead of empty promises. This new meme project has positioned itself as the best crypto to join in 2025 , and the window is still open, but not for long. MoonBull Presale Live Massive FOMO Opportunity for Early Investors MoonBull is cooking up one of the biggest, loudest, and most talked-about launches in the crypto space right now. The presale is pulling serious momentum, and crypto investors are lining up like kids outside a candy store. The hype is not just noise. There are strong numbers behind it. The presale is running across 23 stages, and Stage 4 is live now. The price per token at this stage is just 0.00005168, which still gives massive upside potential. MoonBull ($MOBU) is connected directly to the best crypto to join in 2025 narrative because it is still in early stages and offers real tokenomics that focus on sustainability. This is not just another meme coin blowing hot air. It brings auto liquidity, reflections, and deflationary burns. Every trade builds its token strength instead of weakening the chart. Over three hundred thousand dollars has already been raised, and over one thousand holders have jumped on board. Here is where things get crazy. The current ROI from Stage 4 to the future listing price of 0.00616 sits at 11,800%. That is not a typo. That is a bulls-smashing-through-walls type of growth. Here is a simple example. An investment of 25,000 dollars at the Stage 4 price would secure almost 484 million tokens. When the listing price is reached, that bag could potentially be worth just under 3 million dollars. That is not retirement money. That is freedom money. That is crypto island and supercar energy. The reason MoonBull can secure that type of growth is that the presale is first-come, first-served, and each stage increases the price. The clock is ticking. Once Stage 4 ends, Stage 5 goes live, and the price jumps again. Then again. Then again, until 23 stages are complete. MoonBull is built for FOMO, and right now it is delivering. Liquidity Through Staking Power that Pays Off MoonBull’s staking system gives buyers more than just a bag of coins. It unlocks a 95% APY at Stage 10. Rewards stack daily and holders keep full control over their tokens. This is liquidity staking that lets holders earn without freezing assets forever. Staking lets holders earn passive rewards while fueling price stability. Rewards come from a pool of 14.6 billion tokens that keeps payouts healthy and long-lasting. It encourages loyal holders and pushes long-term gains because more tokens are locked, which reduces market circulation. All of this makes MoonBull the best crypto to join in 2025 for early-stage potential. That claim is strong, and the proof is in the presale math. MoonBull is a movement. A meme with muscle. A bull that refuses to walk. It charges. It climbs. It smashes price ceilings on the way to orbit. Stellar Struggles While Bulls Wait For A Rebound Stellar has been one of the most useful blockchains in the payment and remittance industry. It has fast transactions and a strong utility use case. But price action does not care about fundamentals sometimes. The latest Stellar price prediction shows more room to fall. The XLM chart recently failed to complete a bullish flag pattern and fell below a major support zone. The downtrend started months ago and the market still has not seen a breakout. The latest XLM crypto news highlights another problem. Social buzz for Stellar has collapsed to weak levels. Trader interest has dipped heavily, and that signals low buying demand. That is dangerous because price pumps need hype. Without hype, a token becomes flat. This is what Stellar is facing today. Yes, long-term utility is strong, but short-term upside is crawling at a snail’s pace. Traders get bored with waiting and move their liquidity toward faster opportunities. That is why Stellar investors now keep their eyes on MoonBull, which has already become the best crypto to join in 2025 for those who want gains before the next Bitcoin halving cycle takes flight. Stellar might bounce one day, but it looks stuck in a slow lane while MoonBull is flying in the fast lane with nitro boosters. The choice is simple. Chase potential or wait on a hope. ChainLink Outlook Amid Selling Pressure and Market Volatility ChainLink has been one of the most trusted projects in the blockchain world due to its role as the leading oracle network. Yet recent LINK news today paints a shaky picture. ChainLink dropped sharply by about 4% in a single trading session after heavy institutional selling triggered panic among retail investors. The LINK price today recently touched a session low near 21 dollars, which marked its weakest level in days. This sudden reversal caught traders off guard as LINK had briefly pumped earlier in the week. Chainlink Reserve also purchased over 45K LINK tokens, but the market crash left the reserve sitting underwater. The average cost basis was above $23, and LINK is now trading below that mark. This means even the reserve is technically down, which does not boost investor confidence. Resistance levels are stacking up like bricks at 22.68 and 21.92, which shows that bullish pressure is getting slapped back fast by sellers. Market sentiment is still stuck in fear mode. Trading volumes jumped, but the price kept falling, which signals a bearish trend. Bears are not leaving the party yet, and LINK could tumble again if Bitcoin drags the market further down. Despite ChainLink being one of the more stable altcoins historically, it still cannot deliver the insane early growth potential compared to MoonBull, which is currently considered the best crypto to join in 2025, thanks to its explosive presale trajectory. That comparison matters. Investors who want strong upside returns usually chase presale gold mines before they explode. LINK might still be a long-term hold, but right now it feels more like watching a hippo swim slowly rather than a bull charge to freedom. Conclusion ChainLink and Stellar both sit at important phases in their journey. LINK fights selling pressure while XLM tries to recover from weak demand. Both projects carry long term value but neither delivers explosive growth in the near term. MoonBull breaks that pattern. The presale invites anyone searching for the best crypto to join in 2025 with a chance to enter before the price rockets stage by stage. MoonBull builds hype with solid tokenomics, staking rewards, referral bonuses, audit security, and a launch system that protects early holders. MoonBull is different and the numbers speak louder than words. MoonBull is rewriting the meme economy. The presale is live now and the window for the biggest returns is still open. Anyone who missed PEPE or Shiba Inu now has a second chance. Grab MoonBull today before it blasts off.

52965833,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=833352,1760142749,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52965833.jpeg,Apple sets sights on Prompt AI to supercharge smart home tech,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/apple-eyes-prompt-ai-to-boost-home-tech/,"Apple is reportedly in late-stage talks with the computer vision startup Prompt AI to acquire talent and technology that would help it upgrade its smart home devices and further enhance its position in the artificial intelligence market. First reported on by CNBC, the deal highlights Apple’s low-key but purposeful strategy of shaping its AI offerings through small acquisitions focused on buying talent rather than purchasing billion-dollar companies across the board. Leadership at Prompt AI informed employees during an all-hands meeting that they were nearing the finalization of talks with Apple. Some staff would move to Apple as part of the deal, the company said, and those who did not would receive a less generous salary package and be encouraged to apply for open positions at the iPhone maker. Before Apple entered final-stage talks, other proptech players, including xAI and Neuralink (which is coming from Elon Musk), had reportedly shown interest in acquiring Prompt AI, according to people familiar with the meeting. Yet Apple’s bid seemed to be the most strategically focused, with an emphasis on both the company’s technology and its research talent. Prompt AI was established in 2023 by veteran AI researcher Tete Xiao, who holds a PhD in computer science from UC Berkeley, and Trevor Darrell, a co-founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab. That same year, the startup raised a $5 million seed round led by AIX and Abstract Ventures. Xiao and Darrell are both respected figures in the AI community, known for their work in computer vision and deep learning — two areas where Apple has been quietly building its capabilities behind the scenes. Apple and the Prompt AI founders have not responded to requests for comment on the deal; however, sources familiar with it note that the acquisition is likely to close within the next few weeks. Apple eyes Prompt’s tech for home automation Seemour, the flagship app of Prompt AI, is certainly central to Apple’s attention. The app integrates with home security cameras and utilizes a sophisticated computer vision system to recognize specific individuals, pets, vehicles, and objects. It can send alerts, text messages, or answer users’ questions about what has been happening in front of the camera — a development that suggests a conversational interface for home monitoring. However, while a technical success, the prompt AI failed to find a sustainable business model. At a town hall meeting, Xiao reportedly informed staff that the app and all user data would be deleted to safeguard privacy. This aligns with Apple’s robust stance on privacy, making them a well-matched partner on a cultural and ethical level. Industry watchers believe that Apple will utilize Prompt’s technology for its HomeKit platform — the one behind devices such as light bulbs, thermostats, and security systems that run on Siri. That could potentially transform HomeKit from a largely reactive automation system into an intelligent home assistant that is responsive and intuitive — one capable of observing real-world activity and responding instantly to it. Apple has historically been acquisitive of small AI and vision startups, usually to integrate their work into forthcoming products. In 2020, it bought Xnor. AI, a startup that does edge AI processing, which later helped improve Apple’s on-device image recognition features. Apple’s subtle AI strategy gains focus Indeed, unlike rivals such as Google , Microsoft, and Meta, Apple has steered clear of splashy AI-focused purchases. And while it has made large acquisitions before, its biggest-ever deal is still the purchase of Beats Electronics for $3 billion in 2014. Rather, Apple has shown a preference for “acquihires” — strategic and tactical acquisitions made to soak up specialized talent and proprietary technology. Some analysts argue that this cautious approach has hindered Apple’s outward progress in generative AI. And its new “Apple Intelligence” suite — intended to deliver personalized, on-device AI functions to iPhones and Macs — has seen delays in rolling out and mixed early reviews. Apple’s stock is down just 2% this year, after being left behind by most major tech indices and competitors that have adopted their belief in AI. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

In a recent market update, the analyst shared a comparative chart showing how Amazon’s price action between 1999 and 2009 mirrors XRP’s consolidation pattern from 2017 to 2025. Based on this historical correlation, he proposed that XRP may be entering the same pre-rally phase that preceded Amazon’s massive multi-year growth. Amazon’s Historical Pattern and XRP’s Current Setup According to ChartNerd’s assessment, Amazon’s stock peaked in 1999 before spending roughly a decade moving sideways in a prolonged consolidation phase. Once it broke above resistance in 2009, the company’s stock entered an extended rally that defined its long-term growth trajectory. $XRP 1. $AMZN 1999-2009 2. $XRP 2017-2025 Amazon placed an ATH in 1999 and had to wait just under 10 years before a whopping vertical climb above $20.. $XRP placed an ATH in 2017 and has had to wait 8 years to start breaking its ATH.. Yet I'm reaching with my $27 targets? pic.twitter.com/CtdryNC3TS — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 8, 2025 He compared this structure to XRP’s price behavior following its 2018 all-time high. For nearly eight years, XRP has traded below that level, repeatedly testing resistance without a clear breakout. The analyst noted that both assets share similar long-term accumulation patterns, with XRP’s key resistance area centered around the $3 mark. ChartNerd believes that once XRP closes decisively above this threshold, the market could see a sustained breakout phase similar to Amazon’s in 2009. He identified $27 as a realistic target based on the scale of prior consolidation and the projected extension of the current cycle. Why the $27 Projection Appears Reasonable The analyst emphasized that the projection is not merely speculative but rooted in historical price behavior. He explained that market cycles often repeat when similar technical conditions appear. Amazon’s breakout followed years of low volatility and steady accumulation, a setup he argues XRP now replicates. A move from XRP’s current range near $2.80 to $27 would represent nearly a 10-fold increase. ChartNerd suggested that such an advance, while ambitious, aligns with how previous major crypto assets have behaved once they overcame multi-year resistance levels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ChartNerd is not the only commentator expecting XRP to reach this level. Market analyst EGRAG recently reiterated a similar $27 forecast using long-term Fibonacci extension and linear regression models. In his analysis, EGRAG projected that XRP could potentially reach that target before the end of the year if momentum shifts in favor of bulls. Both analysts share the view that XRP’s ongoing consolidation phase reflects strength rather than weakness and could serve as a foundation for the next major rally once market sentiment improves. Expanding Views: Triple-Digit Scenarios Beyond these moderate projections, other analysts have suggested far higher long-term possibilities. Nick Anderson of Bullrunners has presented an even bolder outlook, arguing that XRP’s setup mirrors Amazon’s full consolidation and breakout timeline, which spanned more than 3,800 days. Anderson observed that Amazon’s stock advanced from about $5 to over $200 after finally breaching its previous highs, and he believes XRP could follow a comparable pattern. Based on this model, he envisions a possible price range extending into triple digits, estimating a potential target of $100. Supporting Anderson’s viewpoint, Brad Kimes of Digital Perspectives highlighted parallels between the two companies’ historical challenges, Amazon’s battles with regulatory oversight in its early years, and XRP’s recently concluded legal disputes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While such extreme price levels remain speculative, analysts agree that XRP’s technical position shows resilience. The asset continues to hold above key supports, and long-term consolidation patterns suggest the groundwork for a future rally is still intact.
