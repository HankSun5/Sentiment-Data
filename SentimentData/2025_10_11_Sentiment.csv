The interview came hours after President Donald Trump announced new tariff threats against China, once again rekindling the threat of retaliation from China. Luckey says the broader economy is at risk As far as Luckey is concerned, the US has become too reliant on China for critical resources like rare earths and semiconductors, and that dependence poses a significant risk to national security. He claimed that Anduril has been able to distance itself from Chinese supply chains, a fact he implied was not true for many other American companies. According to him, the reasons for its decision to distance itself from Beijing’s supply chain have to do with sanctions and the need for independence in defense manufacturing. He said: “We have to get off the Chinese supply chain. We need to reindustrialize. We need to have our own rare earth supply and make our own chips and computers,” adding that China already holds “too much leverage” over the US, particularly where critical materials essential for military hardware are concerned. Luckey has called for the re-industrialization of the US to reduce dependency on China, advocating for domestic production of essential technologies to strengthen the economy and national defense. This is crucial especially since geopolitical tensions with China are now part of the new reality for American companies, Anduril Industries Inc. Chief Executive Officer Brian Schimpf said on Friday. “I think it’s going to be a long-run conflict with China, and that’s just something that we’ve got to be prepared for,” Schimpf said . Anduril and Palantir are working to transform US defense Anduril is part of a growing crop of defense technology startups aiming to modernize the US military with artificial intelligence, software, and autonomous vehicles like drones, fighter jets and submarines. Schimpf expects the company’s revenue to double this year and boost production of its products by 400%. However, there are a few kinks it will need to work out. For example, an internal Army memo reportedly highlighted “fundamental security” issues with the NGC2 battlefield communication platform that Anduril received a $100 million contract to develop. The NGC2 prototype aims to enhance battlefield communications by connecting soldiers, sensors, and commanders. However, the memo claims it is “very high risk” and susceptible to vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized access to sensitive information. “We cannot control who sees what, we cannot see what users are doing, and we cannot verify that the software itself is secure,” the memo says. In its defense, Anduril has said the memo reflects an outdated state of the program, while Palantir asserted that no vulnerabilities were found in their platform. Both companies have seen their valuations surge under Trump’s presidency, with Anduril recently signing a $159 million deal for an initial prototyping period to develop a night vision and mixed-reality system as part of the Soldier Borne Mission Command. In comparison, Palantir signed a $480 million contract for Maven, an artificial intelligence tool with the ability to sift through images and sensor data to provide battlefield analysis.

52960440,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=836452,1760133636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52960440.jpeg,From $254M To $78.5B:  Tron USDT Growth Drives Network Valuation,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/tron-trx/from-254m-to-78-5b-tron-usdt-growth-drives-network-valuation/,"Tron (TRX) is at a decisive moment after retracing to key demand levels that could determine its next major move. Bulls, who have been in control since late March, are now working to defend support and prepare for a possible breakout. However, to confirm a bullish continuation, Tron must overcome the current supply zone and regain strong upward momentum — a challenge that will test the strength of the recent rally. Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Drops 50%: Is The Rally Built On Weak Fundamentals? Adding context to Tron’s long-term growth, top analyst Maartunn shared striking on-chain data revealing that TRON’s USDT supply has surged 309x in just six years. What began as a modest 254 million USDT on the network has now expanded to a staggering $78.5 billion, marking one of the most dramatic liquidity expansions in the crypto industry. This massive increase highlights the network’s role as a core hub for stablecoin activity and underscores how liquidity growth has historically correlated with TRX’s price performance. As Tron trades near a critical juncture, both onchain strength and market structure will play a decisive role in shaping its direction. If demand holds and liquidity continues to flow in, Tron could be gearing up for another leg higher in the weeks ahead. Tron Unprecedented Growth: The Power of Liquidity and Network Effects According to Maartunn, the story of TRON is a perfect example of how fast the crypto industry can evolve. “Time in crypto has a strange rhythm,” he notes — what feels like a lifetime of change in traditional markets can unfold in just a few years on-chain. Six years ago, Justin Sun proudly celebrated a major milestone for TRON: reaching 254 million USDT on the network, with 300 million “coming soon.” At that moment, it represented a remarkable achievement for a still-developing ecosystem. Fast-forward to today, and TRON’s growth has been nothing short of exponential. The network now hosts $78.58 billion in circulating USDT, a staggering 309x increase since that post. This transformation underscores TRON’s evolution from a niche blockchain to one of the most important infrastructures for stablecoin liquidity worldwide. Over the same period, TRX’s price rose from $0.0155 to $0.338, reflecting how price action and liquidity expansion often move hand in hand. Maartunn emphasizes that this correlation between USDT supply and TRX price illustrates a broader truth about crypto markets — liquidity drives adoption and valuation. When infrastructure, user demand, and network effects align, growth compounds at an astonishing pace. The key takeaway, he adds, is to zoom out: short-term volatility can obscure the far more powerful story of long-term innovation, adoption, and capital rotation. TRON’s rise proves how quickly a well-positioned network can become indispensable to the digital economy.

The chart shows that after reaching a local high near $0.36, the price entered a sideways range, with buyers defending the 50-day moving average (blue line), currently acting as dynamic support. This region has proven crucial in maintaining the bullish market structure. The 200-day moving average (red line) remains well below the current price, confirming a long-term bullish bias, while the 100-day MA (green) continues to serve as mid-term support around the $0.32 zone. As long as TRX holds above this area, the broader uptrend remains intact. Related Reading: Coinbase Premium Gap Signals Strongest Bitcoin Accumulation Since ETF Launch – Details However, a clear breakout above $0.35–$0.36 is still needed to confirm renewed bullish momentum and open the door toward $0.38 and $0.40, levels not seen since early 2022. On the downside, a decisive drop below $0.32 could invite further corrections, potentially testing the $0.30 psychological level. Overall, Tron’s chart structure remains healthy. Consolidation above support suggests that buyers are accumulating, waiting for stronger market conditions to push the price into a new bullish phase aligned with the broader crypto trend.

His remarks emphasized Ripple’s professionalism, XRP’s use case , and the company’s commitment to building a lasting financial infrastructure. XRP Framed As The Coin With The Strongest Use Case Crypto analyst John Squire has drawn fresh attention to Ripple and XRP after sharing a video of Gilbertie praising the token’s real-world utility on X social media. In the interview, the Teucrium CEO discussed why the company chose XRP , calling it the digital asset with the strongest utility across the crypto market. He said his confidence in XRP stems from Ripple’s focused mission to achieve its goals of building a robust and sustainable financial system . Gilbertie commended the Ripple team’s disciplined mindset and deep technical expertise—qualities that set the crypto payments company apart from other blockchain firms. These strengths, he added, are key reasons Teucrium selected XRP, viewing it as a transformative technology with real utility rather than merely a speculative token. “The Ripple team, from the interaction we’ve had with them, they’re really professional, they act like investment bankers over there. They know what they’re doing, and they will make this work,” Gilbertie said in the interview. The Teucrium CEO’s high praise of Ripple reflects confidence in XRP’s potential as a settlement tool . He explained that while Bitcoin serves as a store of value, XRP distinguishes itself by solving tangible problems within the global payments landscape. He clarified that his statement was not a price prediction, but rather a reflection of his belief that XRP possesses the most utility among all the cryptocurrencies in the market. Gilbertie’s remarks about Ripple come shortly after Teucrium’s XRP ETF went live on the market , providing regulated exposure to the altcoin. Although the fund did not receive explicit approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) amid the ongoing government shutdown , the company proceeded with the launch. According to one expert, the SEC’s lack of response signaled implicit consent, noting that “silence is compliance.” Analyst Calls XRP “The Plumbing” For The Next Financial System In a separate report, crypto market commentator X Finance Bull urged investors to rethink how they evaluate XRP, insisting it should not be compared to corporate stocks. He described XRP as “the plumbing” for the next global financial system—one that connects institutions, governments, and decentralized ecosystems through tokenized infrastructure. From his viewpoint, Ripple’s objective is not to chase company valuations but to develop a framework that enables global money movement, covering $200 trillion in annual cross-border payments, trillions in tokenized assets, CBDCs , DeFi rails, and Real-World Assets (RWAs) . He added that capturing even 1-2% of this value could change the price of XRP forever. The analyst also highlighted Ripple’s expanding institutional network, noting recent collaborations with Luxembourg’s Ministry of Finance and its growing presence across Bahrain, Dubai, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) .",XRP|Altcoin|CBDCs|DeFi Rails|John Squire|real-world assets|ripple|RWAs|Sal Gilbertie|Teucrium’s XRP ETF|US SEC|US Securities and Exchange Commission|X Finance Bull|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-10 22:00:50

Nearly $1 billion in liquidations slammed the Bitcoin market within 24 hours, based on CoinGlass data, while Ethereum remains under $4,000 at press time, after following Bitcoin’s crash the first time. Binance data shows that Bitcoin actually dropped to a 24-hour low of $101,516.5 before recovering to $110,563.5, down 7.03% on the day. Ethereum (ETH) fell to a low of $3,400.00 and is now trading at $3,722.30, a 9.11% decline. Total liquidations over the past 24 hours reached approximately $706.2 million, with long positions accounting for $648.5 million, the largest single-day long liquidation so far this year. This meltdown follows Trump’s latest rant on Truth Social, where he said China sent “an extremely hostile letter to the World,” revealing plans to launch massive export controls on nearly everything they produce. Trump called the decision “unheard of,” “a moral disgrace,” and claimed it would impact all countries without exception. He vowed that the U.S. would answer with a 100% tariff, plus software export bans aimed squarely at Beijing. Trump cancels Xi meeting, reignites crypto panic This wasn’t Trump’s first warning shot today. Just three hours before, Cryptopolitan reported that the US president had said: “I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so.” He went on to accuse China of lying, saying they’re “becoming very hostile” with restrictions on rare earth metals, a critical ingredient in everything from smartphones to missiles. That post kicked off the initial selloff, but Friday’s update blew the doors off. The fallout spread to stocks quite fast. The SPY ETF dropped 2.7%, the QQQ sank 3.5%, and BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF fell 3.7%. The CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF also dropped 3.9%, showing there was nowhere to hide—not even in mining stocks, which had looked strong just days earlier. Despite the crash, some miners still walked away with gains over the week. HIVE ended the week up 40%, even with the sharp downturn in Friday’s session. Right behind it, BitFarms closed the week with a 31% gain. Over the last month, mining stocks have been some of the wildest movers in the market. Between September 10 and October 10, both HIVE and BitFarms doubled their value. Another name, IREN, nearly did the same, starting at $30.68, closing just under $60. The average one-month return for top miners came in at 73.26%. But that trend may be breaking now.

Bitcoin Faces Key Test Near $126K Trendline,https://cryptopotato.com/wall-breaking-bitcoin-faces-key-test-near-126k-trendline/,"Bitcoin is trading near $121,600 after reaching a new all-time high above $126,000 earlier this week. The asset has slowed and is now moving sideways just below a major diagonal resistance that has capped the price for several months. Analysts are watching to see whether Bitcoin can break through or if it will be rejected once again. Meanwhile, the market is holding near a key level while open interest remains high in the futures market. Bitcoin Struggles Near Long-Term Resistance Bitcoin is facing resistance at a trendline that has held firm since earlier cycle tops. The latest weekly candle shows another rejection near $126,000, followed by a pullback of around 5.5%. Earlier this year, similar rejections led to drops of nearly 10% and close to 30%. The difference this time is the size of the pullbacks. Each rejection has been smaller than the last. Rekt Capital pointed out that “this trendline looks to be a weakening point of rejection,” suggesting sellers may be losing strength at this level. Source: Rekt Capital/X On the lower timeframes, Bitcoin is holding just above $121,000. This zone is marked by a previous support level and lines up with a Fibonacci retracement near $119,550.

The trend remains bullish overall. A confirmed higher low would support another leg higher, especially if resistance breaks. Bearish Scenario Still in Play While short-term sentiment remains positive, some market participants are still cautious. Analyst Ali Martinez shared a scenario where Bitcoin gets rejected at $124,000 and begins a correction toward $96,000. If that level fails, the next major support is around $70,000. Source: Ali Martinez/X The projected path shows a slow recovery beginning in late 2026, with Bitcoin climbing back toward $90,000. This scenario reflects a broader retracement, not a trend reversal, and suggests long-term structure could still remain intact. Futures Market Remains Heated Data from Glassnode shows that futures open interest is still elevated. This means that many traders are positioned on both the long and short sides. Sharp moves in either direction have triggered liquidations. Glassnode said the market is undergoing “ a leverage reset ” as volatility flushes out excess positions. With Bitcoin sitting just below resistance and leverage still high, traders are watching closely. A move above the current range could open the way toward $130,000. If resistance holds, another pullback could extend the current consolidation. The post Wall Breaking?

Ethereum Foundation, Keyring Network Raise Funds According to an October 10 announcement , the two organizations have launched fundraising efforts to “pioneer open-source legal defense funding.” The announcement also states that the first three months of fees from zkVerified permissioned vaults on the Ethereum mainnet will go to Storm and Pertsev’s legal defense. “We believe privacy is a fundamental right, and that open-source developers should not face criminal liability for writing code,” said Alex McFarlane, CEO of Keyring Network. “By donating our early protocol fees to the defense of Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, we’re signaling that zkVerified DeFi can uphold compliance, safety, and privacy while standing in solidarity with the builders who paved the way,” he added. Following the news, Pertsev took to X to say he is “beyond grateful” for the donations.

Federal prosecutors alleged Storm laundered and concealed more than $1 billion through Tornado Cash—including hundreds of millions for the Lazarus Group, North Korea’s state-sponsored malware collective. “Roman Storm and Roman Semenov allegedly operated Tornado Cash and knowingly facilitated this money laundering,” then-U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in an August 2023 press release.

With Ethereum (ETH) holding strong above the $4,000 mark , meme coins tied to its ecosystem are getting a boost. As the second-largest meme coin , SHIB is well-positioned to ride Ethereum’s upward trend and attract renewed attention from traders looking for the next big move. Data from CryptoQuant shows that transaction volumes have been increasing while active addresses on the Shiba Inu blockchain have continued to rise. In addition, exchange netflows, a metric that indicates the amount of tokens flowing in or out of exchanges, has turned negative. This means that investors are withdrawing SHIB to cold storage – a move that is commonly interpreted as a bullish signal. These positive on-chain metrics could be an early indication that investors are jumping back on the market to scoop up SHIB at this lower price. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB ETF Could Ignite Rally to $0.000021 In the past 7 days, Shiba Inu has retreated by 3% as the crypto market as a whole has taken a breather. SHIB has once again found strong support at $0.000012 and could soon bounce off this level to retest its trend line resistance and the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Trading volumes have subsided lately, meaning that the selling pressure could be easing. Moreover, growing institutional adoption could result in the launch of a Shiba Inu exchange-traded fund (ETF) soon. A bullish breakout above $0.000015 could set off a rally toward $0.000021, with above-average trading volumes confirming such a move. New projects have outperformed legacy meme coins during this cycle, and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could be one of those hidden gems that is ready to explode. This top crypto presale has raised nearly $3 million in a heartbeat to build a strong community of like-minded degen traders. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Combines the Power of Meme Culture with High-Leverage Trading Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a meme coin that connects retail traders who aren’t afraid to trade at 1000x leverage to seize the moment and make the most out of this bull market. Token holders can share alpha , compete to make it to the top of the leaderboard, and access strategies typically reserved for whales . Weekly competitions reward top ROI hunters, while gamified challenges like Max Ripped and Max Gains will keep the community engaged through attractive and highly rewarding challenges. Finally, the Maxi Fund allocates up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds on the most promising tokens of this cycle with leverage to boost returns. The earnings from this fund will be used to further promote $MAXI and push the token to the top.

Bitcoin's price quickly plummeted to $102,000, leaving investors confused by the perception that October is typically a bullish month. Cryptocurrency analyst Timothy Peterson shared a striking analysis, noting that this decline is historically rare. According to Peterson, drops of more than 5% in October have only occurred four times in the last 10 years: October 24, 2017 October 11, 2018 October 23, 2019 October 21, 2021 Related News: Bitcoin Partially Recovers After Major Drop, But Liquidations Are Severe!

However, Trump has softened his stance in recent statements. Trump stated today, “The meeting with Xi has not been canceled,” indicating that potential contact between the two leaders has not been completely ruled out. He also said that “other options for export controls may be considered.” However, Trump also stated, “I don't know if I will meet with Xi.” Related News: HOT MOMENTS: Expert Analyst Reveals What Happened to Bitcoin After Historical Declines in the Previous Octobers In a post on Truth Social the day before, Trump noted that China had announced that it would impose comprehensive export restrictions on “virtually all products” starting November 1, 2025, calling the decision “unprecedented in the history of international trade and morally shameful.” In his post, Trump also announced that in response to China’s move, the US would impose 100% additional tariffs on China starting November 1 and impose export controls on all critical software. *This is not investment advice.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $776.48. In 2031, AAVE will range between $1,164.73 to $1,261.79. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $218.09 Market cap $3.51B Trading volume (24-h) $729.53M Circulating supply 15.25M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $279.24 24-hour high $173.32 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.18% 50-day SMA $300.81 14-Day RSI 43.29 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Green days 17/30 (57%) 200-Day SMA $259.84 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE dropped 21% in one day, breaking below key support. Heavy volume and strong MACD divergence confirm deep bearish control. Immediate support for bulls to defend is $200. Aave 1-day price chart As of October 10, AAVE has suffered a brutal 21.45% daily drop, falling from $273 to $215, its lowest level in weeks. The daily candle is large and red, decisively breaking below the lower Bollinger band at $242.59. This move signals a deep oversold condition and a potential panic-driven selloff. Volume surged to 68.8M, confirming heavy participation in the breakdown. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD deepened into bearish territory with a widening separation between the signal and MACD lines, indicating growing downside momentum. Unless the price swiftly reclaims $242–$250, sentiment will likely remain bearish. The next significant support zone lies near $200, followed by $188 if selling pressure continues. Aave 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart confirms intense downside pressure, with AAVE falling as low as $215 before stabilizing slightly at $218. The Alligator lines are sharply fanned downward, showing a strong bearish trend with no signs of flattening yet. RSI has plunged to 17, indicating a highly oversold market, but that doesn’t guarantee an immediate bounce as momentum remains overwhelmingly negative. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView While a minor technical rebound toward $230–$235 is possible, the dominant trend remains downward until the price reclaims at least $250. Traders should expect further volatility, as sharp bear moves are often followed by brief but violent relief rallies.

Momentum remains firmly bearish across all timeframes. While an oversold bounce could emerge, recovery will likely face heavy resistance near $250. Traders should avoid catching the falling knife until stability or a confirmed reversal pattern forms above that zone. Is AAVE a good investment?

AAVE’s historic price sentiment AAVE price history ⏐ Coingecko Aave, originally launched as ETHLend in 2017, rebranded in 2018 and became a major player in DeFi. Its protocol went live in 2020, and by August, its total value locked had reached $1 billion. The coin reached an ATH of $666.86 in 2021 but slumped afterward. Aave v3 launched in March 2022, driving prices back up to $261 before fluctuating between $50 and $100 later that year. In 2023, AAVE saw steady growth, ending the year at $109. It continued its upward trend in 2024, peaking at $178 in September and hitting a high of $328 by December. AAVE hit $378 in January, dropped to $192.57 by February, then fluctuated between $152 and $238 in March. April saw a low of $115, while May reached $282 and June peaked at $319.

52961597,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=833281,1760134838,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52961597.jpeg,The Nobel Committee is investigating a potential leak after Polymarket correctly predicted the 2025 Peace Prize winner hours ahead,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nobel-investigates-itself-over-polymarket/,"Officials in Norway have announced that the Nobel Committee is now investigating how a crypto trader on Polymarket appeared to know this year’s Peace Prize winner (María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader known for challenging her country’s regime) before anyone else, according to Erik Aasheim, spokesperson for the Nobel Institute, which manages the prize selection. As Cryptopolitan previously reported , the surge in bets happened just after midnight in Oslo, raising suspicion that someone leaked the result before the official announcement. Trader 6741 turns a late-night gamble into $50,000 profit Roughly 12 hours before the Nobel announcement, a mysterious trader using the handle “6741” started buying huge positions on Machado’s victory. At that point, she was considered an unlikely choice. But within 2 hours, the trader’s activity transformed the quiet market into a frenzy. When the winner was announced the next day, “6741” walked away with more than $50,000 in profit. What turned heads was how fast her odds jumped from 5% to nearly 70% overnight, all traced back to a newly created Polymarket account. Another Polymarket user, known as “GayPride,” began betting heavily once the early wagers caught attention on social media. With odds swinging between 60% and 71%, that user ended up pocketing over $85,000. For many traders, it was a jackpot. Neither Polymarket nor the Nobel Institute responded to detailed questions from journalists, and The Wall Street Journal reported it couldn’t reach “6741” for comment. Polymarket operates offshore and is technically banned for U.S. users, so it doesn’t outlaw insider trading. That’s why even if someone inside the Nobel process tipped off traders, it’s unclear whether the bets actually violated any law. Harvard professor Jason Furman, who once advised President Barack Obama, reacted to the situation online. “The other day a student asked me about the prevalence of insider trading in prediction markets. I now have an answer,” he posted on Bluesky, attaching a screenshot from Polymarket’s Nobel betting page. Trump’s campaign, Polymarket’s $8 billion boom, and the legal gray zone This year’s Nobel Peace Prize carried extra attention because Donald Trump publicly campaigned for it, which made the prize itself a trending topic, drawing more bettors to prediction platforms like Polymarket. Earlier this week, the Intercontinental Exchange, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, announced plans to invest $2 billion in Polymarket, in a deal valued the latter at $8 billion and signaled how mainstream prediction markets have become. Polymarket was founded just five years ago by the relatively mysterious Shayne Coplan and got in trouble with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2022, which ended with Shayne agreeing to block American users. The crypto betting platform got really popular last year when bettors correctly predicted Trump’s second presidential win and even pop cultural moments, like a user named “romanticpaul” betting on Taylor Swift’s engagement hours before it went public. In September, Cryptopolitan reported that Polymarket acquired a small CFTC-licensed exchange, as part of its plan to re-enter the U.S. Economists remain divided, with some arguing that insider trading improves accuracy, while others call it unfair manipulation. One potential growth area for Polymarket in the U.S. is sports. Kalshi now offers betting contracts on football, basketball, and other professional sports, encroaching on the turf of established sportsbooks such as DraftKings and Flutter Entertainment’s FanDuel.

The DEPEG incident occurred shortly after Donald Trump announced he would impose 100% tariffs on China. Ethena stated that USDE is experiencing volatility in the secondary market due to sudden market fluctuations and widespread liquidations. The protocol asserted that its minting and redemption functions are functioning smoothly and that USDE remains overcollateralized.

However, investor capital is rapidly rotating into altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have already achieved new valuation records in 2025. With U.S. regulators nearing completion of long-awaited crypto legislation, and what many believe could be the final major bull run before mainstream adoption, XRP, Pi Network, and Cardano are well placed to lead the next bull run. Ripple (XRP): 2025’s Cross-Border Payment Powerhouse Has Plenty of New ATHs to Come XRP ($XRP) , the native digital asset of Ripple’s fast, low-cost payments network, has long touted itself as a modern alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. Endorsements from the UN Capital Development Fund and partnerships with several major U.S. banks have propelled XRP to the third-largest crypto by market capitalization, now around $169 billion. Ripple’s introduction of RLUSD, a dollar-backed stablecoin, underscores its intent to capture a leading share in the fast-growing stablecoin sector. Over the past year, XRP has skyrocketed by 437%, setting its first new high in seven years at $3.65 on July 18, before pulling back around 22.5% to its current $2.81, still far outpacing Bitcoin’s 100% gain over the period under examination. Currently holding a relative strength index (RSI) near 43, XRP has headroom for recovery after its 7% decline over the past week. The broader $4.24 trillion crypto market remains unchanged in the last 24 hours as a brief midweek selloff wraps up, cashing in on strong start-of-week rallies. Technical data highlights dual bull flag formations on XRP’s summer charts, which have yet to break out. With ETF approvals anticipated in mid-October, favorable news could lift XRP to the $5–$10 range, or even higher. Pi Network ($PI): Can the Mobile Mining Trailblazer Hit $1 Before Year-End? Pi Network changed the game by pioneering a mobile-friendly “tap-to-earn” mining model, allowing users to mine crypto without expensive hardware or high electricity costs. By simply opening the app and tapping once a day, users can participate in mining, dramatically lowering barriers for newcomers entering the crypto space. Pi’s RSI is sub-30, indicating the token is undervalued right now after recent selling. For investors who want to go long, this makes today a prime dip-buying opportunity. A falling wedge pattern identified earlier this year points to a potential breakout by December. Should sentiment improve, Pi could hit $1 by Christmas, reaching a seven-month high and quadrupling from its current price near $0.24. The Pi team is also currently deploying major updates, gradually ushering in version 23, a crucial milestone toward its long-awaited mainnet release. With its intuitive app interface and proprietary Layer 1 blockchain, Pi is strategically placed to capture market share as crypto adoption continues expanding globally. Cardano ($ADA): The Sustainable Smart Contract Platform Looking Toward 2026 Cardano ($ADA) continues to demonstrate resilience and investor trust through 2025, having risen 142% over the past year, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana alike. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is built on a philosophy of scientific research and energy efficiency, utilizing a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. Its approach has even influenced parts of Ethereum’s ongoing development roadmap. Now capitalizing roughly $30 billion, ADA would need to triple in price to challenge Solana and mount a serious challenge to Ethereum’s dominance. Trading near $0.814 today, ADA has gained 0.5% in the past hour as it looks set to lead a market rebound. Supportive macro and policy trends could drive it toward $1.50 by fall and potentially move to challenge its $3.09 ATH by year’s end. Even without major regulatory breakthroughs, continued steady growth could still see ADA reach $2 within the same timeframe. Additionally, from a technical standpoint, ADA formed a bullish flag pattern over the summer, typically a precursor to large upward moves. The token looked set to break out at the end of summer but lost its steam in a generally bearish September. Key resistance sits near $1.15, with solid support established between $0.85 and $0.90. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The Meme-Driven Bitcoin Layer-2 to Watch in 2025 Finally, one of 2025’s most exciting newcomers, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , is quickly drawing tens of millions in presale investments by enhancing Bitcoin’s scalability and capability with a proprietary Layer-2 protocol inspired by the viral energy of meme culture. The HYPER presale has already netted around $23 million, with analysts predicting potential 10x+ returns post-launch. Built using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER delivers high-functionality smart contracts, low-cost and high-speed transactions, and a Canonical Bridge for near-instant Bitcoin transfers, dApp compatibility, and integrated meme token functionality. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed zero vulnerabilities, strengthening investor confidence. The HYPER token fuels the platform’s ecosystem, powering governance, staking, and transaction fees. Early investors can earn up to 51% APY through staking while enjoying DAO voting rights. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

As U.S. regulators move closer to rolling out comprehensive frameworks to strengthen domestic crypto activity, DeepSeek’s data-driven dreams could come to fruition… XRP ($XRP): DeepSeek AI Sees Path to $10 by Year-End DeepSeek anticipates that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could reach $10 before the end of the year, representing a nearly fourfold increase from its present price, $2.82. Now in its thirteenth year, the cross-border payment token has continued to show strong resilience. Following Ripple’s courtroom win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after a drawn-out five-year dispute, investor confidence surged, sending XRP to $3.65 on July 18, its first new all-time high since 2017. According to DeepSeek, should XRP decisively move beyond that July peak, the token could realistically surpass $10 by January, assuming favorable macroeconomic and regulatory developments. Over the past 12 months, XRP has appreciated by 437%, making it the strongest-performing non-stablecoin among top crypto assets. For comparison, Bitcoin rose 100%, while Ethereum gained 82% over the same period. Technical data reveals three separate bullish flag formations throughout 2025, two of which appeared this summer, signaling a potential breakout as the year winds down. Market watchers now anticipate that October’s seasonally bullish pattern, coupled with pending ETF approvals and the potential for a comprehensive crypto legislative framework in the U.S., could act as major upward catalysts. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): DeepSeek Sees Potential 8× Upside Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) is Dogecoin’s closest rival, now capitalizing $7 billion of the market. Currently trading at $0.00001203, SHIB remains virtually unchanged in the last 24 hours, mirroring the broader market’s stasis. From a technical perspective, SHIB has not yet broken out of either a falling wedge or a bullish flag pattern this year. Surpassing the sticky $0.000025 level by November could pave the way for DeepSeek’s ambitious year-end price range of $0.00005 to $0.0001, just over 8x its current value. Beyond its meme-driven origins, Shiba Inu offers real-world functionality via Shibarium, the project’s Layer-2 network that delivers fast, low-cost transactions, decentralized applications, and enhanced privacy, differentiating SHIB from competing meme assets. Dogecoin ($DOGE): DeepSeek AI Thinks Doge Can Blast Past Traditional $1 Target Originally launched as a parody in 2013, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into a top-10 cryptocurrency, boasting a $38 billion market cap within the $80 billion meme coin sector. Its long-standing success stems from a passionate community and increasing use in real-world payments. Although Dogecoin’s price often tracks Bitcoin’s trends, its deep liquidity and loyal retail following have allowed it to withstand several market downturns. Currently priced near $0.25, DOGE has more than doubled in value over the past year, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. With its RSI hovering around 50 and trending upward, the data suggests growing investor accumulation. Over the last 24 hours, DOGE actually gained 1.1%, beating out leading coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, all of which shed 1%. Chart patterns also highlight multiple bullish patterns forming over 2025, a potential indicator of a major upside breakout. DeepSeek estimates that DOGE could close the year between $1.50 and $3, although its upper bound is a real stretch target, considering Dogecoin peaked during the 2021 bull run at $0.7316. A run up to $0.50 is achievable in normal market conditions, with $1.50 standing as a reasonable bull target. Adoption trends also continue to strengthen: Tesla still accepts DOGE for merchandise purchases, while PayPal and Revolut now support Dogecoin transactions within their payment ecosystems. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin Riding a Wave of Community Excitement Although DeepSeek AI’s forecasts primarily focus on leading established tokens, a newer entrant, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , is gaining notable traction within meme coin circles, having already secured over $2.8 million in early presale funding. Promoted as Dogecoin’s wilder, more speculative cousin, Maxi Doge embraces his degen identity while celebrating both fitness culture and meme-powered virality. After years of living in Dogecoin’s shadow, MAXI is carving out his own brand with high energy and unapologetic flair. Built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, MAXI encourages active participation through Telegram and Discord communities, trading competitions, and upcoming strategic partnerships. Out of 150.24 billion total tokens, 25 percent are allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” which will be used for marketing, collaborations, and community growth. Staking is live during the presale, offering up to 119% APY, though returns diminish as the number of stakers rises. Presale tokens are currently priced at 0.0002615 dollars, with incremental increases as fundraising milestones are met. Investors can participate using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

The meme coin is now expected to rise by 40% should buying pressure increase, as market structure and on-chain data suggest an early parabolic formation. This surge is a reflection of the DOGE past pre-breakout stages of the earlier bull cycles. Interestingly, as DOGE plan its next upward leg, MAGACOIN FINANCE has come into the spotlight as another competitor, with over 500% ROI potentia l. Dogecoin Price Holds $0.24 Support Dogecoin price is holding above the weekly support level of $0.24, indicating stability in the volatile market. Technical analysts noted DOGE recorded higher lows since June 2025, confirming its bullish structure. This support is a launchpad to the past rallies and the present arrangement is an indication that buyers are back in charge. In the market data, it is shown that exchange reserves have declined by almost $23 million worth of DOGE traded out of key trading hubs. Historically, these outflows are associated with periods of whale accumulations as huge investors transfer holdings into cold storage. The trend reflects growing conviction that Dogecoin may be preparing for another sharp move higher. DOGE Inflow/Outflow Chart | Source: Coinglass Meanwhile, volume trends continue to support the bullish case. On-chain activity shows consistent inflows to non-exchange wallets and steady liquidity retention near current levels. If Dogecoin maintains its support above $0.24, analysts anticipate a breakout toward $0.30 , marking a 40% upside move in the near term. Sustained momentum above that range could extend gains toward the 2021 highs over the coming months. Smart Money Signals $0.30 Breakout Technical structures on the 4-hour DOGEUSDT chart indicate a strong reversal setup. Multiple Breaks of Structure (BOS) and Changes of Character (CHoCH) confirm that buyers are gradually reclaiming market dominance. Analysts identify repeating fractal wave patterns consistent with Dogecoin’s past parabolic cycles. DOGEUSD 4-Hr Chart | Source: TradingView These formations suggest that once DOGE clears the $0.30 barrier, the next resistance may not appear until $0.45–$0.50. Furthermore, smart money accumulation continues to build. Volume profile data shows that institutional-scale wallets and experienced traders are entering positions during every dip, taking advantage of consolidation phases. The trendline breakout from Dogecoin’s long-term downtrend has also been confirmed through multiple retests. Analysts highlight that such accumulation patterns often precede extended rallies in assets like DOGE. As these structural signals strengthen, traders expect the meme-coin to spearhead the next bullish wave. Similarly, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the top “smart money” picks of the quarter, showing comparable accumulation among large crypto wallets. MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops Analyst Picks in Q4 MAGACOIN FINANCE presale is one of the most successful launches of 2025. The project, which is a multi-stage presale, is based on the Ethereum network and gives early adopters a chance to have discounted access to the altcoin before exchange launches in Q4 2025 . Its clear roadmap, proven presale platform and rising community traction are regarded by analysts as strong signs of legitimacy and sustainability. Therefore, MAGACOIN FINANCE price trend in 2025 continues to attract a lot of optimism among industry experts. The initial comparisons to Shiba Inu and DOGE breakout years are creating investor confidence that MAGACOIN FINANCE will be able to give 500X ROI as soon as the exchange trading begins. Analyst reports highlight that the prelaunch amount of presales is generally not this large, which demonstrates that the project has strong credibility. Its design compensates early adopters and has fair distribution, appealing to both retail and institutional investors. Conclusion The fact that Dogecoin remains above $0.24 and that its exchange outflows are at $23 million is a solid turning point for bullish traders. Analysts estimate a 40% rally towards $0.30 in case the momentum accelerates, which is in line with repetitive technical and on-chain signals. Simultaneously, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming an opportunity with 500x ROI , attracting the attention of smart money and resembling the initial Dogecoin hype.

Analyst Charts Path To $0.60,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/is-the-dogecoin-low-chart-path-to-0-60/,"Dogecoin’s structure “is still trying to turn around,” according to a market technician More Crypto Online who argues that both the higher-time-frame and intraday counts now permit a constructive path toward $0.60—provided a handful of support and breakout thresholds hold. In a new video, the analyst describes a market that is “printing higher highs and higher lows,” but cautions that the advance is “choppy, slow… boring and very fragile,” language that underscores how conditional the bullish setup remains. Dogecoin Breakout Loading On the daily chart, the crux of the thesis is the integrity of August’s corrective low, labeled as the wave-2 pivot. “From a daily chart point of view [price] should really… ideally hold above the wave 2 low that formed here in August,” the analyst says, calling that local invalidation line at $0.189. A decisive violation would force a re-marking of the larger structure: “If we break below this red line, the idea that a B-wave bottomed in June will have to be revised.” Even so, the commentator preserves a secondary bullish path, noting that an extended B-wave could still be in play as “a broader A-B-C structure,” with the market attempting another reversal “from the lower support area” thereafter. Related Reading: Is It Too Late To Buy Dogecoin? 3 Analysts Reveal What’s Next Upside conviction rotates around September’s swing high. “Once we break above the last swing high from September, we might be on our way to $0.49+,” the analyst says. That level functions as the first high-time-frame gateway: a clean breach would confirm that the move out of the September trough has transitioned from corrective to impulsive character, validating the notion that June’s B-wave low has already printed. The lower-time-frame evidence is doing some heavy lifting. On the one-hour chart, price action out of the late-September base is described as a motive sequence: “The move to the upside from the September low appears to be a five-wave move up. This allows for the interpretation that we have already bottomed in the B-wave.” The decline from the September 13 local high is, in contrast, framed as a completed three-leg retracement. If that count holds, the present pullback should remain corrective and terminate above clearly defined micro levels: “Upper micro support is between $0.23 and $0.245 with an additional key level… at $0.233,” the analyst notes. The condition is crisp: “Ideally we’re holding above $0.23 in this pullback. If we see an impulsive reaction from here to the upside, then this could be the beginning of a third-wave rally up.” Related Reading: Rounded Bottom Formation Shows When Dogecoin Price Will Begin ‘Flying’ Risk management and location remain central. The broader support shelf that cushioned September’s local bottom sits above the daily invalidation line and is expected to remain active on any deeper shakeout: “This support area is still relevant… we might get another test… probably in the area around $0.21 to $0.20,” the analyst says, adding that this band nests within the larger $0.227–$0.20 zone. Lose $0.23 decisively and “it increases the probabilities that we are still caught in this B-wave,” he warns—a shift that would postpone, not nullify, the bullish roadmap so long as $0.189 endures. What would carry Dogecoin beyond $0.49 toward the headline target of $0.60? The blueprint the analyst lays out implies an impulsive third-wave advance once micro support holds and September’s swing high gives way. In classical Elliott terms, a confirmed third wave often stretches beyond the initial motive leg, and the technician explicitly flags the setup: “If we see an impulsive reaction… this could be the beginning of a third-wave rally up.” Moreover, the $0.49 handle—identified as the first destination after a breakout—would be a staging area rather than a terminus. After a fourth wave correction, DOGE could start a fifth wave which the analyst places in the $0.60 region. The message, however, is emphatically conditional rather than euphoric. “It’s always important to zoom out,” the analyst reminds viewers, stressing that while Dogecoin is “moving up step by step slowly,” the advance is not yet an emphatic impulse. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.25.

At the same time, new data shows that corporate XRP treasuries have climbed above $11.5 billion following a fresh purchase from Reliance Global. Ripple Expands Into Bahrain, Strengthening Its Middle East Presence According to the press release , Ripple has entered the Kingdom of Bahrain through a new partnership with Bahrain Fintech Bay (BFB), the country’s leading fintech incubator and ecosystem builder. Ripple and Bahrain Fintech Bay plan to run accelerator activities and take part in local events to boost blockchain innovation across the country. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, said Bahrain was one of the first jurisdictions in the world to regulate crypto assets. According to Merrick, Ripple aims to help strengthen the local blockchain industry in Bahrain and eventually introduce its custody solution and Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin to financial institutions in the country. Suzy Al Zeerah, Chief Operating Officer at Bahrain Fintech Bay, described the collaboration as a key step in connecting global innovators with Bahrain’s financial ecosystem. Ripple currently holds more than 60 regulatory licenses and registrations worldwide, including its DFSA license from March 2025, making it the first blockchain-enabled payments provider licensed by the Dubai Financial Services Authority. Ripple is taking part in Fintech Forward 2025 in Sakhir on October 8 and 9, an event organized by Economist Impact that will bring together key players from banking, fintech, and government. XRP Treasuries Cross $11.5 Billion as Corporate Adoption Surges Corporate interest in XRP continues to rise as large firms add the token to their balance sheets. According to corporate disclosures compiled by Crypto Treasury Tracker, combined XRP holdings across institutions in the U.S. and Japan now total more than $11.5 billion, showing a significant rise in blockchain-based asset adoption. The growth follows Reliance Global’s purchase of $17 million in XRP, which the company disclosed in a filing with the SEC on September 30, 2025. SBI Holdings leads global XRP holdings with around $10.4 billion in reserves. Other notable corporate treasuries include Trident Digital, which plans to raise $500 million for XRP reserves, and Webus International, which filed with the SEC for a $300 million XRP-focused treasury. In Japan, Gumi Inc. allocated $13.5 million of its $38 million raise to XRP under its Digital Asset Treasury initiative, while VivoPower added $19 million to its holdings. Companies are turning to XRP for its fast settlement time, low transaction cost, and ability to improve cross-border liquidity. Adding to the momentum, a well-known finance bull on X shared that Ripple won “Best Initiative with Digital Currencies” at the PAY360 Awards, calling it a significant recognition of XRP’s real-world utility.",XRP|ripple|Ripple news XRP Ledger|XRP Ledger Adoption|XRP Ledger news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-10 23:00:15

Multiple sources allegedly told FOX Business’ Charles Gasparino that the conversation has picked up in recent weeks. They say the Trump team is treating it like a real option, though perhaps for the tenth time this year. The crypto community’s beloved CZ ran into trouble with the feds back in 2023. He cut a plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice, admitting guilt to money laundering charges, which also forced him to step down as CEO and cost Binance a massive $4.3 billion in fines. On top of that, CZ personally had to cough up $50 million and serve four months in prison. He got sentenced in April 2024, did time at a low-security federal prison in California, then finished up at a halfway house. He got out in September 2024. Trump’s team pushes back on crypto crackdown According to Charles, many inside Trump’s circle think CZ got railroaded. They’re calling it political, part of what they describe as the Biden administration’s war on crypto. The pardon idea fits into a bigger plan most of them have been pushing all year: a hard pivot toward pro-crypto policies. They believe the former administration deliberately treated crypto leaders like criminals instead of innovators. Even some critics of Binance think the government went overboard. The original case claimed CZ let the exchange process illegal transactions, including those involving sanctioned parties, and failed to set up strong anti-money-laundering systems. But whether the punishment fits the crime has always been a hot topic. Some argue that CZ was made into an example during an election season. CZ still owns the biggest single stake in Binance. A pardon could bring him back into formal leadership. He started the company in 2017, and under his watch it became the world’s largest place to trade Bitcoin and other cryptos. Right now, he’s not in charge, but his influence remains strong behind the scenes. A cleared name would change everything. Still, nothing moves fast in Trump world. His attention is stretched across several global fights: Ukraine, Gaza, and even China, where trade tensions are flaring up again. People familiar with how clemency decisions are made say they often take longer than expected, especially with this kind of case. Get seen where it counts.

These three altcoins are all in positions where they could rally strongly very soon, with each boasting strong fundamentals that will support longer term increases. We’ll examine these three in the following article, while we’ll also be discussing a new token that is showing enough potential to surge when it lists later in the year. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Bullish Fundamentals and Oversold Technicals Predict Big Incoming Rally Despite having crept up to $2.82 in the past few hours, XRP remains down by 7% in a week and by 5% in a month. On the other hand, it boasts an impressive 435% increase in the past year, with the altcoin having been one of the chief beneficiaries of Donald Trump’s second term as U.S. President. Ripple has finally ended its long-running case with the SEC in recent months, freeing up the company to sign new partnerships, make acquisitions and expand into new territories. This has boosted demand for XRP, which will see another boost in the next few weeks, as the first XRP ETFs are likely to launch. It’s in this hugely positive environment that the coin finds itself in an oversold position, as highlighted by its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) indicators. Source: TradingView Because XRP has been oversold for a couple of months, it’s now overdue a big rebound, something which the launch of XRP ETFs could trigger. As such, we may see the coin reach $3.50 by the end of this month, while it could pass $5 in December. Crypto Price Prediction: BNB Coin ($BNB) – Bull Market Will Push Binance’s Token to New Highs BNB has dipped by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, yet its current price of $1,259 represents a 16% gain in a week and a 42% increase in month. Clearly, BNB is one of the market’s hottest top-100 coins at the moment, and it doesn’t look like the token will run out of steam anytime soon. Its indicators remain within bullish ranges, and while there’s an argument that it may be nearing overbought territory, this has been the case since late July. Source: TradingView And with the market likely to become even more positive in the next few weeks, as more altcoin ETFs come online, BNB is in a prime position to ride the wave. Because it’s the native token of Binance, the market’s biggest exchange (by quite some distance), it will directly benefit from any increase in trading activity. For this reason, it could reach $1,500 by the end of October, while it rise above $2,500 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Sui ($SUI) – Network Growth and Canary ETF Ready to Set Altcoin Alight SUI has risen to $3.46 in the past couple of hours, and while it’s down by 3.5% in the past week, it boasts a decent 9% increase in a fortnight. While SUI is up by 90% in a year, it remans 35% down from its all-time high of $5.35, which it set back in January. It therefore has some catching up to do, although the MOVE-based cryptocurrency (and Libra offshoot) has the fundamentals to retake and then eclipse its current ATH. Sui is currently the ninth-biggest blockchain in terms of total value locked in , which stands at $2.6 billion, having risen by 163% in the past year. It’s witnessing encouraging growth as a smart-contract platform, while its chart today suggests that a rebound may be coming soon. Source: TradingView Its MACD is about to turn positive, indicative of returning buying pressure, while it has also been trading within a bullish pennant. This pennant is close to a convergence point, implying that the SUI price could break out very soon. And with Canary planning to launch a SUI ETF , the altcoin could surge towards the end of year, with its target being a bullish $8. $1.8 Million Raised As PEPENODE Prepares to Launch Mine-to-Earn Platform As good as the tokens above look right now, traders may also want to diversify into smaller, newer tokens, since these can often outperform the market during bull rallies. This may include investing in presale coins, which often have the advantage of generating momentum prior to listing on exchanges. One such coin with lots of momentum is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has raised just over $1.7 million in its sale. Never Mine in the Dark. Let PEPENODE show you the light with the World’s first MINE-TO-EARN Memecoin. https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/U2B7p5W1XY — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 9, 2025 What’s interesting about PEPENODE is that it’s launching a mine-to-earn platform, which will provide users with the chance to run their own virtual mining rigs. Users can expand their rigs by buying new nodes with the PEPENODE token, with more nodes equalling greater rewards. The platform will pay rewards out in the form of other popular meme coins, such as Fartcoin and Pepe. This could provide a strong incentive to buy and hold PEPENODE, which investors can also stake. They can join the token’s presale by visiting the PEPENDOE website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. Visit the Official Pepenode Website Here PEPENODE is currently available at $0.0010962, although this price will rise every three days until the sale ends.

This decision puts Trump-connected capital next to the crypto empire of the Binance co-founder, who served a prison sentence in 2024. According to a statement released Friday, Dominari Securities, the investment banking arm of Dominari Holdings, is working directly with Hemi, a blockchain project built on top of Bitcoin, to increase the usage of the Hemi token. Dominari is involved at multiple levels. American Ventures, where Dominari holds the majority stake, also made a strategic investment in Hemi. The exact amount wasn’t made public. Dominari helps launch Tron, invests in Hemi, and links up with CZ’s circle Hemi, which just raised $15 million in fresh capital from backers like YZi Labs, Republic Digital, and Crypto.com, is now positioning itself as a key Bitcoin-layer solution with institutional interest. Co-founded by Matthew Roszak, a long-time crypto backer and close ally of CZ, the project is now tied into a wider political and financial web. Dominari’s headquarters sits inside Trump Tower in Manhattan, and the firm has played a visible role in deals tied to the former president’s circle. Its parent company brought in Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump as advisers. In June, the firm got involved with SRM Entertainment, a struggling toy company, and helped flip it into a new entity called Tron Inc. That firm plans to start accumulating TRX, the native token of Justin Sun’s Tron blockchain. Justin, too, has poured money into Trump-linked crypto projects and coins. CZ, who stepped down from Binance leadership after a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. regulators, served four months in prison. He’s publicly said he applied for a pardon. This partnership means Dominari is expanding beyond advising Trump-friendly ventures. It’s now funneling capital and institutional clout into projects that sit directly on Bitcoin’s base layer. The plan is to create access points for ETFs and regulated crypto exposure, but with roots in Trump-affiliated money and CZ’s post-Binance ecosystem.

In a recent post on X , Coach JV revealed that he stores his family’s earnings in these two digital assets, citing the consistent depreciation of the U.S. dollar as his primary motivation. He noted that the dollar has lost nearly all of its value over the past century, arguing that inflation continues to erode household savings year after year. The Case Against the U.S. Dollar According to Coach JV, inflation has stripped the U.S. dollar of about 96–97% of its purchasing power since 1913. This, he said, represents a gradual but damaging process that undermines long-term financial security. He contends that conventional money systems inherently lose value over time, whereas digital assets with capped supplies provide stronger preservation of wealth. Why do I store my family’s hard-earned money in XRP and Bitcoin? Because since 1913, the U.S. dollar has lost 96–97% of its purchasing power. Inflation silently robs you every single year. There’s only one way out of poverty, getruthlessly accountable and convert your earned… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) October 8, 2025 He emphasized that assets like XRP and Bitcoin operate on a fixed or limited-supply model, unlike fiat currencies that can be expanded without limit. This fundamental difference, in his view, allows these cryptocurrencies to maintain, and potentially increase, their value relative to the dollar. Limited Supply as a Hedge Against Inflation Coach JV refers to Bitcoin and XRP as “fixed-supply, deflationary assets” that resist inflationary pressures. Bitcoin’s total supply is capped at 21 million coins, while XRP’s is fixed at 100 billion tokens. By contrast, central banks can create new currency indefinitely, contributing to steady declines in real value over time. Statistical comparisons illustrate this point. Over the past decade, the U.S. dollar has lost roughly 37% of its value due to average inflation of 3.2% per year. In real terms, $10,000 in 2015 now has the same purchasing power as about $7,300 in 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has surged from around $600 in October 2015 to about $126,000 in October 2025, an increase that exceeds 20,000%. XRP’s growth over the same period has been even more striking, climbing from $0.0045 to roughly $3, representing a gain of more than 65,000%. Such performance, according to Coach JV, explains why more investors are choosing digital assets as a store of value rather than relying solely on fiat-based systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Growing Support for XRP and Bitcoin as Financial Havens Coach JV’s views echo a broader sentiment within the crypto community. Last month, market analyst Zach Rector projected that XRP could eventually reach $100 , citing weaknesses in the U.S. economy. Rector pointed to a decline in job creation, higher unemployment, and persistent inflation as signs that investors are losing confidence in traditional markets. He added that recent discussions at the Federal Reserve regarding potential interest rate cuts could further boost interest in cryptocurrencies. Historical data support this perspective. XRP rallied by 580% following the 2016 U.S. election, with similar upward movements observed in assets like XLM and HBAR during comparable macroeconomic shifts. In May, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also predicted significant long-term upside for Bitcoin, estimating that its price could reach $1 million by 2028. Hayes based his outlook on weakening U.S. Treasury demand and growing financial fragmentation worldwide, factors he believes will push investors toward borderless digital assets like Bitcoin. Concluding his remarks, Coach JV underscored his personal priorities: “God, family, and protecting your ecosystem at all costs.” He encouraged his audience to take proactive steps in managing and preserving their wealth, particularly as global inflation and economic uncertainty continue to challenge traditional financial systems. For him, Bitcoin and XRP represent more than investment vehicles; they are instruments of financial protection designed to safeguard family assets from the slow erosion of value caused by inflation and monetary expansion.

According to a recent press release, the company has already acquired 2 million SOL , valued at over $440 million , and appears poised to continue adding aggressively to its position. “By utilizing Coinbase’s suite of products, STSS can enjoy the institutional-grade infrastructure, deep liquidity, and competitive pricing required to effectively manage a leading Solana treasury,” commented the head of the company, James Zhang. Through Coinbase, they will also be able to stake Solana to earn yield on their investment. As of today, the staking rewards for this token sit at 6.8%, meaning that its treasury could produce up to $30 million per year. Solana Price Prediction: Ascending Price Channel Favors Bullish Outlook for SOL The daily chart shows SOL is trading within an ascending price channel, a classic bullish setup that supports the case for a Solana price prediction targeting $270 in the short term — and potentially new highs once it breaks above its January all-time high. The $210 level stands out as a key demand zone, backed by both previous highs and trend line support. If SOL pulls back to this area and bounces with volume, it could trigger a breakout toward $270 , followed by a stronger move to $300 . Looking ahead, as institutional adoption accelerates and Wall Street continues to embrace Solana , the long-term target could reach $600 — a 172% gain from current levels. While Solana leads among large caps, the best crypto presales could deliver even bigger returns this cycle. One of the most promising contenders is SUBBD ($SUBBD) , a decentralized content platform that’s raising money at the presale stage.

Bybit, Binance, and other major exchanges do. The now-trending perp decentralized exchange Aster had also minted 8 billion ASTER tokens to a multisig. All these go to show how popular multisignature crypto wallets have become. Multisig wallets balance between security and joint custody of crypto assets. They are much harder to screw up compared to regular wallets, like MetaMask, Phantom, etc., which are single-signature by design. But multisigs are not without some risks. Earlier this year, Bybit lost $1.5 billion to hackers, and UXLINK recently lost $11.3 million , all of which was a result of compromised multisig wallets. Starting with a breakdown of what multisig wallets are and how they work, we’ll show you the upsides and downsides of using one, and some of the best multisig wallets in 2025. Multisig Wallet Definition Multisig is short for multiple signatures. A multisignature crypto wallet is one that requires two or more signatures to sign off on a transaction. The way a Bitcoin multisig wallet works may differ from that of Ethereum multisig wallets or Solana multisig wallets. However, the idea of requiring multiple signatures to make a transaction remains the same. When you initiate a crypto transaction on-chain, a digital signature is required to prove your ownership. That signature is basically a mathematical construct of your Private Key and the hash of the transaction you are making. In the case of multisignature wallets, you will need more than one signature to send a transaction. The wallets are designed to allow multiple signers, each with their own unique private keys, to approve the transaction. Multisigs can be set such that a minimum or all of the signers are required to authorize a transfer from the wallet – more on this later in the article. How It Differs From Standard Wallets Standard wallets like Trust Wallet, Phantom, and MetaMask, including Ledger devices, function as single-signature wallets. That means they only require a single private key or signer to authorize a transaction from the wallet. Single-signature wallets are just perfect for personal use, interacting with dApps, daily transactions, and holding small amounts. On the other hand, multi-signature wallets require many signers. No one signer can fully confirm a transaction without the other, which removes the single point of failure in regular wallets. That is why multisigs are the preferred choice for crypto firm and institutions that manages large crypto treasuries. Individual investors can also decide to use multisigs, especially when dealing with a large amount of money, only that it adds an extra layer of friction where you have to share and require another signature from a trusted third party to spend your money. Analogy With Traditional Bank Signatures The concept of signature in crypto is not entirely new. One can even argue that it’s borrowed from traditional banking. Your handwritten signature does the same work as a cryptographic signature, which is to authorize transactions. For instance, when signing a cheque, you are telling the bank, “I authorize you to write this change (debit) on my account.” The teller then compares the signature to the one on file. If verified, the bank accepts the cheque, and the transaction is written permanently into its records. Traditional banks also have their own system for distributing control to eliminate a single point of failure, i.e., multisig. In joint and corporate accounts, banks can be instructed to require the signatories of some or all authorized persons before greenlighting a payment. How Do Multisig Wallets Work? Multisig wallets work very differently from regular wallets and are more technical to set up. But we can break it down into three segments, which shall include the public/private key generation, setting of the M-of-N threshold, and then the transaction authorization process. Public and Private Keys in Multisig During the setup, each participants first create their own standard private key, which is used by the wallet software to calculate their corresponding public key. Using a script/smart contract, the wallet owners then merge their public keys and agree on the M-of-N configuration on how many keys should be required to sign a transaction. The script is then used to generate the multisig receiving address, where the funds are sent. M-of-N Signature Model The M-of-N signature model is the configuration used to decide the number of keys that are required to send a transaction from multisig wallets. The N represents the total number of keys that can sign a transaction, while the M represents the minimum number of signatures required to validate a transaction. There are three types of multisig wallets based on this model: 1-of-2 Two public keys are paired in this type of multisig wallet, but only one is required to sign a transaction. Such wallets are best suited for personal portfolio management or shared access between two trusted parties. 2-of-3 Only two signatures out of three total keys are required to make transactions from this multisig wallet. In the case of one key loss, the funds can still be accessed. 3-of-5 Multisigs of this type required a minimum of three out of the five total keys. You could still access your funds even if you lost two private keys. N-of-N Multisig wallets can also be set to require all key holders to sign a transaction. In numbers, it would look like this: “2-of-2.” If a dApp with two co-founders sets up a multisig wallet with such a configuration, this means that both founders would have to sign every time a transaction is initiated from the wallet. But this is a risky practice, given that access to the wallet may be impossible if one of the founders loses their private key. Transaction Authorization Process The process of authorizing a transaction from a multisig involves the initiator and the signers, all of whom are key holders of the wallet. In the case of a 3-of-5 multisignature crypto wallet, when one of the key holders initiates a transaction to send, e.g., 1 BTC to another address, it remains pending and is passed to the other key holders, with only two signatures needed to authorize the transfer. The other holders verify the details of the transaction and then add their signature, which goes to show they are aware and approve of the transfer. Once the transaction has collected a total of three signatures from the key holders (the initiator and two signers), it is then marked as fully authorized and broadcast to the network. Benefits of Multisig Wallets There are some good reasons why crypto firms and security-conscious investors choose to use multisignature wallets over standard wallets. 1. Enhanced Security Against Hacks Requiring many signatures adds an extra layer of security to crypto wallets. Multisigs enforce a system where no single individual can move funds in the wallet, which removes the single point of failure inherent in regular crypto wallets. So, if hackers manage to gain access to one of the private keys, they cannot do much with it. With some wallets, you have the option to remove the compromised key, replace it, or add new key holders. 2. Protection Against Key Loss With threshold signature wallets like 1-of-2, 2-of-3, etc., you can still access your crypto assets even with a key loss. This is unlike Phantom, MetaMask, and other single-signature wallets, where losing your one private key makes your assets impossible to recover. 3. Shared Control for Teams and Organizations The M-of-N configuration of multisig wallets is ideal for shared control, which is why it is very common among teams and firms. With it, no single person is a custodian of the funds, and no transaction would be processed without the knowledge of other team members enlisted as key holders. 4. Governance and Trust in DAOs Multisig wallets are usually how Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) get to manage their crypto treasury transparently and trustlessly. The community doesn’t have to trust that one key holder acts in good faith and not run away with their funds. Also, the DAO’s funds remain “SAFU” even if one key holder acts maliciously or becomes unavailable. Risks and Limitations of Multisig Wallets Despite having fantastic security benefits, there are a few limitations or downsides to using a multisignature wallet. 1. Complexity in Setup and Use From our breakdown earlier, you will agree that setting up and using multisig wallets can be complex. It’s usually technical, and that’s why many don’t recommend it for beginners or simple day-to-day spending. 2. Potential Delays in Transaction Approvals The fact that multiple signatures are required to make a transaction presents its own problem. You can make a payment with just a few clicks on single-signature wallets, but multisigs require a certain number of key holders to review and approve the transaction, which delays processing time. 3. Smart Contract or Software Bugs The wallet software is prone to bugs, which can be exploited to compromise the wallet. This was the cause of the $1.5 billion Bybit hack in February, where the exploiters musked a transaction UI to change the smart contract logic of the wallet, leading to the theft. 4. Limited Support Across Platforms Most multisig wallets are built for specific blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means a team or DAOs using a Bitcoin multisig, for instance, would need to set up a different wallet for crypto tokens based on Ethereum or Solana. Popular Use Cases for Multisig Wallets These are some of the popular cases where it makes more sense to use a multisig wallet. 1. Business and Institutional Funds Management Multisig setups like 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 make it easier for businesses and institutions to manage large crypto assets, in that a consensus must be reached among key executives before funds can be moved. 2. DAO Treasury Management Multisig wallets are how DAOs establish trustlessness and the safety of funds. Even if a key holder goes rogue, the community treasury remains intact. 3. Joint Crypto Accounts (Families, Partnerships) A 2-of-2 multisig wallet can be used by partners to collectively manage funds, where transactions can only be approved if/when both partners agree on it. 4. Escrow Services The 2-of-3 setup is usually employed for escrow services, involving a buyer, seller, and a mutually agreed-upon third-party arbitrator. If a dispute arises, the arbitrator intervenes to release funds to the right party. Examples of Leading Multisig Wallets in 2025 Below are some of the best multisig wallets in 2025 used by the top crypto companies and high-net-worth crypto profiles. 1. Gnosis Safe Gnosis Safe is now known as Safe. It is specifically built for the Ethereum ecosystem, meaning it can only be used to manage assets on the Ethereum blockchain, and other EVM-compatible chains can use it. 2. Casa Casa provides a multisig wallet for Bitcoin, often called vaults. It was co-founded by Jameson Lopp and also supports a few stablecoins. 3. Electrum Multisig Electrum Multisig is another Bitcoin-focused multi-signature wallet. It may not be the friendliest for beginner users, but it’s quite popular among Bitcoiners due to its compatibility with Ledger, Trezor, and other hardware wallets. 4. BitGo BitGo manages and also provides multisignature wallets for institutional clients using smart contracts on programmable networks like Ethereum. BitGo wallets support both multisignature and multi-party computation (MPC) signature schemes. Multisig vs Other Security Solutions Here is how multisig wallets compare with other wallet solutions like MPC, Ledger, and MetaMask. Multisig vs Single Private Key Wallets Most of the standard wallet is designed as single private key wallets, including hardware wallets. So, Ledger, Trezor, Trust Wallet, MetaMask, and so on, fall under this category. This means that they require one and only private key to sign off on a transaction. Multisigs like Casa, Safe, etc., can have more than one private key and require multiple signatures to approve a transaction. Multisig vs Hardware Wallets Although hardware wallets are under the single private key umbrella, they also vary from multisig counterparts in that they are physical devices. However, multisig wallets are usually smart contract-based software. Oftentimes, both can be combined to achieve optimal security. Multisig vs Multi-Party Computation (MPC) With multisignature wallets, a certain number of private keys are generated, which are used for signatures. But in MPC, only one private key is generated and is split into a certain number of encrypted shares held by multiple parties. The goal with MPC is to remove a single point of failure of a single private key, while still allowing transactions with a single signature. The Future of Multisig in Crypto Security Most crypto companies and teams use multisig crypto wallets, especially for the use cases mentioned earlier, like shared crypto wallets management, escrow, etc., and it will likely remain so. Integration With DeFi and DAOs Multisigs have become the gold standard for DAOs and DeFi teams to manage treasuries. Multi-signature solutions will be an ongoing practice in DeFi. Multisig + MPC Hybrid Solutions Multisig + MPC solutions could become popular in the future. We could see more firms adopt such hybrid solutions for high-frequency institutional operations. Growing Institutional Adoption Over the past few months, several organizations have announced plans for a digital asset treasury. As this continues, we could see more adoption of multisignature wallets across different networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.",Learn Crypto: Beginner Guides,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|WALLET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-10 23:40:59

The South American country’s government revealed the developments on Friday, indicating that a letter of intent has been signed for the project, that could be one of the most significant technology and energy infrastructure initiatives in the history of Argentina. The Argentina project fits into OpenAI’s growth strategy According to a Reuters article, the project will entail the development of a large-scale facility with a capacity of up to 500 megawatts meant to power advanced artificial intelligence computing. A government statement indicates this mega project will be structured under the country’s RIGI tax break initiative, which went into effect last year as an effort to attract foreign capital. In a social media post, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirmed the development, officially naming the project. “We are proud to announce plans to launch Stargate Argentina, an exciting new infrastructure project in partnership with one of the country’s leading energy companies, Sur Energy.” Altman. Altman also emphasized the project’s importance being the first of its kind ever to be developed in Latin America, a region which he described as “full of talent, creativity and ambition.” The announcement comes at a time the AI startup is experiencing exponential growth. OpenAI which now has 800 million weekly users for its ChatGPT service recently concluded a secondary share sale, solidifying its position as the world’s most valuable startup with a $500 billion valuation. Its recently launched AI-powered video generating tool, Sora is experiencing fastest growth within a week of its launch surpassing ChatGPT. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , Sora massive demand reaching 1 million downloads. Although its access is currently limited to the US and Canada on an invite only basis, market data shows that Sora saw 627,000 downloads on iOS downloads during its first seven days of availability while ChatGPT recorded 606,000 downloads in its first week. This growth also comes at a cost, high energy consumption. The colossal computational power needed to train and operate the startup’s AI models necessitates a global expansion of its AI infrastructure. The Argentina project also seem to be an instrumental part of that strategy. The development also come after the startup’s developer conference earlier this week, where OpenAI showed off a series of new partnerships with huge brands like Spotify, Zillow, and Mattel, together with a suite of new tools aimed at expanding its application ecosystem. As for the Argentina project, while the letter of intent represents the early stages, successful implementation of the project would provide a significant boost to Argentina’s economy and position the Latin American country as a critical hub for AI development in that region.

The meme coin now sits at a critical level, where the next move could either confirm a deeper correction or set up a high-conviction buy-the-dip opportunity. Whale wallets are clearly leaning bullish — the top 100 holders added over 2.7 trillion PEPE in the past week, according to Nansen . Still, short-term sentiment remains shaky, with CoinGlass reporting a 13.6% drop in open interest , showing a decline in speculative demand. Pepe Open Interest. Source: Coinglass. Those who remain engaged appear to be betting on a bounce, with the funding rate almost tripling to 0.0095 over the past 24 hours, suggesting traders are retaking long positions. Yet optimism persists among active traders. The funding rate has nearly tripled to 0.0095 in the past 24 hours, suggesting traders are retaking long positions amid the retest. Pepe Funding Rate. Source: Coinglass. PEPE Price Analysis: Deeper Slide or Bounce Ahead? Pepe now sits at a crucial confluence of support around $0.000009: a historical demand zone aligning with the lower boundary of a 7-month bullish pennant pattern. This level marks the final threshold before a breakdown, with momentum indicators signaling caution. The RSI has slipped below the neutral line, showing sellers in control, though a reversal around 40 could hint at buyers stepping back in. The MACD histogram paints a similar picture. While a death cross suggests downside risk, the narrow gap between the lines shows bearish momentum remains fragile. In a breakdown scenario, the next key support sits 40% lower at $0.0000055. However, with market participants positioning for a bounce, focus could shift back to a breakout. The key threshold remains the $0.0000125 supply zone. However, if momentum flips bullish, a bounce could put a breakout back in focus. The key threshold sits around a past supply zone at $0.0000125. Flipping this level into support would validate the pennant pattern and target a 215% move toward $0.000029. But under stronger demand with continued U.S. interest rate easing into 2026 and growing potential for TradFi exposure through ETFs, the rally could extend 430% to $0.00005.

The price has since entered a consolidation phase, hovering near the $120,000 level as traders search for fresh demand. Market sentiment remains divided — some analysts expect Bitcoin to stabilize and prepare for another leg up, while others warn of a possible drop below current levels as momentum cools. This raises the question that’s echoing across the market: Could this be the first truly different Bitcoin cycle? According to top analyst Darkfost, traditional patterns may not apply this time. “Some claim that a -80% to -90% bear market will occur as usual,” he explains, “but certain data points suggest that this cycle is being built on new foundations.” Unlike previous cycles driven by retail speculation, this one appears increasingly influenced by institutional participation, ETFs, and long-term holders, all contributing to reduced volatility and deeper market maturity . While corrections remain part of Bitcoin’s DNA, structural changes in demand and liquidity may be redefining how this cycle unfolds. Whether Bitcoin breaks higher or faces a major retracement, one thing is clear — this market is evolving faster than ever before. Bitcoin’s Fourth Cycle: A Stable and Mature Market Phase According to top analyst Darkfost, Bitcoin’s current cycle stands out as the most stable in its history. During this bullish phase, BTC has not experienced a single correction exceeding 28%, a stark contrast to previous cycles where violent retracements were common. Most drawdowns have remained within a modest 10%–20% range, and only four corrections have surpassed 25%, marking this as the least volatile Bitcoin cycle so far. For perspective, between 2020 and 2022, Bitcoin endured multiple 50% drawdowns, creating sharp waves of fear and euphoria that defined the market’s rhythm. Today, the picture is very different. Volatility has dropped to its lowest levels since the last bear market, reflecting a new level of market maturity. As Darkfost points out, this decline in volatility has also led to a tightening of the Bollinger Bands’ standard deviation, signaling growing price stability and disciplined market behavior. This shift suggests that Bitcoin’s market structure has fundamentally evolved. It no longer mirrors the chaotic, retail-driven cycles of the past. Instead, adoption continues to climb, regulation has become more favorable, and, most importantly, the investor base is changing. Large institutional players and corporate treasuries — particularly in the United States — are entering the market, absorbing selling pressure that once triggered deep corrections. As a result, Bitcoin’s fourth cycle is rewriting the rulebook, built on deeper liquidity, stronger hands, and long-term conviction rather than speculation. This may be the first cycle where Bitcoin transitions from a volatile asset to a globally recognized, maturing store of value. Price Consolidation Continues Around $121K Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $121,800, consolidating after a volatile week that saw strong resistance near the $126,000 all-time high. The 4-hour chart shows that BTC is moving sideways within a narrow range, struggling to reclaim the short-term 50 EMA (blue line), which has now turned into dynamic resistance. The immediate support level sits near $120,000, while the key horizontal level at $117,500 — highlighted in yellow — remains the most crucial zone to maintain the broader bullish structure. As long as the price holds above this area, the uptrend remains intact, with potential for a renewed push toward the $124,000–$126,000 zone. Momentum indicators suggest that buyers are still defending critical support, though market indecision dominates. The 100 and 200 EMAs (green and red lines) continue trending upward, reinforcing mid- and long-term bullish sentiment. However, failure to close above $122,500 in the coming sessions could expose Bitcoin to deeper retracements, with eyes on $118,000 as the next demand area. The chart suggests a healthy consolidation phase after a major breakout. A decisive move above $123K would confirm renewed bullish momentum, while a breakdown below $120K could mark the beginning of a deeper correction phase.

His comments follow recent market turbulence that saw XRP lose ground while other major cryptocurrencies posted stronger performances. Over the past week, Bitcoin and BNB briefly rallied before the momentum cooled across the market. XRP, however, failed to keep pace, struggling to maintain its position above the $3 threshold. At the time of reporting, the token trades near $2.79, reflecting a mild correction alongside the broader market decline. Market Uncertainty This retracement has sparked renewed concern among retail traders. According to recent on-chain data from Santiment, sentiment toward XRP has reached its lowest level in six months. The growing unease reflects broader frustration among investors, as the token has lagged behind competitors during the latest market recovery phase. I don't understand those who are getting scared, all structures are still in place and XRP is just moving sideways. pic.twitter.com/44jkq6ASzr — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) October 8, 2025 However, analysts like Mr. Xoom argue that this negative sentiment is misplaced. In his latest market update, the chartist noted that XRP’s technical framework has not been compromised, describing the asset’s current position as a normal consolidation phase. He added that, from a structural perspective, XRP remains well-positioned for a potential continuation of its upward trend once current pressures subside. Key Technical Levels Identified To support his assessment, Mr. Xoom outlined several critical areas on XRP’s daily chart. His analysis identified three main zones of interest, two resistance levels, and one support region that define the token’s short-term trading outlook. The first resistance zone lies between $3.00 and $3.12, which he described as the immediate level to watch for a potential breakout. A successful move above this range could signal renewed bullish strength. Beyond that, the second resistance band, positioned between $3.52 and $3.62 , aligns with XRP’s July high near $3.66 and represents a key threshold before any move toward new all-time highs. On the downside, Mr. Xoom highlighted the $2.70–$2.72 region as a vital support level. This area has acted as a strong base in previous market cycles and currently forms the lower boundary of a descending triangle pattern visible on XRP’s daily chart. With the token still trading comfortably above this support, the analyst sees no indication of structural weakness. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Analyst Maintains Optimism Mr. Xoom reiterated that XRP would only enter a bearish phase if the price fell below the $2.70 support and closed decisively beneath that range. Until that happens, he maintains that the asset is simply consolidating within its established structure, waiting for the next directional move. In his view, many investors are misinterpreting short-term fluctuations as trend reversals, when in reality, XRP’s broader setup continues to mirror healthy technical behavior. With similar optimism, other market observers have urged investors not to overreact to XRP’s short-term underperformance. Market analyst Zach Rector, for example, recently addressed investor anxiety following BNB’s brief rise above XRP in market capitalization rankings. Rector reminded traders that despite temporary setbacks, XRP has still delivered impressive performance since the U.S. elections, recording gains of nearly 488% over the period. Overall, the consensus among seasoned analysts remains largely positive. While market sentiment has weakened and price action has turned sluggish, most experts agree that XRP’s long-term structure remains positive and its next major move will likely depend on broader market stability and renewed trading volume.

Once trapped under legal uncertainty, XRP has begun to reclaim attention thanks to favorable legal developments and the anticipated launch of Spot XRP ETFs. However, XRP’s current valuation is significantly below that of the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. But what if XRP were to rise to the same market capitalization as Bitcoin? Data from MarketCapOf offers a glimpse into how much each XRP token would be worth if it reached Bitcoin’s current market cap. Linking XRP’s Price With Bitcoin’s Market Cap Bitcoin’s market capitalization has reached heights that rival and even surpass some of the world’s largest multinational corporations. Notably, Bitcoin’s current market cap of $2.415 trillion places it shoulder to shoulder with tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is the eighth-biggest asset by market cap, just behind Silver and Amazon, and well ahead of Meta Platforms, Broadcom, and Saudi Aramco. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Why XRP Has Not Followed Bitcoin’s Trajectory In 7 Years, And Why Everything Is About To Change XRP is currently the third biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, but its market cap is far below Bitcoin’s lead. However, many analysts and market commentators believe XRP stands out as one of the few assets capable of challenging Bitcoin’s dominance. This belief originates from XRP’s alignment with traditional finance. Its established partnerships with banks and payment providers give it a practical use case that most cryptocurrencies do not have. At the time of writing, XRP has a market cap of $168 billion, not even up to one-tenth of Bitcoin’s market cap. According to MarketCapOf, if XRP were to reach Bitcoin’s current market cap, each token would be worth approximately $40.68. Given XRP’s circulating supply of about 53.4 billion tokens, this price prediction represents an increase of over 14,000% or 14.35x, from its current level of around $2.8. In practical terms, an early investor holding just 1,000 XRP today would see their holdings valued at more than $40,000 under this scenario. What This Means For XRP Holders The comparison provides a valuable perspective on XRP’s long-term potential and the scale of value transfer possible within the crypto market. It also shows how far XRP needs to go in order to reach Bitcoin’s current level. Related Reading: XRP Could Mirror 2017 Style Surge: Here’s How High The Price Will Go If It Happens Bitcoin’s dominance today is due to its first-mover advantage and its acceptance as a store of value. However, XRP is growing in remittances and real-world asset tokenization, and Ripple’s stakeholders are working to challenge SWIFT. This gives the cryptocurrency a utility foundation that could cause the growth of its market share. If Ripple continues to secure partnerships with central banks, payment providers, and institutional investors, as Ripple has increasingly done in regions like the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, then the idea of XRP closing even a fraction of the gap with Bitcoin becomes less far-fetched. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.83. Another factor that could contribute to this projected price growth is if Spot XRP ETFs are launched in the US and they perform well.

In an X post on October 10, Russell Vought, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, confirmed that “RIFs” — short for reductions in force — have officially commenced. The administration had previously warned that such measures could be implemented across federal agencies. Regarding the layoff, the White House did not state the exact number of federal employees to be affected by the layoff. However, officials hinted at departments that would be affected. This includes departments such as Treasury and Health. These widespread layoffs have raised concerns among individuals as they anticipate that they might significantly increase the economic-related risks associated with the government shutdown . During usual shutdowns, federal employees labeled as non-essential go on furlough and can receive payment for their lost wages once funding resumes. Trump’s decision to lay off federal workers raises heated debates among individuals Earlier, Trump made public his intention to permanently terminate federal employees from the workforce and threatened workers who were furloughed that they would not receive back pay. The president’s statement has worsened the shutdown’s effects on government employees and the economies they support. Vought, who offered assistance in writing the Project 2025 plan for Republicans to gain control of the White House, strongly advocated for reducing the number of federal workers and making changes to the federal government. On the other hand, Lee Saunders, the president of AFSCME, a powerful group representing government workers, referred to the mass firing as an illegal act and cautioned the Trump administration that implementing such an act could result in devastating effects. “Whether these federal employees are food inspectors, public safety workers, or perform many other public service roles that enable America to keep running, federal workers should not be used as pawns in this administration’s political games,” Saunders stated. He further mentioned that they will investigate every legal choice to stop the Trump administration’s illegal attacks on the rights and jobs of public service workers. Democrats have also commented on the situation. They swiftly criticized the layoffs, with Chuck Schumer, the Minority Leader of the United States Senate, alleging that this is deliberate chaos in America. According to Schumer, the Trump administration has thoughtlessly decided to harm people — the workers who protect their nation, check their food, and offer help during emergencies. US Democrats call for an extension of health insurance subsidies Some Republicans also appeared uneasy about the move. Senator Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, said she strongly opposed Vought’s announcement and warned that it would hurt families in her state and elsewhere. The shutdown began on October 1, when Democrats declined to back a temporary proposed bill that Republicans had hoped would fund the government until late November. Concerning the proposed bill, Democrats pointed out that they would support it only if Republicans committed to negotiating an extension of health insurance subsidies, which are scheduled to expire at the end of the year, potentially increasing medical coverage costs for tens of millions of Americans. Additionally, some Republicans, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, a representative from Georgia, started to raise concerns about their party’s stance, stating that a solution for the expiring healthcare subsidies needs to be found. Greene shared an X post highlighting that Democrats created this problem in 2010, which worsened in 2021, while Republicans never addressed it. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has announced that he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China starting next month. In a post on social media, Trump stated that the US would also impose export controls on critical software. In an earlier post on Friday, he hit back at Beijing’s move this week to tighten its rules for exports of rare earths, accusing China of “becoming very hostile” and trying to hold the world “captive”. He threatened to withdraw from a meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping. He later said he had not cancelled it, but that he did not know “that we’re going to have it”.

ChainLink faced a sharp drop after traders dumped thousands of tokens, sparking fresh bearish sentiment. On the other hand, Stellar continues to fight within a downtrend, and its weak social buzz has scared off traders who fear another drop may be lurking around the corner. With so much uncertainty, the crypto crowd is scrambling to spot what could be the next big move. The market keeps proving that altcoins can flip direction faster than a penguin sliding on ice. Prices pump. Then dump. Then repeat. This is why crypto investors are shifting toward opportunities that offer real upside potential while also rewarding long-term believers. Many are asking one simple question. Where is the next breakout that can create real wealth instead of crumbs and peanuts? That is why meme coins keep dominating crypto conversations. Meme coins went from a joke to a financial revolution that turned small wallets into bull-powered moon rides. The hype cycle is back, and MoonBull has entered the arena at full speed. Most importantly, MoonBull Presale is live now, and it is cooking with insane growth potential. It offers structured tokenomics and real returns instead of empty promises. This new meme project has positioned itself as the best crypto to join in 2025 , and the window is still open, but not for long. MoonBull Presale Live Massive FOMO Opportunity for Early Investors MoonBull is cooking up one of the biggest, loudest, and most talked-about launches in the crypto space right now. The presale is pulling serious momentum, and crypto investors are lining up like kids outside a candy store. The hype is not just noise. There are strong numbers behind it. The presale is running across 23 stages, and Stage 4 is live now. The price per token at this stage is just 0.00005168, which still gives massive upside potential. MoonBull ($MOBU) is connected directly to the best crypto to join in 2025 narrative because it is still in early stages and offers real tokenomics that focus on sustainability. This is not just another meme coin blowing hot air. It brings auto liquidity, reflections, and deflationary burns. Every trade builds its token strength instead of weakening the chart. Over three hundred thousand dollars has already been raised, and over one thousand holders have jumped on board. Here is where things get crazy. The current ROI from Stage 4 to the future listing price of 0.00616 sits at 11,800%. That is not a typo. That is a bulls-smashing-through-walls type of growth. Here is a simple example. An investment of 25,000 dollars at the Stage 4 price would secure almost 484 million tokens. When the listing price is reached, that bag could potentially be worth just under 3 million dollars. That is not retirement money. That is freedom money. That is crypto island and supercar energy. The reason MoonBull can secure that type of growth is that the presale is first-come, first-served, and each stage increases the price. The clock is ticking. Once Stage 4 ends, Stage 5 goes live, and the price jumps again. Then again. Then again, until 23 stages are complete. MoonBull is built for FOMO, and right now it is delivering. Liquidity Through Staking Power that Pays Off MoonBull’s staking system gives buyers more than just a bag of coins. It unlocks a 95% APY at Stage 10. Rewards stack daily and holders keep full control over their tokens. This is liquidity staking that lets holders earn without freezing assets forever. Staking lets holders earn passive rewards while fueling price stability. Rewards come from a pool of 14.6 billion tokens that keeps payouts healthy and long-lasting. It encourages loyal holders and pushes long-term gains because more tokens are locked, which reduces market circulation. All of this makes MoonBull the best crypto to join in 2025 for early-stage potential. That claim is strong, and the proof is in the presale math. MoonBull is a movement. A meme with muscle. A bull that refuses to walk. It charges. It climbs. It smashes price ceilings on the way to orbit. Stellar Struggles While Bulls Wait For A Rebound Stellar has been one of the most useful blockchains in the payment and remittance industry. It has fast transactions and a strong utility use case. But price action does not care about fundamentals sometimes. The latest Stellar price prediction shows more room to fall. The XLM chart recently failed to complete a bullish flag pattern and fell below a major support zone. The downtrend started months ago and the market still has not seen a breakout. The latest XLM crypto news highlights another problem. Social buzz for Stellar has collapsed to weak levels. Trader interest has dipped heavily, and that signals low buying demand. That is dangerous because price pumps need hype. Without hype, a token becomes flat. This is what Stellar is facing today. Yes, long-term utility is strong, but short-term upside is crawling at a snail’s pace. Traders get bored with waiting and move their liquidity toward faster opportunities. That is why Stellar investors now keep their eyes on MoonBull, which has already become the best crypto to join in 2025 for those who want gains before the next Bitcoin halving cycle takes flight. Stellar might bounce one day, but it looks stuck in a slow lane while MoonBull is flying in the fast lane with nitro boosters. The choice is simple. Chase potential or wait on a hope. ChainLink Outlook Amid Selling Pressure and Market Volatility ChainLink has been one of the most trusted projects in the blockchain world due to its role as the leading oracle network. Yet recent LINK news today paints a shaky picture. ChainLink dropped sharply by about 4% in a single trading session after heavy institutional selling triggered panic among retail investors. The LINK price today recently touched a session low near 21 dollars, which marked its weakest level in days. This sudden reversal caught traders off guard as LINK had briefly pumped earlier in the week. Chainlink Reserve also purchased over 45K LINK tokens, but the market crash left the reserve sitting underwater. The average cost basis was above $23, and LINK is now trading below that mark. This means even the reserve is technically down, which does not boost investor confidence. Resistance levels are stacking up like bricks at 22.68 and 21.92, which shows that bullish pressure is getting slapped back fast by sellers. Market sentiment is still stuck in fear mode. Trading volumes jumped, but the price kept falling, which signals a bearish trend. Bears are not leaving the party yet, and LINK could tumble again if Bitcoin drags the market further down. Despite ChainLink being one of the more stable altcoins historically, it still cannot deliver the insane early growth potential compared to MoonBull, which is currently considered the best crypto to join in 2025, thanks to its explosive presale trajectory. That comparison matters. Investors who want strong upside returns usually chase presale gold mines before they explode. LINK might still be a long-term hold, but right now it feels more like watching a hippo swim slowly rather than a bull charge to freedom. Conclusion ChainLink and Stellar both sit at important phases in their journey. LINK fights selling pressure while XLM tries to recover from weak demand. Both projects carry long term value but neither delivers explosive growth in the near term. MoonBull breaks that pattern. The presale invites anyone searching for the best crypto to join in 2025 with a chance to enter before the price rockets stage by stage. MoonBull builds hype with solid tokenomics, staking rewards, referral bonuses, audit security, and a launch system that protects early holders. MoonBull is different and the numbers speak louder than words. MoonBull is rewriting the meme economy. The presale is live now and the window for the biggest returns is still open. Anyone who missed PEPE or Shiba Inu now has a second chance. Grab MoonBull today before it blasts off.

52965833,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=833352,1760142749,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52965833.jpeg,Apple sets sights on Prompt AI to supercharge smart home tech,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/apple-eyes-prompt-ai-to-boost-home-tech/,"Apple is reportedly in late-stage talks with the computer vision startup Prompt AI to acquire talent and technology that would help it upgrade its smart home devices and further enhance its position in the artificial intelligence market. First reported on by CNBC, the deal highlights Apple’s low-key but purposeful strategy of shaping its AI offerings through small acquisitions focused on buying talent rather than purchasing billion-dollar companies across the board. Leadership at Prompt AI informed employees during an all-hands meeting that they were nearing the finalization of talks with Apple. Some staff would move to Apple as part of the deal, the company said, and those who did not would receive a less generous salary package and be encouraged to apply for open positions at the iPhone maker. Before Apple entered final-stage talks, other proptech players, including xAI and Neuralink (which is coming from Elon Musk), had reportedly shown interest in acquiring Prompt AI, according to people familiar with the meeting. Yet Apple’s bid seemed to be the most strategically focused, with an emphasis on both the company’s technology and its research talent. Prompt AI was established in 2023 by veteran AI researcher Tete Xiao, who holds a PhD in computer science from UC Berkeley, and Trevor Darrell, a co-founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab. That same year, the startup raised a $5 million seed round led by AIX and Abstract Ventures. Xiao and Darrell are both respected figures in the AI community, known for their work in computer vision and deep learning — two areas where Apple has been quietly building its capabilities behind the scenes. Apple and the Prompt AI founders have not responded to requests for comment on the deal; however, sources familiar with it note that the acquisition is likely to close within the next few weeks. Apple eyes Prompt’s tech for home automation Seemour, the flagship app of Prompt AI, is certainly central to Apple’s attention. The app integrates with home security cameras and utilizes a sophisticated computer vision system to recognize specific individuals, pets, vehicles, and objects. It can send alerts, text messages, or answer users’ questions about what has been happening in front of the camera — a development that suggests a conversational interface for home monitoring. However, while a technical success, the prompt AI failed to find a sustainable business model. At a town hall meeting, Xiao reportedly informed staff that the app and all user data would be deleted to safeguard privacy. This aligns with Apple’s robust stance on privacy, making them a well-matched partner on a cultural and ethical level. Industry watchers believe that Apple will utilize Prompt’s technology for its HomeKit platform — the one behind devices such as light bulbs, thermostats, and security systems that run on Siri. That could potentially transform HomeKit from a largely reactive automation system into an intelligent home assistant that is responsive and intuitive — one capable of observing real-world activity and responding instantly to it. Apple has historically been acquisitive of small AI and vision startups, usually to integrate their work into forthcoming products. In 2020, it bought Xnor. AI, a startup that does edge AI processing, which later helped improve Apple’s on-device image recognition features. Apple’s subtle AI strategy gains focus Indeed, unlike rivals such as Google , Microsoft, and Meta, Apple has steered clear of splashy AI-focused purchases. And while it has made large acquisitions before, its biggest-ever deal is still the purchase of Beats Electronics for $3 billion in 2014. Rather, Apple has shown a preference for “acquihires” — strategic and tactical acquisitions made to soak up specialized talent and proprietary technology. Some analysts argue that this cautious approach has hindered Apple’s outward progress in generative AI. And its new “Apple Intelligence” suite — intended to deliver personalized, on-device AI functions to iPhones and Macs — has seen delays in rolling out and mixed early reviews. Apple’s stock is down just 2% this year, after being left behind by most major tech indices and competitors that have adopted their belief in AI.

This huge wave can legitimize Bitcoin at a global level. But while the crown prince in the market is BTC, smart investors are also eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an early-stage project with asymmetrical potential. Being a next-generation DeFi protocol built for real-world applications, Mutuum Finance has become one of the hottest presales of 2025. The project is presently at Phase 6 of its token sale for only $0.035 per token, with over 60% of the phase already sold out. More than 16,830 investors have collectively raised over $17.05 million. Mutuum Finance can outperform Bitcoin’s returns in the upcoming bull cycle, and therefore the time to purchase both now could be ideal. Bitcoin’s Path to a Central Bank Reserve Asset Deutsche Bank strategists already believe that Bitcoin is to be a part of central bank reserves by 2030, when its volatility dwindles and its price action more closely follows gold. Despite having no physical support by a commodity, the appeal of Bitcoin as a safe-haven vehicle for value is taking hold as central banks seek diversification and companies are placing BTC in their treasuries. The digital currency recently crossed $125,000, and with its comparative volatility diminishing in proportion to its rising price, the argument of analysts Marion Laboure and Camilla Siazon is that BTC will shortly be employed as a fresh pillar of economic security, just as gold was employed within the 20th century. And with Bitcoin’s strategic position in the global financial system to increase, the majority of investors are already looking ahead, to Mutuum Finance that could offer a much greater level of upside potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to be trendy as presale Phase 6 continues to create this much hype. Investor appetite still prevails, with over 16,830 investors investing in excess of $17.05 million, demonstrating that confidence in the long-term future and vision of the project in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector continues to rise. Mutuum Finance protocol relies on dynamic real-time Loan-to-Value (LTV) and real-time liquidation factors. These are adjusted in real-time depending on market condition. This kind of dynamic ability enables the possibility of actively hedging volatility and therefore the protocol is more resistant to volatile market conditions. Next-Generation Lending and Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance announced it would be launching its groundbreaking lending and borrowing protocol . The Version 1 of the protocol will launch on Sepolia Testnet Q4 2025, the first to announce with it an extensive range of primary functionalities such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. The protocol will be supported by ETH and USDT in the forms of borrowing, lending, and collateralization on day one, just like offering users a high-speed, efficient, and scalable experience within DeFi. Reserve multipliers also help to offer the system an extra layer of security, ranging from 10% for low-risk assets to 35% for risk assets, as an additional layer of security against the markets. MUTM collateral management is designed to maximize borrowing capacity and overall capital efficiency via synergetic leveraging of the correlated assets. Together, they minimize insolvency risk and offer a safe, stable, and sustainable DeFi lending experience. Rich DeFi Bet On The Horizon Along With Bitcoin Following Deutsche Bank’s predicting central banks to invest in Bitcoin (BTC), long-term belief in digital currencies is on the rise. Smart investors are also coming in to join Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a next-generation DeFi protocol with dual-layer borrowing, lending, and dynamic collateral management. Phase 6 presale tokens are at $0.035, over $17.05M raised, 16,830+ investors, and over 60% sold out. Its upcoming lending protocol on Sepolia Testnet, backed by ETH and USDT, offers secure, scalable, and efficient DeFi exposure. Stack MUTM now and be ready for the next bull cycle.

52966409,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85989,1760144402,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analyst: XRP Moving Like Amazon, Sets $27 Target",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-moving-like-amazon-sets-27-target/,"A respected market analyst known as ChartNerd has drawn parallels between XRP’s long-term price movement and Amazon’s early trading history, suggesting that the digital asset could be preparing for a significant upward breakout. In a recent market update, the analyst shared a comparative chart showing how Amazon’s price action between 1999 and 2009 mirrors XRP’s consolidation pattern from 2017 to 2025. Based on this historical correlation, he proposed that XRP may be entering the same pre-rally phase that preceded Amazon’s massive multi-year growth. Amazon’s Historical Pattern and XRP’s Current Setup According to ChartNerd’s assessment, Amazon’s stock peaked in 1999 before spending roughly a decade moving sideways in a prolonged consolidation phase. Once it broke above resistance in 2009, the company’s stock entered an extended rally that defined its long-term growth trajectory. $XRP 1. $AMZN 1999-2009 2. $XRP 2017-2025 Amazon placed an ATH in 1999 and had to wait just under 10 years before a whopping vertical climb above $20.. $XRP placed an ATH in 2017 and has had to wait 8 years to start breaking its ATH.. Yet I'm reaching with my $27 targets? pic.twitter.com/CtdryNC3TS — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 8, 2025 He compared this structure to XRP’s price behavior following its 2018 all-time high. For nearly eight years, XRP has traded below that level, repeatedly testing resistance without a clear breakout. The analyst noted that both assets share similar long-term accumulation patterns, with XRP’s key resistance area centered around the $3 mark. ChartNerd believes that once XRP closes decisively above this threshold, the market could see a sustained breakout phase similar to Amazon’s in 2009. He identified $27 as a realistic target based on the scale of prior consolidation and the projected extension of the current cycle. Why the $27 Projection Appears Reasonable The analyst emphasized that the projection is not merely speculative but rooted in historical price behavior. He explained that market cycles often repeat when similar technical conditions appear. Amazon’s breakout followed years of low volatility and steady accumulation, a setup he argues XRP now replicates. A move from XRP’s current range near $2.80 to $27 would represent nearly a 10-fold increase. ChartNerd suggested that such an advance, while ambitious, aligns with how previous major crypto assets have behaved once they overcame multi-year resistance levels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ChartNerd is not the only commentator expecting XRP to reach this level. Market analyst EGRAG recently reiterated a similar $27 forecast using long-term Fibonacci extension and linear regression models. In his analysis, EGRAG projected that XRP could potentially reach that target before the end of the year if momentum shifts in favor of bulls. Both analysts share the view that XRP’s ongoing consolidation phase reflects strength rather than weakness and could serve as a foundation for the next major rally once market sentiment improves. Expanding Views: Triple-Digit Scenarios Beyond these moderate projections, other analysts have suggested far higher long-term possibilities. Nick Anderson of Bullrunners has presented an even bolder outlook, arguing that XRP’s setup mirrors Amazon’s full consolidation and breakout timeline, which spanned more than 3,800 days. Anderson observed that Amazon’s stock advanced from about $5 to over $200 after finally breaching its previous highs, and he believes XRP could follow a comparable pattern. Based on this model, he envisions a possible price range extending into triple digits, estimating a potential target of $100. Supporting Anderson’s viewpoint, Brad Kimes of Digital Perspectives highlighted parallels between the two companies’ historical challenges, Amazon’s battles with regulatory oversight in its early years, and XRP’s recently concluded legal disputes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While such extreme price levels remain speculative, analysts agree that XRP’s technical position shows resilience. The asset continues to hold above key supports, and long-term consolidation patterns suggest the groundwork for a future rally is still intact.

A textbook bull-flag pattern and whale accumulation are converging, hinting at a massive rally that may reshape the market’s narrative. Analysts believe this momentum could push Bitcoin to $140,000, opening the door for significant 2025 gains for major altcoins. Among the top beneficiaries, Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are attracting growing institutional and retail attention due to their network strength and scalability potential. Besides these two, analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE , a fast-rising small-cap token, is also emerging as one to watch as investor interest broadens beyond blue-chip cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Forms a Classic Bull-Flag Pattern Bitcoin’s technical outlook is promising, backed by a bull-flag pattern that has historically been associated with massive upward movements. The formation started with a sharp rally followed by a period of tight consolidation, which formed a setup recognized by traders as a bullish continuation signal. Source: X Analysts say that bull-flag breakouts in crypto have an average success rate of 65%. If confirmed above $125K, analysts believe that Bitcoin could extend up towards $140K, mirroring similar patterns observed before 15-20% price surges in past cycles. Whale Accumulation Strengthens Market Confidence Whale accumulation is in full force again supporting the bullish thesis. A short-lived dip led to wallets associated with big exchanges adding almost $79.9 million worth of Bitcoin on October 8, indicating long-term confidence among big holders. This trend aligned with past bull cycles. Analysts have put the current accumulation in a clear light that suggests Bitcoin bears may be getting exhausted as institutional conviction recovers. Technical Indicators Support the Bullish Setup Momentum signals are also in line with the positive trend. The stochastic RSI crossed above the 50-level on October 9, suggesting that bullish momentum is increasing, and volume data indicates less selling pressure across exchanges. If Bitcoin breaks the $125K-$126K resistance range, analysts predict cascading short liquidations to drive a faster rally. All major moving averages from 10-day to 200-day are now below the spot price, validating a general uptrend structure. Institutional Demand Adds Long-Term Stability Institutional inflows continue to be one of the most consistent supports of Bitcoin price structure. Spot ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity have already seen over $7.5 billion in cumulative trading volume this month. These inflows strengthen liquidity and affirm Bitcoin’s position as a go-to hedge against inflation and market uncertainty. Analysts say that as long as the $120K support level is in place, institutional confidence is likely to persist, adding further strength to the next leg of the bull market. Ethereum (ETH) Eyes $7K as Institutional Adoption Expands Ethereum (ETH) remains the shining star in the altcoin recovery story. With institutional adoption, Layer-2 growth, and increasing staking participation, analysts project Ethereum to hit $7K in 2025. With the growth of decentralized finance activity and the acceleration of ETH’s supply deflation post-upgrades, the network continues to be the strongest base for long-term on-chain growth. Capital rotation from Bitcoin into ETH normally comes during a period of consolidation, indicating that Ethereum can outperform in early 2025. Solana (SOL) Builds Strength Ahead of 2025 ETF Decisions Solana (SOL) is building strength in anticipation of potential ETF approvals. A growing developer community, low-cost infrastructure and a vibrant DeFi ecosystem have contributed to it being one of the key players among the next-generation blockchains. Analysts believe pending ETF applications could boost Solana’s liquidity and give confidence to institutional investors. If this trend persists, SOL may break out to the $300-$350 range, making it one of the top performers for gains in 2025. Emerging Altcoins Draw Retail Attention As Bitcoin bulls take control again, big money is flowing into leading cryptocurrencies, and retail traders are searching for even greater growth in smaller-cap tokens. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn notable attention for its expanding base and low-cap potential. Analysts note that because of the large market cap of Bitcoin, the growth rate is limited, but the smaller tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE have potential for rapid growth. Retail traders view it as an opportunity to reap from an upside before it is adopted by institutional investors. This contrast between the whale accumulation of Bitcoin and retail investors placing bets on the agile and smaller assets, may determine the next growth cycle allowing new projects to shine. Final Word Bitcoin’s ability to hold above the $120K support level is further evidence that Bitcoin bears are fading and bulls hold the technical and on-chain metrics. Whale accumulation, ETF activity, and institutional flows are the foundation for this recovery. As Ethereum and Solana position for potential long-term outperformance, smaller-cap projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing growing attention from retail traders seeking faster exposure.

DOGE's price trends sideways on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Dogecoin Whales Accumulate As Exchange Supply Thins On-chain flows are aligning with the ETF narrative. Data show roughly $23 million in DOGE left centralized exchanges recently, classic whale accumulation that reduces immediate sell pressure and can tighten supply when demand rises. At the same time, the technical structure remains constructive as DOGE has respected an ascending channel since the summer, and this week marked a fourth successful bounce off rising trendline support. Momentum gauges have stabilized, with hourly RSI hovering above neutral and OBV trending higher, signs that dip-buying persists even as broader crypto volatility ticks up. Together, shrinking exchange reserves and steady whale bids build a supportive backdrop into Q4, historically a seasonally strong stretch for DOGE. Doge Price Outlook: Key Levels To Watch Near term, bulls need to reclaim $0.254–$0.255 to break a short-term downtrend cap; a close above $0.260 would strengthen a push toward $0.278–$0.284, with the channel top near $0.33 as the next stretch target. Failure to clear $0.255 keeps price range-bound between $0.24–$0.26. On the downside, Dogecoin’s initial support sits at $0.2475, then $0.240 (channel lower bound). A decisive break below $0.232 would invalidate the constructive setup and expose $0.212–$0.205.

Although SHIB’s price action is relatively quiet compared to other cryptocurrencies, it is forming a structure on the daily candlestick timeframe chart that could soon lead to an explosive rally. Technical analysis of Shiba Inu on the TradingView platform shows that the meme coin is about to go on an explosive price action. Testing The Boundaries Of A Long-Term Structure Technical analysis of Shiba Inu’s recent price movement on the daily candlestick chart reveals that the token is currently retesting a major strong buy zone within a broad descending structure that has shaped its trend since May 2025. Shiba Inu has been locked in a tight consolidation range over the past several months, defined by a horizontal support region at the bottom and a slanting resistance trendline connecting a sequence of lower highs. The upper resistance is now situated between $0.0000135 and $0.000014. However, as it stands, Shiba Inu may still solidify its strong buy zone between $0.0000108 and $0.0000120 in order to collect liquidity that’s needed for a breakout momentum. Each test of this area since May has led to some sort of buying pressure that has prevented further declines. If SHIB can maintain stability within this accumulation zone and begin to push higher, the next important step would be a clean breakout above its descending resistance line. It would need to close decisively above $0.0000150 on the daily chart to confirm the strength of this move. That kind of breakout would mark a clear shift in structure and open up an explosive move to $0.000017. However, the area around $0.0000176 to $0.0000190 also coincides with a broader trend reversal zone, where Shiba Inu might experience selling pressure from previous order blocks. A rejection here could cause another pullback that will keep the meme coin within its long-term consolidation. On the other hand, if the price manages to pierce through $0.0000190 and establish support above it, the SHIB could finally escape the confines of its descending structure and set the stage for a sustained bullish move above $0.00002 again. Current Shiba Inu Price Action At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.000012 after a mild pullback from $0.00013 earlier in the week. Whether this breakout materializes will depend heavily on the broader crypto market. Bitcoin’s continued dominance and momentum are dictating the sentiment across altcoins. Therefore, an extended uptrend from Bitcoin’s current consolidation after its most recent all-time high could also contribute to Shiba Inu bouncing off its strong buy zone. Meanwhile, a popular Shiba Inu community member account on X recently warned the SHIB Army to be careful of a growing phishing scam.",Shiba Inu|Altcoin|bitcoin|Descending Structure|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-11 01:00:52

Sources familiar with the matter say discussions inside the White House have intensified in recent weeks, as Trump’s advisers debate the political and legal implications of such a move. Trump Allies Push for CZ Pardon, Calling Binance Case ‘Politically Motivated’ Changpeng Zhao, known widely as “CZ,” served a four-month prison sentence earlier this year after pleading guilty in 2023 to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws. The case, brought during the Biden administration’s broader crackdown on the crypto industry, required Zhao to step down as Binance CEO and pay a $50 million fine . Binance itself was fined $4.3 billion as part of the settlement, one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history. According to Gasparino’s report , several Trump allies believe the case against Zhao was “weak” and did not warrant felony charges or prison time. SCOOP: People close to @cz_binance , the former @binance chief who spent some time in the can amid the Biden Admin's crackdown on all things crypto, say discussions inside the White House are heating up on the possibility of a pardon from @realDonaldTrump . Many Trump insiders… — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) October 10, 2025 They argue that the enforcement actions taken under the previous administration were politically motivated and unfairly targeted crypto businesses. A pardon, they say, would symbolize Trump’s willingness to “reset” Washington’s relationship with the digital asset industry and review what some insiders describe as “overreaching” enforcement by Biden-era regulators. Trump is reportedly inclined to approve the pardon, but the White House is divided on the optics. Some aides have raised concerns about potential backlash, noting the president’s expanding business ties to the crypto sector and the possibility that a pardon could be perceived as favoritism. Others argue that Zhao’s cooperation with law enforcement and lack of prior criminal history strengthen the case for clemency. Zhao’s case became one of the most high-profile legal actions in crypto history. In November 2023, he admitted in a Seattle federal court to failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program at Binance, in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. The plea deal allowed him to retain majority ownership of Binance while stepping down from his executive role. A Pardon Could Bring CZ Back to the Global Crypto Stage — But Does He Even Want It? In April 2024, U.S. District Judge Richard Jones sentenced Zhao to four months in prison , far lighter than the 36 months sought by the Department of Justice. A Seattle courtroom became the stage for a major moment in the cryptocurrency industry as former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao received a four-month prison sentence. https://t.co/WaQvI63Y3O — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 30, 2024 Prosecutors had accused Binance of facilitating transactions linked to sanctioned countries and illicit activity, but the judge cited Zhao’s cooperation, remorse, and clean record as mitigating factors. Zhao was released from federal custody on September 27, 2024 , two days earlier than scheduled, after serving 116 days. Following his release, he indicated in interviews that he had no desire to return as Binance’s CEO, calling his seven-year tenure at the company “a closed chapter.” Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao @cz_binance is back — with plans to continue investments in blockchain, AI and biotech after his prison stint. #Blockchain #CZ https://t.co/3lOa0QZ5Pn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 30, 2024 In a November interview, he said he was focused on new ventures in artificial intelligence , biotechnology, and education, including Giggle Academy , a nonprofit initiative aimed at providing free global basic education through gamified blockchain-based learning systems. Despite stepping back from leadership, Zhao remains Binance’s largest shareholder, reportedly holding a 90% stake in the exchange. His net worth, which surged to an estimated $75 billion, rose sharply following BNB’s breakthrough to a new all-time high in July , which coincided with a surge in Bitcoin’s price to new all-time highs. Binance continues to operate under CEO Richard Teng , who succeeded Zhao following his resignation. The exchange still faces multiple legal challenges, including ongoing litigation with bankrupt crypto firm FTX. In November 2024, FTX sued Binance and Zhao , seeking to recover nearly $1.8 billion in allegedly fraudulent transfers made before FTX’s collapse. The lawsuit claims that Binance’s 2021 share repurchase deal with FTX was funded using misappropriated customer assets. Binance has denied the allegations, calling the claims “meritless.” Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has requested the Delaware Bankruptcy Court to dismiss a $1.76 billion recovery lawsuit filed by the FTX trust. #Binance #FTX #ChangpengZhao https://t.co/kUnttIufCw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 6, 2025 If approved, a Trump pardon would clear Zhao’s criminal record and potentially open the door for his formal return to the global crypto scene. While sources close to him have said he has moved beyond his Binance chapter, others believe a pardon could restore his ability to engage more freely in regulated markets and corporate affairs. As discussions continue inside the White House, the timing of any official decision remains uncertain. Gasparino noted that presidential pardons often take longer than expected, especially amid competing foreign policy and economic priorities.

52967579,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=833360,1760145657,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52967579.jpeg,Reeves presses CEOs to promote UK optimism before tax-hike budget,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/reeves-presses-ceos-to-promote-uk-optimism/,"Chancellor Rachel Reeves is urging top UK business leaders to project confidence in Britain’s economy ahead of next month’s high-stakes, tax-raising Budget. Reeves has privately cautioned that persistent economic pessimism could play into the hands of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, which is now polling ahead of the Conservatives and closing in on Labour among disillusioned voters. In a coordinated push, the Treasury has been highlighting positive remarks from global corporate figures, including Microsoft President Brad Smith, who recently described Britain as a “force for stability in an uncertain world.” The Financial Times says Reeves and her Treasury team have ramped up attempts to convince CEO’s to speak out in public about their confidence in the UK economy. Executives were warned at recent roundtables hosted by the Treasury that “talking down” the economy would simply play into Reform UK’s populist narrative. Treasury officials have reportedly encouraged chief executives to speak positively on social media or in statements about government policies such as planning reform and support for the green industry that might be considered “pro-business and pro-growth.” An ally of Reeves said her absence at this stage reflected what they described as a gutless approach to statecraft, adding that the government’s tone echoed that of the newspaper and warning that joining the chorus of talking Britain down would “only lead to a bad place.” The move is part of a broader ”City charm offensive” launched by the Treasury this month, in which senior executives extol Britain’s investment credentials. Business jitters rise ahead of looming tax hikes As the government tries to inject optimism , many business leaders remain wary of Reeves’s November Budget, which is expected to include rises in corporate and personal taxes to fill a £22 billion fiscal gap. Several CEOs charged that the chancellor was sending conflicting signals — first cautioning that Britain’s finances were worse than they thought when Labour came in, and then now demanding confidence from businesses. Critics also cite previous Reeves proposals to increase employer national insurance contributions by £25bn and toughen workplace protections, which some fear will hike the cost of employment and deter firms from hiring. However, the Treasury continues to claim Britain’s fundamentals are on the up. Official figures show business investment grew 3-year-on-year in the second quarter, and the OECD predicts the UK will be the second-fastest-growing economy in the G7 by 2025. However, growth has decelerated sharply this year – with GDP expanding by just 0.2% in the three months to July – and inflation, at 3.8%, is still eroding household incomes. Labour moves to blunt Farage’s populist surge At play behind Reeves’s shove is political calculus. The Treasury is concerned that Reform UK could capitalize on economic pessimism to reinforce its message of opposition to the establishment. Labour strategists warn that a Farage government would hollow out the institutions of Britain, end the Bank of England’s independence, and put a kebab skewer through Keir Starmer’s attempt to reforge post-Brexit trade links with Europe. In recent months, Reform UK has been courting the business world, with policies that include tax cuts, reduced spending, and increased drilling for North Sea oil. Farage’s team refused to comment specifically on Reeves’s comments, but party figures said government spin on optimism was bypassing the real-world pain felt by British firms. Reeves’s positivity drive received a boost last night after Microsoft’s Brad Smith announced a detailed £22 billion investment plan in the UK over four years, including data centres, AI research, and cloud infrastructure. Britain had become a force for stability in an uncertain world, Smith informed the chancellor — quite a change of tune from 2023, when he went off on UK regulators for thwarting Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard. Following a change in position and regulatory approval, the deal was subsequently approved, and Reeves has since cited Smith’s presidential endorsement as evidence of newfound confidence in the UK’s governance and innovation environment. In January, Reeves also sacked Competition and Markets Authority chair Marcus Bokkerink, citing the need for a “more pragmatic approach” to business regulation — a decision that some at the time interpreted as part of her wider pro-investment agenda.

He also anticipates that XRP may soon experience a comparable move, drawing parallels between both assets’ long-term technical structures. BNB has recently outperformed most major cryptocurrencies, securing a position among the week’s top-performing digital assets. Over the past seven days, it has appreciated by more than 16%, surpassing several large-cap coins. During this period, BNB set a fresh all-time high of $1,350 on October 7. Meanwhile, XRP has trended in the opposite direction, retreating by 7.5% and slipping below the $3 threshold, which allowed BNB to overtake it in overall market ranking. Despite these contrasting performances, EGRAG maintains that BNB’s rally has not yet reached its full potential and that XRP could eventually mirror the same bullish structure once its accumulation phase ends. #GOLD vs #BNB and #XRP vs #BNB I'm not really into #BNB , but take a look at how the movements of #BNB and #GOLD are surprisingly similar in formation! It seems like #BNB could still have a parabolic move towards the $2K region. Just to be clear, I'm not buying or trading… pic.twitter.com/qiwoWghRfM — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 9, 2025 BNB’s Movement Compared to Gold In his latest analysis, EGRAG highlighted a notable correlation between BNB’s price behaviour and that of gold over longer time frames. Examining both the 3-month and 1-month charts, he found that BNB’s trend appears to replicate gold’s historical movement with a slight delay. He noted that gold’s long-term pattern included a sharp correction below a horizontal resistance line in late 2011, following its then-record high near $1,921. Gold subsequently consolidated for several years before reclaiming the $2,000 level in November 2023. Once this threshold was breached, gold entered a steady uptrend that has since carried it to new highs above $4,000. EGRAG sees a similar technical setup in BNB. The token experienced a sharp decline from its 2021 peak of around $691, breaking below its horizontal trendline in May of that year. For nearly four years, it remained in a consolidation zone. In February 2025, BNB finally reclaimed the $700 level, initiating a strong upward trajectory that led to successive record highs. Its most recent all-time high of $1,350 represents an increase of roughly 93% from the breakout point. Based on gold’s previous performance after its breakout, the analyst believes BNB could extend its rally toward $2,000 in the months ahead. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Pattern Aligning With BNB’s EGRAG also compared XRP’s long-term structure with BNB’s historical pattern. According to his research, XRP’s price action demonstrates similar characteristics, though the asset appears to be at an earlier stage of the same trajectory. He explained that XRP first dropped below a comparable horizontal trendline following its 2018 peak of $3.31. The cryptocurrency then spent nearly seven years trading beneath that level. During the broad market rally in November 2024, XRP finally moved above the long-standing resistance, signaling a potential shift in market direction. While the breakout has not yet produced an explosive move similar to BNB’s, EGRAG contends that XRP remains positioned for a comparable advance. If it continues to follow BNB’s lead, he projects that XRP could eventually rise toward the $13 mark. This would represent an increase of approximately 364% from its current level near $2.74 . The analyst’s projection suggests that BNB’s ongoing performance could serve as a guide for what may come next for XRP. Though their short-term trends differ, both assets share a similar technical foundation characterized by prolonged consolidation and eventual recovery above key resistance levels. EGRAG’s findings reflect a broader market expectation that once XRP completes its current consolidation, it could join other major digital assets in a significant upward phase, potentially marking the start of a new cycle of growth.

52968393,603796,1760148031,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52968393.jpeg,US Senate Push for DeFi Restrictions Raises Fears of Crypto Market Slowdown,https://bitcoinist.com/senate-push-defi-restrictions-fears-market-slowdown/,"A leaked draft from the US Senate Banking Committee Democrats outlines an aggressive approach to decentralized finance (DeFi), proposing that any person or firm “designing, deploying, operating or profiting from a DeFi front-end” be regulated as a broker and register with the SEC or CFTC. The text would also extend KYC/AML obligations to DeFi interfaces, including some non-custodial wallets and UI hosts, and authorize the U.S. Treasury to maintain a “restricted list” of risky protocols and front-ends. While the memo carves out room for “sufficiently decentralized” protocols that don’t monetize, and shields open-source developers who don’t profit from running the tech, critics argue the compliance bar is functionally impossible for most U.S.-based teams. Industry Backlash And Early Market Impact Reaction from crypto policy leaders was swift. Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, said that “ropes in everyone in crypto,” calling it unworkable and tantamount to a ban on U.S. DeFi front-ends. Summer Mersinger of the Blockchain Association warned it would “effectively ban DeFi, wallet development, and other applications in the United States,” pushing responsible builders offshore. Consequently, markets appeared to flinch as a DeFi basket gauge slipped 3–4%, with notable underperformers including HYPE and ASTR amid growing regulatory uncertainty. Beyond prices, founders fear a chilling effect on hiring, fundraising, and product launches if front-end operators and wallet providers must run full broker-style compliance stacks. Politics, Policy, And The Risk Of An Innovation Exodus The Senate had been inching toward a bipartisan digital-asset market-structure compromise after the House passed its Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (294–134) . But Democrats’ DeFi counter-proposal, driven in part by illicit finance and national-security concerns, may stall momentum in a chamber that needs 60 votes. If the “restricted list” and front-end broker provisions survive, expect heavy lobbying, civil-liberties pushback, and potential court challenges. Strategists warn the U.S. could cede developer mindshare and liquidity to Europe’s MiCA regime, which already provides clearer guardrails for token issuers and service providers. Potential Impact of Senate DeFi Restrictions The leak raises the odds of a near-term U.S. DeFi slowdown as teams reassess legal exposure and capital waits for clarity. For markets, the key watchpoints are (1) whether Senate staff soften front-end and wallet obligations, (2) how “sufficient decentralization” is defined in statute, and (3) whether Treasury’s blacklist power is scoped narrowly. Without meaningful revisions, the U.S. risks swapping consumer protection for a brain drain, with innovation (and tax revenue) flowing to friendlier jurisdictions.

The recent correction has pushed ETH toward the $4,300 support zone, a level that bulls are now fiercely defending to prevent a deeper retracement. Despite the pullback, on-chain data suggests that large holders remain confident, signaling that this dip may be part of a healthy market reset rather than the start of a downtrend. Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Drops 50%: Is The Rally Built On Weak Fundamentals? According to recent data, Bitmine continues its aggressive accumulation of ETH, adding to its holdings even as prices fluctuate. This steady inflow from institutional players highlights strong conviction in Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals, particularly as the network maintains dominance in DeFi and smart contract activity. Still, sentiment among retail traders remains mixed. Some fear that sustained weakness below $4,300 could trigger another wave of selling pressure, while others see this as a potential accumulation opportunity before the next major move. As Ethereum stabilizes at these levels, the coming days will be crucial to determine whether the market resumes its bullish momentum or enters a prolonged consolidation phase amid heightened volatility. Ethereum Accumulation Continues As Bitmine Strengthens Its Position According to data shared by Lookonchain, institutional accumulation around Ethereum remains strong despite recent market volatility. Just a few hours ago, Bitmine received another 23,823 ETH (worth $103.68 million) from BitGo, marking yet another significant inflow of capital. This move comes only two days after Bitmine acquired 20,020 ETH ($89.7 million) via FalconX, underscoring their consistent strategy of building exposure during price dips rather than chasing rallies. Such accumulation patterns are often seen as a sign of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals, particularly from institutional investors who view ETH as a core asset within the broader digital economy. While short-term sentiment remains cautious after the recent correction, these inflows suggest that smart money continues to see value around current prices. The coming days will be critical for Ethereum’s technical structure. Bulls must defend the $4,300 support zone to maintain momentum and set up a potential recovery toward the $4,600–$4,750 resistance area. A strong defense here could pave the way for a new all-time high, confirming renewed investor confidence and establishing $4,300 as a key accumulation level. Related Reading: Grayscale Stakes 857,600 Ethereum Worth $3.83B As Institutional Confidence Grows Bulls Defend $4,300 Support Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading near $4,325, showing signs of consolidation after a 10% decline from its recent high of $4,750. The 12-hour chart reveals that ETH has fallen below the 50-day moving average (blue line), signaling short-term weakness, while the 100-day (green) and 200-day (red) moving averages are still trending upward — a sign that the broader uptrend remains intact. The $4,300 level now acts as a key support zone, with bulls attempting to establish a base and prevent further downside pressure. If this level holds, the next target would be a retest of $4,500–$4,600, where sellers are likely to reappear. However, a break below $4,250 could expose Ethereum to a deeper pullback toward the $4,000 psychological level, an area that previously served as a strong accumulation zone in late September. Related Reading: Short-Term Holder Supply Rises By 559K Bitcoin – New Buyers Flood the Market Momentum indicators suggest that selling pressure is easing, aligning with the recent on-chain data showing continued accumulation from large entities such as Bitmine. This reinforces the idea that institutional confidence remains strong, even amid volatility. For now, holding above $4,300 is critical — a successful defense could mark the foundation for Ethereum’s next push toward new highs.

The team stated that the move was necessary to ensure that all allocations accurately reflect users’ correct participation ratios across reward epochs. Aster posted on X, stating that it is verifying all allocation data after users reported errors in their token rewards. The team said most users’ allocations will stay above their final snapshot holding percentage and promised to update the numbers within a few days. Aster checks all user data and opens the refund option Aster said that some of its users have complained that the amount of tokens they received does not match the work, trading, or staking they had done on the platform, so the company’s team is reviewing the data again to address this issue . The process will take some time because there are many users and large amounts of data to compare, but once the checks are over, the company will share new and corrected allocation numbers for all users to see. Everyone will have 48 hours to review their updated results and decide whether they are satisfied with them or if they would prefer a USDT refund instead. The exchange said the refund options will make things fair for users who may have been affected by the data mistakes and will make sure they get the money one day after the final airdrop is completed. The exchange noted that its approach will demonstrate to users that it values their time, effort, and loyalty, which will also enable the project to continue growing with the support of its community. Aster stated that it will keep users updated on progress, respond to questions, and make sure that the airdrop will be done in a way that is accurate, fair, and fully transparent for everyone involved. Community questions fairness as Aster promises transparency Aster’s airdrop was delayed because some users said they received much less than they expected after inviting many new users, trading often, or holding large amounts of tokens. Others said they compared their results with their friends and found that people who did less somehow received more tokens. Social media platforms like X were flooded with messages from users sharing screenshots, spreadsheets, and explanations of what they believed had gone wrong. These posts pushed the Aster team to explain the problem. Quinten (048.eth), a well-known community member who had been promoting Aster for a long time, said he generated more than $100 million in referral trading volume and attracted around 250 new users to the platform. However, he explained that he only received 338 ASTER tokens as a reward, which he felt was far too little compared to his contributions. Quinten accused both Aster and Binance of unfairly rewarding certain insiders instead of regular users, claiming that insiders or people close to the project had received almost 95% of the total rewards. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) replied to Quinten’s post and asked if the numbers that Quinten had shared were correct and if the data could be verified. Quinten responded that the numbers were accurate based on Aster’s publicly shared data and that the problem was with the reward formula and not the math. He said that the reward system gave too much importance to referral-based points while ignoring other ways users had contributed, such as trading, staking, or supporting the community. Users who focused only on referrals earned much more, while those who had been active in many ways received much less. Aster released a statement, stating that its technical team had already begun checking every allocation record to ensure all numbers were correct. The exchange plans to complete the revised token drop by October 20.

In a stunning 24-hour period, more than $19 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated , erasing months of gains and leaving traders worldwide reeling. Screens that glowed green just days ago turned blood red as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major assets plummeted in synchronized freefall. Analysts are calling it the mother of all liquidations . Bigger than LUNA. Bigger than the COVID crash. Bigger even than the FTX implosion. The wipeout was triggered by a perfect storm: overleveraged positions collapsing in sequence, heightened regulatory pressure from multiple jurisdictions, and a sudden loss of investor confidence following the implosion of several highly speculative tokens. As automated liquidation engines kicked in, billions of dollars vanished from the markets within hours. Veteran traders compared the chaos to a financial hurricane. Exchanges experienced record traffic as investors scrambled to close positions, stablecoins briefly de-pegged, and panic rippled through DeFi protocols that had long been considered secure. Sentiment collapsed faster than prices, reinforcing the cycle of fear that gripped the global crypto landscape. Yet amid this unprecedented carnage, one digital asset stood resilient, BDT COIN (BDTC) . While the market drowned in red, BDT COIN continued to climb, defying the gravitational pull that dragged even the strongest cryptocurrencies down. The Calm Within the Storm: BDT COIN’s Rise While traders struggled to comprehend the market’s sudden collapse, BDT COIN remained firm and stable. Its value not only held but showed steady upward momentum, becoming a beacon of security in an otherwise turbulent market. The reason behind this resilience lies in BDT COIN’s design and philosophy . Unlike volatile, speculative cryptocurrencies, BDT COIN is backed by real, tangible gold reserves , giving every token intrinsic value. This gold-backed foundation has become the ultimate safeguard against the kind of systemic panic that wiped out billions elsewhere. BDT COIN isn’t just another digital asset; it is engineered to drive economies forward. It offers stable money , backed by gold for genuine confidence in every transaction. It empowers global commerce through effortless and low-cost international payments that transcend traditional financial barriers. It promotes financial inclusion , giving people everywhere access to participate in the new digital economy. And it stands as a fortress of ultimate security , protected by advanced, quantum-resistant technology that future-proofs it against cyber threats. A Vision of Stability in a Volatile World Launched with the vision of merging the reliability of gold with the innovation of blockchain, BDT COIN represents a new era of financial integrity. Its hybrid model , combining digital utility with physical asset reserves, delivers unmatched transparency and trust. Each BDT COIN is verifiably backed by audited gold holdings, ensuring that its value remains rooted in the real world. While speculative tokens falter, BDT COIN thrives by staying true to fundamental economics. Its transparency and asset-backing have earned it growing recognition among institutional investors and retail holders alike. During the market’s darkest hours, investors sought refuge in BDT COIN, viewing it as one of the few digital assets capable of maintaining stability when everything else failed. In a landscape defined by uncertainty, BDT COIN has proven that innovation anchored in real value is the foundation for lasting success. Its performance during this record-breaking market crash is more than a show of strength; it is a signal that the future of crypto will belong to assets built on trust, security, and tangible value. The Future Belongs to the Resilient As the dust settles on the largest liquidation event in crypto history, one message rings clear: the age of reckless speculation is ending. The future belongs to assets that blend innovation with stability, technology with transparency, and ambition with accountability. BDT COIN stands at the forefront of this transformation. It offers not just a safe haven in times of crisis but a sustainable path forward for the global financial system. For investors seeking security, real-world backing, and long-term growth potential, BDT COIN is more than a token—it is a movement toward resilient digital finance . Now is the moment to explore, understand, and invest in what could become the gold standard of tomorrow’s economy.

Pepe, one of the most well-known meme coins, currently trades at $0.059122, experiencing a slight 5.26% decline in the last 24 hours. Similarly, SPX6900, trading at $1.39, has recently experienced a more significant 12.99% decrease. Both of these coins have garnered attention for their volatility and strong communities, which drive much of their price action. The meme coin price trends are not always predictable, but they present opportunities for investors willing to ride the waves of the market. However, while Pepe and SPX6900 offer the thrill of short-term gains, investors are now eyeing a new contender that might offer even greater returns. BullZilla ($BZIL), a new meme coin built on the Ethereum blockchain, is quickly gaining attention for its solid technical foundation and high potential for long-term growth. As its presale continues to gain momentum, the meme coin price of $BZIL is becoming an increasingly attractive proposition for investors looking for an entry point into the meme coin market. Let’s take a deeper dive into these three coins, with a special focus on BullZilla and its unique value proposition. BullZilla: A Game-Changer in the Meme Coin Space BullZilla ($BZIL) offers an exciting opportunity for meme coin investors looking for a combination of hype and technical strength. Unlike many of its predecessors, BullZilla is built on the Ethereum blockchain, one of the most secure and scalable networks in the crypto world. This technical foundation provides $BZIL with several key advantages, including the potential for greater liquidity, security, and scalability. Currently, the meme coin price of $BZIL during its presale stands at $0.00013907, an attractive entry point for investors seeking high returns. BullZilla’s presale has already raised over $850k, with more than 2800 token holders, signaling strong community support and investor confidence. The coin’s unique features, such as its Roar Burn Mechanism, staking rewards, and a referral system, position it as a promising long-term investment. These features not only add value but also offer potential for growth and engagement within its ecosystem. How to Buy BullZilla Coins To buy BullZilla ($BZIL) coins, you’ll first need to set up a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. These wallets allow you to store your cryptocurrency securely and interact with decentralized applications. After setting up your wallet, purchase Ethereum (ETH) through a cryptocurrency exchange like Binance or Coinbase, and transfer the ETH to your wallet. Once your wallet is funded with ETH, visit the official BullZilla presale site and connect your wallet to the platform. From there, you can easily swap your Ethereum for $BZIL tokens. Simply select the amount you wish to purchase, confirm the transaction, and your tokens will be secured. Your allocation of $BZIL will be held in your wallet until the presale concludes, and you can claim it once the presale ends. Investment Scenario: What $2000 Could Buy You in BullZilla Presale For investors looking to get in on the ground floor of BullZilla, the presale offers a great opportunity. With the current price at $0.00013907, a $2000 investment would get you approximately 14,388,506 $BZIL tokens. If the coin appreciates by 10x after the presale, as many other meme coins have in the past, your $2000 investment could grow to $20,000. While this scenario is speculative, it highlights the potential for significant returns when investing early in promising meme coins. BullZilla’s technical foundation and its strong presale performance make it a particularly attractive investment. The presale price offers a unique opportunity for early investors to lock in a price before the coin potentially rises in value post-launch. Pepe Price: A Meme Coin with a Loyal Following and Volatile Price Pepe, while facing recent price drops, remains one of the most recognizable names in the meme coin space. Its current price of $0.059122 might not seem like much, but its high volatility means that it could surge once market conditions shift. Pepe is often considered a “safe bet” for meme coin investors, thanks to its massive following on social media platforms and its deep roots in internet culture. The meme coin price has been heavily driven by hype, with investors eagerly awaiting the next “pump” that could propel its value higher. Despite the current downturn, the long-term potential of Pepe should not be discounted. The meme coin price is often cyclical, following trends set by larger market movements and social media buzz. As a result, investors usually view Pepe as a coin that’s ripe for quick trades, capitalizing on its periodic price swings. With its established community and continued brand recognition, Pepe remains a meme coin worth keeping an eye on. SPX6900 Price: A High-Risk Meme Coin with Volatility at Its Core SPX6900, trading at $1.39 with a 12.99% decline in the past 24 hours, brings a unique level of volatility to the meme coin market. This meme coin is often seen as an underdog, with its price largely driven by market sentiment and community hype. While it may seem like an attractive investment during price dips, SPX6900 is a high-risk option for investors looking for stability. Its volatility is a double-edged sword,offering the potential for large gains, but also posing the risk of significant losses. The meme coin price of SPX6900 is influenced more by hype than by technical advancements or ecosystem improvements. As a result, it’s often seen as a speculative investment, ideal for traders who can time the market but not necessarily for long-term holders. With its current price at $1.39, SPX6900 may still hold promise for traders willing to navigate the choppy waters of meme coin trading. However, those looking for a more structured investment might find more appeal in newer meme coins with stronger foundations. Conclusion: Pepe, SPX6900, and BullZilla, Meme Coin Price Trends for 2025 Pepe and SPX6900 remain popular meme coins, but their prices continue to fluctuate with the crypto market’s highs and lows. For those looking for a more stable investment with the potential for long-term growth, BullZilla presents an exciting opportunity. The $BZIL presale is gaining momentum, and its price continues to rise as more investors jump on board. With its Ethereum-backed infrastructure, deflationary features, and strong community support, BullZilla is a meme coin price that is poised for success. Investing in meme coins has always been about timing the market and understanding the underlying value. While Pepe and SPX6900 provide opportunities for short-term gains, BullZilla offers a much stronger foundation and the potential for significant long-term growth. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a newcomer to the meme coin market, BullZilla is one to watch in 2025.

Israeli Trader Stabbed, $600K Stolen in Home Attack",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-or-your-life-israeli-trader-stabbed-600k-stolen-in-home-attack/,"According to the Tel Aviv District Attorney’s Office, a Bitcoin trader in Herzliya was attacked and robbed in what prosecutors call a violent home invasion on September 7. The victim was stabbed and forced to give up digital wallet access. Reports say the thieves walked away with roughly $600,000 in assets and valuables. How The Attack Unfolded Reports have disclosed that the assailants waited in the stairwell outside the victim’s apartment and struck at about 8:10 a.m. They forced their way in when the door opened. The attacker tied the man up and stabbed him twice, each wound above the knee. They threatened harm to his family to force him to hand over wallet codes. At first, the group demanded 500 Bitcoin, a demand that was later scaled down as violence was used to extract access. Under pressure, the victim surrendered credentials that allowed transfers of approximately $547,260 in Bitcoin and $42,248 in USDT. The intruders also took a Rolex watch valued at about $50,000, a laptop, a Trezor hardware wallet, around €5,300 in cash and several thousand Israeli shekels. Before leaving, they sprayed disinfectant inside the flat—apparently in an effort to erase traces. Arrest And Charges Based on reports, police arrested 46-year-old Murad Mahajna on September 10. He was indicted by the Tel Aviv District Attorney’s Office. The charges include breaking and entering, aggravated robbery, extortion by threats, obstruction of justice and making threats. Prosecutors say they linked Mahajna to the scene using phone records, voice identification, technological data and CCTV footage. He is described as having a criminal history with 10 prior convictions for matters including violence, drugs and weapons. Numbers And Evidence The sums in this case are specific. Roughly $589,508 in crypto was reportedly moved from the victim’s accounts — the combined total of the Bitcoin and USDT transfers. When the watch and cash are added, the financial loss approaches the headline figure of $600K that circulated in early reports. Crypto-analytics sources tracking physical attacks on holders listed this event among confirmed “wrench” style assaults ; one count put it as the 52nd such physical attack recorded in 2025. Phone calls allegedly made after the assault pressured the victim for more coins and included threats to “find” family members if demands were not met.

Canary Capital’s updated S-1 now includes ticker LTCC and a 0.95% fee, the kind of last-mile filing detail ETF watchers say typically appears “before go-time.” With Grayscale and CoinShares also in the hunt, analysts argue LTC’s commodity-like profile and long proof-of-work history make it one of the cleaner alt candidates for regulated fund access once the SEC resumes normal operations. Litecoin Technical setup: $130 reclaim tees up $135–$138 On the charts, Litecoin blasted through the $127.45 swing high and reclaimed stacked moving averages (7- and 30-day SMAs), turning the multi-month range from ceiling to potential floor. RSI (68) shows strong momentum without a blow-off, and MACD remains firmly positive. Immediate resistance sits at $130–$131; a daily close above opens a path to $134–$135, then $138 and $150. Should FOMO follow an ETF headline, bulls point to a broader vacuum up to the $150–$160 zone, Litecoin’s highest region since early 2022. On higher time frames, some technicians note a breakout from a year-long diagonal that, if confirmed, preserves a stretch target toward $275 over the coming months; that scenario likely requires sustained ETF-driven inflows. LTC's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: LTCUSD on Tradingview LTC Levels That Matter, And What Could Invalidate For momentum traders, the line in the sand is $125: lose it decisively and swift profit-taking could drag LTC back into $122–$125 support, with $115–$118 as a deeper retest. Hold above $125 and reclaim $130 with volume, and bulls keep control into $135–$138. Macro remains a swing factor; government shutdown timing, SEC throughput, and broader crypto risk appetite can still inject volatility.

For searchers tracking the Litecoin price, keep your eyes on $130: it’s the path to the next leg.

The milestone marks growing confidence in regulated crypto investment products and increasing liquidity in the Bitcoin market. BlackRock’s IBIT fund continues to lead with the $244.5 million in yearly revenue and almost $100 billion in controlled assets. With consolidation above $120 000, analysts are also shifting focus to high-potential altcoins. Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK) top the list, yet MAGACOIN FINANCE is now entering the conversation as one of the next big altcoins to buy with the renewed capital rotation. Bitcoin ETF Volume Hits $7.5B Milestone Institutional inflows are continuing to fuel record activity across Bitcoin ETFs. Combined volumes have exploded right through early October, driving cumulative trading to new highs. Bitcoin is trading at nearly $121,000, down slightly from its record $126,279 high reached two days ago. The token managed to add over $10,000 in two weeks before stabilizing. Prediction markets have a 38% chance of prices holding between $120,000 and $122,000. Technical readings remain positive. Thirteen out of fifteen moving averages indicate a bullish structure, whilst the RSI at 60 indicates balanced momentum. Resistance levels are at $123,240 and $125,000-$126,000, and solid support at $118,000-$119,500. Profit-Taking Emerges After Record Highs Open interest has fallen from $47 billion to $46.1 billion as some long positions have been taken off after the new highs. Analysts consider this normal profit-taking, rather than a sign of weakness. Market sentiment is optimistic, and traders expect liquidity to rotate into altcoins as Bitcoin consolidates. Historically, such phases often signal the start of the next broad-based crypto rally. Top Altcoins to Buy Cardano (ADA) — Resilient Structure Suggests Upside Potential Cardon (ADA) is trading above its 50-week moving average and keeping its long-term bullish structure intact. The coin is consolidating around $0.80 level, with $0.70 to $0.75 being an effective support zone. Analysts are targeting the $1.00 to $1.20 range as the next big resistance. Developer activity and DeFi growth continue to strengthen ADA’s position as one of the best altcoins to buy for investors looking for stability and growth. Chainlink (LINK) — Breakout Pattern Targets $54 Chainlink (LINK) is trading close to $22.33 after breaking out of a bullish flag pattern. Volume has increased 16% to $916 million, indicating renewed momentum. Technical projections call for a $54.60 target if momentum is sustained. Support is now near $23.50, which was the previous breakout zone. LINK’s expanding role in linking real-world data to blockchains has made it a leading utility token for institutional adoption. Market Rotation Expands Beyond Bitcoin As Bitcoin ETFs attract institutional inflows, analysts anticipate a shift to liquidity from large- and mid-cap altcoins. Historically, when Bitcoin stabilizes, capital moves into assets that have better potential for upside gains. Cardano and Chainlink have profited from this first wave, but analysts monitor small-cap emerging projects, too, with exponential potential. As capital begins rotating from Bitcoin into smaller-cap assets, analysts are highlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most promising tokens to watch. The project has captured investor attention due to its strong fundamentals and rapid early-stage accumulation. According to projections, analysts expect MAGACOIN FINANCE to deliver up to 65× returns before the end of the year, fueled by a growing community and rising on-chain activity. This outlook reflects sustained buying pressure from early participants seeking high upside exposure as the market enters its next altcoin cycle. With expanding liquidity and active community growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout small-cap contender positioned to benefit from renewed demand for higher-return opportunities. Its early-stage traction mirrors previous market leaders that multiplied during prior bull rotations. Conclusion — ETF Strength Sets the Stage for Altcoin Growth The $7.5 billion Bitcoin ETF volume underscores how deeply traditional finance has entered the crypto sector. As Bitcoin steadies near record levels, attention is shifting toward altcoins with stronger fundamentals and technical appeal. Analysts say ADA and LINK are leading the charge, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming one to watch among emerging assets. With capital rotation accelerating and institutional inflows rising, these projects could anchor the next major altcoin rally as the market transitions into the final quarter of 2025.

This includes the strategic launch of the stablecoin across its Multi-Assets Collateral mode and SmartEarn product. This expansion is accompanied by an unprecedented three-tier campaign, offering users powerful tools for more efficient asset management and substantial rewards. Triple Incentives for USDD Holders The announcement states that from 4:00 (UTC) on October 11 to 4:00 (UTC) on October 21. To access the three exclusive benefits, users must click “ Register Now ” on the event page, activate USDD on SmartEarn, and switch to Multi-Assets Collateral mode. Earn 10% APY on USDD with SmartEarn: Registered users who activate USDD on SmartEarn can earn a 10% APY during the event period. Interest will be automatically distributed as Points on the T+1 day. Enjoy 2% Rebate on USDD Transfers to Futures Account: Users who transfer USDD to their USDT-M Futures accounts will receive a 2% rebate on the net transferred amount (minimum 100 USDD). The campaign features a total prize pool of 20,000 USDD, distributed on a first-come, first-served basis, with a maximum reward of 200 USDD per participant. Climb the Trading Volume Leaderboard to Share 30,000 USDD: Users who trade Futures in Multi-Assets Collateral mode during the event can qualify for a share of the 30,000 USDD prize pool. To be eligible, participants must maintain a daily average USDD balance of at least 100 USDD in their U-Margined Futures account (verified by daily snapshots) and reach a cumulative futures trading volume of at least 10,000 USDT. Each participant can earn up to 3,000 USDD in rewards. USDD (Official Social Media: https://link3.to/usdd ) is a decentralized stablecoin deployed on the TRON and Ethereum blockchains, characterized by its security, transparency, and stability. It maintains a stable 1:1 peg to the US dollar, supported by secure liquidation, dynamic collateral management, and an advanced risk control framework. Since its upgrade to USDD 2.0 this year, it has achieved seamless integration with Decentralized Finance (DeFi), while introducing efficient liquidation processes, collateral auctions, and a Peg Stability Module (PSM) to enhance price stability. The USDD 2.0 ecosystem is committed to long-term growth, empowering users and enhancing protocol security through real-time monitoring and community-driven decisions. SmartEarn and Multi-Assets Collateral Maximize Asset Efficiency HTX’s Multi-Assets Collateral mode allows a broader range of assets to serve as margin collateral for USDT-margined futures, enabling users to optimize their portfolios without converting all assets into USDT. This feature helps fully activate idle assets, significantly improving overall capital utilization and efficiency. SmartEarn automatically calculates rewards by taking snapshots of assets held in users’ USDT-M Futures accounts. Importantly, even after activating SmartEarn, users can transfer or trade their assets at any time without restrictions. Activating Multi-Assets Collateral mode is easy—users just switch the asset mode on the futures page. Enabling SmartEarn is just as simple: on the App, go through the futures asset banner to the SmartEarn page, or on the Web, select SmartEarn from the Futures navigation bar and click “Enable All.” Both actions are quick, intuitive, and take effect immediately. The addition of USDD to both Multi-Assets Collateral and SmartEarn not only enhances HTX users’ asset allocation options but also broadens the range of available trading and wealth management opportunities. Looking ahead, HTX remains committed to optimizing the user experience and will accelerate the rollout of innovative financial tools to help users achieve highly efficient asset growth.

Trader anxiety that a cooling trade war was about to re-ignite sent a macro shock rippling through crypto, triggering one of the largest long declines in prices of BTC, ETH and other digital assets seen all year. Bitcoin recovered to $113,294 and Ether to $3,844 as the CoinDesk 20 Index slid 12.1%. The world's largest cryptocurrency had fallen below $110,000 briefly, marking a 10% decline over the past 24 hours. Crypto's total market cap dropped to $3.87 trillion, and roughly $16.7 billion of the $19.1 billion in liquidations came from longs, while Ethena’s USDe briefly printed $0.9996, a mild deviation that highlights peg stress when derivatives markets whipsaw. Friday's crash saw crypto's worst liquidation in terms of pure volume, seeing over 10 times as much dollar value liquidated as the crashes when FTX collapsed in 2022 or when global markets melted down during the early COVID lockdowns. At a percentage level, Friday's crash is much less significant, given how much the overall crypto market has grown since 2022. CoinGlass said in a post on X that while it recorded $19.13 billion in liquidations, ""the actual total is likely much higher,"" noting that crypto exchange Binance — the largest in the world — does not report as quickly as other platforms. The Ethena team said USDe minting and redemptions remained fully operational despite the volatility and pointed out that the stablecoin is even more overcollateralized as unrealized gains from short positions are realized. Adding to traders’ concerns, the U.S. government shutdown has delayed key economic data releases, leaving markets to navigate without official indicators just as trade war rhetoric returns to center stage.

XRP Whale Flow Is At A Negative $50 Million Per Day At The Moment As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, XRP whales have been offloading coins recently. “Whales” refer to the big-money investors who hold significant amounts in their wallets and carry some influence in the market. The behavior of these key investors can often be worth keeping an eye on, as even if it may not always directly correlate with the asset’s trajectory, it can still be revealing about how the influential entities are feeling about the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Pivoting To Accumulation, But Mega Whales Are Still Selling There are many ways to track the behavior of the XRP whales, with one such being the metric cited by Maartunn: the Whale Flow. This indicator measures the net amount of coins that’s entering into or exiting out of the wallets of this cohort. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the XRP Whale Flow over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA XRP Whale Flow plunged to a highly negative value in July as the coin reached its top above $3.6. This suggests that the large holders took the opportunity of the rally to participate in profit-taking. Interestingly, since this plummet in the indicator, its value has remained at a similarly red value until today, meaning that the whales have only continued to apply selling pressure. At present, the metric is sitting at a negative value of $50 million per day, meaning that whales have been withdrawing an average of $50 million every day for the past month. This could be a reason why the cryptocurrency hasn’t seen any big rally recently, while Bitcoin and other coins have been flying. In some other news, analyst Ali Martinez has identified a price level that could help turn XRP around. As the below chart shared by Martinez in an X post shows, the coin has seemingly been trading inside a Parallel Channel over the last couple of months. A Parallel Channel is a technical analysis (TA) consolidation pattern that forms when an asset trades between two parallel trendlines. The lower level of the pattern acts as a support line. From the chart, it’s visible that in the case of this XRP Parallel Channel, it’s situated at $2.73. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Rally Still Looks Intact, CryptoQuant Says: Here’s Why The analyst has noted that if this support level holds, the coin could see a rebound to the upper level at $3.10. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.745, down more than 11% over the last week.

52974494,603464,1760155244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52974494.jpeg,Weirdest Bitcoin Heist Yet? OP_RETURN Targets Dormant Wallets,https://bitcoinist.com/weirdest-bitcoin-heist-yet-op_return/,"An obscure firm using the storied “Salomon Brothers” name has ignited one of Bitcoin’s strangest ownership fights to date: a mass “dusting” campaign that blasted tens of thousands of legacy wallets with on-chain “legal notices” embedded in OP_RETURN messages. In a detailed forensic study, Galaxy Research links the messages to a coordinated attempt that may be laying groundwork for abandoned-property claims—though it remains unclear how any claimant could ever take control of coins without the private keys. Bitcoin Dust Attack Sparks Legal Chaos According to Galaxy’s analysis , an unknown, sophisticated actor sent 41,523 OP_RETURN messages from 3,738 sender addresses to 39,423 recipient addresses that collectively held about 2.334 million BTC when targeted. The vast majority—98.82%—were legacy P2PKH addresses with very long inactivity, averaging roughly 2,171 days (~5.95 years). The campaign rolled out in waves over the summer: test transactions in late June with no links or “Salomon” references, followed in July and August by messages carrying all-caps “LEGAL NOTICE” language and URLs pointing to Salomon Brothers’ website. Early operational hiccups—like an initial broken URL—were later corrected as the sender iterated through a “test → blast → monitor → adjust” loop. The notices directed recipients to a page asserting that the targeted wallet “appears to be lost or abandoned,” and that a Salomon client “has taken constructive possession of it.” The page gives owners ninety days to prove control—either by moving funds on-chain or by submitting documentation—warning that “the lack of a response may be provided to a court as evidence of the relinquishment of all rights, title and interest.” As of Friday, October 10, 2025 (Europe/Berlin), the page states that responses must come “before October 10, 2025.” “Constructive possession,” as defined by Cornell Law’s Legal Information Institute, refers to legal possession without direct physical control—“for example, someone with keys to a safe deposit box may have constructive possession to the contents of that box.” Applied to bearer-style digital assets, the analogy is provocative: on Bitcoin, control is cryptographic, not custodial, and “keys” are literally the ability to sign. Establishing constructive possession without a private key is, at minimum, legally novel. Galaxy’s researchers stress there is no evidence the episode reveals a Bitcoin protocol flaw or a private-key compromise. In fact, most of the targeted scripts (legacy P2PKH) are less exposed to certain hypothetical attack classes than other address types. Still, the scale and method—paired with explicit deadlines and relinquishment language—suggest the organizer could attempt legal action in jurisdictions with unclaimed-property statutes that contemplate digital assets. “Given the OP_RETURN campaign’s scale, the messages’ contents, and the notices they linked to, a plausible interpretation is that whoever is behind them may try to wage legal claims on unresponsive wallets,” Galaxy writes, while cautioning that “the legal viability and possible reach” are “questionable.” The campaign also coincided with renewed on-chain movement from at least one long-silent whale. Shortly after a tranche of messages drew attention in early July, a wallet associated with an early holder moved roughly 80,000 BTC, fueling speculation that the dusting acted as a wake-up call for dormant addresses. Whether cause, coincidence, or opportunistic timing, the episode underscored a truth unique to bearer crypto: proof of life is an on-chain signature away. Salomon’s public posture, captured across its website, frames the effort as a compliance exercise “meant only for the wallet owner,” insisting the client “is not a hacker and is not phishing.” But the notice also asserts that, after the 90-day window, the “digital wallets and their contents will be considered to be confirmed as abandoned,” and warns against any “trespass” without the client’s authorization—language likely to alarm Bitcoiners who view private keys as the sole arbiter of control. What happens next hinges on courts more than code. Abandoned-property law in the US varies by state, and even where statutes recognize virtual currency, translating a court order into on-chain control is non-trivial. Without the keys, a claimant cannot sign a transaction; without a cooperative custodian or intermediary, there is no off-chain lever to pull. Galaxy’s bottom line reflects that tension: the gambit is sophisticated and not purely performative, but any attempt to convert “constructive possession” into spendable BTC would face profound practical and legal hurdles. For now, the dust has settled into an uneasy signal. The campaign demonstrates that OP_RETURN can carry more than memes—it can deliver pseudo-legal processes at blockchain scale. Whether that message ever amounts to more than noise will test the boundaries between on-chain facts and off-chain claims, and whether courts will try to bridge a gap that cryptography, by design, made very wide.

SOLT achieves 2x Solana exposure via regulated futures, not direct SOL purchases, with $781M AUM, 1.85% expense ratio, and robust liquidity. On-chain analysis highlights strong Solana fundamentals: rising TVL, user growth, and liquidity inflows, supporting positive momentum and long-term value. Recommend tactical buying of SOLT to amplify Solana beta, driven by strong fundamentals and ETF approval speculation, with active risk management essential. Introduction 2x Solana ETF (SOLT) is a Volatility Shares Trust ETF that seeks to double (+200%) the daily Solana price movement (daily target 2x), using derivatives instead of buying the asset directly. It is listed on the NASDAQ, with a start date of 20/03/2025, and is intended for traders who understand the effect of daily capitalization (compounding) and the risks of 2x leverage. The fund manager warns about this: this vehicle is a product for investors who can monitor the position on a daily basis and tolerate amplified volatility; the value of the stake can vary sharply even in a single session. Volatility Shares As of 9/10/2025, the fund's website shows: net assets $672 million NAV $24.38 27.56 million shares median spread: 0.12% (30d) expense ratio: 1.85% Ticker: SOLT CUSIP: 92864M830 Volatility Shares Operationally, SOLT obtains its exposure primarily through Solana futures listed on regulated markets (CME Group's Solana future), further relying on high-quality cash and collateral (T-bills or government monetary funds) to cover margins and liquidity. Volatility Shares In its holdings, we found that it holds a 200% exposure in Solana futures and a 100% “Cash & Other” item (cash, accrued assets/liabilities and government money fund shares). This combination makes it possible to meet the 2x target without recourse to capital lending: the leverage is derived from derivatives, not traditional financial leverage. The trade-off is the costs/benefits of roll (as contango/backwardation) and potentially imperfect spot tracking when the futures curve moves. Risks: Daily Compounding and Beta Slippage In the first graph, taking as a time horizon the start of the ETF, we have built a comparison of how the Solana cryptocurrency has evolved in its spot price and the real SOLT ETF. To these two series we have added the theoretical SOLT (SOLx2) that takes the spot performance of Solana and multiplies it by two, without added frictions. This graph, we will use it as a visual support to compare the trajectories of the underlying, the actual product and the x2 “ideal”. In this way, we obtain a first insight into the effect of volatility and daily reset. Node Analytica SOLT, SOLX2, SOL-Spot base 100 Looking at the series in the graph, while there is a clear trend the SOLT ETF accompanies the theoretical one (SOLx2) and loses in lateral movements with volatility increasing the widening between the series. Node Analytica Daily Tracking Difference & Cumulative Divergence We visualize better the gap between the real and the theoretical with the following graph that combines the blue line of cumulative divergence with the area of the Daily Tracking Difference (green if SOLT yields above 2× daily and red if it yields below). The cumulative divergence measures how far the accumulated “path” of the ((REAL)) SOLT ETF has deviated from the theoretical when both start on the same day. If positive, the actual ETF is ahead of the theoretical ETF and vice versa. In this way we can quantify the erosion (daily reset, roll, commissions, spreads, etc.) of the leveraged ETF. After a convulsive start that we will treat as an operational outlier (by possible time misalignment and/or premium/discount at closure), over time the divergence deepens, to a current -20%. The gaps between both values are accentuated when volatility increases, while more stable trends bring the real performance closer to the theoretical. In the same way, it can be seen that the Tracking Difference tends to oscillate around 0 with a typical amplitude of +/- 10%. When the underlying asset ((SOL)) enters into cleaner trend tranches, the area softens and the divergence reconverges. On the other hand, in lateral and volatile phases, tracking alternates with greater intensity, and divergence deepens. So far, this indicates that SOLT is a good option to maintain in the short term and capture directional impulses with positive momentum. In this scenario, the position offers its best version, while on the volatile side, it erodes the result versus the theoretical one, and therefore maintaining it in the long term makes no sense from the point of view of profitability/risk. Node Analytica Rolling effective beta In the following graph, with the effective beta, we observe how many points real SOLT moves for each point that SOL spot moves. As the ideal theoretical beta should stay around 2, if you frequently move away, it means that something is happening with tracking, microstructure, or market regime. Since the start of the ETF, except on two occasions, the beta has remained constantly below 2, reaching extreme levels of 1.5-1.6 in volatile laterality regimes and only reaching levels 2 of beta, when the trend was constant and directional volatility during the month of July. We also observed a convergence last September when the price maintained momentum without strong oscillations in the microstructure. This analysis reinforces the theory that this instrument should be used tacitly for short-term operations, a tight size, and measuring accurately the inflows by monitoring beta, tracking volatility, and volatility: final phases of price consolidation and/or beginnings of confirmed upward micro-trends that break with sideways ranges. Also, reduce/close exposure when side volatility increases along with downward reversals of the beta. Regulatory Warning Regulatory warning. SOLT is a 2× daily reset leveraged ETF that gets its exposure mainly through futures and is geared towards tactical operation by experienced investors. The SEC and FINRA caution that leveraged/reverse ETFs are designed to meet their objective in daily periods and that over longer horizons their performance may differ significantly from the expected multiple of the underlying, especially in volatile or sideways environments; therefore, they require active monitoring and a short-term horizon. In addition, FINRA reminds institutions (and by extension the investing public) of their suitability and supervision obligations with these products, given their complexity and specific risks. Analysis - On-Chain Fundamental In this section we will analyze the investment vehicle proposed from the perspective of on chain analysis. The purpose of this block is to obtain insights from the blockchain to provide information to the reader about its fundamental value and argue the momentum of it and how it translates into the price of the asset. Node Analytica TVL & Stables The first chart shows two metrics: Total Value Locked (TVL) (Blue) and Total Stable Coins (Yellow), both measured in USD. The TVL is the number of Solanas that are “blocked” and cannot “move”—that is, it represents how much of the total circulating supply is not actually available. On the other hand, the line of SOL_STABLE, represents the amount of stable coins expressed in USD that are found in the Solana blockchain. That said, let’s look at each: A positive trend of the TVL, like the one we have in the graph, is usually linked to two main factors: an increase in the number of projects and greater DeFi activity. This in turn positively influences the number of validators/operators committed to the ecosystem. The translation is simple: capital inflow and increased interest: interest on the part of application developers, new validator/operator nodes, and infrastructure creators for DeFi markets → improves the supply and availability of services on the network → attracts users → increased capital inflow into the Solana ecosystem → increased demand = medium/long-term value. Another important aspect of the TVL is that the higher it is, the greater confidence and security it conveys. The idea is that whoever is blocking your Solana coins, is “betting” that they will be revalued or, what is the same, placing their trust in the blockchain, in addition to receiving a periodic reward for it (in the cases of staking). Not only has the TVL been on a positive trend, but so has the liquidity of the system. The curve in the amount of dollars that have flowed into Solana’s ecosystem since mid-2024 has been dramatic. Solana stands out mainly for its DeFI ecosystem, more stablecoins in the blockchain (more liquidity) implies tighter spreads, a greater market depth in the DEX (Decentralized Exchange) and Swaps. In addition, liquidity represents the entry of “new players,” whether market makers or speculators, reinforces network activity, Solana's demand, the increase in fees, etc. Which translates into an improvement in the structural growth of the blockchain. In addition, a growing ecosystem increases the number of Solanas that are burned at each epoch, and this increase affects the issuance of new Solanas in such a way that reduces the amount emitted; that is, it exerts a deflationary effect on supply that sustainably positively affects the valuation of the asset. Node Analytica Transfers, addresses & fees To reinforce the concept of the evolution of the Solana ecosystem, in the following graph we show the series of: Total Addresses, Total Transfers and Total Fees. Being Total Addresses, the total number of addresses created in the blockchain, Total Transfers, the total number of transfers executed in the blockchain and finally, Total Fees is the total number of fees in USD that have been “paid”. All this in daily temporality. The sustained growth of Total Transfers and Total Addresses, reinforces the idea that the user base and usage activity has been increasing. While it is true that within the total of addresses we can say that many of them may have stopped being active long ago, the key to this data is the slope of the curve itself and how it has accelerated since the beginning of 2024, this increase in the speed of address creation is very significant. All this keeps Solana as an attractive and competitive network in front of its counterparts (L1/L2). Initially, the entry of new users usually comes from the good performance and development of the network and the number of services it offers; however, what is interesting here is that the increase of users of an ecosystem, attracts more capital and new developments, which in turn is usually accompanied by a new wave of users. Currently, we are living the second wave after the previous bear market, which will push Solana to greater heights until seeking new points of balance. Node Analytica Transfers, addresses & fees zoom Finally, it should be noted that the spike of transfers and fees that was given at the beginning of the year. Part of Solana's ecosystem, it stands out for managing a large volume of ""speculative appetite"": memecoins. In 2025, the launch of the memoir linked to Donald Trump meant an unprecedented increase in traffic and on-chain transactions on the network, in a short space of time. This type of episodes, general volatility in the asset and in a product like SOLT must be taken into account: the impulses are strong and short as well as their effect that lacking “a fundamental value” as soon as the “fashion” passes is dissipated. However, we must not underestimate this sector, as it introduces liquidity into the global system, generates impact, and, in the long term, contributes its grain of sand to total growth. In addition, this sector is of vital importance to monitor since it is a great indicator of confirmation of soils in downward cycles and corrections in upward cycles: the continued disappearance over time of this type of volume in the blockchain, confirms practically all of the absence of appetite for speculation, typical of those moments. On the contrary, as long as there are some levels of appetite for speculation, it is one more fact that helps us to assess that we are still in a positive momentum. Node Analytica SOL on-chain transfer volume adjusted by market cap and TVL z-score To complete the current analysis, we bring you one of our metrics: On-Chain Transfer Volume Adjusted Daily. To create this indicator, we divide the volume in USD of the transactions between the difference of the market cap and the total value locked. With this, we seek to give a better context to the valuation of the asset with respect to its actual use. By dividing the total volume transacted by the really free circulating supply, we are representing how many dollars are being moved daily for each unit of dollar actually available. The ratio may rise due to increases in the LVT, increases in the volume transacted, or decreases in the price, and both variables remain constant or increase and vice versa, low. From the ground formed in July, we observed a divergence between the Z-Score and the price movement. Taking into account that, in that same period, the number of transactions and TVL fell along with the stables and the total directions increasing, it gives us a reading that the price has been pushed more by the valuation than by the real economic use. Although liquidity continues to flow in, the drop in the number of transfers may be indicative of a cooling off in blockchain activity and suggests that such capital has not yet been “deployed” via on-chain. If you look at the record, this situation has only happened once, and it was in the second stage of the rally experienced in the bull market of 2021, where after boosting close to $200, and falling back to $130, the ratio decreased while the upward momentum in the price continued. Taking into account the whole conglomerate and the rumors about the approval of the ETF and the creation of Solana treasuries companies, we can be on the cusp of a new rally driven by the inflow of liquidity from the TradFi sector and be witnessing how some speculators are already taking positions. Conclusion In short, taking advantage of Solana's fundamental on-chain moment coupled with the speculation (buy the rumor and sell the news) of the approval of ETFs and the news about the creation of Solana treasuries companies, SOLT stands for those investors looking to speculate by amplifying the cryptocurrency beta. Of course, always with active risk management. Based on the above, our recommendation is to buy tactical short-term ETF x2, looking for directional upward trends and avoiding or reducing exposure during choppy, non-trending ranges.

The total crypto market capitalisation dropped more than 9% to around $3.8 trillion, wiping out roughly $200 billion in value within hours. Bitcoin, which earlier this week hit a fresh all-time high above $126,000, was trading near $112,013 at last check, down 7.6% over the past 24 hours and 8.5% lower for the week. Ethereum fell 12.5% to $3,803, while Solana and XRP posted sharper declines of 16.5% and 14.3%, respectively. Binance’s BNB token slipped nearly 11% to $1,132, and Tether held its peg around $1.00. Record liquidations deepen the crypto market crash According to data provider Coinglass, more than $19 billion worth of leveraged crypto positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, affecting over 1.6 million traders. CoinGlass @coinglass_com · Follow The largest liquidation event in crypto history.In the past 24 hours, 1,618,240 traders were liquidated, with a total liquidation amount of $19.13 billion.The actual total is likely much higher — #Binance only reports one liquidation order per second. 5:18 am · 11 Oct 2025 227 Reply Copy link Read 14 replies Of this, $7 billion was wiped out in less than an hour on Friday, as selling pressure cascaded across exchanges. The scale of forced liquidations—caused by automatic margin calls on over-leveraged positions—may have been undercounted due to exchange reporting limits. Coinglass noted that Binance, the world’s largest exchange, only logs one liquidation order per second, potentially masking the true extent of the sell-off. Market participants said the rout began when Trump declared plans for a 100% tariff on Chinese goods and export controls on software, measures that rattled risk assets globally. Bitcoin’s fall below $115,000 triggered margin calls and a wave of automated liquidations, further accelerating the decline. Sentiment turns cautious The abrupt reversal follows a week of heightened optimism that had pushed major cryptocurrencies to record levels. Analysts said the combination of geopolitical tension, high leverage, and overheated sentiment created the perfect conditions for a sharp correction. Despite the plunge, some traders see this as a temporary shake-out. Funding rates on futures contracts have reset closer to neutral levels, and long-term holders have shown limited selling activity so far. Analysts are now watching whether Bitcoin can hold above the $110,000 support zone. A sustained breach below that level could invite further losses, while a stabilisation above it might suggest the worst of the forced selling is over. Volatility is expected to remain elevated in the coming sessions as traders digest the policy shock and await possible responses from China. For now, the market’s euphoric rally has come to an abrupt halt—brought down not by crypto’s internal flaws, but by geopolitics colliding with over-leverage.

Latest exchange data – such as Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) Confirmation Score – suggests that BTC is benefitting from strong underlying demand. CVD Confirmation Shows Strong Demand For Bitcoin According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Bitcoin’s CVD Confirmation Score – a 30-day rolling correlation between Bitcoin’s price and the CVD – is suggesting a strong resynchronization of the trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decouples From Miner Flows With -0.15 Correlation – What It Means For Price? For the uninitiated, the CVD Confirmation Score measures the 30-day correlation between Bitcoin’s price and the CVD, which tracks the net difference between taker buy and sell volumes on exchanges. A high score (above 0.7) indicates that price increases are backed by real buying pressure, while a low or negative score suggests weak or speculative momentum. Latest data from Binance shows that the CVD Confirmation Score currently hovers around 0.8 to 0.9, indicating that the current price surge is largely driven by genuine taker buying rather than a technical bounce or a short squeeze. Past data also suggests that whenever this data point has remained about 0.7 for an extended period, price corrections tend to be relatively shallow and short-lived. This is because new liquidity in the market quickly absorbs any incoming supply of BTC. The CryptoQuant analyst remarked that if the CVD Confirmation Score continues to hover above 0.7 – coupled with a decisive breakout above the $124,000 – $126,000 resistance zone – then it could be on its way to a potential target of as high as $135,000. However, any negative divergence with BTC price rising and CVD Confirmation Score dropping below 0.4 should be seen as a warning sign, as it increases the likelihood of distribution or liquidation pressure. Conversely, the $112,000 – $115,000 and $108,000 – $110,000 stand out as strong support levels for BTC. At these price levels, the CVD Confirmation Score should remain steady to ensure the uptrend remains intact. Arab Chain added: The underlying trend is bullish and supported by real inflows on Binance, the highest-volume exchange globally. Monitor three confirmation signals: CVD Confirmation stays high, open interest remains moderate, and funding does not become excessive. Any clear imbalance across these metrics will be the first warning of a momentum shift. Is BTC Due For A Correction? While bulls are hoping for an extended rally for BTC, some analysts aren’t quite convinced about the digital asset surging to new highs in the near term. For instance, crypto analyst ZVN recently stated that BTC may witness a pullback before its next surge to $150,000. Related Reading: Short-Term Holder Supply Rises By 559K Bitcoin – New Buyers Flood the Market Similarly, fellow crypto analyst Dick Dandy recently predicted that BTC may witness a massive 60% price correction, falling all the way down to $43,900.

Despite the recent volatility, bulls are showing resilience, holding price levels that suggest the broader uptrend remains intact. However, uncertainty persists as some analysts warn that a deeper correction toward lower demand zones could still occur before the next leg higher. Interestingly, onchain data provides a more optimistic signal. Metrics indicate that Bitcoin miners are not in a hurry to sell, suggesting strong conviction in the market’s long-term trajectory. This stability from miners — historically one of the largest sources of selling pressure — reflects growing confidence in the sustainability of current price levels. As the market navigates this phase of consolidation, traders are watching whether Bitcoin can reclaim $125K and establish a new base for continuation. For now, the combination of miner confidence and stable demand suggests the market is preparing for its next decisive move rather than signaling exhaustion. Bitcoin Miners Remain Strong Top onchain analyst Axel Adler shared new insights into the state of the Bitcoin mining economy through the Miner Financial Health Index — a composite metric designed to measure the financial condition of miners by accounting for hashprice, block profit, fee share, and overall cash flow. According to Adler, the index currently stands at 59%, which represents a healthy, neutral-to-bullish mining economy. This reading indicates that miners are operating in a stable environment with balanced profitability and no signs of distress. Importantly, the absence of excessive stress or euphoria suggests that miners are not under pressure to liquidate holdings, a factor that often contributes to market stability. Historically, periods when the index stays within the 50–65% range have coincided with steady price growth, as miners tend to accumulate or hold their rewards rather than selling into rallies. Adler notes that a sharp rise above 80% would mark the beginning of a distribution phase, typically associated with increased miner selling as profits peak. For now, the moderate reading highlights that the current cycle still has room for growth before reaching overheated levels. This insight aligns with other onchain indicators showing robust network activity and strong miner confidence, reinforcing the notion that Bitcoin’s recent correction remains a healthy consolidation phase rather than a sign of structural weakness. As long as miners continue to operate profitably and refrain from large-scale selling, Bitcoin’s underlying market foundation remains firm — setting the stage for potential renewed momentum once price volatility subsides. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Bulls Defend $120K Support Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $121,400, consolidating after a brief pullback from the $126,000 all-time high. The daily chart shows BTC holding above key support levels, with the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages trending upward — confirming that the broader structure remains bullish. The $120,000–$121,000 zone is emerging as a short-term support area, where buyers have stepped in to defend against further downside. A sustained move above $123,500 could open the door for a retest of $125,000, while a breakdown below $120,000 would likely expose BTC to a deeper correction toward the $117,500 level, a major horizontal support that previously acted as resistance in September. Momentum indicators suggest the market is in a cooling phase after an extended rally, allowing for potential re-accumulation before the next major move. The recent consolidation aligns with on-chain data showing miners maintaining confidence and no significant selling pressure. Bitcoin remains structurally bullish, as long as price holds above $117,500. Traders will watch for a breakout above $125,000 to confirm renewed momentum and potentially push BTC into price discovery territory once again.

His assessment is not definitive yet, but rather dependent on a specific technical condition being met. Brandt stated , “This is on my list of short candidates XRP but it is conditional upon completing the descending triangle.” The accompanying chart outlines the structure he is monitoring, showing XRP moving within a tightening range that has developed since July, when the asset hit an all-time high . The setup Brandt referred to centers on a descending triangle pattern , a formation recognized in technical analysis as a potential continuation pattern that often precedes a downward move. The pattern forms when lower highs repeatedly test a horizontal support level. In XRP’s case, the chart shows resistance descending from near $3.2 while horizontal support holds around $2.68. The price has compressed between these levels, creating a narrowing zone of trading activity. Ripple —> Certified as Sharia-Compliant by the Central Bank of Bahrain.

The upper boundary of the triangle connects several lower highs from August through early October, while the base level has been tested multiple times near $2.68743. The chart shows an 8-day and an 18-day moving average with both trending slightly downward and reflecting weakening momentum. A completed descending triangle would require a clear breakdown below the support line. If the market closes below that threshold decisively, it would validate Brandt’s condition for a potential short setup. The chart’s Average Directional Index (ADX) reading near 12.61 suggests low trend strength, indicating that the market is consolidating rather than trending. The Average True Range (ATR) also remains subdued, signaling reduced volatility during the consolidation phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Support and Breakdown Levels The current price of $2.8 sits only marginally above the key support zone. The base at $2.68743 represents the critical level traders are likely to watch for confirmation. Should this level give way, the next historical support appears around $2.22, a point noted on the chart as a prior consolidation area. Further below, a long-term reference at $1.879 may represent a deeper target if bearish pressure intensifies. Until a decisive move occurs, XRP remains confined within its converging pattern. The declining highs reinforce seller control, but buyers have managed to hold the lower boundary repeatedly, maintaining short-term equilibrium. Brandt’s comment suggests that he is not preemptively shorting but waiting for the market to confirm the setup with a definitive breakdown.

The sizable transaction, detected by on-chain tracking platforms, comes at a critical juncture for XRP, as the token struggles to maintain stability amid fluctuating market sentiment and renewed whale activity. Large-scale transfers to centralized exchanges like Bitstamp are often viewed as potential sell signals, suggesting that holders might be preparing to offload substantial amounts of their assets. This latest move, therefore, has raised eyebrows across the XRP community, with some interpreting it as a sign of impending selling pressure, while others see it as a strategic liquidity maneuver linked to institutional activity. Market data shows XRP trading within a tight consolidation range, with the altcoin having shed off 19.8% of its value in the past week to trade at $2.44 per CoinGecko data . Despite short-term uncertainty, on-chain metrics indicate consistent accumulation by long-term holders, suggesting that confidence in Ripple’s broader utility narrative remains intact. Therefore, the $42.1 million XRP transfer to Bitstamp has reignited market speculation, underscoring XRP’s unmatched liquidity and testing investor sentiment. Whether it marks strategic accumulation or large-scale distribution, one thing is certain that XRP remains a central force shaping institutional strategy and the evolving digital finance landscape. Banks to Turn to Ripple as the Fastest Route to ISO 20022 Readiness by November 2025 According to renowned crypto researcher SMQKE, global banks are increasingly positioning Ripple as their preferred path toward ISO 20022 readiness ahead of the November 2025 deadline. The upcoming transition , mandated across the global payments ecosystem, requires financial institutions to adopt a standardized, data-rich messaging format designed to enhance transparency, interoperability, and efficiency in cross-border settlements. ISO 20022 is more than a compliance update, it’s a structural transformation that compels banks to modernize outdated messaging and processing systems. As legacy infrastructure struggles to adapt to the new standard’s demands, Ripple’s blockchain-based technology is emerging as the fastest, most cost-effective alternative. By leveraging the XRP Ledger and RippleNet, institutions can streamline transactions while maintaining full regulatory alignment. As SMQKE notes, banks are under mounting pressure to achieve ISO 20022 compliance without disrupting daily operations. Ripple’s modular technology delivers a plug-and-play upgrade path that slashes costs, accelerates integration, and ensures seamless interoperability. With unmatched speed, low fees, and full transaction visibility, Ripple stands out as the most practical bridge between legacy systems and real-time, blockchain-powered settlement networks, just as the November 2025 deadline draws near. Conclusion The $42.1M XRP transfer to Bitstamp spotlights whales and institutions steering market moves. While sparking short-term sell-off speculation, it underscores XRP’s deep liquidity and strategic role in the crypto ecosystem.

The selloff drove price as low as $1.64 before a partial recovery to $2.36, with volumes surging 164% above the 30-day average — a sign of forced deleveraging across corporate desks. What to Know • XRP fell from $2.82 to $2.36 between Oct 10, 01:00 and Oct 11, 00:00, posting a 16% daily loss. • Intraday volatility peaked at 43%, with prices briefly wicking to $1.64 during high-frequency liquidation sweeps. • Institutional futures open interest dropped from $9.0B to $8.85B as long liquidations hit $21M versus $2M shorts. • 320M XRP transferred to exchange wallets in the past week, confirming whale distribution pressure. • Late-session buying stabilized price near $2.35–$2.40, with accumulation volumes exceeding 12M in the final 15 minutes. News Background • Ripple’s ecosystem faces macro and structural stress: global trade tensions, diverging central-bank policy, and uncertainty over U.S. digital banking licenses. • Ripple’s National Trust charter deadline passed on Oct 7, heightening regulatory risk premiums around XRP-linked institutional products. • Despite the drawdown, on-chain data shows long-term holders adding below $2.40, suggesting value-based repositioning. Price Action Summary • XRP opened near $2.82 and sold off aggressively by mid-session, breaching key supports at $2.70 and $2.50. • The heaviest liquidation occurred between 15:00–21:00 UTC, when hourly volume hit 817.6M. • Low of $1.64 marked potential capitulation point; bounce to $2.36 capped at resistance around $2.84. • The final 60 minutes (23:41–00:40) saw a stabilization move from $2.31 → $2.38 (+2%), with algos breaking $2.35 on sustained bids. Technical Analysis • Support: Established around $2.30–$2.35; extended downside risk to $2.22 if volume dries up. • Resistance: Layered at $2.84–$2.90, with $3.05 as macro breakout trigger. • Volume: Up 164% vs. 30-day average — capitulation-grade turnover. • Trend: 75-day symmetrical triangle broken to downside; needs close above $2.90 to regain structure. • Momentum: RSI levels near multi-month lows; volatility bands expanding, signaling potential base formation. What Traders Are Watching • Whether $2.30 support zone attracts sustained whale accumulation. • Rebuild of open interest following $150M contraction in derivatives markets. • Regulatory clarity post-Ripple charter review, and its impact on corporate adoption. • Cross-asset spillover from BTC’s $125K rally — potential relief rotation back into XRP. • Technical confirmation above $2.90 to invalidate short-term bearish bias.",Markets|XRP|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-11 05:32:37

Bitcoin’s price, for example, took one of its most painful nosedives in recent history, dumping from over $122,000 to $105,000 on some exchanges and even to as low as $101,000 on others. The altcoins were obliterated as well, with massive double-digit price drops from the majority of them. Here’s what we know so far. Valuermarket’s report classified the event as the “largest single-day liquidation in the history of digital assets.” The initial numbers of $250 million in an hour and $900 million on a 24-hour scale when BTC had dipped to $117,000 pale in comparison to what happened next. Data from CoinGlass shows a violent picture of $19.30 billion wrecked in the span of a day. Naturally, longs represent the lion’s share, with nearly $17 billion. However, the crypto market’s minor recovery attempt since then has also harmed some short traders, with $2.5 billion in such liquidations. The number of wrecked traders is off the charts as well. It typically remains around 200,000 during a bad liquidation event, but has now skyrocketed to over 1,660,000. That’s more than 1.6 million traders. Liquidation Data from CoinGlass The most obvious reason for this calamity was Trump’s actions on Friday evening when he threatened China with a new set of substantial tariffs after saying that Beijing had been lying for a long time. The losses on Hyperliquid alone account for a big portion of the entire wipe-out. After all, the single-largest liquidation occured on Hyperliquid, with over $200 million gone on a ETH-USDT pair. I counted 1010 traders that are down $100k+ today and 206 traders that are down $1M+ today on Hyperliquid 358 of those accounts lost everything and have ~0 balance, including one person who lost all $19M+ in their account pic.twitter.com/aAHFwidXIG — Conor (@jconorgrogan) October 10, 2025 Despite the majority of traders in losses, there are some that made significant profits. According to MLM, one whale closed 90% of their BTC short and fully closed their ETH short, profiting around $200 million in just a day. In case you didn’t know – the BTC whale closed 90% of his BTC short and fully closed his ETH short, making around $190–$200M profit in just one day on Hyperliquid. The crazy part is that he shorted another 9 figs worth of BTC and ETH minutes before the cascade happened.

Many altcoins briefly lost over 90% of their value. IoTeX (IOTX), in particular, briefly dropped to $0, while Cosmos (ATOM) similarly plummeted to zero. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes offered a critical assessment of the crash. He stated that market rumors suggest that the sudden drop was triggered by the automatic liquidation of collateral tied to cross-margined positions by some major centralized exchanges (CEX). ATOM fiyatında yaşanan büyük düşüşü gösteren grafik. Chart showing the decline in IOTX price. Related News: BREAKING: Stablecoin That Lost Its $1 Peg During the Big Crash Issues Statement Arthur Hayes made the following statement: “Word on the street is that many altcoins fell sharply as major CEXs automatically liquidated collateral tied to cross margin positions. Congrats to those who bought on the dip, we won't see these levels again for a long time.” According to experts, such sudden “flash crashes” are typically caused by a lack of liquidity, algorithmic trading, and the chain liquidation of leveraged positions. Hayes's statements suggest that this market crash may have been caused by an automated liquidation chain rather than a systematic error or manipulation. *This is not investment advice.

This case adds to the growing list of lawsuits that big tech companies operating in the AI space have been hit with. The proposed class action, filed on Thursday by Susana Martinez-Conde and Stephen Macknik, professors at the SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in Brooklyn, alleges that Apple used illegal shadow libraries containing thousands of copyrighted books to train its AI system . The neuroscientists say that among those works were their own titles, Champions of Illusion: The Science Behind Mind-Boggling Images and Mystifying Brain Puzzles and Sleights of Mind: What the Neuroscience of Magic Reveals About Our Everyday Deceptions. The complaint claims that Apple utilized datasets made up of pirated and copyright-infringing materials scraped from the internet, without the authors’ consent. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and an injunction to stop Apple from further using their copyrighted works. Apple’s AI push and the ‘shadow library’ problem Apple Intelligence is Apple’s suite of AI-powered features built into its devices, such as the iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The complaint notes that the day after Apple officially announced Apple Intelligence, its market value rose by more than $200 billion, “the single most lucrative day in the history of the company,” the lawsuit said. The plaintiffs allege that Apple, like other AI developers, uses shadow libraries, which are massive online repositories that store plagiarized and unauthorized copies of academic, scientific, and literary works. The claimants say that their work was used without permission. Apple has not publicly disclosed the full range of datasets used to train Apple Intelligence. The lawsuit argues that this lack of transparency masks the company’s reliance on illegally sourced data, in contrast to its marketing emphasis on user privacy and responsible innovation. AI firms face a wave of copyright challenges In early September, a group of authors filed a copyright suit against Apple, claiming that their works were used without consent to train Apple’s AI tools. The company joins a growing list of technology firms, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Anthropic, that have faced lawsuits over the unauthorized use of copyrighted content to develop generative AI systems. As Cryptopolitan reported , Anthropic itself agreed in September to pay $1.5 billion to settle a separate class action lawsuit brought by authors over the training of its chatbot Claude. AI developers claim that the process they use to train their models qualifies as fair use because it transforms the data to learn linguistic or visual patterns rather than reproducing the original works. However, authors and publishers have a different view of the matter, as they maintain that the copying involved is extensive and commercial in nature, violating their rights and undermining their creative livelihoods. High stakes for Apple and the AI industry For Apple, which entered the generative AI race later than its rivals, the lawsuit threatens its effort to position Apple Intelligence as a privacy-focused, ethically trained alternative to other chatbots, especially when the accusations are in stark contrast to what it projects itself to be. Legal experts say the outcome of these cases could change how AI systems are built and trained. A ruling against Apple or similar firms could compel companies to license copyrighted works at scale, significantly increasing development costs and potentially slowing innovation. On the other hand, a ruling favoring tech firms could entrench the fair-use precedent and limit compensation options for creators.

A New Era For Crypto In Mainstream Finance The renewed interest in stablecoins comes in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s endorsement of the sector, which has reignited discussions about integrating blockchain technology into mainstream finance. Currently, the stablecoin market is heavily dominated by Tether (USDT), based in El Salvador, which accounts for approximately $179 billion of the total $310 billion in stablecoins circulating, according to data from CoinGecko. The banks involved in this new initiative, which also includes Santander, Barclays, BNP Paribas, MUFG, TD Bank Group, and others, have stated that the goal is to assess whether a collaborative industry offering could enhance competition and bring the benefits of digital assets to the market, all while ensuring compliance.

Analyst Charts Path To $0.60 Notably, France’s Societe Generale recently became the first major bank to issue a dollar-backed stablecoin through its digital asset subsidiary, although it has seen limited adoption, with only $30.6 million currently in circulation. In addition to this consortium, a separate group of nine European banks, including prominent names like ING and UniCredit, is also in the process of launching a euro-denominated stablecoin. Meanwhile, Citi has made strides in the stablecoin space by investing in BVNK, a company focused on stablecoin infrastructure. Demand For Stablecoin Solutions Grows Although Citi has not disclosed the amount of its investment, the co-founder of BVNK, Chris Harmse, told during an interview with CNBC, that the company’s valuation has surpassed $750 million, as reported in its latest funding round. Harmse remarked on the increasing demand for stablecoin infrastructure, particularly with the emergence of regulatory clarity through the passage of the GENIUS Act in the US. This has prompted major US banks to strategically position themselves in the crypto ecosystem. Citi’s CEO, Jane Fraser, has indicated that the bank is contemplating the issuance of its own stablecoin while also exploring custodian services for digital assets. However, Citi is not alone in its pursuit of digital asset integration; JPMorgan Chase has already launched its own stablecoin-like token, JPMD.

52978492,603797,1760162459,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52978492.jpeg,Chainlink (LINK) Price Builds Momentum as Reserves Grow and Jovay Network Integration Nears,https://bitcoinist.com/chainlink-link-price-builds-momentum-reserves-grow/,"Chainlink (LINK) is grinding higher above a key pivot, trading near $22.5 with a $15.25 billion market cap and roughly $1.68B in 24-hour volume. Positioning looks constructive as open interest has edged up to $1.38 billion (+0.43%), while derivatives volume climbed 10%, a combo that typically supports continuation when spot holds support. Funding remains modestly positive, suggesting bullish bias without dangerous leverage. On-chain flows echo that tone. The Chainlink Reserve , a program that accumulates LINK using protocol revenues, added 45,729 LINK this week, lifting its balance to 463,190 LINK (about $10 million at recent prices). Jovay Network picks Chainlink for CCIP and Data Streams Fundamentals continue to expand. Jovay Network selected Chainlink CCIP as its native cross-chain communication standard from day one and adopted Chainlink Data Streams to deliver secure, low-latency market data. For developers building tokenized asset markets and institutional-grade DeFi, that means simpler interoperability and cleaner market feeds, two real-world utilities that strengthen the LINK demand flywheel (node rewards, staking, and service payments). Beyond Jovay, Chainlink remains the leading oracle and interoperability stack across major chains, with expanding partner networks and cross-chain integrations. In prior cycles, a similar cadence in enterprise integrations preceded periods of relative strength for LINK versus the broader altcoin market. Price levels to watch: Can LINK Clear $25? Technically, LINK reclaimed the $22 zone and is testing it as new support. Holding that shelf keeps a breakout toward $23.00–$23.20 in play; a decisive close above that band opens the path to the $25.60 resistance cluster. A push through $25.60 would validate a bullish continuation from the current bull-flag structure and refocus buyers on $27.8 (prior high) next. On the downside, $21.50–$21.90 is the first defense. A daily close below $21.50 risks a deeper check of $20.70–$20.00; persistent weakness could revisit $19, where demand previously re-emerged. Until those lower levels break, the mix of rising OI, healthy spot volume, and Reserve accumulation favors buy-the-dip flows over a trend reversal. With reserves growing, derivatives steady, and Jovay’s CCIP/Data Streams integration adding another real-world pillar, Chainlink’s momentum base is firming. If bulls defend $22 and flip $23–$23.2 into support, a run at $25–$25.60 looks increasingly likely.

President Donald Trump’s retaliatory tariffs caused the market’s downturn. Of the $9.55 billion lost, about $8 billion came from long positions and $1.55 billion from shorts, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being hit the hardest. Bitcoin leads with $1.37 billion in liquidations, followed by Ethereum at $1.26 billion. HTX also handled the biggest single wipeout: $87.53 million in BTC/USDT, according to CoinGlass. President Trump called on China to change its policy by November 1 Cryptocurrency prices plummeted after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans for an additional 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, along with new software export restrictions. Nearly all cryptocurrencies plunged in two major steps after Trump warned of the new levies. Bitcoin plunged more than 12% following Trump’s Truth Social announcement, pulling back from its fresh all-time high near $125,000 to around $113,000 as of Friday morning. It even touched an intraday low just below $102,000 late Friday before recovering slightly. Now the token is changing hands at $111,327. Ravi Doshi, co-head of markets at prime broker FalconX, commented, “A renewed trade war between China and the US erupted on Friday, causing uncertainty in markets and a rout in risk assets,” adding that the firm’s derivatives team saw a surge in interest for downside hedges during the session. Trump’s decision to announce new tariffs came in response to Beijing’s latest policy change. On Thursday, China’s Ministry of Commerce said foreign exporters will need licenses for products containing more than 0.1% of rare earth materials sourced from China. Some reports suggested Trump canceled his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. However, he later indicated he’s still open to meeting and might roll back the tariff plan if Beijing reverses its policy by November 1. Should the tariffs be called off, crypto spot prices may bounce back, but the liquidations would remain final. A whale managed to profit on Hyperliquid In terms of leveraged positions, the crypto market lost over $19 billion within 24 hours. According to CoinGlass data, longs accounted for the bulk of the losses, at around $16.75 billion, while shorts incurred $2.47 billion in losses. Again, the leading losses were incurred by Bitcoin at $5.34 billion and Ethereum at $4.39 billion, with Solana contributing $2 billion, and other altcoins accounting for an additional $1.5 billion. There have been warnings from analysts that, if sentiment does not quicken sooner rather than later, this huge wave of liquidations might deepen the downturn. Tech gauges – such as RSI and MACD – across most currencies remain heavily oversold, which suggests more short-term pressure will not be far off. Despite the widespread losses, at least one major player on Hyperliquid managed to profit, taking short positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum worth hundreds of millions and earning an estimated $190 million. Crypto trader by the domain name, mlmabc, who had been tracking the whale’s movements, confirmed , “The BTC whale closed 90% of his BTC short and fully closed his ETH short, making around $190–$200M profit in just one day on Hyperliquid.

These comments were interpreted as a hardening stance on international trade. For financial markets, such language signals possible disruptions to global supply chains, increased costs for multinational firms, and reduced investor confidence in near-term economic cooperation. The result was rapid repositioning by both institutional and retail participants. Traditional markets reacted immediately, and the risk-off sentiment quickly crossed into the cryptocurrency sector. As automated systems and derivatives markets adjusted, liquidity in major digital assets tightened. XRP’s Decline in the Broader Market Context XRP’s 17% decline must be viewed against the backdrop of an overall market retreat triggered by macroeconomic uncertainty. Large-cap cryptocurrencies often mirror broader financial sentiment during sudden geopolitical escalations. In this case, capital flowed out of risk assets, with traders opting for defensive positioning rather than exposure to volatile tokens. Unlike asset-specific events such as legal developments or ecosystem changes, today’s XRP price dump was macro-driven. There was no major internal update from the XRP ecosystem ; instead, its decline aligned with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other high-liquidity tokens facing coordinated sell pressure. Amplifying the Market Response Wendy O’s reaction brought further attention to how digital asset traders are processing this event. While her commentary emphasized the severity of the drop, it is crucial to separate sentiment from structural analysis. The Kobeissi Letter provided the factual basis: an abrupt market reaction directly tied to a major political statement. Influential voices within crypto then broadcast concern, reinforcing caution across exchanges. This amplification effect contributes to accelerated volatility. Social commentary, particularly from known figures, often influences short-term decisions among retail traders, which can intensify price movements already underway due to macro catalysts. With XRP now trading at $2.32, down 17% in 24 hours, market participants are shifting their attention to forthcoming policy signals.

According to data from ForkLog, BTC addresses holding less than 1 BTC sent more coins into exchanges in recent days, a classic sign of first-time buyer activity. Meanwhile, large capital flows continue overtaking headlines: global crypto ETPs logged $5.67 billion in net inflows last week, pushing Bitcoin beyond $126,000. That mix – heavy institutional interest and active small-scale participants, sets the stage for a new presale designed for accessibility: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Why now is ideal for small-budget investors It’s not just about access – risk control matters. Many retail traders are wary of moving into high-cap assets when volatility spikes, and swinging from ETH to memecoins feels like guessing. Instead, newcomers are gravitating toward projects that transparently advertise tiered entry, guided onboarding, and built-in audits as trust anchors. Analysts now suggest that cycles once dominated by whales may increasingly reward projects that welcome and retain small investors, especially when combined with tight tokenomics and consistent community engagement. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale: engineered for everyone Crypto’s biggest breakthroughs rarely start with large sums – they begin with conviction and timing. MAGACOIN FINANCE is redefining what’s possible for investors with small budgets, offering a clear and measurable growth path. At its $0.00051213 presale price and $0.007 target listing , the project embeds a 13.6× built-in upside that even first-time buyers can calculate instantly. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its transparency. Audits by CertiK and HashEx have confirmed its credibility, while its community-led marketing and patriotic brand identity keep engagement authentic and relatable. The presale’s rapid sellouts reflect more than hype, they represent a cultural shift, where retail traders are learning that discipline and timing often outperform speculation. For investors who missed DOGE or SHIB early, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides a chance to join a structured movement with both heart and strategy, proof that in crypto, starting small can still mean thinking big. Support, education, and clarity as retention tools What helps small-budget investors stay in, and keep participating, is support. MAGACOIN FINANCE emphasizes this by providing shared tutorials, live Q&A, and community feedback loops to address doubts early. Many projects leave newcomers to fend for themselves, but this one operationalizes mentorship. The presale interface is intuitive, starting with wallet setup, gas estimation, and allocation transparency, so first-time participants don’t feel like they’ve jumped into the deep end without a lifeline. Momentum builds confidence for new participants Beyond structure and support, momentum plays a psychological role. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s referral programs, community contests, and milestone reveals help amplify excitement while keeping it grounded in real metrics. Each new user who participates becomes a micro-ambassador, imaging what “small-budget early entry” truly means. As larger investors and institutions hold back in consolidation phases, these grassroots-driven narratives often become the breakout story, and they tend to attract waves of fresh capital. Bridging retail access with cycle timing While institutional flows dominate headlines, the next phase of growth often comes when the bigger players step back and leave room for retail-driven discovery. MAGACOIN FINANCE enters exactly at that pivot: many projects now are already too expensive or overextended. With $16+ already raised, verified audits, and accessible entry mechanics, it provides an opportunity for new participants to join before the narrative gets crowded. Crypto cycles reward those who enter with structure, not chaos. For small-budget investors ready to take the first step, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers clarity, community, and real upside, with the kind of door open access rarely seen in presale stages.

The ruling represents one of the biggest patent verdicts against the South Korean tech conglomerate in recent years. The jury ruled that Samsung’s Galaxy phones, laptops, and other wireless products employed technology that infringed on four patents owned by Collision Communications. The verdict came following a four-and-a-half-day trial and two hours of jury deliberation. The case was presided over by U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap at the Eastern District of Texas, a court known for handling major patent battles. Jury rules Samsung copied Collision’s network technology Collision said Samsung devices used its technology without permission or payment for the rights to use it. The company stated that Samsung has become very popular by utilizing technology that did not belong to it. At the same time, Collision struggled for years to bring that same technology to market independently. The jury reviewed evidence from Samsung’s own emails and technical documents that showed Samsung had known about Collision’s patents long before the lawsuit. Both companies discussed possible business partnerships and licensing deals for the patented technology between 2011 and 2014. Witnesses testified that the tech heavyweight’s engineers and managers clearly understood the value of the technology and even praised its ability to reduce interference and improve data speeds. These features could make Samsung’s products more competitive, but the firm walked away from the discussions without signing any agreement or paying for the technology. The company continued to release devices that used the same patented systems. The jury awarded $445,484,160 in damages to Collision Communications. It imposed a running royalty, meaning Samsung would be liable for additional payments in the future if it continues to sell phones, laptops, or other devices that utilize the same technology. Small U.S. firm wins major case after years of legal battle Collision Communications spent more than ten years fighting to protect its inventions from Samsung Electronics. Lead attorney Brad Caldwell from Caldwell Cassady & Curry in Dallas said the victory represented recognition and respect for honest, hard work. He explained that the founders of Collision had invested not only their time but also a significant portion of their savings and energy in developing their technology and keeping it alive through years of challenges. Caldwell described the trial as among the most challenging his team had worked on, devoting much of its effort to simplifying some complex concepts about how wireless signals are transmitted between wireless phones, cellphone towers, and routers, so that jurors could understand them. His team worked for months to write clear explanations that would make the science easy to understand. Samsung’s attorneys, Victoria F. Maroulis and Sean Pak of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, denied the allegations and contended that the patents were invalid. They said the smartphone manufacturer’s own engineers had independently developed their versions of the technology and had not copied Collision’s work. The jury found that the tech firm committed willful infringement because it was aware of the inventions but proceeded to use them anyway. Samsung and its lawyers have not yet publicly commented on the case, although they could still appeal the decision. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Ripple’s XRP didn’t go unscathed. In fact, it was one of the altcoins that painted massive red wicks, dropping to as low as $1.2 on the Binance perpetual contracts charts. That’s a 60% drawdown, which, not surprisingly, had a lot of traders liquidated. So much so that, in fact, almost $1 billion worth of leveraged positions were wiped out in the past 24 hours. Why is the XRP Price Going Down? While reasons remain unclear and speculative at best, the fact is that the total cryptocurrency market went through arguably its worst crash in years. As CryptoPotato reported , close to $20 billion worth of leveraged positions were liquidated in the past hours, as Bitcoin’s price dropped from more than $122,000 to $105,000 on some crypto exchanges. Naturally, and as it’s almost always the case, altcoins had it worst. Believe it or not, XRP wasn’t even amongst the worst performers. ATOM, for instance, saw close to 99% of its spot value deleted before bouncing back. XRP also bounced back and is currently trading at around $2.4 on Binance. Source: TradingView There is no specific reason that’s isolated to XRP relating to this market crash and its decline is likely attributed to the broader wipeout in the industry. However, the event highlights the dangers of leverage and, once again, shows how much more volatile altcoins are and how much thinner their trading order books are as opposed to Bitcoin’s.

CONY: Why Leverage Outperforms Covered Calls In Coinbase ETFs,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829242-coiw-vs-cony-why-leverage-outperforms-covered-calls-in-coinbase-etfs?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary Bitcoin’s long-term bullish outlook supports leveraged income ETFs like Roundhill COIN WeeklyPay ETF over covered-call strategies such as YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF. COIW benefits from active leverage management, balancing risk and upside capture better than CONY. CONY underperforms in flat or volatile markets, offering limited drawdown protection and weak upside participation. Overall, COIW is a Hold with better risk-reward; CONY is downgraded to Sell. As I look at Coinbase and its two different income generating wrapper ETFs, let me summarize my findings across my analyses on income plans and cryptocurrencies so far. My previous analyses in the bitcoin space and option based income plans have mostly concluded thus. One, bitcoin is going through a structurally supportive phase (therefore read bullish). Two, leveraged income strategies are better than covered call option based strategies in most cases - they are simpler and perform in the long run. The only thing they need is a long term bullish thesis on the underlying. And three, those option based income plans do better, that either save drawdowns significantly or capture upsides better - usually option ETFs do either of these well, not both, and they should be used tactically for their strengths. Some option strategies do neither, and needless to say are best avoided. In the crypto space, a spate of supportive legislations like the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts could bring in required transparency as increased crypto adoption drives demand. Recent news around funding for Strategic Bitcoin Reserve ( SBR ) starting anytime soon, for example, lends support to wider institutional recognition of bitcoin as a strategic asset, including state entities. A leveraged asset like the Roundhill COIN WeeklyPay ETF ( COIW ) needs to have a bull thesis on the underlying Coinbase in the long term to work out. Bitcoins do look like meeting that long term bullish thesis criteria. How about Coinbase? The Underlying Thesis - Coinbase In my last article about the option income ETF based on Coinbase - the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) - I have taken a cautiously bullish stance on Coinbase. That still holds. On the positive side, I like Coinbase's strategic positioning through the Deribit acquisition, making Coinbase one of the leading derivatives players in the crypto space. USDC based payments enablement and integration with Shopify and Stripe move Coinbase into payments infrastructure - more revenue diversification. The structurally supportive crypto ETF inflows also support long term crypto led growth for Coinbase. I ended up with a tactical Hold rating because of Coinbase's high beta, volatility, valuation concerns, and momentum-driven nature. Long term investors in COIW will need a bullish long term thesis in COIN. Unfortunately, the crypto space is still maturing, and a long term thesis is not really as foolproof as, say, in big tech. However, bitcoin is bullish long term. COIN should mature and stabilize along with that growth and expect no regulatory or competitive threats over the next few years. So, I would still position COIN as a cautious Buy - or Hold tactically for medium term investors. CONY's Stronghold In my earlier CONY analysis, I have shown how CONY is not the greatest option income performer even in what can be called flat markets end to end - this is because such flat markets for Coinbase are often extremely volatile, wherein CONY manages to lose several percentage points (9-10 percentage points) even when COIN is relatively flat at 2% on a close to close basis. The data below shows a flat period over a year, with upsides of up to ~80% in between. Data by YCharts The reason why CONY fails to do well in such prolonged and volatile but flat markets on a closing basis is the volatility and its inability to catch up with sharp upsides in COIN. In the below chart, we can see CONY's total returns are less than half of what has been a sharp rally in Coinbase. And this is expected - some option income ETFs write calls on smaller parts of the portfolio and capture upsides better through active management, not CONY. Data by YCharts But does CONY's upside underperformance get compensated on drawdowns? It does. For a prolonged drawdown period between December 2024 to April 2025, CONY saves 4-5 percentage points in total returns than COIN. However, the drawdown mitigation is not even close to the kind of opportunity loss we see on upsides. The net result is that CONY suffers even in flat markets - tracing almost all of the drawdown but capturing less than half of any upside run. Data by YCharts Scenarios and Why Leverage is Better CONY's apparently underlying-agonistic strategy does promise alpha and income even if the underlying does not move or undergoes mild corrections, in theory - however we have seen how that is not the case in real market conditions. CONY seems to need a bull thesis as much as the perceived underlying dependency of a straightforward strategy like COIW's, where a 20% leverage is applied on weekly returns. Before we move on to scenarios, I want to clarify that a 20% leverage is more conservative than it sounds. If say Coinbase crashes by 10% in two consecutive weeks, the total drawdown is 19% at the end of two weeks. COIW will be down by 12% each week i.e. 22.56% down in the same period. Now 22.56% is only 18.7% of the 19% drawdown in Coinbase cumulatively (not 20% as may seem apparent). This impact magnifies as we continue to compound returns or drawdowns over weeks. Now, even ignoring that more conservative than the headline 20% leverage, I have constructed three scenarios and compared COIW and CONY. Scenario 1: Coinbase corrects by 50% in 6 months - Here expect CONY to be down by ~45% as we have seen before. COIW will be down by 60% (assuming no compounding effect, while in reality the true drawdown should be closer to 55%). CONY definitely works in this scenario, but the gap with COIW is not huge. Scenario 2: Coinbase remains flat for 6 months - We have seen that unless Coinbase's volatility subsides, CONY is likely to be down by 5-10%. COIW should be flat. So even in neutral circumstances, COIW seems a better proposition than CONY's covered call mechanism. Scenario 3: Coinbase rallies by 50% in 6 months - CONY captures 25-30% of this rally at best. COIW rallies 55-60%. The difference here is much more material than the risks on the downside. Get a Bull Thesis Anyway and Choose COIW After looking at the scenarios, it should be clear that unless a call writing strategy is efficient and active, or the underlying optimally volatile (unlike in the case of Coinbase, where volatility is almost too high), it is better to rely on the underlying's bull thesis than on the option mechanics to generate income irrespective of the underlying moves. If there is a bull thesis, then a moderately leveraged income plan works out better - the performance differential is material in flat and rallying conditions. On the other hand, the leveraged plan surely underperforms the option plan on drawdowns, but the margins are thinner compared to the other two scenarios. For a bullish Coinbase thesis, I would conclude the following. I would recommend a Buy for the direct Coinbase stock and encourage a DIY style payout over time. This avoids the pitfalls of leverage and balances the risk reward best. Since, I am actually Hold to cautious Buy on Coinbase in the medium term, conscious of valuations and volatility, I would recommend a Hold on COIW - it carries its risks although it balances them well with rewards on rallies. The Hold rating looks reasonable particularly because I am not bearish on Coinbase. The rating that needs correction in the light of this thesis on COIN and COIW, is CONY's. I have rated it Hold thus far because of tactical use cases in drawdowns. But that use case also yields hardly a few percentage points at best. I think, to align ratings meaningfully, I will need to downgrade CONY from a Hold to Sell. COIW is a Hold and a better bet given its risk reward profile and a mildly bullish underlying thesis. CONY's performance neither captures upside, nor adds meaningful drawdown benefits. It even stutters in flat markets. COIW's Performance and Yields versus CONY Although I would expect COIW's leverage to show up at around ~15% due to compounding, actual performance shows COIW tracing COIN through both bullish and bearish market conditions. That implies the leverage is being actively managed, most likely no leverage most of the times. That gives me greater confidence in COIW by removing the constant 20% leverage overhang and risks thereof, although COIW retains the ability to employ the full 20% leverage in conducive markets. Data by YCharts The other thing I like about COIW is its more conservative yield compared to CONY. COIW has paid out ~$18 in 32 weeks. That translates to an annualized yield of ~$29.5 i.e. ~63%. This is still aggressive and comes with NAV erosion concerns too, but is much lesser than the CONY's $10.25 payout in the past year, that translates to a yield of 133% of current prices. COIW does stand a chance of maintaining its NAV in bullish conditions in comparison to CONY, whose NAV erosion appears to be irrespective of market conditions because of the very high yields. It also helps that despite the leverage, COIW's expense ratio is 0.99%, compared to CONY's 1.22%. This may, of course, increase in the future as COIW starts employing higher leverage compared to today's levels. All in all, COIW outdoes CONY in most market conditions. Its active leverage management means the downside is not drastically worse than CONY's. I would recommend COIW to any investor who has a bullish thesis on COIN. I will keep it a Hold because its leverage risks and also because COIN has a few pressures on its otherwise bullish thesis - i.e. valuations and volatility. But in most market conditions, it has better credentials than CONY, which I downgrade to a Sell.",COIN|COIW|CONY,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-11 06:56:17

Several altcoins have crashed between 20% to 40% as the market recoiled. Naturally, bulls may be wondering whether the recovery could be swift or take time. Understanding the process that follows a crash like this suggests the recovery is likely to be gradual, testing the patience of bullish investors. ""When the market turns like this, there’s usually a pretty straightforward playbook for the aftermath,"" Zaheer Ebtikar, chief investment officer and founder of Split Capital, said on X. Here's what a typical sequence looks like: Market bleeds and market makers pause The initial phase involves the market ""bleeding out"" or tanking deeper as liquidation orders flood exchanges, pushing prices lower. We saw that happen overnight as several altcoins, including XRP, DOGE, and others, crashed to multi-month lows. Amid this, market makers, the entities responsible for providing liquidity and ensuring orderly trading, usually step back temporarily to manage their risk and focus on ""refilling by first taking out big spot and perp abrs on assets,"" as Ebtikar noted. It means they address price mismatches between spot and futures markets with arbitrage plays involving opposing positions in the two markets. This process prevents an immediate rebound. Data feeds stabilize This phase refers to the period after a market crash, when information channels that traders and market makers rely on begin to work reliably again. During the crash, exchanges and the tech systems providing real-time updates, order book data, and order executions often see delays or outages due to high volatility. Once the data feed stabilizes, market makers and large traders start absorbing major sell orders to restore market equilibrium. These participants capitalize on liquidation orders, which receive priority in order books and facilitate bargain hunting. Given the sheer size of the forced liquidations observed overnight, this absorption phase can span several days. Market stabilization This stage involves dealers and market makers closing out their long positions, which they initially acquired at bargain prices while absorbing liquidation orders, to profit from a potential rebound. ""Once dealers fill long they will start unwinding spot and perp when the market is back to equilibrium. This is when the market hits a local maxima and the Dalai Lama chart starts hitting. Some assets that have tighter supply will look better than others,"" Ebtikar said. This process is usually slow, especially over the weekend when the spot ETF's don't operate, reducing the overall market liquidity. This lower liquidity makes it harder and slower for dealers to unwind large positions without causing big price moves, so unwinding tends to slow down during these periods. Market finds a floor Eventually, the market finds a floor, settling into a more stable range, and investor confidence dented by the crash begins to rebuild. To conclude, the large liquidations observed overnight will likely prolong the multi-step bottoming process, involving strategic buying of liquidation orders by market makers, liquidity challenges over the weekend, and new price anchoring. All this being said, if the headline risk — continued U.S. - China trade tensions — doesn't subside, all bets are off as to when this will end.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|XRP|Solana|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|XRP|BTC|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-11 06:57:56

Vladimir Chistyukhin, the First Deputy Chairman of the Bank of Russia, highlighted that this cautious approach aims to prevent commercial banks from making cryptocurrency trading their primary focus. New Role Of Banks In Crypto Assets Chistyukhin emphasized the need for strict capital and reserve standards, asserting that while excluding banks from cryptocurrency transactions would be unjustified, it is essential to maintain conservative views on the banking sector’s involvement with digital assets. In his statement, Chistyukhin asserted: We hold conservative views and think about how appropriate it is for the banking sector to include cryptocurrency in its assets. After discussion with the professional banking community, we came to the conclusion that excluding banks from such operations would be unjustified. To mitigate risks associated with money laundering and terrorism financing, all transactions involving digital assets will be subject to existing anti-money laundering (AML) regulations . Chistyukhin noted the importance of transparency in these transactions, stressing that all parties involved must be adequately identified and that the sources of funds must be clear. This regulatory framework aims to ensure that banks, brokers, and exchanges are held accountable for monitoring illegal transactions, with strict penalties for those who fail to comply. Chistyukhin added: The international community and the Russian professional community have become very clear that crypto assets have an increased risk associated with money laundering and the financing of terrorism. We believe that all anti-money laundering mechanisms should also apply to investing in crypto assets. Bank Of Russia To Conduct Major Digital Asset Audit In a related development, the Bank of Russia is planning a comprehensive audit of the nation’s cryptocurrency holdings and activities, set to take place in early 2026. As reported by Bitcoinist earlier this week, this audit will assess investments in digital assets by regulated financial institutions and investigate any lending or financing associated with crypto businesses. The central bank intends to cross-reference data from various sources, including miners, exchanges, and the Federal Tax Service, to identify discrepancies between reported activities and actual transactions. But while Russia continues to develop its regulatory landscape for digital assets, a divide has emerged among government agencies. While some ministries advocate for clearer regulations and taxation for crypto operations, the central bank appears to favor a more cautious approach, prioritizing financial stability over rapid integration.

But in a video shared on his X account, he argued that this event also carries a deeper meaning for XRP holders. Linking the new liquidity injection to a symbolic message from Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, he suggested that the timing is not a coincidence. Ripple Bull Winkle pointed to Schwartz’s past decisions as a source of guidance for investors. He recalled how Schwartz once sold 40,000 ETH at $1 each to fund the installation of solar panels on a house he no longer owns. That amount of Ethereum would have been worth over $100 million later on, yet according to Bull Winkle, the real takeaway is not regret. David Schwartz’s SECRET MESSAGE TO #XRP HOLDERS pic.twitter.com/MYX3hrb5qQ — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 10, 2025 Learning from David Schwartz Bull Winkle emphasized that Schwartz’s story serves as a warning, not a mistake. “He’s telling us XRP holders, do not sell too soon ,” he said, describing the experience as a cautionary example against early exits during critical turning points. He added that the community should “hold strong” as he believes the asset’s pivotal moment is approaching. This perspective comes at a time when market activity is intensifying and XRP continues to attract speculation about its next move. Bull Winkle connected Tether’s large-scale minting with what he views as early signals of a major financial shift . “Tether’s the smoke. Bitcoin is your distraction,” he declared, adding that “XRP, it’s the bridge.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz’s Departure and Renewed Confidence in XRP The comments gained greater significance in light of Schwartz’s recent announcement that he will step down as Ripple’s CTO at the end of the year. For many within the XRP community, this development represents a defining moment. After years of contributing to the design and development of Ripple’s core technologies, his upcoming exit is seen by supporters as the completion of a long-term mission . With Schwartz preparing to depart, Bull Winkle’s interpretation of his past remarks has taken on new urgency. While the broader market remains focused on Bitcoin’s potential rally, Bull Winkle’s message aims to redirect attention to XRP’s position in the next phase of digital finance. He views Schwartz’s experience as a message of patience to the XRP community, and those who listen might profit significantly when XRP starts to climb.

The Cardano community has likened the Ethereum Foundation’s new privacy-focused initiatives to the Midnight network associated with the Cardano ecosystem. The Ethereum Foundation previously announced the expansion of its privacy efforts. The statement announced the creation of a new “privacy cluster,” comprised of 47 researchers, engineers, and cryptography experts. This cluster encompasses various subprojects, including Secret Read and Write, Secret Proof, Hidden Identities, Privacy Experience, the Enterprise Privacy Task Force (IPTF), and Kohaku. The foundation's statement aims to enable users to conduct private payments, voting, and transactions without the risk of surveillance or data leaks. It also includes projects like zkID (zero-knowledge identity), which will prevent unnecessary information sharing during identity verification processes. Related News: Binance Founder CZ Speaks Live: This Altcoin's Price Skyrocketed The Ethereum Foundation made the following statement regarding these studies: “Privacy deserves to be a top-notch feature of the Ethereum ecosystem. We are committed to making this vision a reality for both individuals and institutions.” However, the Cardano community likened the announcement to the Midnight Network, which Cardano has been developing for a long time. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson also joined the discussion, making a direct reference to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin: “Sorry Vitalik Buterin, some things you can't copy. Midnight was built for the fourth generation, and adapting Ethereum's first layer (L1) to it is not possible without fundamentally changing its tokenomics.” Midnight in the Cardano ecosystem is described as a network that stands out with its “secret smart contract” architecture, aiming for a structure that is compliant with regulations while protecting data privacy. *This is not investment advice.

Demand from institutional investors for ETFs is increasing, and macroeconomic fundamentals are in favor of coins, with overall crypto market capitalization going above $4.2 trillion. Conversely, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an Ethereum-based DeFi protocol that is becoming popular as one of the top investments below $1. Already in Phase 6 presale, MUTM has a price of $0.035, with more than 60% of the phase tokens in this phase already sold out. A total of more than $17.1 million in the presale has been raised so far, with estimates placing the return at a value of 20x. Mutuum Finance provides a two-layer lending protocol with peer-to-contract (P2C) pools of accessible assets and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending for meme tokens. It aims to deliver diversified streams of profits to users. Mutuum Finance favors diversification of profit streams in the crypto space. Bitcoin (BTC) Maintains Bullish Bias Above $122,000 As the crypto space is stabilizing, Bitcoin (BTC) has risen once again above $122,000, which shows strong institutional demand and a healthy on-chain setup. Coinbase Premium Index is still in positive territory, which suggests that professionals are still accumulating even during price consolidation. Spot Taker CVD is still aggressive accumulation, and moderately positive funding rates suggest well-contained optimism. NVT Golden Cross has recovered +38%, and on-chain indicators are in favor of real utility rather than speculation. Institutions are leading and retail is following, and BTC is poised for its next leg up with prudent hands on the wheel. Mutuum Finance Presale Soaring as Investor Appetite Hits ATH Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going full steam ahead, having already raised over $17.1 million in Phase 6 of presale and having gained 16,840 individual holders. Over 60% of Phase 6 has already been sold, presenting investors with a relatively brief timeframe in which to sign up before the phase comes to close. Early bird investors are setting themselves up for potentially huge paydays when MUTM reaches the open market. Mutuum Finance protocol relies on a close-order book architecture for market risk management and illiquidity protection. Central components like close-level conditions, liquidation levels, and liquidator incentives are highly precisely dynamically adjusted to allow safe and reliable lending. The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and liquidation parameters dynamically adjust in relation to asset volatility, with more risky assets being treated in a stricter loan condition. Further, risk-weighted multipliers are applied across asset classes for stability, security, and resilience, even under stressed market conditions. Mutuum Finance Prepares Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance is preparing to roll out its lending and borrowing protocol , Version 1, on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025. The protocol will include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be supported on day one for lending, borrowing, and collateralization, creating a multi-purpose, easy-to-use DeFi platform with a focus on convenience, security, and simplicity. Leading Sub-$1 Crypto While Bitcoin Reaches $122K With Bitcoin (BTC) surging past $122,000 and institutional demand on the rise, investors are also looking at growth assets, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading the charge. It’s only at $0.035 in Stage 6 of its presale, yet the project already has raised over $17.1 million from 16,840+ purchasers with 60% of the tokens sold out. Leveraging the Ethereum platform, Mutuum’s two-tier lending protocol leverages peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) configurations to create hedged yield. With risk-weighted collaterals and adjustable LTV percentages, along with forthcoming Q4 2025 lending protocol, Mutuum is one of the top DeFi plays. For investors seeking the next break-out sub-$1, Mutuum Finance is the best buy as Bitcoin pushes on towards mastery.

While many felt the pain of being liquidated, others seem to profit. In the span of just 12 hours or so, the entire market went from a capitalization worth $4.120 trillion on TradingView to $3.3 trillion, which meant a wipe-out of almost $900 billion. This pushed the metric down to its lowest levels since July, erasing months of gains, before it recovered to $3.670 trillion as of press time. Crypto Market Cap. Source: TradingView What We Know Whenever such crashes occur, the cryptocurrency community rushes to offer different views on the matter, trying to explain what happened and provide some insights on what might follow. The current collapse is no different, as Crypto X is full of various opinions and speculations on the matter, especially since it became the single-largest liquidation event in the digital asset market. The most talked-about reason is, surprise, surprise, US President Donald Trump. In what felt like a deja vu, the POTUS alleged China of deception in certain areas and threatened to impose a new set of tariffs on Friday, which triggered the first wave of market-wide declines. He made it official a few hours later, confirming that these tariffs will begin on November 1. The Kobeissi Letter, though, indicated that markets were “LOOKING” for a good reason to correct, given the massive amount of leverage, especially in crypto. The blatant reality: Heading into President Trump’s 100% China tariff announcement, markets were LOOKING for a catalyst to pull back on. Leverage was through the roof and we had not seen a 2%+ decline in the S&P 500 for 6 months. President Trump’s post became THE REASON to… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) October 11, 2025 Bull Theory alleged that one of Bitcoin’s oldest wallets might have known what was about to happen as they opened big short positions on BTC and ETH a day before the announcement and doubled down as events started to unfold. They closed all shorts with a profit of roughly $200 million in just a day. Bull Theory added that this wasn’t a retail-driven dump, as it has been on some occasions in the past. Instead, they noted that it “felt structural, as if a fund or a desk was forced to unwind positions all at once.” What’s Next? Naturally, after trying to explain what happened, the next step is to offer a prediction of what’s to come. The majority of the crypto community seemed adamant that this is a proper buy-the-dip moment, as similar crashes are typically followed by large moves in the opposite direction. “So yes, the headlines scream Market Crash. But zoom out the structure didn’t break. It just reset. The whales already took their entry. Retail panic is peaking. And history says, that’s exactly when the next leg begins,” said Bull Theory. CZ concurred, indicating that this could be the next “COVID crash,” when BTC dumped to $4,000 but exploded in the following months. https://t.co/4O6i3MsfIA — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 11, 2025 However, Crypto Bully outlined a different projection, which is a lot more painful if Trump proceeds with the tariffs: “- Unless Trump changes his statements immediately on Monday, this will not be a V reversal. Most alts with 50-70% wicks will bleed down and fill them or partially fill it before reversal.” Different Perspective While most are focused on price drops, reasoning, and future behavior, Cobie highlighted a different perspective on the situation. The popular X user believes such collapses are a perfect example of why investors should avoid taking leveraged positions, as they can wipe out years of gains. Instead, they need to focus on building a long-term portfolio by holding only assets that they are bullish on and believe in. This means steer clear of speculative tokens that only chase hype without actual utility. “When everyone is making hilarious amounts of money I am always tempted to start using leverage again. It is almost impossible to fight the feeling that you’re not making enough, or everyone else is outpacing you. Good reminder that fighting that feeling and avoid the wipeouts is worth it in the end. Don’t let a leverage blowup dictate your long-term views. The future is bright, good things to come, patience is rewarded.” The post Crypto Market’s Massive Meltdown: What We Know and What’s Next appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Top News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|BTC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-11 07:43:29

This bearish pressure started when rumors of a trade war between the United States and China emerged in the early hours of Friday. The downward pressure intensified after US President Donald Trump declared that the US would impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods. As a result of this announcement, over $5.5 billion was liquidated from the crypto market in less than an hour, with the Bitcoin price briefly falling to as low as $101,500. Is This BTC Whale Linked To The US Government? In a recent post on X, on-chain analyst Maartunn highlighted a specific Satoshi-era Bitcoin investor who might have expected this downturn way before it happened. A look at the trader’s market moves suggests that the large BTC holder almost always knows something the market doesn’t. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Are Back: Three Indicators Suggest A Run Toward $130,000 While the price of Bitcoin steadily dropped towards $117,00 during the day, blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that this Bitcoin OG kept piling up their short positions up to $1.1 billion. Following the BTC crash below $110,000, this large investor made a profit of over $160 million, leading to speculations about them having insider information. Maartunn went further to highlight the large holder’s activities in the past few months. According to the analyst’s post on the social media platform X, this Bitcoin OG started selling part of their 86,000 Satoshi-era BTC stash when prices peaked around August 2025. Similarly, the BTC whale took to shaving off their holdings again when the Bitcoin price ran up to new highs in early October. What’s more interesting is that the Satoshi-era investor soon opened leveraged short positions on both Bitcoin and Ethereum on the Hyperliquid platform. Maartunn thought that the timing of these trades might be interesting, especially as the general crypto market soon witnessed a downturn due to President Trump’s tariff announcement. The on-chain analyst then concluded that the “Satoshi-era OG have insider ties to the US government.” Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $113,250, recovering swiftly from the plunge to around $101,500. However, the premier cryptocurrency is still down by nearly 7% in the past 24 hours.

52980555,603447,1760169604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52980555.jpeg,"Dogecoin Adoption: Holders Cross 8.1 Million, Ahead Of XRP & ADA",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-adoption-cross-8-1-million-ahead-xrp-ada/,"On-chain data shows Dogecoin holders have broken the 8.1 million milestone. Here’s how other cryptocurrencies like XRP and Cardano compare. Dogecoin Holder Count Above Other Altcoins, But Still Below Bitcoin & Ethereum In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared about how the various coins in the cryptocurrency sector currently compare in terms of the Total Amount of Holders . The Total Amount of Holders is an indicator that measures, as its name suggests, the total number of wallets carrying some non-zero balance on a given network. When the value of this metric rises, it means new investors are joining the blockchain and/or old ones who had sold earlier are investing back into the asset. Existing users creating new wallets to distribute their holdings also contribute to the trend. In general, all of these factors can be assumed to be at play at once to some degree, so some net adoption of the asset can be considered to have occurred whenever the Total Amount of Holders goes up. On the other hand, the indicator witnessing a decline implies some investors may have decided to exit from the cryptocurrency, so they are clearing out their wallets. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Total Amount of Holders for some of the top assets in the sector: As is visible in the above graph, the Total Amount of Holders has generally gone up in the cryptocurrency sector during the past year, indicating that new investors have been coming in. Many coins have shown a steady growth rate, but the trend has fluctuated for others. Dogecoin saw some explosive growth earlier in 2025, but the memecoin’s adoption has since taken a slow approach. Today, the Dogecoin network hosts around 8.1 million users. This is more than XRP (7.1 million), Cardano (4.5 million), USDC (4 million), and Chainlink (802,500). DOGE being above XRP in particular is interesting, as the latter’s market cap is more than four times the former’s, showcasing the reach that the memecoin has among retail traders . Ethereum has continued to dominate the list with over 160 million holders, far ahead of Bitcoin with its 56.9 million count. USDT rounds out the top three with a metric value of 8.9 million. Historically, adoption is something that has been constructive for any cryptocurrency network, as a wider userbase means a more solid foundation for future price moves to grow on. In this view, the uptrend in the Total Amount of Holders among Dogecoin and other assets can be a positive signal. DOGE Price While Dogecoin is continuing to attract retail users, its price has struggled recently, being down around 18% from its September high to $0.25.",Dogecoin|ADA|Cardano|Doge|dogecoin|dogecoin adoption|Dogecoin holders|XRP|XRP holders,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|ADA|XRP|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-11 08:00:04

The clip featured entrepreneur and host Patrick Bet-David speaking with two guests about outdated financial systems, the limitations of traditional money transfers, and how technology, such as XRP, could transform global transactions. Patrick Bet-David just dropped a bomb! The world deserves a faster, cheaper, smarter payment system. SWIFT is outdated $XRP is the evolution. Ripple’s tech moves money instantly across borders with record-breaking efficiency and a fraction of the cost. pic.twitter.com/G4ZpdIVk0o — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 9, 2025 Examining the Old System During the discussion, Bet-David referenced the differences between the Automated Clearing House (ACH) and traditional wire transfers. He noted the irony that ACH, a newer system, operates more slowly than wire transfers, leading to a broader question about inefficiencies in global banking infrastructure and setting the tone for a conversation about the need for modernization. One of his guests explained the operational limits of the SWIFT system, calling it “a very antiquated system ” and emphasizing that it functions primarily as a messaging platform between banks rather than a tool that actually moves money. He added that transferring large sums internationally remains a slow and costly process, a gap that blockchain-based solutions are now attempting to fill. XRP’s Growing Appeal for International Payments Bet-David then shifted the discussion toward Ripple and XRP, acknowledging the increase in investment interest around the asset. “And you saw how much money was put into Ripple just in the last couple of days,” he said, describing it as a “record-breaking” period for the company and its native token. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He continued by linking that momentum to a broader industry conversation about which technology could ultimately replace SWIFT . Bet-David mentioned that he and his co-host recently met with an individual involved with another blockchain project, highlighting how the competition to modernize financial networks is expanding. Still, the core of his point centered on XRP’s reputation as a faster and cheaper system for international transactions. Industry Consensus Shifting Toward XRP Throughout the exchange, Bet-David emphasized that growing numbers of investors and professionals share the belief that systems like Ripple’s could eventually become the foundation for more efficient financial transactions. The discussion backed XRP’s ability to facilitate instant settlements across borders at a fraction of the cost of legacy systems. As more financial institutions explore digital alternatives to traditional banking infrastructure, conversations like Bet-David’s highlight both the limitations of the current model and the promise of innovation through blockchain solutions.
