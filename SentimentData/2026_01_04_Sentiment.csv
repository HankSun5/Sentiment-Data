56778670,652184,1767463219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56778670.jpeg,Expert Reminds XRP Investors Of The Greatest Blessing Right Now,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-greatest-blessing-right-now/,"Crypto expert JV has told XRP investors about what he described as the greatest blessings. This came as he also revealed that he has been accumulating XRP in preparation for a potential bull run for the altcoin. Expert Tells XRP Investors Of The Greatest Blessings In an X post , JV stated that XRP under $2 is one of the greatest blessings of this lifetime. He added that he is still accumulating XRP, which is his top crypto holding. The expert also listed Bitcoin, WLFI, Solana, XLM, HBAR, and VET as his other top holdings alongside XRP. Meanwhile, his top two stocks are crypto equities ABTC and XXI. Meanwhile, JV indicated that he was gaining exposure to XRP and other crypto assets to counter the dollar’s devaluation . In an earlier X post , he revealed that his XRP has gained over 600% since 2020, while the dollar has lost almost 20% of its purchasing power. In line with this, he declared that he is a long-term investor and that he moves his fiat currency into assets that grow over time and do not lose value. The expert mentioned that he told people five years ago they would be a legend if they bought XRP at $0.17 and held it for four years. Now, he again told market participants that they would be legends if they bought XRP under $2 and held it for the next four years. JV suggested that he wasn’t worried about the altcoin’s recent underperformance , noting that it isn’t about timing the market but about time in the market. He further remarked that most market participants get wrecked because they are trying to get rich quickly by chasing pumps, waiting for saviors, and looking for perfect entries. However, the expert believes that buying and holding is the best approach. XRP Likely To Rise Above $2 Soon Enough Crypto analyst TARA has predicted that the XRP price could rise to $2.30 soon, indicating this might be the last chance for investors to get XRP around $2, as JV advised. The analyst noted that if the altcoin can hold the $1.88 level from here on out, it could make a big push to the $2.30 resistance level next. XRP has notably bounced in the last 24 hours amid Bitcoin’s rally to $90,000. Meanwhile, in the long term, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has reiterated that XRP can reach double digits. In an X post, he stated that the altcoin will likely hold above the 21 EMA and build a base for the next macro move, with targets between $10 and $11. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2, up over 9% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|ABTC|Altcoin|Coinmarketcap|Crypto expert JV|Egrag Crypto|EMA|HBAR|ripple|solana|TARA|VET|WLFI|XLM|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT|XXI,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-03 18:00:19

Some assets remain locked in technical ranges, while others are being judged less by charts and more by what is forming behind the scenes. The Litecoin price reflects that divide, holding steady yet offering little expansion. XRP price prediction debates follow a similar pattern, now centred on whether long-term support continues to absorb pressure rather than where momentum might return. Away from chart-driven narratives, BlockDAG (BDAG) is shifting attention toward timing and access. As its presale enters a closing phase, a limited-time $0.003 price window is creating urgency among late movers. With $441 million already raised and the countdown toward January 26 underway, BlockDAG is increasingly referenced in discussions around scale, ownership, and why missing this final window could prove costly for those searching for the best crypto to buy. Litecoin Price Holds Firm as Downtrend Pressure Persists The Litecoin price continues to trade within a narrow range, reflecting a market that remains cautious despite short-term rebounds. Recent sessions show LTC price holding above key intraday support, though broader momentum still leans bearish as it struggles below longer-term moving averages. From a technical standpoint, the Litecoin price faces layered resistance overhead, keeping upside attempts contained for now. Momentum indicators suggest consolidation is more likely than a decisive breakout in the near term. Within discussions comparing established networks and newer alternatives, Litecoin is sometimes mentioned alongside other assets categorized as the best crypto to buy. However, its appeal currently rests more on network resilience than price expansion. XRP Price Prediction Hinges on a Critical Support Test The current market structure has put XRP price prediction back into focus as the asset tests long-term support near its 20-month EMA. Analysts tracking historical cycles note that this zone has often acted as a decision point, where consolidation or renewed downside tends to emerge. Recent exchange outflows suggest some accumulation, but price action remains tightly range-bound, keeping risk balanced on both sides. From a technical perspective, each XRP price prediction now hinges on whether buyers can defend the broader support band and form higher lows. Failure to do so could reopen short-term weakness. In this context, XRP price prediction discussions remain analytical rather than directional, especially as broader market conditions stay mixed. Among assets often listed as the best crypto to buy, XRP is increasingly assessed through structure and liquidity trends rather than short-term momentum. Overall, the prevailing XRP price prediction depends on whether buyers continue absorbing supply at key levels. BlockDAG Moves Toward Community Ownership Before Presale Close BlockDAG has entered a decisive moment as CEO Nic van den Burgh recently confirmed the signing of a Letter of Intent (LOI) that places the project on a clear path toward full community ownership before launch. This move signals a major structural shift at a time when the presale is rapidly approaching its January 26 close, adding urgency to what is already a narrowing window. According to leadership, BlockDAG is preparing to launch as a community-owned layer-1 network, a model that continues to draw attention from analysts watching governance-first designs. This transition is unfolding while the presale enters its final phase, where timing is becoming critical. Although the standard price level has moved higher, BlockDAG is offering a limited-time presale opportunity at $0.003, giving one last chance before launch pricing begins. Once this stage ends, the $0.003 price is gone permanently. No resets. No extensions. No second chances. The LOI outlines a structured transfer of core assets into a community-driven framework. These include presale funds, blockchain infrastructure, intellectual property, development environments, tooling, and operational systems required to scale without reliance on a single controlling entity. This approach is uncommon in the layer-1 space, where decentralization is often delayed until long after launch. Van den Burgh described the transition as a phased process, expected to unfold over the coming weeks, with the current team maintaining oversight until governance is finalized through a community vote. This timing aligns closely with the presale’s closing stretch, reinforcing the sense that BlockDAG is locking in its launch structure before public trading begins. Alongside this governance shift, BlockDAG’s roadmap remains on track. The presale end date stays fixed for January 26, with mainnet deployment and centralized exchange listings planned soon after. The presale has already raised $441 million, is currently in Batch 34, and has just 3.5 billion coins remaining. With launch pricing set at $0.05, the limited-time $0.003 window represents a 16.67× difference, or a +1,566% upside from today’s level to launch. As supply tightens and the deadline draws closer, BlockDAG’s combination of governance transition, fixed timeline, and disappearing entry price is pushing urgency to the forefront. For those watching late-stage presales with real structure behind them, this final phase is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. Why BDAG is The Best Crypto to Buy Now? Stepping back, the distinctions between these assets become more pronounced. Litecoin price behaviour suggests consolidation without expansion, while each XRP price prediction continues to depend on whether long-term support can absorb ongoing pressure. While XRP and LTC remain important reference points, neither currently shifts the broader market balance. BlockDAG operates on a different timeline. With its move toward community ownership, a presale that has surpassed $441 million, and a limited-time $0.003 entry window now in its final stage, the opportunity is actively closing. As market participants reassess the best crypto to buy through timing and structural readiness rather than short-term price signals, BlockDAG continues to stand out based on measurable progress and a window that will not remain open for long.

Beware of This Potential Scam,https://timestabloid.com/easya-co-founder-sends-critical-warning-to-xrp-holders-beware-of-this-potential-scam/,"The cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly, with new token models and blockchain experiments emerging daily. While innovation can drive adoption, it also increases the risk of projects that may prioritize extraction over utility. Traders and investors are becoming increasingly cautious, recognizing that not every token associated with established networks provides meaningful value or aligns with community interests. This perspective was emphasized by Dom Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, who reacted to a recently announced token plan involving XRP. Kwok highlighted concerns over the structure of the proposed initiative, describing it as potentially prioritizing short-term gains for creators rather than delivering sustainable utility to the XRP community. be careful folks, this looks like a pure extraction play — Dom Kwok | EasyA (@dom_kwok) January 3, 2026 Two-Chain, Two-Role Token Concept The project in question was outlined by YoungHoon Kim, who has drawn attention due to his high-profile credentials, including an IQ of 276 . Kim proposed a dual-token ecosystem: $LAMB, a token on Solana aimed at community growth, and an XRPL-linked token intended to power DAO utility. The concept positions XRP as the foundation for the second token’s functionality, leveraging its established utility and on-chain capabilities. While such cross-chain approaches are technically innovative, Dom Kwok warned that the plan may represent an extraction play, a term in crypto markets used to describe projects designed primarily to capture investor funds without delivering long-term value. He urged holders to exercise caution, highlighting the need to distinguish between genuine utility and schemes that exploit trust in established ecosystems. Understanding Extraction Plays in Crypto Extraction often surfaces in rapidly growing markets where enthusiasm outpaces due diligence. These projects typically promise high utility or community benefits but fail to establish mechanisms for sustainable adoption or transparent governance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In the case of multi-chain token structures, the complexity itself can obscure risks, making it harder for investors to evaluate whether value creation or short-term monetization drives the initiative. Dom Kwok’s warning underscores the importance of critical assessment , especially when projects involve established assets like XRP. Even when a token references a network with proven utility, the design and incentives behind new tokens can significantly impact risk. Investors are encouraged to analyze tokenomics, governance, and actual utility before committing funds. XRP Community Response and Vigilance The reaction from the XRP community to Kim’s announcement has been mixed. While some are intrigued by cross-chain DAO concepts, others heed warnings like Kwok’s, emphasizing careful scrutiny. This episode illustrates a broader trend in crypto: innovation must be paired with transparency and sustainable design to gain lasting credibility. Caution Over Hype Dom Kwok’s advisory serves as a reminder that not all new token initiatives are aligned with long-term network health. For XRP holders, evaluating projects critically, verifying utility, and assessing governance structures are essential steps in avoiding potential scams . As blockchain ecosystems evolve, informed vigilance remains the most effective safeguard for investors navigating complex token landscapes.

The current surge in ETH has continued to boost overall confidence while also underlining a gap that exists between top-level projects that have long existed, as opposed to emerging ones that have been gaining momentum lately. Amid the rise of Ethereum, investors are also currently taking a keen interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi-based project that is currently within its presale with undeniable momentum. Thus far, this new crypto coin project has raised more than $19.6 million with more than 18,660 members signing up for its presale, making it a top crypto to buy now for investors looking for early opportunities. ETH Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has just made a bullish cross-over around $2,900, a pattern that occurred before a situation where it increased by approximately +217% from $1,550 to above $4,950. Currently, it is expected to reach $4,811.71, even $8,557.68, showing its massive structural potential. ETH’s price action points to a much larger issue with crypto markets. While there is established upside in market giants, newer projects like the new crypto coin Mutuum Finance provide higher, more rapid percentage increases. Mutuum Finance in Early Stage at $0.04 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in the initial valuation stage in the ongoing presale. With the token price now set at $0.04, while the launch price is set at $0.06, investors have a great chance to capture meaningful upside even before market launch. The project has managed to raise a cumulative value of $19.6 million, with the support of more than 18,660 investors in the initial seven presale stages. As an emerging new crypto coin, it has already become one of the most talked-about crypto to buy now in the DeFi space and for a good reason. Those joining in phase 7 have the potential of enjoying a near 2x jump at launch. This is before a 40x ROI predicted by analysts when MUTM launches. Market strategists have pointed to factors such as passive income streams, community-driven funding, buy-backs and staking as some of the factors that could trigger a 40x climb for MUTM by mid-year. This shows just how much the newcomer differs from an asset like Ethereum. ETH is a strong market player, but its days of sharp rises are far behind it. By mid-2026 ETH could soar as little as 100%, yet MUTM is on track for a 3900% jump. In fact, analysts have stated that buying MUTM now is similar to being an Ethereum investor in 2017. This was the year ETH saw its biggest rally. If indeed, MUTM captures similar upside, and fundamentals show it could, a 40x rally past $1.60 could just be the beginning for the newcomer. Passive Earnings For Users One of the features of Mutuum Finance is its mtToken concept. mtTokens enable users to accrue passive income immediately while still enjoying liquidity. For instance, a user with an idle 5000 USDT in their portfolio could choose to deposit it in MUTM to earn an interest. The lender will receive mtUSDT, and ERC-20 receipt minted 1:1 to their deposit. The mtUSDT accrues yield, around 8-12% APY without requiring users to sell their assets. Buybacks & Staking Mutuum Finance’s buy and distribute and staking solution works to ensure the value of the MUTM token in the long run by pegging its value to the usage of the protocol. Some of the revenue generated from the lending platform is used to buy back MUTM tokens. The purchased tokens are then used to reward the stakers. This means that on top of a 8-12% APY on mtToken deposits, stakers in the project are eligible for periodical dividends. Ethereum (ETH) is eyeing $4,800 as it makes progress. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at $0.04 in Presale Phase 7, shows strong potential for growth. Its projected 40x ROI that could launch it past $1.50, juicy APY and periodical dividends are drawing a huge crowd looking for the next DeFi giant and the best crypto to buy now.

Crypto pundit and Digital Ascension Group CEO Jake Claver weighed in early on the issue, arguing that the dominant narrative around XRP supply misses what is actually happening behind the scenes. Market data has shown repeated high-volume XRP movements that do not align with Ripple’s escrow schedule or typical retail behavior. These transactions often appear without the sharp price reactions normally associated with open-market selling. That disconnect has made analysts reassess how XRP liquidity is managed and where these large blocks are headed. Large XRP sales aren't from escrow or retail, they're OTC trades through Falcon X, Kraken dark pools. Early investors and hedge funds moving massive positions anonymously. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) January 2, 2026 Institutional Channels Over Public Markets Claver stated, “Large XRP sales aren’t from escrow or retail, they’re OTC trades through Falcon X, Kraken dark pools.” According to him, these venues allow major holders to transact without exposing their positions to public order books. He added that the activity reflects “early investors and hedge funds moving massive positions anonymously.” Over-the-counter desks and dark pools exist to handle scale. FalconX operates as a prime brokerage for digital assets, servicing institutions that require depth and discretion. Kraken’s dark pool functions similarly, matching large buyers and sellers away from visible exchange liquidity. These mechanisms reduce slippage and limit short-term volatility. This context challenges the assumption that visible XRP selling pressure reflects fear or distribution into weakness. OTC transactions often signal structured reallocation rather than emotional exits . Large holders typically choose these routes to manage exposure efficiently. XRP’s global liquidity makes this type of activity feasible. The asset trades across many regions and pairs, allowing supply to change hands without immediate disruption. That helps explain why heavy on-chain movement has not consistently caused sustained price breakdowns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Focusing on XRP Claver’s remarks come as he faces criticism from notable figures in the XRP army. They have challenged past price predictions that failed to meet earlier timelines, and raised allegations tied to previous business disputes, including claims of potential fraud. These issues are personal and contested. They do not alter XRP’s on-chain behavior or liquidity structure. XRP remains the focus of his comments. XRP remains the central focus. If OTC desks and dark pools handle a meaningful share of large transfers, public charts only capture part of the picture. The absence of visible selling does not mean inactivity. It indicates activity is happening elsewhere. XRP’s structure remains intact. Ownership may be rotating, but the market continues to absorb volume.

This low volatility signals greater market predictability. The upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $6.05, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $5.55, establishing the support point. UNI/USD 4-hour price chart.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin’s price is decreasing after a bearish trend observed over the current trading session. If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI’s price might decrease to the $5.6 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $16.23 level by 2027 and above $45.20 by 2032. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing negative market sentiment today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are shedding, and so is UNI. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2026? The maximum UNI can reach in 2026 is $10.43, while the average price is expected to be around $8.69. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just below the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.27 and $7.8; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2028, which is quite higher than its current value, making it a good option to buy UNI tokens. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high, which is not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. However, this is not investment advice, and one should seek independent professional consultation before making any investment decision. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2032. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $45.20 by the end of 2032, substantially higher than its current price.

Uniswap historic price sentiment Uniswap price history. Source: Coinmarketcap Uniswap (UNI) token launched on September 17, 2020, starting at $3.00. It quickly rose to $7.00 before reaching an all-time low of $1.03 (CoinGecko) or $0.4190 (CoinMarketCap) on the same day. UNI ended the year at $5.00 after a gradual recovery during the 2020 bull run. In 2021, UNI surged 400% in January to $20. By March, it hit $28; on May 3, it reached an all-time high (ATH) of $44.93, skyrocketing its market capitalization. It ended the year near $18 after a significant decline. Throughout 2022, UNI continued to decline as the cryptocurrency prices kept falling, dropping to around $5.5 by June as the bearish trend persisted. The crypto market rebounded in 2023, and UNI saw bullish momentum, peaking at $7.77 on December 28. UNI began 2024 on a downtrend, briefly recovering to $15 by March 6. After mid-May, it faced selling pressure, falling to $0.14 by July 31, as UNI holders kept selling assets. It stabilized in August at around $5 and traded above $6 at the start of September. In October, UNI reached a peak of $8, and November saw a peak price of $13.58. In December, UNI soared to $18.60. In February 2025, Uniswap was trading near $12, which was below January price levels of $15. In March, it dipped further down, reaching the $7.4 range, and the descent continued into April with a price of $4.7. However, some bullish price action was observed in May, when UNI jumped to $7.5 and finally peaked at $11.74 in July. August proved a bullish month as UNI/USD reached a yearly high price of $12.31, while it remained in a downtrend in September and October. UNI traded near the $5.7 mark in early November. After surging toward $10 in mid-November, the price of UNI declined again toward $5.5 in early December. At the start of January 2026, UNI is trending near the $5.8 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Uniswap,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|UNI|ARB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-03 18:53:24

The numbers that many share on social media can be distorted by exchange moves, not fresh buying. That distortion matters because large transfers tied to exchanges can look like one entity is piling in, when the action is often internal bookkeeping.

When that happens, onchain trackers may count those consolidated addresses as “whales,” inflating the apparent number of very large holders. According to Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, once those exchange-related shifts are removed from the data, the balance held by true large holders is still falling. Balances in addresses holding between 100 to 1,000 BTC have dropped, a trend that lines up with outflows from spot ETFs. No, whales are not buying enormous amount of Bitcoin.

We… pic.twitter.com/dk9XqqckIX — Julio Moreno (@jjcmoreno) January 2, 2026 Long-Term Holders Turning Buyer Reports have disclosed that another group has shifted its behavior. Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, says long-term holders have been net accumulators over the past 30 days after what was their biggest selling spree since 2019. That change could reduce one major source of selling pressure. It does not guarantee a rally, but it does mean at least one key cohort stopped adding to the sell side. Markets react to who is buying and who is selling, and this move by long-term holders softens the case that a single group is driving prices lower. Price Action Shows Mixed Signals Bitcoin has been hovering around the $90,000 area during thin holiday trading. At the time of reporting, the price was about $89,750 Saturday, with 24-hour volume near $52 billion. The token sits roughly 2.8% below a recent day high of $90,250 and carries a market capitalization of about $1.75 trillion based on a circulating supply close to 20 million BTC. Trading has seen sharp moves up and down, but volume has been weak, which means moves lack the support needed for a clear breakout or breakdown. Market Moves Hinge On ETF Flows Since US spot Bitcoin ETFs became active in early 2024, the ownership picture has changed. ETFs now hold a large share of on- and off-chain demand, which can shift where Bitcoin is stored and how flows appear on onchain charts. Reports suggest that ETF outflows have helped drive lower balances in the 100–1,000 BTC band, while at the same time some long-term holders are quietly buying.

Claims of a massive whale reaccumulation wave were overblown because they did not account for exchange consolidation. Yet the story is not one-sided. Long-term holders have shown buying interest, even as large non-exchange addresses continue to shed some holdings. Future price direction will likely depend on whether ETF flows return in size and whether trading volume picks up enough to confirm any move.

While such fears dominate headlines, a closer look at on-chain activity and corporate escrow practices reveals a different story. By maintaining disciplined and transparent supply management, Ripple has established a framework that reduces market uncertainty and builds confidence among investors. Zach Rector recently reinforced this insight, sharing a detailed update on Ripple’s 2026 escrow activity. Rector highlighted how Ripple continues to execute a predictable escrow strategy that balances institutional distribution with supply control, a mechanism that has been consistent through 2025 and appears set to continue into the new year. 2026 Ripple XRP Escrow Update pic.twitter.com/UbhUqco0Rt — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) January 1, 2026 Escrow Mechanics and Market Stability According to Rector, Ripple has maintained a rhythm of locking up 700 million XRP into escrow while retaining 300 million XRP for controlled distribution. The retained XRP is used to supply institutional partners, including emerging XRP ETFs, through over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. By avoiding direct market sales, Ripple ensures that its distribution does not negatively impact XRP’s price, preserving market stability while continuing to support adoption. In early 2026, blockchain monitors, including Whale Alert, confirmed two transactions locking a total of 700 million XRP back into escrow, reinforcing the company’s commitment to disciplined supply management. These actions demonstrate that Ripple prioritizes predictability and responsible distribution over immediate liquidity events that could create short-term volatility. Implications for XRP Price The continued escrow discipline has multiple implications for XRP holders and market dynamics. First, it counters recurring fears of “XRP dumps,” allowing investors to focus on fundamentals rather than speculation-driven FUD. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Second, by supplying institutional partners in a controlled OTC manner, Ripple integrates XRP into growing adoption channels, including regulated financial products like ETFs, without creating artificial price pressure. Such structural predictability enhances investor confidence, particularly among institutional players who require assurance of supply stability when entering the market at scale. Over time, this responsible approach can support a healthier price trajectory for XRP, reducing the risk of sudden supply shocks that historically create short-term volatility in crypto markets. Escrow Discipline as a Signal of Maturity Ripple’s consistent escrow strategy signals maturity in the management of XRP as a reserve currency. By maintaining clear, verifiable patterns for locking and distributing tokens, Ripple demonstrates transparency and operational rigor that strengthens trust across retail and institutional investors. Zach Rector’s update confirms that 2026 will continue the precedent set in 2025, combining escrow discipline with measured institutional distribution. For XRP holders, the takeaway is clear: predictable supply management reduces uncertainty, supports adoption, and creates a foundation for more sustainable price growth.

According to ScamSniffer, the user in question had signed a malicious “permit” signature, which was what led to the theft. That signature was an off-chain approval mechanism, and it allegedly allows tokens to be spent without triggering an immediate on-chain transaction. ScamSniffer shared screenshots of the transactions. As to how the victim was susceptible to the exploit, they believe the scammers would have gotten the victim to sign the permit via a phishing site or cloned dApp, giving them access to drain the wallet. How did the scam happen? SlowMist’s founder, Cosine, commented on the haul, pointing out that the specific phishing group behind the attack is not one of the “mainstream” drainer groups, which suggests an emergence of smaller, sophisticated independent attackers. They also moved fast, rapidly converting the funds to ETH and then laundering the funds immediately via Tornado Cash. The incident was highlighted on January 3 by ScamSniffer via its X page, not long after it dropped its 2025 yearly report. In the report , as reviewed by Cryptoplitan, it revealed there was an overall 83% drop in crypto phishing losses, falling from $494 million to $84 million. However, it emphasized that sophisticated wallet drainers still abound. They just seem to be targeting high-value holders with permit-oriented attacks, as is often the case during a bull market. Permit-based exploits depend on the user’s trust in routine signature requests that actually authorize token transfers off-chain. Unfortunately for scams like these, recovery is very unlikely as the draining happens on-chain and transactions are irreversible. Crypto phishing losses went down, but wrench attacks went up While ScamSniffer has confirmed crypto phishing losses went down in 2025, crypto security experts claim the frequency of so-called “$5 wrench attacks” went up. Ari Redbord, the global head of policy and government affairs at crypto analytics firm TRM Labs, called 2025 a record year for wrench attacks, with roughly 60 reported physical assaults on crypto holders, up from 41 in 2024 and 36 in 2021. However, Redbord believes the actual number of attacks that have happened is significantly higher. “Many incidents are logged simply as robberies or burglaries, with the crypto element omitted, while others are never reported due to victim hesitation or uncertainty about how law enforcement will handle crypto-related crimes,” Redbord claimed. The cybersecurity risk called the “ wrench attack ” derives its name from the idea that even the most sophisticated forms of encryption and data security are susceptible to physical coercion — like getting threatened by a “$5 wrench.” These attacks are inarguably worse than phishing exploits and protocol hacks as they not only put assets at risk but also lives, increasing the stakes for maintaining proper OPSEC beyond wallet management best practices. “No matter how many technical precautions you take or how many factors you authenticate with, no individual is immune to human attack vectors,” Tor Bair, CEO of Hybrid Minds Advisory and former president of the Secret Foundation, said. Although the true number of wrench attacks is difficult to quantify, there appears to be either a higher risk of victimization or, at least, a greater awareness of the threat. Last year May, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau spoke up about the rise of crypto-related assaults in the country, which at the time was the site of about one-third of wrench attacks in 2025, including the high-profile kidnapping and torture of Ledger co-founder David Balland and his wife in January.

CryptoQuant Researcher Says No,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-really-back-in-the-market-cryptoquant-no/,"The price of Bitcoin has made a solid start to the new year, jumping above the $90,000 mark on Friday, January 2nd. While this newly-found momentum could have been triggered by a plethora of factors, an on-chain expert has pointed out that whale activity is not one of them. Look Closer: BTC Whale Holdings Actually In Decline In a recent post on the social media platform X, CryptoQuant’s head of research Julio Moreno argued that the largest Bitcoin investors are not back buying enormous amounts of BTC. This conclusion is based on the Total Whale Holdings and Monthly % Change and Total Dolphin Holdings and Monthly % Change chart. As the name suggests, the Total Whale Holdings and Monthly % Change chart shows the total balance of addresses with more than 1,000 coins and how it has changed in the past month. Meanwhile, the Total Dolphin Holdings and Monthly % Change chart depicts the change in the balance of investors with between 100 and 1,000 BTC (capturing exchange-traded fund holdings). What’s more peculiar is that the Total Whale (and Dolphin) Holdings and Monthly % Change excludes exchange wallet addresses. According to Moreno, the majority of Bitcoin whale data has been skewed by exchanges consolidating a lot of their holdings into fewer addresses with larger balances, explaining why whales seem to be in a reaccumulation phase recently. Interestingly, the data is indeed skewed, as upon removing all exchange addresses’ data, the total Bitcoin whale balances shows a decline rather than an ascent. The same trend can be seen in the lower Total Dolphin Holdings and Monthly % Change chart in the image below. This shrinking balances of Bitcoin whales tells a story of waning demand in the market, sending signals of the start of a bear market. As seen in past cycles, the lack of apparent demand growth is the most telltale sign of impending correction phase for the Bitcoin price. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $90,320, reflecting an over 2% leap in the past 24 hours. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Suffering Historic Losses Since its trading debut, the US Bitcoin ETF market has been an excellent way to judge investor demand in the cryptocurrency market. However, market data hasn’t been telling a pretty story for the flagship cryptocurrency in recent weeks. For context, the largest Bitcoin ETF , BlackRock’s IBIT, posted roughly $244 million in net outflows last week, marking its 2nd-consecutive weekly withdrawal. The fund has now witnessed net withdrawals in 8 of the last 10 weeks, with a total of just 20 weekly outflows since its launch two years ago. According to recent data, crypto funds registered approximately $446 million in net outflows last week, marking the sixth week of withdrawal over the last nine weeks.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc price|BTCUSDT|crypto|Julio Moreno,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-03 19:30:49

When former President Trump sat down with President Xi in South Korea, the two leaders struck a deal to put their trade fight on hold for a year. China gains leverage in U.S.–China trade dispute The agreement showed China can push back against economic pressure from Washington while keeping a tight grip on crucial manufacturing supplies. Beijing made it clear that American businesses could face limits on rare earth elements, materials that go into everything from smartphones to military gear. Joerg Wuttke from DGA Group said the deal could help China boost its share of global manufacturing from around 30 percent up to 40 percent . “They’re telling other countries, don’t mess with us, don’t compete with us, you can’t beat us,” Wuttke said. Yet even as China talks up its industrial muscle, December trade numbers show the country heading for its first merchandise trade surplus above $1 trillion in 2025, problems are piling up at home. A lasting downturn in the property sector has hurt local governments badly. The crisis has led to falling prices and smaller paychecks for workers. Kristalina Georgieva, head of the International Monetary Fund, traveled to Beijing last December and told officials that China needs “more forceful measures to be implemented with greater urgency.” She pushed leaders to address the “imbalances” dragging down the economy, pointing out that such a big country cannot rely only on selling goods abroad. “Boosting consumption would unlock . . . a more durable source of growth,” Georgieva said. China’s supply chain dominance raises global exposure China processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth materials and dominates other key supply chains, including batteries for electric cars, drones, and the processing of lithium and cobalt, according to Eddie Fishman, author of Chokepoints. He noted that heavy American tariffs might hurt China but could trigger a downturn in the United States as well. China also supplies as much as 80 percent of certain ingredients used to make medicines, leaving Western countries more exposed as Beijing moves ahead in new fields like electric vehicles. Chinese leaders said the country wants foreign money coming into its market, as long as it supports “advanced manufacturing, modern services, high-tech industries and sectors related to energy conservation and carbon reduction.” But a fresh report from the EU Chamber of Commerce in China found that “European companies in some strategic sectors are being pushed out, due to regulatory barriers or formidable competition that has benefited from China’s industrial policies.” Europe stands as China’s largest export destination after Southeast Asia. Still, Beijing’s win in the trade dispute with Trump has made it less concerned about other business partners, according to sources close to the matter. For Europe and other major trading countries, China’s growing trade imbalances are becoming what French President Emmanuel Macron described as “unbearable.” China’s merchandise trade surplus with the European Union hit €305.8 billion last year, up from €297 billion in 2023 and below a record of €397 billion in 2022. Beyond industrial policy and market barriers, China’s weakening currency adds another headache for trading partners. The renminbi fell about 8 percent against the euro in 2025, while its real effective exchange rate dropped 18 percent from a high point in March 2022. Falling prices also mask a surge in how much China is actually shipping out, which has grown its slice of world markets. S&P Global Ratings figures show merchandise exports jumped 43 percent since the start of 2020, while imports rose just 15 percent. Rhodium Group expects China’s real exchange rate to keep sliding over the next two to three years as Beijing does little to counter deflation. China’s grip on rare earths – it handles 90 percent of global processing – extends across many other industries, including batteries for electric cars and drones and the processing of lithium and cobalt used in them, according to Eddie Fishman. One of China’s biggest supply chain advantages from a Western viewpoint involves ingredients used to make medicines. In some types, Fishman says China controls 80 percent of the market. As China climbs higher in manufacturing value and takes charge of future technologies like electric vehicles, America and other nations face growing risks, he noted. Even with computer chips, while America holds a technology lead, China’s strong foothold in older chips became clear during the recent Nexperia conflict. China’s trading partners in developing nations face extra risks from this kind of pressure, economists warn. Developing countries depend on Chinese parts for their factories, but might lose their industries due to cheap imports. “Chinese mercantilism is at least as big a threat, if not much bigger, to the prospects of emerging countries as American tariffs are,” said George Magnus, research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre and former chief economist of UBS. At a Beijing meeting, a government adviser noted China’s GDP deflator has stayed negative for a record 10 straight quarters.

Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 88.87 trillion. It is important to note that 87.99 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk network that also drive Bonk’s price. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2026? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2026 and beyond.

The coin has decreased by up to 1.40% during the day. BONK’s key support sits at $0.00000810. On January 3, 2026, Bonk’s price analysis indicates that the trend is in the negative direction as sellers regain control. The memecoin decreased to $0.00000914 after finding resistance around the $0.00000927 level. BONK is down 1.40% in the last 24 hours, signaling bearish momentum and diminishing hopes for bullish traders as the coin loses its recent gains. Bonk 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day BONK price analysis indicates a downtrend. This movement suggests a bearish trend as selling activity dominates buying activity. The chances of reversal also seem low in the face of the larger downtrend. The area between the upper and lower bands of the Bollinger Bands indicator defines market volatility. As the bands are expanded, this signals increased volatility. The upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, serving as the resistance band, is at $0.00000909. Its lower limit, acting as the support, is around $0.00000720. BONK/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral region. Its value is 56; however, its curve is descending. The downward movement of the RSI confirms a negative market sentiment. Moreover, considering the larger downtrend, this marks instability in the trading atmosphere after the return of the selling pressure. BONK/USD 4-hour price chart analysis The 4-hour price chart for BONK also presents a bearish scenario of the market events. The BONK/USD pair value decreased to $0.00000914. The selling activities remained quite intense compared to the buying activities during the day, as the trend has changed again in the past few hours.

Moving ahead, the upper boundary of the Bollinger Bands indicator is at $0.00000968, confirming the resistance threshold. Conversely, the lower boundary of the Bollinger Bands indicator is at $0.00000700, securing stable support. BONK/USD 4-hour price chart.

Bonk price analysis predicts a bearish outcome regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has descended to $0.00000914, as a downturn was recorded today. Moreover, the overall market sentiment remained negative. Technical indicators support the bears, and the price charts also favor the sellers for today. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has numerous side projects that enhance its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2032, Bonk will approach $0.00007046, making it a worthwhile investment tool. However, it is advised to do your own research and consult expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market and lay out a proper investment strategy according to your risk appetite. Why is Bonk down? BONK is experiencing some correction as stakeholders start selling again. However, support still exists at $0.00000810 and is expected to hold over the next trading sessions. Will Bonk reach $0.000045? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000010. Over the last few weeks, BONK saw a downtrend below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000045 by 2030, which is quite higher than the current price. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now, considering BONK’s current value. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. However, analysts are optimistic about BONK, and some suggest long-term targets of $0.00007046, which makes it a viable option to buy Bonk tokens.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history. Source: Coingecko In December 2022, Bonk was launched with an opening price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, giving a bullish outlook according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value. In June 2023, Bonk’s price did not experience much action, and it gradually decreased to $0.0000001927 in September 2023. In October 2023, Bonk started to see bullish sentiment, with the price reaching $0.0000005518, which eventually reached $0.00002445 on December 15, 2023, as the market trends were on the positive side. Bonk closed 2023 with a price tag of $0.00001407, significantly higher than the price at the start of the year but almost 50% down from the highest price point of 2023. Bonk hit key highs in 2024, when the price of BONK rose to $0.00003771 in March and an all-time high of $0.00004115 in May, before dipping to $0.0000223 in August. A late-year rally peaked at $0.00005825 in November, with the token closing 2024 at $0.00003043. At the start of January 2025, Bonk was trading at $0.00002976, and after further depreciation, it plunged to $0.000018 by February, as the market sentiment turned negative. In March, the token dipped to $0.00000959, but it recovered to $0.0000122 in April and $0.000021 in May as Bonk demand increased. In June, Bonk corrected down to $0.00001201, but in July 2025, it became bullish again and reached $0.00004072. In the middle of August, BONK was trending near $0.00002374, and at the start of October, Bonk was trading near $0.00002056. In November, Bonk traded between $0.00000847 – $0.00001379, and at the start of December, the coin was trading between $0.000009769 – $0.00001015.

The market size and maturity of XRP imply a muted rally, which may have to await a positive sentiment drift in the overall market. Conversely, the spotlight has been shifting towards an early-stage DeFi project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently in the presale phase. MUTM is different from XRP, with its strong DeFi focus, an early-stage advantage and rapidly growing holder-base. In no time, the new crypto has surpassed 18660 token holders and has quickly become among the best cryptos to buy for early adopters. XRP Price Prediction XRP’s 2025 was a rollercoaster, with regulatory victories such as the SEC settlement, listing of US-based spot ETFs, and increased engagement with Ripple partners, yet its price declined significantly by 50% from $3.66 to $1.58, failing to reach $5. As XRP embarks on a new year in 2026, technical analysis presents a potential for additional decline if current support levels are broken, although ongoing ETF investments combined with regulatory support might establish a basis for a recovery. While there exists a recovery potential in XRP, its large market and relatively slower pace limits how high it could go compared to Mutuum Finance, which has been termed as the next crypto to explode. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has moved into Presale Phase 7, where the tokens are priced at $0.04. However, this phase is filling up quickly, and as such, the price will go to $0.045 in Presale Phase 8. So far, the presale event has raised $19.6 million. The current token value is 300% higher than Presale Phase 1, at $0.04, and with a projected 50x rally from the current levels, MUTM could touch $2 by the end of the year. In this scenario, a small bet of $500 today could swell to $25,000. Such a growth projection within the first few months makes MUTM the best crypto to buy now and a must-hold in the next bull run. Early investors looking for the next crypto to explode see this as a no-brainer bet. Next-Generation DeFi Platform Mutuum Finance is an open lending and borrowing platform that facilitates the creation of yields, lending of assets, and effortless borrowing. The design and functionality of the platform are focused on the principles of secure returns on investment. The platform uses a two-model approach to lending, which involves Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. Peer-to-Contract relies on smart contracts for automating loans, which adjust interest rates according to market trends. In this way, there is predictability and stability in borrowing and lending. On the other hand, Peer-to-Peer lending facilitates direct transactions between lenders and those seeking loans, thereby cutting off third parties. Say for instance an investor has $7500 ETH lying in their wallet. If ETH doubles in price over the next one year, this investment will only grow into $15,000. On the other hand, if they choose to deposit it in MUTM’s lending pools, it will deliver an 8-12% APY on top of this growth. The initial $7500 will deliver an extra $900 and the investor does not need to sell their ETH. Halborn Security Audit & Sepolia Testnet Launch The lending & borrowing contracts of Mutuum Finance have been audited for security by Halborn Security , and all suggested patches have been successfully implemented. This adds an extra layer of security to the protocol, ensuring that investors have peace of mind, knowing that their assets are safe. The audit process is over, and the V1 protocol is now set to launch on the Sepolia testnet. Testnet will consist of a number of key functionalities, which will include Liquidity Pools related to lending and borrowing, mtTokens that will indicate the deposits made as well as the accumulated interest accrued from these deposits, and an Automated Liquidator Bot. This will enable users to test functionality of the system. First, it will focus on ETH and USDT, which will be its key digital currencies to work with when it comes to lending and borrowing. This, however, will soon be upgraded to enable compatibility with other tokens. Although XRP is currently trading below $2 with limited potential to go higher due to market maturity, a promising opportunity for early investors lies in the Presale Phase 7 token price of $0.04 in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). For investors asking which is the best crypto to buy, MUTM sets itself apart. Its P2P + P2C lending model appeals to all types of DeFi users and their respective risk profiles. The project will soon go live on the Sepolia tesnet where users will get to test its features. This sets it apart from most other projects that launch with no working tools, but empty promises. As 2026 kicks off, analysts see this as the next crypto to explode.

Using a blend of technical analysis, supply dynamics, and adoption trends, ChatGPT provides a grounded forecast for XRP’s price by January 31, 2026, while also contextualizing the outlook with verified forecasts from reputable platforms. AI‑Based Forecast and Range Based on technical, supply, and adoption factors, ChatGPT’s AI‑based model predicts that XRP will most likely trade in the $1.90 to $2.35 range by January 31, 2026, with a median around $2.10. The model suggests that price action will remain range‑bound throughout late January, and it identifies two clear thresholds: upside above $2.35 requires strong bullish catalysts, while downside below $1.90 likely reflects broader crypto market weakness driven by macro conditions or a drop in Bitcoin. Technical Momentum and Market Structure XRP’s price has demonstrated relative upward momentum in the last 24 hours, up by 6.48%. Current trading around $2.00 reflects price appreciation over the early January low. Price movements in late January are likely to remain tethered to broader sentiment and liquidity flows. Adoption and Institutional Factors Institutional interest remains a significant theme for XRP’s prospects. Spot ETFs and inflows from institutional investors have provided measurable support , limiting downside risk and encouraging a more structured market environment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Growing adoption of the XRP Ledger for cross‑border payment services and enterprise integrations further lends weight to the base case that XRP may hold above critical support levels. Positive developments — such as new adoption announcements or integration milestones — could help propel XRP closer to the upper bound of the projected range. External Forecasts for Context Other sources offer complementary projections that, while not definitive, help frame broader market expectations. Finbold’s AI pricing tool, which aggregates forecasts from ChatGPT, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Flash, suggests an average XRP price of around $1.92 by the end of January 2026, which aligns closely with ChatGPT’s forecast. Major institutional forecasts extend beyond short‑term estimates. Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick projects that XRP could reach $8 by the end of 2026, driven by broader adoption and regulatory clarity. Additionally, long‑term forecasts from InvestingHaven suggest XRP could trade between $2.12 and $4.48 in 2026. While these longer‑term views vary widely, they provide context for the potential upside that strong adoption and macro factors could support over the full year. In conclusion, ChatGPT predicts that XRP will likely trade between $1.90 and $2.35 on January 31, 2026, with a median near $2.10. This outlook remains range‑bound in the absence of strong bullish catalysts. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

About 19 .8% of Argentina’s population were using digital assets in 2025, with USDT and Bitcoin being the most popular types in circulation. Why are Argentines into crypto? Argentina led Latin America in cryptocurrency adoption throughout 2025. The country’s adoption rates place it among the world’s top 20 markets. Argentines use virtual assets as protection against inflation and peso volatility, while others view them as more efficient alternatives to traditional payment systems. According to the Blockchain Argentina Foundation’s latest report, which incorporates data from major exchanges including Ripio, Decrypto, and Satoshi Tango, crypto adoption grew by 0.8% during 2025, with 19.8% of the population now using some type of cryptocurrency. This means nearly one in five Argentines has embraced digital assets as part of their finances. “Almost no one today considers having their money stagnant, without ‘working’. That’s why the use of wallets that ‘kill’ for giving a differential is growing and will continue to expand.” Analyst Rodrigo Mansilla noted . Exchanges offer attractive returns on crypto-denominated deposits that traditional banks cannot match. Mansilla explained that adoption was previously related to devaluation and the need to preserve purchasing power; today, crypto usability has significantly expanded with yields in crypto dollars and other attractive uses. The Argentine Fintech Chamber has confirmed that new users continue signing up despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions. Decrypto’s annual growth recorded close to 20% an d de tected sustained interest from a new segment: small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Which cryptocurrencies are Argentines actually using? Stablecoins are the most popular in the region and are used as tools for saving and covering inflation, plus their utility for international transfers. Up to 80% of Decrypto transactions are made using this stablecoin. Satoshi Tango presents Bitcoin as the lead adopted cryptocurrency and USDT as the second, with monthly variations depending on factors like vacations, Christmas bonuses, or elections. In Decrypto, 70% of customers ar e me n with an average age of 35 years, predominantly residing in large cities.

After rallying strongly earlier in 2025 and pushing to new all-time highs, the cryptocurrency has spent much of the recent months digesting those gains through pullbacks and consolidations. That structure was referenced in a chart shared on the social media platform X by Steph, which proposed that XRP’s current market behavior is beginning to resemble the long compression phase that preceded its breakout in 2017. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst XRP Completes Nearly 400 Days Of Sideways Accumulation According to Steph’s analysis, XRP has just completed roughly 393 days of sideways accumulation, a duration that almost perfectly matches the 395-day consolidation phase it went through between 2016 and 2017. During that earlier cycle, XRP spent months moving within a relative range, producing a choppy price action. This kind of extended consolidation reflects a balance between buyers and sellers, where neither side is strong enough to force a decisive trend. In 2017, that balance led to a transition into another technical formation of a descending channel before breaking out. The current setup in 2024-2025, at least structurally, shows XRP once again spending an unusually long time building a base in a range. A more detailed look at the chart shows another important similarity with the transition into another descending channel. Back in the 2016-2017 cycle, XRP transitioned from sideways movement into a descending channel that gradually pushed the price lower over several months. That downward-sloping structure ultimately resolved with a sharp breakout to the upside. The 2024-2025 chart shows XRP moving through a comparable descending channel, with price compressing toward the lower boundary before showing early signs of a breakout while attention is still low. XRP Price Comparison. Source: @Steph_iscrypto on X What To Expect For XRP The 2016-2017 chart segment above shows XRP trading for roughly 395 days in a broad sideways range between about $0.005 and $0.01. Once XRP broke out of the descending channel in early 2017, price moved up very fast, first reclaiming $0.01, then surging past $0.03 and $0.05 within a few days. The expansion did not stop there, as XRP eventually rallied into the $0.40 region later that year, cementing XRP’s first 5,000% move in its history. The 2024-2025 chart shows XRP peaking near the $3.40 zone before entering a sideways consolidation phase throughout 2025. Price action is now in the descending channel, which is gradually compressing around the $1.70-$1.90 area.

A comparable 5,000% move from the current zone of price action would mathematically project the XRP price to about $100.

On-chain data shows the figures fell by 60% compared with those recorded in November. $76 Million Lost Across 26 Incidents According to the Peckshield report revealed via X, hacks and cybersecurity exploits in the crypto sector dropped in December 2025, with only $76.2 million stolen across 26 major incidents. This figure represents a 60% decrease from November’s $194.2 million. The largest single hack during the period was a $50 million address-poisoning scam, where attackers mimicked wallet addresses to trick a user into misdirecting funds. Another notable incident involved a $27.3M multisig breach on a wallet identified as 0xde5f…e965, which was compromised due to a private key leak. Other attacks that made it to the top 5 include the exploit of babur.sol, which resulted in $22 million in losses. The Trust Wallet hack, which occurred around Christmas, involved a trojanized Chrome extension uploaded via a compromised Web Store API key and GitHub secrets, leading to the theft of $8.5 million in user funds. Unleash Protocol also suffered a $3.9 million loss in December after a hacker gained control of its multisig governance and executed an unauthorized contract upgrade. Meanwhile, the Flow blockchain experienced a $3.9 million breach caused by an execution layer vulnerability that allowed the attacker to mint and transfer assets across services before the network was halted. Crypto Industry Loses Over $2.2 Billion in 2025 Hacks Despite the December dip, on-chain data reveals that 2025 was another challenging year for the digital asset sector, with over $2.2 billion lost in the top 10 hacks. Bybit’s $1.4 billion breach in February, which saw attackers drain approximately 401,000 ETH from the exchange’s wallets, remains the year’s most devastating hack. Other major incidents included Cetus, a concentrated-liquidity DEX on Sui, which lost $223 million in May after attackers exploited a protocol flaw to manipulate pricing and drain liquidity. Balancer V2 also suffered a $128 million exploit in November linked to a rounding-error bug in its composable stable pools, while Bitget reported roughly $100 million lost in April due to manipulation of its VOXEL market-making infrastructure. Centralized exchanges were also targeted, with Phemex experiencing an $85 million hot wallet breach in January and Iran-based Nobitex falling victim to $80–90 million stolen from hot wallets in June. In each case, the platforms froze withdrawals, protected the remaining assets, and worked to resume services, while the amount recovered from the losses differed.

Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR up? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a sharp drop to $420 before finding support that enabled it to recover to the current $434 level. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2031 suggests a minimum price of $922.68 and an average trading price of $1,000.34. The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,099.55. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility creating an atmosphere of extreme fear are challenges that Monero traders could face that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and the broader monero project gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Now that 2026 is underway, a Ripple developer has revealed that even more groundbreaking innovations are coming for the crypto project. He encourages the community to prepare for upcoming changes to XRP that could take the project to the next level. Ripple Dev Announces Exciting Changes For XRP In 2026 J. Ayo Akinyele, the Head of Engineering at RippleX, the developer-focused arm of the crypto payments company, has shared an exciting new update for XRP that is gaining traction across the community. In a public post on X, Akinyele sounded optimistic, highlighting steady behind-the-scenes progress on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and unveiling exciting new developments set to transform the network’s future. Akinyele began by recognizing the builders, validators , and community members whose ongoing contributions continue to drive XRPL, emphasizing that their collective efforts remain critical to the blockchain’s long-term growth. The developer also highlighted how RippleX and Ripple are driving progress for the XRP Ledger, noting that they’re both helping to prepare the network for a pivotal phase in its evolution. Looking ahead, Akinyele described 2026 as a potentially transformative and incredible year for the XRP Ledger. He shared plans for several technical upgrades , each aimed at expanding the network’s functionality and making it more appealing to developers and global enterprises. Notably, privacy will be a major focus in 2026. While he did not go into technical details, Akinyele’s remarks suggest ongoing work to improve how transactions and data are managed on the ledger. He also highlighted programmability as a crucial area of growth. Improvements in this area could enable developers to build more complex and flexible applications directly on XRPL, opening the door to broader use cases. The Ripple developer also hinted at new changes to XRPL’s Interoperability, particularly through the use of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology . This development could enable the network to interact with other blockchain ecosystems more securely and efficiently, without compromising data integrity. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is also expected to feature prominently in XRPL’s roadmap in 2026. Akinyele referenced on-chain lending as one example of DeFi functionality that could be introduced, signaling deeper financial tooling on the network. Taken together, these upcoming advancements paint a picture of XRPL evolving into a more versatile and developer-friendly network, capable of a broader range of applications and use cases across the blockchain ecosystem. XRPL Set For Major Technological Overhaul This Year Beyond new features, Akinyele stressed the importance of strengthening XRPL’s technical foundations. He outlined upcoming upgrades for 2026 , including formal specification and verification, as well as a more modular ledger design. These improvements are expected to enhance the blockchain network’s resilience, scalability, and long-term stability. The Ripple developer concluded his post by urging the XRP community to stay committed and focused as they prepare for the next phase of XRPL’s evolution in 2026.",Ripple|decentralized finance|DeFi|J.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-nothing-will-stop-xrp-heres-why/,"XRP Queen (@crypto_queen_x) shared a long-term XRP chart, stating that “NOTHING WILL STOP XRP.” The chart spans more than a decade of data and highlights a repeating sequence of consolidation, breakout, expansion, and then correction. According to the visual structure, XRP is in the middle of an expansion cycle, and she expects that rise to continue. The chart puts the current price action within a pattern that has happened multiple times. Each prior cycle followed a similar progression. XRP moved sideways inside symmetrical triangles before rapid upward surges. After these surges, XRP entered a corrective phase that held above key trend support. The latest structure shows the same behavior. NOTHING WILL STOP #XRP pic.twitter.com/vbdqxcjKD0 — XRP QUEEN (@crypto_queen_x) January 2, 2026 Defining the Trend The chart shows XRP trading inside symmetrical triangles across multiple market cycles. These channels acted as accumulation zones before major upside moves. In earlier periods, XRP respected lower trend support before launching into steep advances. The pattern did not rely on a single breakout, but developed over multiple years. In the current cycle, XRP has already exited its most recent channel to the upside. The asset experienced a surge of over 500% between late 2024 and early 2025, and the price has flipped long-term resistance to support. Failed breakouts often return to the range quickly, but XRP has not returned to the consolidation range. The structure shows higher lows across each major correction, reinforcing the belief that the asset’s upward run will continue . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Fibonacci Extensions Map Historical Peaks XRP Queen’s chart overlays Fibonacci extensions on previous expansion waves. In earlier cycles, the price reached the 1.272 and 1.618 extensions before topping. These levels did not act as resistance early, but marked the final stages of expansion. Those same extensions now sit far above the current price. The 1.272 extension is at $8.44. The 1.618 extension aligns close to $27.23. These levels come directly from historical measurements, and other analysts have shared the same $27 target for the digital asset. The digital asset has already reclaimed the 0.382 retracement near $1.47. In past cycles, holding above that level preceded further upside. Losing it led to deeper corrections. The chart shows XRP above it, and notable dips in late 2025 held above that level. As long as XRP holds above rising support and key retracement levels, the structure remains valid. According to the chart, the cycle has not yet been resolved, and XRP’s upside will continue. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

56783743,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=888032,1767477600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56783743.jpeg,3 Cryptos Investors Are Watching as 2026 Kicks Off,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/3-cryptos-investors-are-watching-as-2026-kicks-off/,"Market participants are monitoring a mix of established cryptocurrencies and early-stage projects when assessing potential opportunities for 2026. Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have been cited for different reasons. Solana for its cheap blockchain, Dogecoin for its hype, and Mutuum Finance for its fresh twist to DeFi. MUTM is in presale and has amassed over $19.6 million faster than analysts predicted. Unlike SOL and DOGE that are already far along the maturity tree, MUTM is building its foundation in DeFi with a dual-lending mechanism. SOL Price Prediction Solana (SOL) has been volatile in the past year, falling from $290 to below $100 at one point. The price of SOL is now around $124, a strong support level that is set to influence its trajectory in the next cycle. If the price manages to rebound, it could pave way for a potential move towards $300. Dogecoin Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) has been shifting within an extremely critical area of support at $0.116-$0.120 after witnessing a sharp correction since its peak levels above $0.16 in mid-December. On the 4-hour chart, DOGE is witnessing lower highs. However, it seems that it is facing critical compression levels. A breakout above $0.124 with increased trading volumes would point towards $0.130-$0.135. MUTM Presale Rise While Solana and Dogecoin are decent picks, they lack the strength of Mutuum Finance. The project’s presale has achieved yet another milestone with more than 18,660 participants and a total of $19.56 million collected. The current price of MUTM per token is set at $0.04 during Phase 7. The presale rewards those who buy early. For instance, when MUTM hits $2 like analysts predict, an investment today will deliver a 5000% ROI. However, those who delay and get in during later stages or at $0.06 listing price will only see a 3200% ROI, a massive 1800% ROI difference. Mutuum Finance also runs a $100,000 giveaway where 10 people participating in the presale get to win $10,000 in MUTM. To qualify, each of the participants needed to buy a minimum of $50 in MUTM, register a valid wallet address on the official site of the giveaway, in order to claim the prizes in case of being picked, as well as undertake quests such as a follow the project on social media. Additionally, there is a $500 award every 24 hours for the top investor buying MUTM. Moreover, the top 50 holders will get rewarded based on their performance on the leaderboard. MUTM DeFi Ecosystem Mutuum Finance is working on a decentralized over-collateralized stablecoin. The stablecoin is pegged 1:1 to the USD. In addition, it is non-algorithmic, saving it from the depeg risks seen in algorithmic stablecoins like TerraUST. The project also has a reward system wherein rewards are given based on a buyback program that utilizes a portion of the fees accrued from the borrowing/lending activities on the protocol to purchase the MUTM tokens on the open market; these are then allocated to the stakers of mtTokens. The mtToken is an ERC-20 yield-bearing asset issued to users when they deposit assets in the project to earn interest on lending. The mtTokens will accrue yields based on the protocol’s usage, ranging between 7-10% or higher. A user could for instance deposit 10 ETH in the platform to receive 10 mtETH which will then see an up to 10% interest per year. Multi-Chain Deployment Mutuum Finance is meant to be capable on both EVM and non-EVM blockchain chains, working with a variety of liquidity pools and communities of users. Such an approach strengthens long-term value by broadening the addressed market and increasing liquidity levels. While Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) continue to make headlines, they face the limitations of market maturity and trading influenced by market sentiment. At $0.04 in Presale Phase 7, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a stronger case with early investor advantage, community rewards, juicy lending yields among other strong features. The project has attracted 18,660 presale participants and $19.56M in raised funds. This is a crucial phase of FOMO and is increasingly being recognized as the top crypto to invest in, while cementing its spot among the best crypto picks for investors looking to diversify in 2026.

Bitcoin Enters Choppy Range As Critical Trend Line Holds Below,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-enters-choppy-range/,"Bitcoin has entered a choppy weekend range, testing traders’ patience as price action slows and volatility compresses. Despite the sideways movement, a critical trend line just below current levels remains intact, keeping the broader market outlook cautious but far from broken. Bitcoin Drifts Into A Typical Weekend Range According to a recent update by Lennaert Snyder, Bitcoin has entered a typical weekend range. Weekend trading is often characterized by low liquidity and choppy price action, which can make moves less predictable and more prone to false signals. Snyder is taking a cautious approach, waiting for a clear trigger at the boundaries of this range before committing to any trades. Related Reading: Bitcoin Key Moving Averages Indicate An Imminent Drop To $38,000 Snyder notes that the $90,930 level could present a strong shorting opportunity if a liquidity sweep occurs and the price fails to hold. On the other hand, if Bitcoin demonstrates strength and manages to break above this threshold, it could signal bullish momentum, making long positions potentially attractive for traders looking to capitalize on a breakout. Similarly, the lower boundary near $88,430 is critical. A sweep below this level followed by a quick reversal could offer long positions. However, if the support fails and the market structure breaks, it would likely trigger continuation shorts. These levels act as key decision points where traders can gauge whether momentum favors buyers or sellers in the short term. Snyder emphasizes that these setups are primarily scalp trades, with lower risk exposure. The expert only executes trades when all confirmation signals align, ensuring that a clear technical rationale backs each position. Looking ahead, external factors could add more volatility to Bitcoin’s price action. Geopolitical tensions and the return of major market participants next week are expected to increase trading volume and momentum, potentially turning these weekend range moves into larger trends. BTC Holds Key Investor Tool Model Support Around $83,900 Crypto analyst Patel recently highlighted that Bitcoin is holding a key support level known as the Investor Tool Model Support, situated around $83,900, which also coincides with the 730-day moving average. This level has historically acted as a major pivot for Bitcoin, helping to gauge the broader market trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Unusual Short-Term Supply Spike, Raising Bearish Flags According to Patel, a decisive break below this support has historically signaled the start of a confirmed bear market, while holding above it typically points to a corrective phase rather than a long-term downtrend. In other words, this level serves as a critical dividing line between temporary pullbacks and structural weakness. Currently, the $83,900 zone is a key area to watch closely. Price action around this support could determine whether Bitcoin resumes its upward trajectory or risks entering a more extended bearish phase, making it a pivotal point for decision-making in the market.

Fed’s Paulson gave a speech on Saturday at the 2026 Allied Social Science Associations Annual Meeting in her hometown. She said that the central bank wants to see how things unfold before making further moves on rates. Paulson laid out what she is expecting. “I see inflation moderating, the labor market stabilising and growth coming in around 2 percent this year,” she said in her speech. If that is how things materialise, “then some modest further adjustments to the funds rate would likely be appropriate later in the year. “ Fe d maintain s re strictive stance to fight inflation Right now, Paulson thinks rates are “still a little restrictive,” and they are helping push inflation down. What makes her view matter more this year is that she gets a vote on the Federal Open Market Committee. That is the group that sets interest rates. Last year, they cut rates three separate times – 25 basis points each time – for a total drop of three-quarters of a percentage point. That put rates at 3.5% to 3.75% after their December meeting. Those cuts were not easy decisions. Fed officials had to walk a tightrope. They needed rates high enough to cool inflation but not so high that they would damage the job market. Things became more complicated when President Donald Trump started calling for bigger cuts, even though some Fed members did not want any cuts at all, with inflation still well above the 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell did not say much about what comes next at the December meeting. However, the Fed’s own forecasts indicate more easing could happen in 2026. The labor market is strained but remains stable. Paulson sai d Sa turda y sh e has “cautious optimism on inflation” but wants “greater clarity on what is pushing growth up and employment down.” She thinks there is “a decent chance that we will end the year with inflation that is close to 2% on a run-rate basis” after price bumps from tariffs settle down. Regarding employment, she stated, “While the labor market is clearly bending, it is not breaking.” The slowdown in hiring is caused by “both supply and demand factors,” and it will need to be closely monitored throughout the year. On the first trading day of 2026, major U.S. stock indexes such as the Dow and S&P 500 closed higher, with gains led by chipmakers and industrials, though a traditional year‑end “Santa Claus rally” failed to materialise. Strategists suggest that investor sentiment remains opportunistic, marked by buying during market pullbacks and expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve, including possible rate cuts later in the year. Markets around the world are trying to figure out what comes next with interest rates. European stocks have climbed higher since the Fed’s last rate cut, and traders are betting there’s more easing on the way. Analysts say investors are still working through how inflation numbers stack up against growth forecasts, trying to guess where policy goes from here.

APEMARS is an early-stage 100x crypto presale designed for maximum early advantage, offering whitelist access and scheduled burns. Unlike LINK and XLM, which are established projects with steady utility, APEMARS gives early participants a chance to secure front-row positioning. Why should I invest in 100x crypto presales? Investors target 100x crypto presales because they offer lower entry prices, structured tokenomics, and early-stage advantages that established coins cannot. Early participation can significantly amplify potential returns as demand grows. Can Chainlink still grow? LINK remains vital to DeFi infrastructure and smart contract accuracy, sustaining consistent long-term demand. Is XLM safer than investing in a presale like APEMARS? XLM offers stable utility through fast, low-fee cross-border payments, but its growth is gradual. Whitelist access to early-stage presales like APEMARS provides higher-risk, higher-reward exposure to the next potential 100x crypto breakout.

According to market analyst Amr Taha, this price gain has been accompanied by significant changes in the derivatives market, which suggest an aggressive shift in investors’ positioning. Related Reading: 2026 Crypto Market Prediction: Will Prices Soar Or Face Continued Declines? Ethereum Traders Flood Market With Long Positions To Usher In 2026 In a QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, Amr Taha shares an in-depth analysis of the Binance derivatives market following ETH’s recent surge in the first days of 2026. Notably, the market expert reports an impulsive rise in ETH open interest on the world’s largest exchange, in what they described as “one of the strongest single-day increases seen recently. As the spot price climbed above $3,100, data from CryptoQuant shows that ETH open interest rose from approximately $6.2 billion to around $7.1 billion, representing a 12% increase in the last day. Taha highlights the importance of the coincidence, stating a rise in open interest amid price appreciation suggested that traders were opening fresh positions, rather than the move being driven solely by short covering. Interestingly, more data showed the ETH Cumulative Volume Delta – which measures the net difference between buying and selling volume over time – also rose alongside open interest, implying several positive developments. One of which is that long positions comprised the majority of the newly opened positions in the market, citing a heavy bullish sentiment around Ethereum. In addition, ETH buyers demonstrated heightened urgency by favoring market orders over passive limit bids, indicating aggressive taker-side demand, implying a strong market conviction that preferred to engage the market immediately rather than wait for lower prices. Related Reading: Popular Crypto Founder Dumps Millions In Ethereum, Here’s What He’s Buying A Potential Bull Trap? In analyzing the liquidation heatmap for the ETH derivative market, Amr Taha unveiled other critical price developments. Notably, ETH’s recent surge was partly driven by a short-squeeze effect around the $3,100 price level. Notably, when the altcoin touched this level, over-leveraged short traders had to defend their positions, effectively creating a market demand that translated into a sudden price gain. While the recent price increase and open interest boost represent positive moments for the market, Taha warns that forced liquidation often results in temporary resistance zones on the lower timeframe, especially when accompanied by rising funding rates. The analyst also explains that Ethereum’s price move appears leverage-driven and highly sentimental rather than structural, suggesting equal room for both opportunity and risk. At press time, the prominent altcoin trades at $3,087, representing a 2.51% gain in the last day.

Local government officials face tough decisions about whether these facilities, which use enormous amounts of electricity and water, belong in their communities. Many places lack clear rules about data centers, forcing boards to consider special exceptions or draft new laws from scratch. What used to be quiet town meetings are now packed with upset residents demanding their leaders say no. “Would you want this built in your backyard?” Larry Shank asked officials in East Vincent Township, Pennsylvania, last month. “Because that’s where it’s literally going, is in my backyard.” The mounting defeats worry major technology companies, property developers, power companies, and labor unions invested in the data center business. Andy Cvengros, who works on data center deals for commercial real estate company JLL, told AP News he’s seen opponents knock on doors, pass out T-shirts, and plant signs in yards for seven or eight recent projects. “It’s becoming a huge problem,” Cvengros said. Data Center Watch, run by AI security firm 10a Labs, reports a major increase in community and government obstacles to data center construction. From April through June, the group tracked 20 proposals worth $98 billion across 11 states that got stopped or stalled because of local fights and state-level opposition. That represented two-thirds of all projects being monitored. Groups working on environmental and consumer issues say they’re getting daily phone calls and helping communities learn how to fight back. “I’ve been doing this work for 16 years, worked on hundreds of campaigns I’d guess, and this by far is the biggest kind of local pushback I’ve ever seen here in Indiana,” said Bryce Gustafson from the Citizens Action Coalition in Indianapolis. Just in Indiana, Gustafson counted over a dozen projects that failed to get approved for rezoning. Common concerns unite different communities Residents share similar worries no matter where they live. Man y al ready upset about rising electricity cost s do n’t want data centers that could push bills even higher. People fear losing farmland, forests, and open spaces. Others worry about noise from backup diesel generators and cooling systems, damage to property values, and health effects. Some are concerne d th eir wells and underground water supplies could dry up, as data centers consume millions of liters of water daily. Legal battles are erupting in both directions over whether local governments followed proper procedures. Major technology companies Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook, spending hundreds of billions worldwide on data centers, didn’t respond to Associated Press questions about how community opposition affects their plans. Microsoft did mention the difficulties in an October filing with securities regulators, listing “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent that may impede or delay infrastructure development” among its operational risks. The resistance is making an impact even when state and federal officials support the projects. Maxx Kossof, an investment executive at Chicago developer The Missner Group, said developers worried about zoning battles are thinking about selling properties after securing electricity access—a valuable asset that makes projects more attractive. “You might as well take chips off the table,” Kossof said. “The thing is you could have power to a site and it’s futile because you might not get the zoning. You might not get the community support.” Industry representatives complain that opponents spread false information about data centers polluting water and air. Still, they’re telling developers to talk with communities earlier, highlight economic benefits, support local programs, and explain conservation efforts. “It’s definitely a discussion that the industry is having internally about, ‘Hey, how do we do a better job of community engagement?'” said Dan Diorio from the Data Center Coalition trade group. Local officials feel the pressure In Matthews, North Carolina, developers withdrew a project from the October agenda after Mayor John Higdon told them it faced certain defeat. Despite promises to fund half the city budget with environmentally friendly features, town meetings overflowed and feedback ran “999 to one against,” Higdon said. Council members who voted yes “would no longer be in office,” he added. “That’s for sure.” Near Duluth, Minnesota, in Hermantown , a proposed campus several times bigger than the Mall of America is stuck in legal challenges over environmental reviews. Residents connected through social media and learned to organize protests and spread their message. They felt deceived when they learne d st ate, county, city, and utility officials knew about the plan for a full year before releasing internal emails confirming it.

And that’s pushing corporate bond trading to levels never seen before. Last year saw an average of $50 billion worth of corporate bonds trade hands every single day. The figure comes from Crisil Coalition Greenwich, which tracks financial market data. That beat 2024’s daily average of $46 billion and set a new record. Companies are rushing to fund big AI projects right now. Data centers that power these new technologies need a lot of money. Wall Street firms like Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase are predicting record sales of top-rated corporate bonds this year. A lot of this borrowing happens in private markets. Last year Cryptopolitan reported Meta Platforms and Blue Owl Capital borrowed roughly $27 billion in high-quality debt to build a data center in rural Louisiana. Deals like this are creating more trading opportunities in private credit. Investors there want more options to exit their positions. Rehan Latif oversees credit trading globally at Morgan Stanley. “I view it very much as the biggest single opportunity coming into 2026,” he said. “Every single time a new market is created, there is a little bit of a lag before the secondary market kicks off. The reality is this is the right time for it to happen.” Tech companies and utility firms often sell bonds with longer payback periods to finance AI-related projects. Sam Berberian leads credit trading at Citadel Securities. He and Jeff Eason, a senior analyst at the firm, say these longer-term bonds create more trading action. These bonds see bigger price swings when interest rates change. Hedge funds and active traders like that because they can profit from market moves. Companies are borrowing more for AI ventures Investors have to watch their holdings carefully. They don’t want too much money tied up in tech companies and utilities. There’s growing worry about a possible AI bubble too. That’s pushing investors to buy more protection through credit default swaps. Market makers say this is adding even more trading activity . Bond trading has been climbing for years. New methods like portfolio trading help. Investors can buy or sell large groups of bonds all at once. The market borrowed tools from stock trading. Bond-focused exchange-traded funds, computer-based execution systems, and fast trading strategies all help. More trading generally narrows the gap between buying and selling prices. Bonds become easier to trade. Investors are moving toward broader strategies now. They use many different financial tools instead of betting on individual companies. Alex Finston helps run credit trading for the United States at Goldman Sachs. He says these changes have cut the cost of trading corporate bonds by up to two-thirds in recent years. “The scalability by which our clients are able to access liquidity has never been better and I would expect that that will continue to grow over time,” Finston said. Automated trading keeps expanding but traditional phone-based trading still matters Grant Nachman started and runs the credit firm Shorecliff Asset Management. He says computer systems can only go so far. They struggle with bonds that don’t trade frequently. Investment firms also risk losing influence if they move too much business away from traditional trading relationships. “There’s likely a ceiling on how much electronic trading there can be,” he said. Getting allocated bonds in new deals matters. So does receiving market research, gathering market insights, and keeping long-standing business relationships. “It helps to be a relevant voice counterparty to get some of that.” However trades happen, 2025 was busy across bonds, crypto, and AI stocks. Activity will probably keep growing. Related markets are seeing increased volume too. Credit ETFs and credit derivatives both are. “We expect trading activity to pick up in 2026,” said Citadel Securities’ Berberian.

Blockchain tracking data shows that the world’s largest asset manager expanded its cryptocurrency holdings by more than $23 billion in 2025, and this is one of the biggest institutional accumulation phases seen in the year. The figures highlight a sustained commitment to Bitcoin and Ethereum, even as price action turned bearish towards the end of the year. BlackRock’s Crypto Portfolio Expansion Through 2025 Crypto was at the forefront of BlackRock’s investment strategy in 2025. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock’s on-chain cryptocurrency holdings at the start of 2025 were $54.83 billion. By January 1, 2026, that figure had risen to about $78.36 billion, representing a net increase of roughly $23.52 billion over the course of the year. These figures mean that by the end of 2025, BlackRock’s crypto portfolio had grown by about 43% compared to the start of the year. Unsurprisingly, the accumulation was concentrated almost entirely in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two biggest assets leading institutional exposure to the crypto industry. Bitcoin was the dominant holding by value. BlackRock’s BTC stash grew from around 552,550 BTC worth about $51.16 billion in January 2025 to about 770,290 BTC valued at $68.05 billion in January 2026. This translates to an increase of approximately 217,740 BTC, adding about $16.88 billion to the firm’s portfolio based on year-end valuations. Even with Bitcoin’s price down about 5% from January 2025, the increase in BTC units held grew by 39%, which, in turn, pushed the total value higher. Ethereum, although smaller in absolute terms, saw even faster relative growth. Holdings expanded from 1.07 million ETH valued at $3.59 billion in January 2025 to about 3.47 million ETH worth $10.31 billion in January 2026. That represents an increase of nearly 2.4 million ETH, contributing around $6.71 billion to BlackRock’s crypto holdings in 2025. These numbers mean that BlackRock’s ETH holdings grew by more than 224% over the year, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 39% increase. ETFs And Institutional Demand Motivated $23 Billion Accumulation The bulk of BlackRock’s crypto buying in 2025 was due to persistent inflows into its spot exchange-traded products. Investor demand for regulated exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum was strong for much of the year, particularly during rallies that pushed both assets toward fresh all-time highs. At the same time, corrective phases in the crypto market were accompanied by notable ETF outflows. This trend supports the view that Bitcoin and Ethereum price action is becoming increasingly linked to ETF activity, and BlackRock is the dominant issuer within those flows. BlackRock has not yet established a presence in the XRP market. The asset manager does not currently offer a Spot XRP ETF, and spokespersons have previously stated that the company has no immediate plans to launch one.

Rethinking Wealth Beyond Token Price Speculation that XRP could reach $100 has led some investors to assume that holding 20,000 tokens would automatically ensure financial security. However, the analyst cautioned against this mindset. He emphasized that a high XRP price alone does not guarantee financial freedom, as taxation, living expenses, and inflation can significantly reduce wealth over time. He added that the financial needs of investors vary depending on age, lifestyle, and planning. For example, younger investors require funds that can last several decades, which may necessitate holdings far beyond $2 million to maintain long-term financial stability. According to the pundit, most individuals would likely need between $5 million and $7 million to achieve true financial independence. Leveraging XRP Without Selling Cypress Demanincor, a community finance commentator, highlighted that wealth should be approached as an income-generating mechanism rather than purely as asset appreciation. Instead of liquidating $1 million in XRP, investors can leverage their holdings to generate cash flow while maintaining exposure to potential price growth. One way people miss the bigger picture is thinking in price only, not passive income. If you had $1M worth of XRP, you don’t spend it or sell it for fiat you deploy it. • Lend the XRP on a lending protocol like @LOAN_Protocol ⁰• Borrow against XRP in stables ~65% instead of… https://t.co/cwbRXRayfI — Cypress Demanincor (@CDemanincor) December 28, 2025 One suggested approach is borrowing against XRP on decentralized lending platforms. Demanincor recommended borrowing no more than approximately 65% of the token’s value to minimize liquidation risk. For a $1 million XRP portfolio, this would allow an investor to access roughly $650,000 in stablecoins such as USDC, while diversifying risk across multiple stablecoins, including USDT. Creating Income Streams from Borrowed Capital Demanincor outlined a structured approach for using the borrowed funds to generate multiple streams of income. About $300,000 could be allocated to real estate, with properties tokenized through platforms like Lofti to yield 4%–8% annually. Additionally, short-term rentals or Airbnb-style stays could supplement returns with more than $1,000 per month. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The remaining $350,000 could be deployed in stablecoin liquidity pools on reputable decentralized exchanges, targeting roughly 10% annual returns. Earnings from these positions could then be reinvested into staking, node operations, or other yield-generating opportunities, potentially producing returns between 4% and 12% per year. Demanincor emphasized that income generated through these strategies can be used to service the borrowed stablecoins, reducing debt while leaving the original XRP position intact. He noted that price fluctuations are less critical than consistent cash flow and financial planning. Nevertheless, he reminded investors that these lending protocols carry inherent risks, underscoring the importance of thorough research and careful risk management before participation. By focusing on generating sustainable income rather than relying solely on token appreciation, XRP holders can maintain long-term exposure while creating a reliable source of cash flow to support retirement or other financial objectives.

56787302,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258302,1767485410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tech Billionaire Stock Sales: The $16 Billion Cash-Out Strategy Behind 2025’s AI Boom,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tech-billionaires-cashed-out-2025/,"BitcoinWorld Tech Billionaire Stock Sales: The $16 Billion Cash-Out Strategy Behind 2025’s AI Boom In a year defined by unprecedented market highs, a staggering $16 billion flowed from corporate equity into the personal accounts of technology’s most prominent leaders during 2025. According to a comprehensive Bloomberg analysis of regulatory filings, executives like Jeff Bezos, Safra Catz, and Jensen Huang executed massive, pre-planned stock sales as an AI-fueled rally propelled tech valuations to record levels. This coordinated cash-out, occurring between January and December 2025, reveals a strategic financial maneuver distinct from panic selling, instead highlighting sophisticated wealth management during a peak market cycle. The $16 Billion Tech Billionaire Stock Sale Phenomenon Bloomberg’s examination of insider trading data provides a clear window into executive confidence and portfolio strategy. Consequently, the $16 billion figure represents one of the largest aggregate cash-outs in a single year. Importantly, these transactions primarily occurred through Rule 10b5-1 plans. These pre-arranged trading plans allow corporate insiders to sell shares at predetermined times, effectively insulating them from accusations of trading on non-public, material information. Therefore, the scale of sales indicates a widespread belief among founders and CEOs that 2025 presented a prime opportunity to diversify holdings after years of explosive growth. The market context for these sales was critical. Throughout 2025, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 Information Technology sector repeatedly shattered records. This surge was fundamentally driven by relentless investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure, cloud computing, and advanced networking. As a result, company valuations reached historic multiples, creating optimal conditions for executives to liquidate portions of their equity stakes without signaling a lack of faith in their companies’ futures. Breaking Down the Major Sales A detailed analysis of the filings shows a tiered structure of sales among the industry’s elite. The following table summarizes the key transactions that contributed to the $16 billion total: Executive Company Approximate Sale Value (2025) Notable Context Jeff Bezos Amazon $5.7 billion Sale of 25M shares in June/July, coinciding with personal milestones. Safra Catz Oracle $2.5 billion Former CEO leveraging cloud and database software rally. Michael Dell Dell Technologies $2.2 billion Capitalizing on AI server and infrastructure demand. Jensen Huang Nvidia $1.0 billion Partial sale as Nvidia achieved first $5T market cap. Jayshree Ullal Arista Networks $1.0 billion Net worth crossed $6B amid networking gear boom. Strategic Motivations Behind the AI Stock Rally Cash-Outs Financial analysts point to several converging factors that motivated these well-timed transactions. Primarily, portfolio diversification remains a cornerstone of prudent wealth management for individuals whose net worth is overwhelmingly tied to a single stock. After a multi-year bull run, converting paper gains into liquid assets allows for investment in other ventures, real estate, philanthropy, or risk-free instruments. Furthermore, potential tax considerations ahead of anticipated regulatory changes often influence the timing of such substantial sales. The role of pre-arranged 10b5-1 plans cannot be overstated. These mechanisms demonstrate that the sales were not reactive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations or undisclosed company news. Instead, they were methodical strategies filed months in advance. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg’s $945 million sale was executed through his philanthropic foundation, channeling wealth into charitable endeavors. Similarly, sales by Palo Alto Networks’ Nikesh Arora and Robinhood’s Baiju Bhatt, each exceeding $700 million, followed their companies’ strong performance cycles. Wealth Diversification: Reducing over-concentration in a single volatile asset. Estate and Tax Planning: Managing capital gains and future liabilities. Liquidity for New Ventures: Funding space exploration, biotech, or climate tech initiatives. Philanthropic Commitments: Fulfilling pledges to foundations and charitable causes. Market Impact and Investor Sentiment Analysis Historically, large insider sales can trigger investor anxiety, perceived as a bearish signal. However, the market’s reaction to the 2025 sales was notably muted. This resilience is attributed to the transparent, plan-based nature of the transactions and the underlying strength of the companies involved. Nvidia, for example, continued its ascent even after CEO Jensen Huang’s sale, underscoring that the market differentiated between personal financial planning and corporate fundamentals. The broader economic impact of $16 billion re-entering the liquidity pool is significant. This capital likely flowed into various sectors, including: Venture capital and private equity funds Real estate and asset markets Government bonds and fixed-income securities Direct investment in startup ecosystems Market regulators and academics closely monitor such activity for patterns. The 2025 data provides a case study in how modern executive compensation, heavily weighted in stock awards, interacts with historic market peaks. It also highlights the maturation of trading protocols designed to ensure fairness and transparency in public markets. The AI Engine Driving Record Valuations The common thread enabling these sales was the pervasive AI rally. Demand for semiconductors, cloud infrastructure, data center networking, and AI software tools created a rising tide that lifted all major tech stocks. Nvidia’s milestone as the first $5 trillion company symbolized this era. Similarly, Arista Networks benefited from the need for high-speed data transfer between AI servers. Consequently, executives found themselves holding equity that had appreciated manyfold over a relatively short period, creating a logical moment to realize some gains. Conclusion The $16 billion in tech billionaire stock sales during 2025 represents a landmark event in modern financial history, not as an indicator of doubt but as a function of cyclical market maturity and personal financial strategy. Executives like Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang utilized established, lawful mechanisms to diversify their vast holdings against the backdrop of an AI-driven market zenith. For investors, this activity underscores the importance of distinguishing between routine, plan-based selling and discretionary sales that might signal deeper issues. As the tech landscape evolves, the patterns established in 2025 will likely serve as a blueprint for how founders and CEOs manage wealth during periods of extraordinary sector-wide growth. FAQs Q1: Why did tech billionaires sell so much stock in 2025? They primarily sold stock to diversify their personal portfolios, which were heavily concentrated in their company’s shares. The sales, executed through pre-arranged 10b5-1 plans, coincided with record-high stock prices driven by the AI boom, making it a strategic time to convert paper wealth into liquid assets for other investments, tax planning, or philanthropy. Q2: Did Jeff Bezos sell the most stock in 2025? Yes, according to the data. Jeff Bezos led the group by selling 25 million Amazon shares for approximately $5.7 billion in June and July of 2025. Q3: Are these large insider sales a bad sign for the tech market? Not necessarily. Because these were almost all conducted under pre-filed 10b5-1 trading plans, they are not interpreted as impulsive decisions based on negative insider information. The market largely viewed them as planned personal financial management, and the stocks of the companies involved generally remained strong. Q4: What is a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan? It is a provision established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that allows corporate insiders to set up a predetermined plan for buying or selling company stock. The plan must be established when the insider is not in possession of material non-public information, shielding the trades from allegations of insider trading. Q5: How did the AI boom contribute to these sales? The AI boom caused the stock prices of major technology companies—especially those in semiconductors, cloud computing, and networking—to soar to all-time highs throughout 2025. This massive appreciation increased the value of the equity holdings of founders and CEOs, creating a powerful incentive to sell a portion and lock in gains.

This surge represents a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, marking its highest valuation in the current market cycle and igniting discussions about its underlying drivers and potential trajectory. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Breaking Down the $91,000 Surge The ascent past $91,000 follows a period of sustained upward momentum for Bitcoin. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the confluence of factors propelling this rally. Market data reveals consistent buying pressure, particularly on major exchanges like Binance. Furthermore, on-chain metrics indicate a reduction in exchange reserves, suggesting a trend toward accumulation rather than immediate selling. This price action is not occurring in isolation. For instance, the broader cryptocurrency market cap has expanded in tandem, though Bitcoin’s dominance ratio remains a key watch metric for institutional and retail investors alike. Several technical indicators aligned to support this breakout. The price convincingly moved above several key moving averages, which now act as potential support levels. Trading volume spiked notably during the ascent, providing validation for the move’s strength. Market sentiment, as gauged by various fear and greed indices, has shifted firmly into optimistic territory, though not yet at extreme levels historically associated with market tops. Historical Context and Market Drivers To understand the importance of the $91,000 level, one must consider Bitcoin’s price history. This milestone sits well above previous cycle highs, establishing a new benchmark. The journey to this point involved overcoming significant resistance zones, each representing a consolidation of seller interest. Macroeconomic conditions continue to play a crucial role. For example, evolving monetary policy, inflation data, and geopolitical stability all influence investor appetite for alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Institutional adoption provides another critical layer of context. Recent filings with regulatory bodies show increased exposure from traditional finance entities. Moreover, regulatory clarity in several major jurisdictions has reduced a longstanding overhang on the market. Technological advancements within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements to the Lightning Network for scaling, also contribute to its fundamental value proposition. The following table compares key Bitcoin price milestones from recent years: Date Price Milestone Notable Context Nov 2021 ~$69,000 (All-Time High) Peak of previous cycle, high institutional interest Nov 2022 ~$16,000 (Cycle Low) Post-FTX collapse, macro risk-off environment Q1 2025 >$91,000 (Current) New cycle high, matured regulatory landscape Expert Perspectives on Sustainable Growth Market analysts emphasize the difference between speculative spikes and sustainable growth. Many point to the changed underlying infrastructure compared to previous bull markets. The investor base is now more diversified, including: Long-term holders (HODLers): Entities with multi-year investment horizons. Corporate Treasuries: Public companies adding BTC to balance sheets. Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs): Providing regulated access for a wider audience. Nation-State Entities: Some countries have adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This diversity can potentially reduce volatility over time. Experts from firms like Fidelity Digital Assets and CoinShares often reference on-chain data, such as the percentage of supply that hasn’t moved in over a year, as a measure of conviction. Their analysis suggests the current rally is supported by strong fundamentals, not merely hype. However, they universally caution that cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile, and past performance never guarantees future results. Potential Impacts and Future Trajectory The breach of $91,000 has immediate and longer-term implications. In the short term, it tests liquidity and can trigger algorithmic trading strategies. It also brings psychological price targets, like $100,000, into clearer view for market participants. For the broader digital asset ecosystem, a strong Bitcoin often acts as a rising tide, lifting other projects. Nevertheless, capital rotation between Bitcoin and altcoins is a dynamic that seasoned traders monitor closely. From a global finance perspective, Bitcoin’s performance challenges traditional asset correlations. Its behavior during periods of currency devaluation or equity market stress is a subject of ongoing study. Regulatory bodies worldwide are undoubtedly observing this price action as they continue to formulate frameworks for digital asset oversight. The network’s security, measured by its hash rate, typically strengthens during price rallies as mining becomes more profitable, creating a positive feedback loop for the protocol’s integrity. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $91,000 marks a definitive chapter in its evolution from a niche digital experiment to a mainstream financial asset. This Bitcoin price achievement reflects a complex interplay of technological adoption, macroeconomic forces, and shifting investor demographics. While the path forward will inevitably include volatility, the current milestone underscores the asset’s growing resilience and its cemented role in the global discussion about money, value, and sovereignty. Market participants will now watch closely to see if this level consolidates as a new support zone for the next phase of growth. FAQs Q1: What was the exact Bitcoin price reported in this surge? According to Bitcoin World market monitoring data cited on April 2, 2025, BTC was trading at $91,188.55 on the Binance USDT market when it rose above the $91,000 level. Q2: Why is breaking the $91,000 level significant for Bitcoin? Surpassing $91,000 represents a new cycle high, demonstrating strong buyer conviction and overcoming previous psychological and technical resistance levels. It establishes a new benchmark price for the asset in its current market phase. Q3: What are some common factors that drive a major Bitcoin price increase? Major rallies are often driven by a combination of factors including increased institutional adoption, favorable macroeconomic conditions (like inflation concerns), regulatory developments, technological upgrades to the network, and broader shifts in global risk sentiment. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s current price compare to its all-time high? The all-time high for Bitcoin prior to this move was approximately $69,000, reached in November 2021. The move above $91,000 therefore represents a new record high, surpassing the previous peak by a significant margin. Q5: Does a high Bitcoin price affect the rest of the cryptocurrency market? Historically, a strong Bitcoin price often has a positive effect on the broader cryptocurrency market, a phenomenon known as the “halo effect.” It can increase overall market capitalization, improve sentiment, and attract new capital into the digital asset space. However, capital sometimes rotates between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Next Crypto to Explode Could Be Brewing Fast, APEMARS Stage Lasts 7 Days as Pre-launch Hype Accelerates",https://timestabloid.com/missed-shiba-inu-next-crypto-to-explode-could-be-brewing-fast/,"Crypto markets move lightning fast. One day, you’re scrolling through charts, and the next, everyone’s talking about the coin that skyrocketed overnight. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and this new meme coin, APEMARS ($APRZ), have captured the imagination of crypto communities worldwide, pre-launch. While SHIB made early adopters millionaires, APEMARS is gearing up to become the next crypto to explode by providing early whitelist access and the opportunity to join Stage 1 at the lowest price. Joining the APEMARS whitelist gives participants a structural advantage before public access begins. Both coins carry massive hype, but APEMARS is engineered for those who want to ride a rocket of momentum while the market is still in its early stages. If you missed SHIB, don’t let history repeat itself. Let’s explore how early participation in these meme-driven crypto marvels could define your next gains. Shiba Inu’s Regretful Losses: A Lesson in Missed ICO Shiba Inu, now a household name in the crypto universe, hit an all-time low of $0.0 10 5637 , leaving many early watchers regretting they didn’t buy. Its all-time high? A staggering $0.00008616 , proving that timing and patience in crypto can turn even small investments into life-changing returns. Currently trading between $0.0 5 7429 – $0.0 5 8549 , Shiba Inu remains a reminder of the wealth opportunities available in the crypto space. Those who got in early are now reaping rewards, while those who hesitated are left watching charts and stories of missed gains. The FOMO is real, and it’s precisely the kind of momentum that APEMARS is built to harness. History shows the potential for exponential gains when narrative, community, and timing align. If you think SHIB was your shot, you might want to shift your focus to a coin built for the ambitious: APEMARS. APEMARS ($APRZ): The Mission-Built Token for the Next-Genz APEMARS ($APRZ) is a story-driven mission to Mars, built around 23 symbolic stages designed to compress seven months of momentum into a weekly thrill ride. Every element of APEMARS is engineered for holders who aim to make the most gains. From its narrative-driven upcoming presale to structured utilities, this coin rewards commitment, creativity, and foresight. Whitelist members gain priority access during the earliest allocation window, significantly reducing the risk of missing entry as demand increases. It acts as the primary entry layer for Stage 1, where pricing is lowest, and token availability is most restricted. Each subsequent stage introduces higher pricing, making early positioning a critical factor for upside potential. The Investment Upside That Will Make You Sit Up! Now, imagine you’re one of the first Stage 1 participants in APEMARS. With a price of $0.000016990 per token and a potential listing price of $0.0055, a modest $1,000 investment could theoretically see an ROI of 32,271.98%, equating to $323,719.84 at listing. Every week, the mission advances through its symbolic stages, and with each stage, the FOMO intensifies. Tokens are limited, demand is building, and the market is watching. APEMARS isn’t just a coin, it’s a movement, a story, and a chance to rewrite your crypto journey. The whitelist opportunity is fleeting, making early participation critical. Don’t let hesitation cost you the momentum that could transform your investment strategy. Secure Your Spot Before it Goes Public: Join The $APRZ Whitelist The $APRZ whitelist is your early gateway to the lowest possible entry before demand explodes. Miss this, and you’re chasing higher prices later. Visit the official APEMARS website. Enter your email in the $APRZ whitelist section. Confirm your spot via email. Once confirmed, you’re officially ahead of the crowd. When Stage 1 opens, whitelist members move first, while others wait.

Final Thoughts: Why APEMARS Could Be the Big Crypto You’ll Regret Missing! APEMARS ($APRZ) is more than a token; it’s a community-driven mission, a structured investment, and a narrative-fueled opportunity.

In a post shared on X, one trader said he made $80,000 overnight using Polymarket by tracking signals tied to US military activity. The trader pointed out that the United States had moved its largest aircraft carrier earlier on, which convinced him a strike on Venezuela was coming. The only unknown was timing, so he built a simple bot to watch Domino’s pizza orders around the Pentagon, a pattern long linked to late-night government work. The trader wrote , “The moment the pizza indicator bot spotted an unusual activity, I was alerted on my phone and immediately purchased as many ‘Will the US strike Venzuela’ shares on Polymarket. GG and thanks for playing.” Early hours of the morning, Trump confirmed the strike on Truth Social, saying the United States had carried out a large-scale operation against Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who were flown out of the country. “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement. Details to follow. There will be a News Conference today at 11 A.M., at Mar-a-Lago,” said Trump. B ets land before Trump confirms capture of Nicolás Maduro By the time Trump spoke , Polymarket positions were already deep in profit. A newly created Polymarket account had invested more than $30,000 on Maduro’s exit from power. After US forces took him into custody overnight, the trader walked away with about $400,000 in under 24 hours. Polymarket bets on Trump’s Venezuela strikes. Source: X/Polymarket On prediction markets, insider trading is allowed. Traders openly act on private analysis and public signals tied to geopolitical events involving Venezuela. Prediction markets have recently drawn scrutiny from regulators. Gaming commissions across the United States argue some platforms act like unlicensed sportsbooks. Sports contracts on Kalshi and Polymarket have grown quickly. Kalshi ended a long legal fight with the Commodity Futures and Exchange Commission in 2025, but that calm ended when state gaming commissions began sending cease-and-desist letters. Crypto and oil markets react as regulators circle prediction platforms Trump later said at a press conference that the United States would temporarily run Venezuela during a transition period. He said the goal was to get oil production moving again. “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure and start making money for the country,” Trump said. He added, “They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been.” Hours after Maduro’s capture, senior figures from his government condemned the military operation and warned against US involvement. Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s chosen vice president, whom Trump said was sworn in on Saturday, called the capture “barbaric” and an “illegal and illegitimate kidnapping.” She said it was an attack on the sovereignty of Venezuela and called for the “immediate release” of Maduro and his wife, saying he remained “the only president of Venezuela.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to reporters at Mar-a-Lago and said Maduro had chances to avoid arrest. “Nicolás Maduro had multiple opportunities to avoid this. He was provided multiple very, very, very generous offers, and chose instead to act like a wild man.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin surged back above $91,000 as more than $60 million in leveraged short positions were wiped out in one hour after prices increased around $3,000 from lows seen after the US began strikes on Venezuela. Trump linked Maduro’s removal to oil supply. He said Venezuela holds roughly 300 billion barrels of oil, the largest reserves in the world, more than Saudi Arabia. “We built Venezuela’s oil industry with American talent, drive, skill, and the socialist regime stole it from us,” Trump said. He added that the oil embargo he imposed remains “in full effect.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|Kalshi|Polymarket|Venezuela,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-04 00:50:10

As DOGE awaits an impending breakout, it seems that most of those searching for another new crypto coin to invest in are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is already in Phase 7 of its presale and growing in popularity. This new crypto coin is still at $0.04 and has managed to raise in excess of $19.5 million. This is set to rise in Phase 8 20% and reach a price of $0.045. This is raising urgency for immediate entry. Those who are investing now are positioning themselves to reap a 500% return on investment in this presale. This is yet another reason why MUTM is quickly emerging as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy that is presently relatively inexpensive in preparation for the next big wave in cryptocurrency. Dogecoin (DOGE) Looks for Recovery With Major Technical Targets Drawing Near Dogecoin (DOGE) has pulled back more than 60% from its 30¢ high, and although a bullish divergence has emerged, indicating a possible reversal, traders can’t expect a strong V-shaped rebound. Trading analysts forecast that there could be a small period of consolidation within a month as DOGE processes these losses and finds support around essential levels. The key level to keep an eye on is breaking above 13.5¢, which would signify a strong fundamental shift, thus contributing towards mending the sluggish market cap, paving a way for a possible positive breakout. MUTM Presale Update: Phase 7 is Live Mutuum Finance, whose ticker symbol is MUTM, is actually in presale stage 7, with the price of the token at $0.04, following presale stage 6, in which the price was set at $0.035, showing a 15% rise in price over the previous phase, and is predicted to go up another 20% in presale stage 8, which is predicted to be launched at a price of $0.045 and is nearly the final stage in which one can acquire this new crypto coin at a cheap price. Many investors see MUTM as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy before its public launch. Currently, the presale has been able to attract more than 18,600 investors, amounting to more than $19.5 million, showing the confidence that they have placed on the platform. The notion that MUTM has dual functionality with its upcoming V1 Sepolia Testnet is what entices investors to invest into this new crypto coin. This makes it a strong contender among the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy for early-stage investment. Mutuum Finance Infrastructure & Price Discovery Mutuum Finance employs the use of Chainlink oracles in order to obtain updated as well as accurate pricing information, which refers to the process of querying token prices in relation to very liquid assets such as USD, ETH, Matic, and Avax. Moreover, fallback oracles, aggregation feeds, as well as on-chain data are also employed in this system in order to obtain updated as well as accurate pricing information, which are considered building bricks in relation to the associated functionality related to this new crypto coin, which deals with valuation, risk, and the process of liquidation in this system. $50,000 Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a bug bounty program, which gives the public the opportunity to receive some share of a pool of rewards that goes up to a total of $50,000. The product has full functionality and can be utilized by the public. This further strengthens MUTM’s position as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy in the current market. The development team has now turned their focus to the service of the MUTM users and investors, in addition to developing the platform. As Dogecoin is treading the waters around $0.15, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues moving upwards, priced at $0.04 during the Presale Phase 7 and moving on to Presale Phase 8, priced at $0.045. More than 18,600 people have already taken the initiative and put money into this new crypto coin, amounting to $19.5 million, solidifying its status as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy for smart investors.

While recent technical improvements suggest momentum is turning in favor of the bulls, key resistance levels remain overhead, which means the recovery seems promising, but not yet fully confirmed. Market Structure Remains Unconvincing Despite The Bounce In a recent market update, crypto analyst Luca expressed a cautious outlook regarding Ethereum’s current market structure. While the price has managed a technical feat by breaking above the 1D Bull Market Support Band, a zone that has historically served as a reliable reversal point over the past several months, Luca remains unconvinced of a broader trend shift. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Momentum Rolls Over, Bearish Move Warning The primary hurdle for a definitive bullish reversal lies at the 0.618 Fibonacci Point of Interest (POI), currently positioned at $3,120. Luca emphasizes that Ethereum must durably reclaim this level to shift the lower-timeframe sentiment. Until this specific price target is secured as support, the risk of the current move being a fake-out remains high. Drawing parallels to the current state of Bitcoin, Luca suggests that the most prudent approach for investors is to remain defensive, as the market has yet to confirm a breakout above the Fibonacci resistance. This cautious stance is intended to guard against emotional trading during a period of high uncertainty and potential volatility. To manage this risk, Luca is maintaining a cash reserve to hedge spot holdings in case a rejection occurs. A failure to hold current levels would likely trigger a deeper pullback toward the previous high-timeframe resistance range near $2,700 before a more sustainable and durable reversal to the upside unfolds. Ethereum Opens 2026 With A Key Trend Shift According to StockTrader_max, Ethereum has started 2026 on a clearly positive technical footing. ETH has printed its first daily close above the 50-day moving average since October 9, a period that coincided with the liquidation-driven shock that rippled through the broader crypto market. This close marks a meaningful shift in trend behavior after months of trading below key short-term averages. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Presses Resistance, but Can The Recovery Survive? From a bullish perspective, reclaiming the 50-day MA is exactly the kind of confirmation sought for following an extended corrective phase. It signals improving momentum and suggests that buyers are beginning to regain control, potentially laying the groundwork for a more sustained recovery rather than a short-lived bounce. Looking ahead, StockTrader_max highlighted the 200-day moving average around $3,550 as the next major upside objective. As capital starts to rotate back into Ethereum and risk appetite improves, the analyst expects price action to gravitate toward this level in the coming sessions.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-xrp-under-2-is-a-great-blessing-heres-why/,"A prominent financial educator within the XRP community has described XRP’s current valuation below $2 as an exceptional long-term opportunity, framing the present market environment as favorable for strategic positioning rather than short-term concern. His remarks reflect a broader sentiment among long-term holders who believe XRP’s current price does not adequately reflect its intended role in future financial systems. Long-Term Positioning Over Short-Term Price Action Coach JV, a widely recognized finance coach and digital asset commentator, recently shared his perspective on XRP’s current market price. According to him, XRP trading below $2 represents a rare opportunity for patient investors who are focused on long-term outcomes rather than short-term volatility. He disclosed that he continues to increase his exposure at current levels, suggesting confidence that broader adoption and institutional integration have not yet been fully reflected in market pricing. XRP under $2.00 is one of the greatest blessings of our lifetime. I am still accumulating. My top crypto holdings: XRP Bitcoin WLFI Solana XLM HBAR VET My top two stocks: ABTC XXI Cash-value life insurance is the foundation of my family’s wealth empire. Cash flow is the… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) January 1, 2026 Rather than emphasizing daily price fluctuations, his commentary centers on delayed valuation recognition. From his viewpoint, XRP’s use case within cross-border payments and financial infrastructure positions it for future relevance, regardless of temporary market weakness. This approach contrasts with the frustration expressed by some investors who remain focused on near-term performance. Investment Strategy Anchored in Conviction Beyond his stance on XRP, Coach JV has openly discussed the structure of his broader investment portfolio. Within digital assets, his largest positions include XRP, Bitcoin, Solana, XLM, HBAR, VET, and WLFI. This allocation highlights a preference for assets tied to infrastructure development, liquidity, and long-term utility rather than speculative trends. In traditional markets, he identified American Bitcoin Corp (ABTC) and Twenty One Capital (XXI) as key equity holdings. Both companies operate as crypto treasury-focused firms, reinforcing his emphasis on exposure to businesses aligned with digital asset accumulation and long-term balance sheet strategies. Collectively, these choices reflect a consistent investment thesis centered on durability and strategic alignment rather than short-term returns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Emphasis on Structure and Financial Discipline A recurring theme in Coach JV’s commentary is the importance of financial systems over reactive decision-making. He has repeatedly stated that long-term success depends on disciplined frameworks rather than frequent trading or emotional responses to market movements. According to him, sustainable wealth is built through predictable cash flow, controlled risk exposure, and intentional asset allocation. He has highlighted tools such as cash-value life insurance as part of his family’s long-term financial planning, alongside maintaining minimal personal debt and evaluating investments through the lens of inflation protection. This structured approach resonates with XRP supporters who view extended periods of low prices as opportunities to strengthen their positions within a broader financial plan. Broader Bullish Sentiment Within the XRP Community Coach JV’s outlook aligns with similar views expressed by other well-known XRP commentators. In recent months, Alex Cobb has also argued that XRP trading below $2 represents a significant valuation disconnect. Cobb has pointed to multiple developments that could support future price appreciation, including upcoming regulatory clarity in the United States. One frequently cited catalyst is the scheduled markup of the CLARITY Act in January 2026, which many industry participants believe could encourage increased institutional participation in crypto markets. Additionally, demand for spot XRP exchange-traded funds has continued to grow, with assets under management now totaling approximately $1.16 billion. Corporate interest in XRP treasury strategies has also increased, with firms such as VivoPower and Wellgistics Health announcing plans to hold XRP as a long-term reserve asset. Supporters argue that sustained institutional accumulation, combined with regulatory progress, could create conditions favorable for long-term price expansion. Taken together, these views reflect a shared belief that XRP’s current market value does not fully capture its long-term potential. For investors who prioritize disciplined planning and extended time horizons, XRP’s sub-$2 price is seen not as a signal of failure, but as an opportunity to build exposure ahead of broader adoption cycles.

This record has been achieved almost two years after the introduction of these crypto ETFs in January 2024. To back this claim, data from a reliable source noted that the $2 trillion achievement was reached on January 2. In comparison, analysts found that the cumulative trading volume reached an all-time high of approximately $1 trillion, recorded on May 6, 2025. This milestone was achieved about 16 months after the launch of the ETFs. Notably, the surge from $1 trillion to $2 trillion took approximately eight months. This duration is half the time consumed to attain the first trillion. Hence, the situation demonstrates a heightened interest from institutions seeking regulated investments in cryptocurrency-related assets. Crypto ETFs demonstrate outstanding net inflows US-based spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs opened 2026 with strong momentum, recording nearly $646 million in combined net inflows on the first trading day despite uneven sentiment across the wider crypto market. Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $471.3 million in net inflows on Friday, while spot Ether ETFs added $174.5 million, lifting total inflows to $645.8 million, according to data from Farside. The inflow marked the strongest single day for US spot Bitcoin ETFs in 35 trading sessions, the largest since Nov. 11, when the 11 funds collectively drew $524 million. Spot Ether ETFs also logged their biggest one-day inflow in 15 trading days, the highest since Dec. 9, when inflows reached $177.7 million. The current cumulative volume encompasses a broader range of assets. To further clarify this point for better understanding, they mentioned that firms introduced spot ETFs that can effectively track Solana, XRP , Dogecoin, Litecoin, Hedera, and Chainlink shortly after new generic listing standards received the green light from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on September 17, 2025. Following this approval, reports highlighted that the agency decided to reduce approval times from 240 days to 75 days. Meanwhile, among the listed new offerings, XRP-based products secured ranking among the most outperformed, generating about $1.2 billion in net inflows since they began operating on November 13. On the other hand, a review from a reliable source declared that Bitcoin ETFs experienced approximately $21.8 billion in net inflows while other ETFs encountered about $9.8 billion in net inflows. In the case of BlackRock’s IBIT , it was confirmed that the spot bitcoin ETF owns approximately 70% of the market share by volume with more than $66 billion in assets under management (AUM). This finding was noted after its volume share hit a high level of 80% in mid-2025. James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, weighed in on the situation. He acknowledged that the authorities have approved several crypto ETF filings. However, Seyffart affirmed that there are at least 126 more of these filings pending approval. Nonetheless, he warned that some may halt their operations if they fail to draw in sufficient steady investments. As the situation becomes more intense, data from SoSoValue claimed that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs showed significant outcomes at the beginning of the new year on January 2.

The largest central bank on the planet is dealing with leadership uncertainty, public attacks from Donald Trump, and a rate strategy narrowed by steady growth and sticky inflation. Policymakers are trying to plan for the year ahead after delivering three straight interest rate cuts while facing louder dissent inside the committee and rising attention on how data is gathered and used. Those three cuts now hang over every 2026 decision.Expectations for solid growth and ongoing price pressures make additional reductions harder to justify.What looks clear is that the turbulence from the prior year did not fade. Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said the attention will not ease. “There’ll be a big spotlight. There’ll be lots of intrigue,” Kathy said. She added that uncertainty keeps the Fed “in the hot seat too.” Trump escalates pressure as legal and leadership deadlines collide The past year pushed the Fed into fights it rarely faces. As Donald Trump began his second term in the White House, he repeatedly threatened to fire Chair Jerome Powell over the pace of rate cuts. Midyear scrutiny then turned to cost overruns tied to a renovation project at the Fed’s Washington headquarters. Between those episodes, Trump sought to remove Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations that have not been proven and were never filed as formal charges. All of this unfolded while the administration searched for Powell’s successor.His chair term expires in May, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ran interviews that included as many as 11 candidates.The clock tightens in January.A Supreme Court hearing on Jan. 21 is scheduled to decide whether Trump has authority to remove Lisa. One week later, the Federal Open Market Committee meets to vote on interest rates. Trump is expected to name his chair pick during the month. Jerome has not said whether he will stay on the Board of Governors, where his term runs until January 2028. There also have been multiple dissents at recent rate votes, and new regional presidents set to come on board at the FOMC have a hawkish bent, meaning they’re likely to resist additional cuts. “It’s still a tough spot for the Fed,” Kathy said. Data, labor, and AI complicate rate planning for 2026 Despite the noise, Wall Street expects policymakers to keep working toward a neutral rate near 3 percent. The federal funds rate sits about half a percentage point above where most committee members see it in the long run. Kathy said Jerome helped guide three consecutive quarter-point cuts and was not blocking action. Future decisions depend on incoming numbers. She expects two cuts, one around midyear and another near year-end. The committee’s dot plot points to one cut. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, and analysts at Citigroup see labor weakness that could support three. Jerome and his colleagues have said decisions will follow data rather than political pressure. Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, sees less room. He expects only one reduction. “The winds are really changing for the U.S. economy,” Torsten said in a CNBC interview. He noted that tariffs, inflation, and uncertainty weighed on 2025, while fiscal stimulus and a steadier labor market now support growth. “The tailwinds are beginning to accumulate and making it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates,” he said. Another variable is artificial intelligence.Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, said its impact on productivity and hiring matters for policy communication.“The Fed this year has got a real challenge in terms of communicating their strategy,” Joseph said, pointing to heavy investment in advanced technology. After a slow start to 2026, the economy grew strongly in the middle quarters and is tracking near 3 percent growth late in the year, based on Atlanta Fed estimates.

The figure points to a 34% increase as the company pushes deeper into China’s crowded EV market and lines up overseas expansion. Billionaire founder Lei Jun announced the goal during a livestream on Saturday, setting expectations for the next phase of the car business. The EV unit turned profitable in November, around 18 months after the first electric sedan hit the road. That timeline landed faster than Tesla, which took years to reach the same point. The profit news did little to calm markets. The stock ranked among the worst-performing Chinese tech names last year as concerns grew around overcapacity, soft demand, and tighter conditions across the EV sector, according to Bloomberg. Xiaomi faces regulation pressure after SU7 crashes Two serious accidents involving the Xiaomi SU7 triggered calls for tougher oversight.The incidents pushed regulators to act.China released draft rules and new standards covering advanced driver assistance systems, door handle design, and battery safety. These changes landed as scrutiny rose around software control and physical build choices in new electric models. Despite that pressure, attention around the vehicles kept spreading beyond China. Karl-Thomas Neumann, former Volkswagen China chief executive, said the SU7 Ultra performance version was a “crying loud warning sign” for Western carmakers. Tech reviewer Marques Brownlee also weighed in, calling the sedan’s software integration “awesome.” The comments circulated as the company prepared its next steps outside the domestic market. Xiaomi expands models as EV growth slows worldwide Xiaomi also plans to widen its lineup by up to four new launches and refreshes, featuring a five-seat model and a seven-seat extended-range SUV. Xiaomi’s extended-range vehicles reportedly carry a small gasoline engine that recharges the battery once power runs low, without full reliance on charging stations. Moreover, in May, Lei announced the Xring O1, a 3-nanometer processor designed for devices such as the Tablet 7 Ultra, promised to target performance levels seen in products from Apple and Qualcomm. At the same time, Xiaomi has warned of the impact of a shortfall in memory chips on its core smartphone business, forecasting a potential supply crunch this year that would raise the price of its mobile devices. Meanwhile, the global EV market is cooling, with sales expecting to grow by 13% to 24 million vehicles in 2026, down from a 22% rally last year. The slowdown comes as Chinese demand eases, Europe grows at a slower pace, and the United States contracts. Policy changes are playing a role. President Donald Trump, back in the White House, ended federal EV tax incentives. The European Union also softened its planned 2035 ban on petrol cars, while China’s growth rate continues to decelerate after years of rapid expansion. In the United States, EV sales are forecast to drop 29% to 1.1 million units after reaching 1.5 million in 2025.Europe is expected to post 4.9 million sales, up 14% from the prior year. China remains the largest market, with volumes projected at 15.5 million vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, compared with 13.3 million in 2025. Even at that level, growth trails the surge from 2020 through 2025, when sales jumped from about 1.1 million to over 13 million. Chinese brands continue to dominate pricing pressure. BYD led the charge with lower-cost models across China and Europe and overtook Tesla in 2025 as the world’s biggest electric-car maker after expanding across overseas markets.

Experts Weigh In,https://timestabloid.com/where-will-xrp-go-in-2026-experts-weigh-in/,"As the digital asset market turns the page on a challenging 2025, discussion has intensified around where major cryptocurrencies, including XRP, could be headed in 2026. Commentary from industry figures highlighted by Digital Perspectives founder Brad Kimes has contributed to an optimistic narrative. The video Kimes shared included insights from Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and Inversion CEO Santiago Roel Santos, shaping expectations for 2026 . Crypto Market Closed 2025 Below Its Peak Despite beginning 2025 with strong momentum, the cryptocurrency market struggled to sustain those gains. Market capitalization reached a record level of approximately $4.27 trillion in early October, only to reverse sharply in the final quarter. By year-end, total market value had declined to about $2.93 trillion, representing a significant retreat from its peak and an overall annual loss of roughly $250 billion. This performance reflected a year-over-year decline of 7.85%. XRP- Where Will Crypto & XRP Go in 2026? – XRP Charts? (includes paid promotion) pic.twitter.com/6jPjub2Ehq — Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) December 28, 2025 XRP mirrored the broader market’s downturn, finishing 2025 with a loss of almost 12%. However, early indicators in 2026 suggest a shift in sentiment , as analysts reassess the structural forces influencing digital assets and reconsider long-standing assumptions about market cycles. Bitwise CIO Questions the Traditional Crypto Cycle Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan challenged the relevance of the traditional four-year crypto cycle , arguing it no longer drives market behavior. He said the industry may now be entering a longer-term growth phase shaped by new structural forces. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Hougan pointed to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, regulatory developments, and the expanding use of stablecoins and tokenization as lasting demand drivers. While cycle thinking still affects sentiment, he expects 2026 to deliver steady gains, lower volatility, and more normalized price action. Hougan also noted that institutional adoption remains slow. He stated that firms such as Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and more approved Bitcoin products well after ETF launches due to lengthy internal processes. This delay helps explain the uneven market action observed over the past year. Inversion CEO Expresses Confidence in XRP’s Potential Kimes also referenced comments from Inversion CEO Santiago Roel Santos. Santos shared a notably bullish view on XRP during a recent Empire podcast episode. He argued that the asset has a credible path back to its all-time high . He believes it is more likely to do so than the other top 10 cryptos, even with weak market conditions. He contrasted this optimism with a more pessimistic outlook on Ethereum, questioning its valuation and product direction. According to Santos, Ethereum’s market capitalization lacks sufficient justification. However, XRP’s lower valuation gives Ripple greater flexibility to deploy its native asset. He emphasized Ripple’s ability to use XRP for expansion, acquisitions, and to strengthen its ecosystem over time.

The fourth quarter alone added 2.5%, even as doubts around artificial intelligence kept showing up in market chatter. Many investors stayed skeptical about what AI could really deliver. Most still stayed invested. The run keeps cooling but refuses to break. Returns hit 21% in 2023, eased to 17.4% in 2024, then slowed again this year. The direction stayed the same. Up. The pace changed. Slower. The Mutual-Fund Yardsticks data shows three strong years back to back. Each year pulled in less than the one before it. None of them slipped below double digits. AI-led rallies narrowed after tariffs shook markets “The biggest surprise in 2025 was how dominant the AI stocks were,” said Ellen Hazen, market strategist at F.L. Putnam Investment Management in Lynnfield, Massachusetts. “Everyone thought the AI trade was over, that the Mag 7 were done, and the market broadening that everyone was eagerly looking forward to was going to happen.” That idea did not survive April.President Donald Trump, the sitting president in 2025, announced broad tariffs during what he called Liberation Day. After that point, leadership tightened again. “The market dramatically narrowed again,” Hazen said. “And since that day the Mag 7 has trounced the rest of the market again.” The gains stayed tied to a small group of names linked to artificial intelligence. The expected spread into other sectors did not arrive. Hazen said the outlook for 2026 remains open. “There are more yellow flags appearing than disappearing for the AI trade, but they do not yet reach the level that makes me bearish on the markets or bearish on AI,” she said. She added that earnings growth outside technology could still widen returns if it shows up. Global funds, bonds, and flows reshaped investor behavior International stock funds outperformed U.S. peers in 2025. These funds posted a 29.8% gain, far above last year’s 4.8% rise. Early tariff turmoil helped drive that result. While U.S. markets pushed to records, investors sent fresh money elsewhere. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times during the year. Bond funds held steady through the moves. Funds focused on investment-grade debt rose 7.3% for the year. The fourth quarter added 1.1% to that total. These funds became a preferred place for new cash. Fund flows showed a clear split. Investors pulled $391.6 billion from U.S. stock mutual funds and ETFs in 2025, based on Investment Company Institute estimates. Most of that came in July, when tariff fears peaked. Those worries faded later in the year, but the money did not rush back. At the same time, $102.1 billion flowed into international stock funds. Bond funds attracted $669.4 billion in net inflows as investors leaned toward stability. Large-cap managers dominated the latest Winners’ Circle rankings of actively managed U.S. stock funds. These managers focused on artificial-intelligence names and other technology holdings. The top spot went to Permanent Portfolio Aggressive Growth Portfolio (PAGRX), a $376.2 million fund that returned 36.9% over the past 12 months, according to Morningstar Direct. Second place went to PrimeCap Odyssey Growth Fund (POGRX) with a 33% gain. Four funds from the Alger group landed in the top ten, including Alger Capital Appreciation Portfolio (ALVOX) at 32.9%. Across the full survey, 1,185 funds with at least $50 million in assets posted an average total return of 11.5% for the year, keeping the long run of positive stock results intact.

Trump said the U.S. will temporarily run Venezuela, though he did not say who would manage the country or how long that control would last. Trump lays out oil takeover plan after Caracas operation Right now, Venezuela holds the largest oil reserves in the world, estimated at about 300 billion barrels, which means it’s above Saudi Arabia, the literal largest oil producer of the OPEC itself. At his press conference, Trump said the U.S. built the oil industry decades ago and accused the prior government of theft. “We built Venezuela’s oil industry with American talent, drive, skill, and the socialist regime stole it from us,” he said. “This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country.” Trump confirmed that the U.S. oil embargo on Venezuela is active. “The embargo is in full effect,” he said, repeating the accusation again directly:- “They stole our oil. They took it over like it was nothing.” When asked how U.S. control of oil supply could affect ties with China, Russia, and Iran, Trump said oil sales will continue globally. “We’ll be selling large amounts of oil to other countries,” he said. “We’re in the oil business. We’re going to sell it to them.” For decades, Venezuela relied on oil exports as its main economic engine. Analysts say China is currently its largest oil buyer, though shipment data remains unclear due to limited transparency. Beijing reacted quickly to Maduro’s removal. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the U.S. action violated international law and Venezuela’s sovereignty and threatened regional security, adding that China firmly opposed the move. Aging infrastructure, sanctions, and Venezuela’s gold reserves take center stage Only one U.S. company currently operates inside Venezuela. Chevron holds a limited license issued by the Trump administration. A Chevron spokesperson said Saturday that the company is focused on employee safety and asset protection and is operating in compliance with all laws and regulations. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said restoring oil production to 1990s levels would cost more than $8 billion, citing estimates from PDVSA, the state oil company. Many oil pipelines are more than 50 years old, and most reserves are extra-heavy crude, which is very expensive to extract and process. The EIA said on Saturday that:- “The extraction of extra-heavy crude oil requires a higher level of technical expertise, which international oil companies possess but their involvement has been limited by international sanctions. Furthermore, budgetary constraints at Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA and a lack of qualified technical personnel and foreign direct investment have all hampered Venezuela’s oil and natural gas development.” Despite those constraints, PDVSA remains the largest revenue source for the Maduro government. Oil markets have not yet reacted. Crude trading resumes Sunday evening. Meanwhile, Venezuela holds 161 metric TONS of gold reserves, which is around 5.18 million troy ounces, worth ~$22 billion at current prices of $4,300/oz. This makes Venezuela the Latin American country with the largest gold holdings. Every $100 that gold rises, these holdings gain +$518 million of value. It’s clear that controlling Venezuela will generate hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue for the US. So will the US take control of these gold reserves? Guess we’ll just have to wait and see.

The rally that started the year didn’t last long, so traders who chased tech gains across Asia are now watching the floor fall out from under them. According to Bloomberg, last year’s market darling, the MSCI Asia Index, beat every major global benchmark by nearly five full points. That win streak just met a brick wall. Asia’s heavy reliance on the global AI supply chain means anything that hits Wall Street’s chip names hits Asia right after. And right now, nobody knows if the AI trade is just taking a break, or running out of gas for good. China ramps up local chip funding as Korea and Taiwan face heat in the Tech Wars AI stocks pushed Asia’s tech index to a record high last Friday. Now, investors are backing off. Everyone wanted a piece of the action last year. This year, they’re nervous. The problem is most of that rally sat on the backs of just a few firms, especially in Taiwan and South Korea. Some are still hopeful that Asia gives them better exposure to AI because of lower prices. But others are warning that too much depends on too few players. Ken Wong, who runs Asian equity portfolios at Eastspring in Hong Kong, said, “We’re calling more of an AI fatigue as opposed to a bubble.” He said if companies cut back spending or if profits start slipping, it’s game over for some of these stocks. While all that’s happening, China is going the other way by working on a massive $70 billion package to support the country’s chipmakers. Two big names (MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai and Moore Threads Technology) just had blockbuster public listings. That kicked off a rush. Now, everyone wants in. Baidu’s AI chip division and GigaDevice Semiconductor are both planning new offerings. Why is money pouring in? Because it’s cheap. Tech stocks listed in Hong Kong are trading at 19 times forward earnings. The Nasdaq 100 is sitting at 25. That’s enough of a gap to grab attention. Rate confusion spreads while investors rotate into weaker markets The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates twice this year. That puts pressure on central banks from India to Thailand to follow suit. The idea is to help economies grow faster. But not everyone’s on board. The Bank of Japan is under fire to raise rates again. The yen is too weak, and inflation’s too hot. New Zealand’s central bank says it’s done cutting for now. Australia is getting ready to hike again. This back-and-forth is leaving traders stuck in guessing mode. Dilin Wu at Pepperstone said India’s low-rate strategy could help its stock market. He also said Thailand, Malaysia, and even China could benefit if their central banks go easier. But companies loaded with debt? They’re in trouble. The crowd chasing AI stocks last year is now digging through the trash pile for anything with upside. India’s Nifty 50 only rose 10.5% in 2025. That was its worst showing against the MSCI Asia Pacific Index since 1998. Now it’s cheap. Lower taxes and possible rate cuts might flip the story. Indonesia is getting some attention too. Its government is still trying to boost spending, and that could help. Southeast Asia fell behind last year. Traders think it might finally catch up. Xin-Yao Ng, who manages money at Aberdeen, said, “India and ASEAN are interesting for being very non-AI.” He’s watching for companies with good cash flow, low drama, and fat dividends. Then there’s South Korea, which absolutely crushed last year when its stocks outstandingly rallied 76% year-to-date, thanks to AI euphoria and hype around market reforms. Just this Friday, Cryptopolitan reported that Korea’s Kospi index added another 2.3%, blasting past 4,300. President Lee Jae Myung wants it to hit 5,000. Samsung is flying. It hit another all-time high after co-CEO said customers were saying, “Samsung is back.” That buzz got louder when data showed semiconductor exports from Korea jumped 43% in December. Between Samsung and SK Hynix, Asia’s still got power players in the global AI race.

He sees enormous potential in expanding into real-world assets (RWAs) and institutional markets, projecting that Aave could ultimately support a $500 trillion asset base and onboard tens of millions of users through the Aave App. Kulechov said: Today, most of Aave’s lending is concentrated around ETH, BTC, or leverage-driven looping strategies correlated with crypto market cycles. When I started Aave (originally as ETHLend) in 2017, the vision was to use smart contracts to power lending across virtually all asset classes and use cases. A core aspect of this strategy is the upcoming Aave V4, a modular architecture designed to integrate new lending models and asset classes safely. The design allows innovation without compromising protocol integrity, enabling both crypto-native and RWA-backed use cases while creating a developer-friendly environment to encourage innovation. Consumer Products, Revenue, And Alignment Addressing operational concerns, Kulechov stressed that mainstream consumer-grade products needed to onboard millions of users should be developed by independent, highly autonomous teams on top of the permissionless Aave Protocol rather than funded or controlled directly by the DAO. This approach ensures rapid execution while allowing the protocol to benefit from increased usage and revenue. Kulechov said: World class consumer products are built by highly opinionated teams with the autonomy to move quickly. While decentralized governance works well for protocol economics, it is not suited for product-level decision making. Kulechov also pledged to share revenue generated outside the protocol with token holders and confirmed that upcoming proposals will include clear guardrails for branding and revenue alignment. In his concluding notes, Kulechov reinforced his belief in Aave’s potential while also appealing for collaboration to drive the protocol and its native token’s success.",Crypto News|aave|Aave DAO|Aave Labs|Aave V4|Governance Dispute|Revenue sharing|Stani Kulechov,EN,0,0,AAVE|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-04 03:00:43

December hiring likely stayed soft, closing a year defined by hesitation instead of momentum. Economists expect about 60,000 jobs were added in the final month, a small figure that capped a year where payrolls rose roughly 670,000. That stands far below the 2 million jobs created in 2024 and shows how sharply conditions cooled. Unemployment probably edged down to 4.5% in December from a four-year high, but that dip offered little comfort. Employers largely stopped expanding payrolls after years of fighting for workers. Job openings stabilized, signaling many firms felt fully staffed. At the same time, shifting trade policies under President Donald Trump pushed companies to protect margins. Cost controls came first. New hires came later, if at all. The labor market did not crash. It simply stalled. Employers slow hiring as costs, AI, and policy risks pile up Hiring slowed across most industries as companies adjusted to a different playbook. Artificial intelligence became a bigger part of daily operations, allowing firms to raise output without adding headcount. That shift limited payroll growth even as demand stayed steady. Still, the slowdown did not trigger mass job cuts. Layoffs remained rare, keeping the labor market locked in a low-hire, low-fire pattern. Meanwhile after delivering three interest-rate cuts at the end of 2025, policymakers are expected to hold off for at least the first 3 to 4 months of this year. Officials want clearer evidence that inflation continues to cool before making further moves. Steady employment, even at low growth, gives them room to wait. But more data is coming fast.The Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release November figures on job openings, quits, and layoffs.Those numbers will show whether workers feel confident enough to leave jobs and whether firms are quietly trimming staff. The Institute for Supply Management will also publish December surveys covering manufacturers and service providers, offering another look at hiring trends inside key sectors of the labor market. The government will release October housing starts next week, and the University of Michigan will publish its preliminary January consumer sentiment index, both updates that will show whether households and builders are reacting to the same uncertainty weighing on employers. Economists warn the hiring freeze cannot last forever With retirements continuing, American companies will eventually need new workers. Claudia Sahm said the labor market faces two clear roads in 2026. They are:- “We really slow down in terms of hiring, and we hit a place where the bottom falls out. And it’s not just about slow hiring, it’s about firing workers and a recession.” “The uncertainty lifts, they’re ready to pick up hiring, and you see things really stabilize and kind of look more like a labor market that we’ve been more used to in terms of the job opportunities and adding workers.” A rise in layoffs would flood the market with job seekers, increasing competition. If hiring improves across sectors while layoffs stay low, conditions would ease for unemployed Americans and workers stuck waiting for openings. Chris Martin, lead researcher at Glassdoor, said change is inevitable. “At some point, something has to happen,” Martin said. He added that even a return to stability could lead to more quits, more hires, and more firings compared with today’s frozen state. A ZipRecruiter survey found in September that 63% of employers expect to hire moderately or significantly in 2024, a 13% drop from 2024.

Vitalik compared Ethereum’s situation to peer-to-peer networks that came long before it, like “BitTorrent (2000): huge total bandwidth, highly decentralized, no consensus.” Ethereum starts large gas limit increases in 2026 through BALs and ePBS Vitalik then pointed to Bitcoin in 2009, saying:- “Bitcoin (2009): highly decentralized, consensus, but low bandwidth because it’s not “distributed” in the sense of work being split up, it’s replicated. Now, Ethereum with PeerDAS (2025) and ZK-EVMs (expect small portions of the network using it in 2026), we get: decentralized, consensus and high bandwidth. But now it’s time to talk about what this combination means for Ethereum.” Vitalik said these upgrades are already running code, not theory. Data availability sampling is active on mainnet today. zk-EVMs already hit production performance levels. Safety checks are the final step, and Vitalik traced that work back ten years, starting with his first data availability research commit and later zk-EVM experiments that began around 2020. The rollout plan is staged. In 2026, Ethereum expects large gas limit increases that do not depend on zk-EVMs, driven by BALs and ePBS. That same year should also bring the first chances to run a zk-EVM node on parts of the network, according to Vitalik. From 2027 through 2030, Ethereum plans even larger gas limit jumps as zk-EVMs become the main block validation method. “ZKEVM becomes the primary way to validate blocks on the network,” Vitalik wrote. Another piece is distributed block building. Vitalik said the long-term goal is a setup where a full block is never built in one place. He said this is not urgent, but worth building toward. In Vitalik’s words:- “Even before that point, we want the meaningful authority in block building to be as distributed as possible. This can be done either in-protocol (eg. maybe we figure out how to expand FOCIL to make it a primary channel for txs), or out-of-protocol with distributed builder marketplaces. This reduces risk of centralized interference with real-time transaction inclusion.” Vitalik said that it also improves geographic fairness. The Ethereum Foundation has it stated on its website that higher gas limits on Ethereum are made safe by zk-EVMs increase capacity, cut congestion, and stabilize fees. The Foundation said :- “Bringing zkEVMs to L1 is a multi-faceted effort. Our work is organized into three core workstreams, with parallel progress on client implementations.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

It rocketed from just over $0.30 to a multi-year peak of $1.30 within the first month, especially since Charles Hoskinson hinted that he would work with the Trump administration in 2025. After a brief correction, it entered 2025 at around $0.85 and experienced enhanced volatility in the first few months. It reclaimed the $1.00 level almost immediately, then dumped below $0.55, and surged back up to almost $1.20 by March. What followed, though, was a prolonged correction with a few brief spikes in late August. Ultimately, ADA dumped hard by the end of 2025, finishing the year with a 60% drop. With 2026 already here, we decided to ask around some AI solutions about ADA’s potential this year, and here are the most shocking scenarios. Bears to Keep Dominating Following such a painful and frustrating year, ChatGPT warned that the landscape might remain the same in 2026, at least in the first couple of months. The hopes from Cardano’s community that ADA might rejoin the larger-cap altcoin leaders after it surged past $1.00 in early 2025 led to a disappointing ending, which, if it persists, could drive the asset further south. More specifically, the AI solution provided a bear target of $0.10-$0.15 if the “broader crypto market remains selective in 2026.” ADA could lose its remaining support and plunge to levels last seen during the depths of the previous bear markets. Such a 60% price drop from current prices could force many long-term holders to capitulate, it added. Base and Bull Scenarios ChatGPT admitted that such a disastrous price decline appears unlikely at the moment, and outlined its most probable scenario for 2026 – a rangebound consolidation between $0.30 and $0.80. However, it also provided a more speculative bull case, in which the asset flies past the $1.00 resistance and aims for new heights, not seen in years. If this “dramatic revival” indeed takes place, driven by real traction in Cardano’s ecosystem, growth of decentralized apps that attract meaningful activity, then ADA could knock on the doors of $2.00 or even $3.00. “Such a move would likely be driven by renewed speculative interest combined with improved on-chain usage – a combination that has fueled explosive rallies in past cycles,” OpenAI’s platform concluded.

Yes the Venezuela invasion indeed is a very big deal, because Washington hasn’t carried out this kind of direct action in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama that removed military leader Manuel Noriega under similar claims. And Cryptopolitan reported earlier that Trump told reporters at a press conference after the fact that the United States would run Venezuela with a group, adding Secretary of State Marco Rubio would work on the details. Around the same time, Trump warned that the U.S. could step in to support protesters in Iran if security forces opened fire, as unrest there left several dead and created the most serious internal challenge for Iranian authorities in years. Oil markets and investors hold steady in the face of massive geopolitical uncertainty Attention in markets has of course stayed on energy, not stocks or crypto. The OPEC+, which includes Venezuela and Russia among others, is gonna meet in a few hours to discuss output levels. Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia, said the reaction across markets is limited. “The overall market reaction will be muted. We might get some market moving news tomorrow during the OPEC meeting,” Jamie said. He added that shares of large oil companies and drillers could attract interest if talk grows around rebuilding the oil industry in Venezuela. Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy and MENA research at RBC Capital Markets in New York, said the scale of any rebuild would be large. “This an enormous undertaking, given the decades-long decline of the oil sector, also the U.S. regime change and nation-building track record is not one of unambiguous success,” Helima said. Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management in Brookfield, Wisconsin, said the situation was expected. Brian added that from an investor’s POV, large oil reserves could become available over time. He also said the move sends a signal to leadership in Iran and possibly Russia about Trump’s willingness to act. “Markets sometimes swing into risk-off mode on expectations of conflict, but once the conflict starts, they rotate quickly to risk-on,” Brian said, adding that oil could be the only market to react, especially with forecasts already pointing to a supply glut. Venezuela is also dealing with a long-standing oil decline and legal disputes Economists say geopolitical pressure is already part of daily trading. Marchel Alexandrovich, an economist at Saltmarsh Economics in London, said current events add to existing strain. “From the unresolved trade tensions around U.S. tariffs, to Ukraine, Iran, Taiwan and, now, Venezuela, it is clear that the markets are having to cope with significantly more headline risk,” Marchel said . Tina Fordham, founder and geopolitical strategist at Fordham Global Foresight in London, said optimism often appears early. “I feel that there’s a lot of optimism about a post-Maduro, post-Chavez Venezuela. I think reality is likely to be messier,” Tina said. She added that the Monday market open could fuel risk appetite tied to possible change in Iran. “We’ve periodically seen these protests. This time, it’s gaining momentum,” Tina said, pointing out that both Iran and Venezuela are energy producers and consumer markets that have remained closed to global investors. The country holds some of the world’s largest estimated oil reserves, yet output has collapsed over decades due to mismanagement and lost foreign investment after oil nationalization in the 2000s, including assets tied to Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips. Chevron remains the only U.S. major operating in Venezuela. ConocoPhillips has sought billions of dollars tied to three seized projects from nearly twenty years ago, while Exxon pursued lengthy arbitration after exiting. In recent weeks, oil tankers chartered by Chevron were among the few leaving Venezuela, after Trump’s December blockade announcement that Cryptopolitan reported.

His winnings have already drawn the attention of the online community and even Congress. Some lawmakers have shared their frustrations about insider trading. According to sources, Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) plans to introduce a bill that would restrict insider trading. The bill would prohibit federal lawmakers, political appointees, and executive branch staff from trading in prediction markets if they possess, or could reasonably be expected to obtain, material non-public information related to those contracts. The Polymarket trader started placing bets on New Year’s Eve. The Polymarket trader began wagering on Maduro’s removal on December 31, 2025, placing multiple bets that the leader would be ousted by the end of January, starting with a $1,238.34 bet on New Year’s Eve. Earlier, speaking about the trader’s activity, left-wing political researcher Tyson Brody had even questioned whether this was some war-related insider trading. Later, sports and business commentator Joe Pompliano reshared Brody’s post, pointing out that the account reportedly earned $400,000 betting on Maduro’s removal. He even noted that prediction markets are now encouraging insider trading. Soon after, several X users jokingly speculated that the insider might be Barron Trump, the president’s son, while others focused on the $400,000 cash-out and additional big winners. Saturday’s focus on Polymarket comes on the back of mounting calls by US officials to rein in the platform and other prediction markets. Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, had previously warned that sports-related prediction markets are growing too quickly, posing legal, economic, and ethical challenges while threatening state control and the integrity of sports. The former governor argued that prediction markets are operating unlawfully in the US, evading the safeguards designed for state-controlled sports betting. According to Jake Sherman, founder of Punchbowl News, Representative Torres intends to introduce legislation titled the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026. The restriction targets prediction market trades linked to public policy, government actions, or political results when conducted on platforms engaged in interstate commerce. Ideally, it would limit US officials or those with access to confidential information from wagering on prediction markets. Representative Torres also criticized the Trump administration for Maduro’s removal Representative Torres had also condemned the Trump administration’s role in Maduro’s removal . He noted, “The US Constitution vests the power to declare war in Congress. No single individual has the authority to commit the nation to a war of regime change without congressional authorization. Power cannot replace principle. Nor can the ends justify the means.” He further stressed that the rule of law should outweigh raw military power, warning that history shows regime-change wars frequently create more chaos than stability. Representative Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY), however, praised the Trump administration’s actions, saying, “This bold and decisive action by the Trump Administration is a major victory for American security and justice.” He referred to the Venezuelan president as an illegitimate leader who has enabled violent gangs and drug cartels. On the other hand, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani shared his criticism, “Unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a violation of federal and international law. This blatant pursuit of regime change doesn’t just affect those abroad; it directly impacts New Yorkers, including tens of thousands of Venezuelans who call this city home.” Rep. Yvette D. Clarke (D-NY) also criticized the Trump administration for “kidnapping” Maduro without Congress’s approval or regard for the potential fallout from their illegal actions. Get seen where it counts.

Bitcoin remains above $91,000, while the market capitalization of all tokens rose to over $3.11 trillion. This article highlights some of the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week, including Ethena (ENA), Jito (JTO), Pump (PUMP), and Pi Network (PI). Ethena to unlock millions of tokens Ethena, a cryptocurrency valued at over $1.8 billion, will be one of the top coins to watch this week. It will unlock 171 million tokens, currently valued at over $41 million on Sunday. This unlock comes as the unlock progress stands at 51.9%. Ethena token has rebounded in the past few days, moving from a low of $0.1935 in December to the current $0.2400. It still remains about 72% below the highest point in 2025, a decline that mirrors that of other cryptocurrencies . ENA has seen intense buying by Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMex, who has accumulated tokens worth over $3.8 million even as the total value locked has slumped to $6.4 billion from last year’s high of $14.3 billion. Jito token in focus ahead of a big token unlock Jito, a major player in the Solana ecosystem, is another top crypto to watch this week as it unlocks 11.3 million tokens worth over $5.39 million, which is equivalent with 1.14% of its market cap. Like Ethena, Jito has a long way to go in terms of its token unlocks as it has unlocked just 37.28% of its tokens. Jito’s TVL, which is made up of staked Solana tokens, has dropped from last year’s high of $3.37 billion to the current $1.9 billion. Other cryptocurrencies with large unlocks this week are Movement (MOVE), Rain (RAIN), Linea (LINEA), Pump, and Gods Unchained. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum price has rebounded in the past few days, moving to a high of $3,150, its highest level since December 12. It has jumped by 20% from its lowest level in November last year. The token will be in the spotlight this week as investors watch the ongoing trends in the ETF market. Spot Ethereum ETFs added over $160 million in inflows last week, a big improvement from the previous week’s outflows of $102 million. They had shed over $643 million in assets a week earlier. Spot Ethereum ETFs now hold over $19 billion in assets, which are equivalent to 5% of its market capitalization. Ethereum price will also be in focus as BitMine continues to invest and stake it. The company has now accumulated tokens worth over $12 billion and has started staking them. It will also announce its financial results on Friday. Pi Network (PI) Chart shows that Pi Network price moved above the upper side of the falling wedge Pi Network token has held steady in the past few days. It has remained at the key support at $0.200, its highest level since December 20th. The main reason it will be in the spotlight is that, as the chart above shows, it has moved slightly above the upper side of the falling wedge pattern. As such, there is a likelihood that this could lead to more upside in the near term. Pi Network will unlock over 36 million tokens worth over $7. 2 million as part of its daily tokens.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/researcher-the-digital-euro-uses-xrp-heres-how/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE directed attention to a specific institutional trajectory that is already unfolding within the European Union. His post centered on the Digital Euro and its apparent alignment with XRP-based infrastructure, pointing readers to publicly available developments rather than hypothetical partnerships. The post highlights how regulatory timelines, pilot programs, and existing distributed ledger technology initiatives collectively form a coherent narrative around settlement architecture in Europe. The Digital Euro using XRP. @DigPerspectives pic.twitter.com/LvkzyaKvbM — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 31, 2025 Digital Euro Timelines and Official Signals The substance of SMQKE’s post was reinforced by commentary from Digital Perspectives, who revisited recent statements from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. Lagarde confirmed that preparatory work for a Digital Euro is advancing, with key decisions expected in the near term and a formal rollout projected for 2029. This timeline aligns with prior disclosures from the European Union regarding central bank digital currency preparation, providing an official anchor for broader infrastructure discussions. The emphasis was not on whether a Digital Euro will exist, but on how it is being engineered. SMQKE’s reference underscored that the EU has already moved beyond conceptual design into applied testing environments, particularly through distributed ledger initiatives. DLT Pilot Programs and Settlement Infrastructure Central to the analysis was the EU’s Distributed Ledger Technology pilot program, which has been established to test issuance and settlement mechanisms for digital financial instruments, including potential central bank digital currencies. SMQKE highlighted that this program is not theoretical; it is designed to evaluate real-world performance under regulatory supervision. Within this framework, Axology was identified as a key technological layer. Axology operates as an XRP Ledger–based settlement system designed to handle DLT transactions efficiently. Its role within the EU context is especially relevant given its involvement in initiatives connected to tokenized securities and secondary market settlement. Digital Perspectives’s commentary suggests that this infrastructure positioning places XRP-linked technology inside the operational perimeter of European financial experimentation. Tokenization and Network Capabilities The post also drew a clear distinction between settlement networks designed for institutional finance and those optimized primarily for value storage. Tokenized securities , which are a core focus of the EU’s DLT efforts, require features such as compliance-aware settlement, interoperability, and high-throughput transaction finality. SMQKE emphasized that these requirements are being actively addressed within the EU pilot environment.

This comparison was not presented as an attack on Bitcoin , but as a functional observation about differing design objectives across blockchain networks. Why the Observation Matters By connecting official EU timelines, DLT pilot programs, Axology’s XRP Ledger foundation, and the push toward tokenized securities, SMQKE presented a consolidated view of how the Digital Euro’s technical pathway is forming. The implication was not that outcomes are finalized, but that infrastructure decisions are already being made within regulated environments. For observers tracking institutional adoption, the post highlighted where practical implementation appears to be taking shape rather than where market narratives are most visible.

Thus, the cryptocurrency added almost three grand since the attacks began from bottom to top before it retraced slightly to around $91,300 as of press time.

Two of the tokens linked to the US President, WLFI and TRUMP, are among the biggest gainers, with the former skyrocketing by 14%, while the latter is up by nearly 7%. Given the consequences of the attack and the fact that Trump said the US will run the Venezuela oil industry for now, analysts expect further volatility on Sunday at 6 PM ET when the oil futures open in some markets. The Kobeissi Letter explained that Venezuela has over 300 billion barrels of crude oil reserves, which will reportedly be under US control. With oil prices at $57 per barrel, this would put the country’s total reserves at $17.3 trillion. The analysts added that even if the US sells this oil for half the market rate, the value of $8.7 trillion would be larger than the GDP of all countries except China and the US. Consequently, they noted that “most people do not realize how much the world just changed,” and warned that more volatility is expected once financial markets, especially oil, open for trading. This is absolutely insane: Venezuela currently has 303 billion barrels of crude oil reserves, which Trump says the US now controls.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-showing-early-breakout-behavior-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto has presented a comparative analysis that places XRP’s current market structure alongside its behavior in the 2016–2017 cycle. The focus of the post is not on short-term price fluctuations, but on the duration and character of consolidation preceding major upside movements. According to the analysis, XRP has just completed approximately 393 days of sideways accumulation, a timeframe that closely mirrors the period observed before the well-documented breakout in early 2017. The charts attached to the post align two multi-month windows: one covering from 2016 to 2017 and the other spanning from 2024 to 2025. In both cases, price action is shown moving within a tightening range after an extended period of volatility. The comparison emphasizes time symmetry rather than price symmetry, suggesting that market participants should focus on how long XRP has been consolidating rather than how high or low it has traded during that phase. $XRP just completed 393 days of sideways accumulation — the same duration seen before the 2017 breakout. Back then, price chopped, compressed, and bored everyone out before expanding aggressively. Now, $XRP is showing early breakout behavior while attention is still low. pic.twitter.com/9kayvuTdF7 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 31, 2025 Compression and Market Fatigue Before Expansion Steph Is Crypto’s assessment highlights that the earlier cycle was characterized by prolonged price compression that gradually reduced volatility and market interest. During that period, XRP traded within narrowing boundaries, creating conditions where participation declined, and sentiment became increasingly indifferent. Only after this extended phase did price expansion occur, resulting in a sharp and sustained move higher. The current chart structure is presented as following a similar progression. XRP has spent more than a year moving laterally, forming a descending compression pattern that has limited upside while steadily absorbing supply. The analyst notes that this type of environment historically tends to remove speculative excess and weak positioning, leaving the market structurally prepared for a directional move once resistance is resolved. Early Signs of Structural Change The post argues that XRP is now exhibiting what Steph Is Crypto describes as early breakout behavior, despite broader market attention remaining subdued. Rather than pointing to a completed breakout, the emphasis is on subtle changes in structure that often precede stronger moves, such as price pressing against descending resistance and holding higher lows within the compression zone. An additional perspective was provided in a reply by X user dibscrypto, who reinforced the relevance of the 393-day accumulation period. The commenter described the pattern as a powerful fractal, noting that the descending triangle formation and reduced public interest closely resemble conditions seen ahead of the 2017 expansion. The comment further suggested that sustained closes above the descending trendline, accompanied by volume, would be a critical confirmation signal.

The implication is not that price appreciation is guaranteed, but that extended accumulation phases have historically preceded significant repricing events for XRP. The comparison to 2016–2017 is used to contextualize the present market, highlighting how long-term structural setups often develop quietly before attracting wider attention. In this view, XRP’s prolonged consolidation is less a sign of stagnation and more an indication that the market may be approaching a transitional phase similar to prior cycles.

Key Takeaways: Hut 8 expanded its Coinbase credit line to $200M to support its AI and HPC push. A $7B Fluidstack deal makes Hut 8 a long-term power supplier for AI data centers. Strong stock gains and a large BTC treasury set Hut 8 apart from struggling miners. The amended facility, disclosed in a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, will be used for “general corporate purposes.” T he expansion builds on Hut 8’s strong momentum through 2025, a period when many Bitcoin miners struggled with compressed margins and rising costs. Hut 8’s $7B AI Deal With Fluidstack Powers Major Data Center Push The credit increase follows a landmark $7 billion agreement signed in December with AI cloud provider Fluidstack. Under the deal, Hut 8 will supply 245 megawatts of energy over 15 years to power a large-scale AI data center, marking one of the largest partnerships between a crypto-native firm and an AI infrastructure company. Hut 8’s strategic pivot has been rewarded by markets. The company’s shares have risen more than 134% over the past year and are trading around $51, according to Yahoo Finance. The rally sets Hut 8 apart from much of the mining sector, which has faced sustained pressure since the April 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Beyond AI, Hut 8 has continued to expand its Bitcoin mining and treasury strategy. Through its majority ownership of American Bitcoin, a mining and crypto treasury company, the firm has increased exposure to Bitcoin at a time when many peers have been forced to sell holdings to cover operating costs. JUST IN: #Bitcoin mining company Hut 8 just announced it partnered with Google for financial backing on a 15-year lease. Bullish pic.twitter.com/NQN9JmW0ob — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 17, 2025 Industry-wide challenges have included higher energy prices and macroeconomic uncertainty, as well as rising equipment costs linked to US tariffs introduced under President Donald Trump. The measures have heightened concerns over supply chains, particularly given China’s role as a major producer of application-specific integrated circuits used in Bitcoin mining. Despite those headwinds, Hut 8 remains one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders globally. The company ranks ninth among Bitcoin treasury firms, with 13,696 BTC worth more than $1.2 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.Net. American Bitcoin ranks twentieth, holding 5,098 BTC valued at roughly $458 million. Bitmain Slashes Bitcoin Miner Prices as Industry Pressure Mounts As reported, Bitmain is cutting prices aggressively across multiple generations of Bitcoin mining hardware as pressure builds across the mining sector, according to recent promotional campaigns and internal price lists circulated to customers. One promotion dated Dec. 23 offered a package of four S19 XP+ Hydro units paired with an ANTRACK V2 container, implying an effective price of roughly $4 per terahash for the 19 J/TH machines. Shipments for that batch are scheduled to begin in January 2026, suggesting Bitmain is willing to lock in low pricing well ahead of delivery. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s network hashrate fell 4% in the month through Dec. 15, a development that could set the stage for stronger price performance in the months ahead, according to analysts at VanEck. “When hash rate compression persists over longer periods, positive forward returns tend to occur more often and with greater magnitude,” the analysts wrote.

After blaming the country’s officials for certain drug operations, the US military bombed its capital, Caracas, and arrested its leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife. In his first interview and address to the nation after the attacks, US President Donald Trump claimed that his country will now run the oil industry in Venezuela, which reportedly has over 300 billion barrels of oil, valued at more than $17 trillion at market prices. One of the statements he made caused even more controversy as he claimed that he didn’t tell Congress about the military operation, as it would have leaked. The democrats used this opportunity to criticize Trump’s actions, including Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, who called the attacks “reckless.” He also warned that any plan for the US to run Venezuela should “strike fear in the hearts of all Americans.” He added that the Trump administration had denied pursuing regime change or military action, which was evidently not the case. Some reports indicated later that the Trump impeachment odds reached a new all-time high on prediction platforms such as Kalshi. However, a closer look at the charts today actually shows a different story. The odds on both Kalshi and Polymarket have declined slightly since the start of the year on almost all scales (by June 1, 2026, January 1, 2027, and January 1, 2028). The chances for an impeachment by December 31, 2026, on Polymarket have declined by 3% since the attacks took place. Trump Impeachment Odds on Polymarket Interestingly, the attacks against Venezuela have impacted the two largest cryptocurrencies linked to the US President. Aside from BTC jumping past $91,000 for the first time since mid-December, WLFI has skyrocketed by more than 16% on a daily scale to almost $0.18. TRUMP has returned to the top 100 alts, soaring 7.5% to $5.40.

They have a small number of big caps to hold on, yet they also go in search of a smaller Altcoin which can still have an unexpectedly better side to the upside. This explains why next big crypto talk usually spikes at tokens less than 0.1. When a project is actually underway and there is an usher-in route, the shift of attention may be high-speed. Certain observers consider that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) would be appropriate for such an arrangement at present. It is also not completely deployed on mainnet, but is no longer a secret concept either. It is in that in-between place where 20x conversations are likely to begin. Presale That Pushes Momentum In phase 7, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.04. The presale has been held in the format of a system of stages, and the stage includes a predetermined price and a predetermined number of tokens. Having a higher demand, a given stage will be filled quicker, and the price will be advanced. The project shows it raised $19.6M and had approximately 18,700 holders and sold approximately 822M tokens, up to now. The pricing trend is also narrated. The initial price of Mutuum Finance was $0.01 in Phase 1, and now to $ 0.04 in presale Phase 7. That is a 300% rise across phases. An official launch price is also mentioned in Mutuum Finance and is $0.06. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Developing Mutuum Finance is developing a non custodial protocol of lending and borrowing. The point of focus is dual lending markets. Users are able to lend in a shared pool format and also to avail direct lending terms between users. That is important since it is compatible with various forms of demand as the protocol expands. One more primary entity is mtTokens. When assets get provided by users, that position is represented by mtTokens. These tokens are set for earnings over time. To customers of the DeFi, this is the way which lending would be easy to monitor as well as being easy to navigate. Also included is the trend story of security. Mutuum Finance uses a CertiK token scan of 90/100 and that an independent audit of its V1 lending and borrowing protocol was performed by Halborn . It has also mentioned a bug bounty of $50k, which is an indicator of added testing before broader implementation. V1 Timing and Phase Speed Per official statements by Mutuum Finance , V1 is being tested in Sepolia testnet and then designed to work on mainnet, and it is stated that it will be launched soon. V1 encompasses such integral elements as the Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and a Liquidator Bot, with initial assets of lending, borrowing as well as collateral being ETH and USDT. Your Phase 6 quick selling and whale allocations were also asked about. This is the clean version of putting it without number inventions. The presale proceeded out of Phase 6 with a price of $0.035 to Phase 7 with a price of $0.04 and subsequent phases tend to move rapidly due to increase in attention as delivery approaches. According to some market commentators, bigger buyers are likely to show up in such late stages as they want to see more than they worry. Nonetheless, precise numbers of whale transactions have not been framed in the official statistics that have been made available to date. In a bullish scenario, projections show that a 5x increase from Phase 7’s $0.04 level would place MUTM around $0.20, while a 7x move would imply about $0.28. That is why the present moment is important. Provided that V1 growth continues to be linear and stage distributions continue to become tighter, the transition to the presale token to a widely-followed Altcoin might become fast as Q1 2026 gets closer.

The BMNR stock ended the week at $31.20, up from last week’s low of $27. BitMine shareholder to vote on increasing shares to 50 billion The BMNR stock price will likely be highly volatile in the coming days as the shareholders vote on authorizing more shares. They will determine whether to boost the outstanding shares from 500 million to 50 billion. In a statement, Tom Lee noted that the new fundraising will enable it to have selective at-the-money (ATM) and capital raising opportunity over time. At the same time, he noted that the new authorization will enable opportunistic deals such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Most importantly, he noted that the new fundraising will enable the company to execute future share splits as he expects that the Ethereum price will continue rising in the long term. However, critics have pointed to some major holes in Lee’s argument. First, analysts argue that the new share expansion will be too much, considering that it is nearing its goal of its Ethereum accumulation strategy. Tevis @FunOfInvesting · Follow $BMNR I read through the proposal to increase authorized shares from 500M to 50B, as well as Tom’s thread below.Here are my TOP 3 concerns:I should start by highlighting that I very much appreciate the transparency of the thread by Tom. In it, he argues this is not about 2:42 AM · Jan 4, 2026 296 Reply Copy link Read 99 replies It has bought 4.1 million tokens so far and now holds about 3.4% of the ETH supply. As such, it needs to buy 1.6% of the supply, which is smaller than what it has bought so far. At the current price, the company needs to authorize 190 million more shares. Second, analysts noted that the share split argument is vague as Lee argued that it will happen when Ethereum surges, potentially to $250,000, an event that will happen many years later. Finally, there are concerns that the company’s market net-asset value (mNAV), which has slumped to 0.93. Increased dilution when the stock is trading below NAV is relatively risky as we have seen with other companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which is selling shares worth billions a month. Ethereum price technical analysis suggests more upside ETH price chart | Source: TradingView Meanwhile, technicals suggest that Ethereum price has more upside in the coming weeks. It has formed a double-bottom pattern at $2,766, its lowest level in December last year. Its neckline is at $3,475, its highest level on December 10. A double-bottom is one of the most common bullish reversal signs in technical analysis. The token is also about to move above the Supertrend indicator. It has also moved above the 50-day moving average, while the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has moved to the neutral level. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the next key resistance level at $3,475. A move above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the psychological level at $4,000. BMNR stock price technical analysis BitMine stock chart | Source: TradingView The daily timeframe chart shows that the BMNR stock price has crashed in the past few months, moving from a high of $160 in July last year to the current $30. A closer look shows that the stock has remained below all moving averages and the Supertrend indicator, which is a highly bearish sign. However, like Ethereum, the stock has formed a double-bottom pattern with a neckline at $42. Therefore, the stock will likely rebound this week, potentially to the next key resistance level at $42. A move above that level will be the psychological point at $50.READ MORE: Here’s why BitMine stock price is ripe for a strong comeback The post BMNR stock forecast as BitMine shareholders votes on increasing share count appeared first on Invezz",Crypto|Stock Market|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2026-01-04 07:51:20

56800333,https://timestabloid.com/?p=93989,1767513747,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"When Asked about XRP Price, 10th Employee At Ripple Had Two Words",https://timestabloid.com/when-asked-about-xrp-price-10th-employee-at-ripple-had-two-words/,"A recent post by crypto commentator Digital Asset Investor has renewed attention on earlier remarks made by Greg Kidd, one of the earliest employees at Ripple. The tweet highlights Kidd’s concise response to a question about XRP’s price outlook. According to the post, Kidd focused the discussion on two core concepts, liquidity and supply, emphasizing underlying market mechanics rather than short-term price narratives. The tweet references a video in which Kidd outlines his position in detail, providing context that continues to resonate within the digital asset community. Digital Asset Investor’s post does not introduce new commentary from Kidd. However, it instead emphasizes the continued relevance of his earlier explanation, particularly as XRP remains a subject of debate regarding long-term pricing potential . When asked about XRP Price Greg Kidd(10th employee @ripple ) had two words. Liquidity & Supply pic.twitter.com/VFSfP5FN2i — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) December 31, 2025 Liquidity as a Core Requirement In the attached video, Kidd explains that for Ripple’s business model to function effectively, XRP must be highly liquid. He stresses that ease of entry and exit is essential, arguing that reduced friction in transactions is more critical than focusing solely on the nominal price level. His remarks suggest that liquidity underpins utility, particularly in environments where assets are intended to move efficiently across markets and jurisdictions. Kidd further states that, in his view, liquidity outweighs absolute price considerations. This perspective aligns with a functional approach to digital assets, where consistent market depth and accessibility are prerequisites for broader adoption. The tweet underscores this portion of the video to reinforce the idea that price appreciation is not the primary metric by which XRP’s success should initially be measured. Demand, Supply, and Price Formation While prioritizing liquidity, Kidd also acknowledges the role of supply and demand in determining price outcomes. In the same video, he explains that when demand exceeds available supply, upward price movement is a natural consequence. He notes that those who anticipate sustained demand may benefit if such an imbalance develops over time. The tweet frames this statement as Kidd’s recognition that price increases are a byproduct of market conditions rather than an objective in themselves.

One X user, Guy Schiefelbein, commented that the remarks remain relevant and speculated that Kidd may still hold a significant amount of XRP. Another user, cryptos_smalls, offered a more critical interpretation, arguing that XRP’s large and expanding supply has historically outpaced demand, contributing to prolonged price stagnation. That user further asserted that XRP’s long trading history weakens the case for future double-digit valuations. Ongoing Relevance of the Discussion Digital Asset Investor’s post primarily serves to reintroduce Kidd’s comment into the current discourse. By focusing on liquidity and supply rather than projections, the tweet reinforces a foundational view of how XRP’s market behavior should be assessed. The contrasting reactions in the replies illustrate that while Kidd’s explanation remains widely cited, interpretations of its implications continue to differ.
