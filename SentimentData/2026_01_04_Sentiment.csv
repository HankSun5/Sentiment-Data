56778670,652184,1767463219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56778670.jpeg,Expert Reminds XRP Investors Of The Greatest Blessing Right Now,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-greatest-blessing-right-now/,"Crypto expert JV has told XRP investors about what he described as the greatest blessings. This came as he also revealed that he has been accumulating XRP in preparation for a potential bull run for the altcoin. Expert Tells XRP Investors Of The Greatest Blessings In an X post , JV stated that XRP under $2 is one of the greatest blessings of this lifetime. He added that he is still accumulating XRP, which is his top crypto holding. The expert also listed Bitcoin, WLFI, Solana, XLM, HBAR, and VET as his other top holdings alongside XRP. Meanwhile, his top two stocks are crypto equities ABTC and XXI. Meanwhile, JV indicated that he was gaining exposure to XRP and other crypto assets to counter the dollar’s devaluation . In an earlier X post , he revealed that his XRP has gained over 600% since 2020, while the dollar has lost almost 20% of its purchasing power. In line with this, he declared that he is a long-term investor and that he moves his fiat currency into assets that grow over time and do not lose value. The expert mentioned that he told people five years ago they would be a legend if they bought XRP at $0.17 and held it for four years. Now, he again told market participants that they would be legends if they bought XRP under $2 and held it for the next four years. JV suggested that he wasn’t worried about the altcoin’s recent underperformance , noting that it isn’t about timing the market but about time in the market. He further remarked that most market participants get wrecked because they are trying to get rich quickly by chasing pumps, waiting for saviors, and looking for perfect entries. However, the expert believes that buying and holding is the best approach. XRP Likely To Rise Above $2 Soon Enough Crypto analyst TARA has predicted that the XRP price could rise to $2.30 soon, indicating this might be the last chance for investors to get XRP around $2, as JV advised. The analyst noted that if the altcoin can hold the $1.88 level from here on out, it could make a big push to the $2.30 resistance level next. XRP has notably bounced in the last 24 hours amid Bitcoin’s rally to $90,000. Meanwhile, in the long term, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has reiterated that XRP can reach double digits. In an X post, he stated that the altcoin will likely hold above the 21 EMA and build a base for the next macro move, with targets between $10 and $11. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2, up over 9% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|ABTC|Altcoin|Coinmarketcap|Crypto expert JV|Egrag Crypto|EMA|HBAR|ripple|solana|TARA|VET|WLFI|XLM|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT|XXI,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-03 18:00:19

Some assets remain locked in technical ranges, while others are being judged less by charts and more by what is forming behind the scenes. The Litecoin price reflects that divide, holding steady yet offering little expansion. XRP price prediction debates follow a similar pattern, now centred on whether long-term support continues to absorb pressure rather than where momentum might return. Away from chart-driven narratives, BlockDAG (BDAG) is shifting attention toward timing and access. As its presale enters a closing phase, a limited-time $0.003 price window is creating urgency among late movers. With $441 million already raised and the countdown toward January 26 underway, BlockDAG is increasingly referenced in discussions around scale, ownership, and why missing this final window could prove costly for those searching for the best crypto to buy. Litecoin Price Holds Firm as Downtrend Pressure Persists The Litecoin price continues to trade within a narrow range, reflecting a market that remains cautious despite short-term rebounds. Recent sessions show LTC price holding above key intraday support, though broader momentum still leans bearish as it struggles below longer-term moving averages. From a technical standpoint, the Litecoin price faces layered resistance overhead, keeping upside attempts contained for now. Momentum indicators suggest consolidation is more likely than a decisive breakout in the near term. Within discussions comparing established networks and newer alternatives, Litecoin is sometimes mentioned alongside other assets categorized as the best crypto to buy. However, its appeal currently rests more on network resilience than price expansion. XRP Price Prediction Hinges on a Critical Support Test The current market structure has put XRP price prediction back into focus as the asset tests long-term support near its 20-month EMA. Analysts tracking historical cycles note that this zone has often acted as a decision point, where consolidation or renewed downside tends to emerge. Recent exchange outflows suggest some accumulation, but price action remains tightly range-bound, keeping risk balanced on both sides. From a technical perspective, each XRP price prediction now hinges on whether buyers can defend the broader support band and form higher lows. Failure to do so could reopen short-term weakness. In this context, XRP price prediction discussions remain analytical rather than directional, especially as broader market conditions stay mixed. Among assets often listed as the best crypto to buy, XRP is increasingly assessed through structure and liquidity trends rather than short-term momentum. Overall, the prevailing XRP price prediction depends on whether buyers continue absorbing supply at key levels. BlockDAG Moves Toward Community Ownership Before Presale Close BlockDAG has entered a decisive moment as CEO Nic van den Burgh recently confirmed the signing of a Letter of Intent (LOI) that places the project on a clear path toward full community ownership before launch. This move signals a major structural shift at a time when the presale is rapidly approaching its January 26 close, adding urgency to what is already a narrowing window. According to leadership, BlockDAG is preparing to launch as a community-owned layer-1 network, a model that continues to draw attention from analysts watching governance-first designs. This transition is unfolding while the presale enters its final phase, where timing is becoming critical. Although the standard price level has moved higher, BlockDAG is offering a limited-time presale opportunity at $0.003, giving one last chance before launch pricing begins. Once this stage ends, the $0.003 price is gone permanently. No resets. No extensions. No second chances. The LOI outlines a structured transfer of core assets into a community-driven framework. These include presale funds, blockchain infrastructure, intellectual property, development environments, tooling, and operational systems required to scale without reliance on a single controlling entity. This approach is uncommon in the layer-1 space, where decentralization is often delayed until long after launch. Van den Burgh described the transition as a phased process, expected to unfold over the coming weeks, with the current team maintaining oversight until governance is finalized through a community vote. This timing aligns closely with the presale’s closing stretch, reinforcing the sense that BlockDAG is locking in its launch structure before public trading begins. Alongside this governance shift, BlockDAG’s roadmap remains on track. The presale end date stays fixed for January 26, with mainnet deployment and centralized exchange listings planned soon after. The presale has already raised $441 million, is currently in Batch 34, and has just 3.5 billion coins remaining. With launch pricing set at $0.05, the limited-time $0.003 window represents a 16.67× difference, or a +1,566% upside from today’s level to launch. As supply tightens and the deadline draws closer, BlockDAG’s combination of governance transition, fixed timeline, and disappearing entry price is pushing urgency to the forefront. For those watching late-stage presales with real structure behind them, this final phase is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. Why BDAG is The Best Crypto to Buy Now? Stepping back, the distinctions between these assets become more pronounced. Litecoin price behaviour suggests consolidation without expansion, while each XRP price prediction continues to depend on whether long-term support can absorb ongoing pressure. While XRP and LTC remain important reference points, neither currently shifts the broader market balance. BlockDAG operates on a different timeline. With its move toward community ownership, a presale that has surpassed $441 million, and a limited-time $0.003 entry window now in its final stage, the opportunity is actively closing. As market participants reassess the best crypto to buy through timing and structural readiness rather than short-term price signals, BlockDAG continues to stand out based on measurable progress and a window that will not remain open for long.

Beware of This Potential Scam,https://timestabloid.com/easya-co-founder-sends-critical-warning-to-xrp-holders-beware-of-this-potential-scam/,"The cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly, with new token models and blockchain experiments emerging daily. While innovation can drive adoption, it also increases the risk of projects that may prioritize extraction over utility. Traders and investors are becoming increasingly cautious, recognizing that not every token associated with established networks provides meaningful value or aligns with community interests. This perspective was emphasized by Dom Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, who reacted to a recently announced token plan involving XRP. Kwok highlighted concerns over the structure of the proposed initiative, describing it as potentially prioritizing short-term gains for creators rather than delivering sustainable utility to the XRP community. be careful folks, this looks like a pure extraction play — Dom Kwok | EasyA (@dom_kwok) January 3, 2026 Two-Chain, Two-Role Token Concept The project in question was outlined by YoungHoon Kim, who has drawn attention due to his high-profile credentials, including an IQ of 276 . Kim proposed a dual-token ecosystem: $LAMB, a token on Solana aimed at community growth, and an XRPL-linked token intended to power DAO utility. The concept positions XRP as the foundation for the second token’s functionality, leveraging its established utility and on-chain capabilities. While such cross-chain approaches are technically innovative, Dom Kwok warned that the plan may represent an extraction play, a term in crypto markets used to describe projects designed primarily to capture investor funds without delivering long-term value. He urged holders to exercise caution, highlighting the need to distinguish between genuine utility and schemes that exploit trust in established ecosystems. Understanding Extraction Plays in Crypto Extraction often surfaces in rapidly growing markets where enthusiasm outpaces due diligence. These projects typically promise high utility or community benefits but fail to establish mechanisms for sustainable adoption or transparent governance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In the case of multi-chain token structures, the complexity itself can obscure risks, making it harder for investors to evaluate whether value creation or short-term monetization drives the initiative. Dom Kwok’s warning underscores the importance of critical assessment , especially when projects involve established assets like XRP. Even when a token references a network with proven utility, the design and incentives behind new tokens can significantly impact risk. Investors are encouraged to analyze tokenomics, governance, and actual utility before committing funds. XRP Community Response and Vigilance The reaction from the XRP community to Kim’s announcement has been mixed. While some are intrigued by cross-chain DAO concepts, others heed warnings like Kwok’s, emphasizing careful scrutiny. This episode illustrates a broader trend in crypto: innovation must be paired with transparency and sustainable design to gain lasting credibility. Caution Over Hype Dom Kwok’s advisory serves as a reminder that not all new token initiatives are aligned with long-term network health. For XRP holders, evaluating projects critically, verifying utility, and assessing governance structures are essential steps in avoiding potential scams . As blockchain ecosystems evolve, informed vigilance remains the most effective safeguard for investors navigating complex token landscapes.

The current surge in ETH has continued to boost overall confidence while also underlining a gap that exists between top-level projects that have long existed, as opposed to emerging ones that have been gaining momentum lately. Amid the rise of Ethereum, investors are also currently taking a keen interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi-based project that is currently within its presale with undeniable momentum. Thus far, this new crypto coin project has raised more than $19.6 million with more than 18,660 members signing up for its presale, making it a top crypto to buy now for investors looking for early opportunities. ETH Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has just made a bullish cross-over around $2,900, a pattern that occurred before a situation where it increased by approximately +217% from $1,550 to above $4,950. Currently, it is expected to reach $4,811.71, even $8,557.68, showing its massive structural potential. ETH’s price action points to a much larger issue with crypto markets. While there is established upside in market giants, newer projects like the new crypto coin Mutuum Finance provide higher, more rapid percentage increases. Mutuum Finance in Early Stage at $0.04 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in the initial valuation stage in the ongoing presale. With the token price now set at $0.04, while the launch price is set at $0.06, investors have a great chance to capture meaningful upside even before market launch. The project has managed to raise a cumulative value of $19.6 million, with the support of more than 18,660 investors in the initial seven presale stages. As an emerging new crypto coin, it has already become one of the most talked-about crypto to buy now in the DeFi space and for a good reason. Those joining in phase 7 have the potential of enjoying a near 2x jump at launch. This is before a 40x ROI predicted by analysts when MUTM launches. Market strategists have pointed to factors such as passive income streams, community-driven funding, buy-backs and staking as some of the factors that could trigger a 40x climb for MUTM by mid-year. This shows just how much the newcomer differs from an asset like Ethereum. ETH is a strong market player, but its days of sharp rises are far behind it. By mid-2026 ETH could soar as little as 100%, yet MUTM is on track for a 3900% jump. In fact, analysts have stated that buying MUTM now is similar to being an Ethereum investor in 2017. This was the year ETH saw its biggest rally. If indeed, MUTM captures similar upside, and fundamentals show it could, a 40x rally past $1.60 could just be the beginning for the newcomer. Passive Earnings For Users One of the features of Mutuum Finance is its mtToken concept. mtTokens enable users to accrue passive income immediately while still enjoying liquidity. For instance, a user with an idle 5000 USDT in their portfolio could choose to deposit it in MUTM to earn an interest. The lender will receive mtUSDT, and ERC-20 receipt minted 1:1 to their deposit. The mtUSDT accrues yield, around 8-12% APY without requiring users to sell their assets. Buybacks & Staking Mutuum Finance’s buy and distribute and staking solution works to ensure the value of the MUTM token in the long run by pegging its value to the usage of the protocol. Some of the revenue generated from the lending platform is used to buy back MUTM tokens. The purchased tokens are then used to reward the stakers. This means that on top of a 8-12% APY on mtToken deposits, stakers in the project are eligible for periodical dividends. Ethereum (ETH) is eyeing $4,800 as it makes progress. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at $0.04 in Presale Phase 7, shows strong potential for growth. Its projected 40x ROI that could launch it past $1.50, juicy APY and periodical dividends are drawing a huge crowd looking for the next DeFi giant and the best crypto to buy now.

Crypto pundit and Digital Ascension Group CEO Jake Claver weighed in early on the issue, arguing that the dominant narrative around XRP supply misses what is actually happening behind the scenes. Market data has shown repeated high-volume XRP movements that do not align with Ripple’s escrow schedule or typical retail behavior. These transactions often appear without the sharp price reactions normally associated with open-market selling. That disconnect has made analysts reassess how XRP liquidity is managed and where these large blocks are headed. Large XRP sales aren't from escrow or retail, they're OTC trades through Falcon X, Kraken dark pools. Early investors and hedge funds moving massive positions anonymously. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) January 2, 2026 Institutional Channels Over Public Markets Claver stated, “Large XRP sales aren’t from escrow or retail, they’re OTC trades through Falcon X, Kraken dark pools.” According to him, these venues allow major holders to transact without exposing their positions to public order books. He added that the activity reflects “early investors and hedge funds moving massive positions anonymously.” Over-the-counter desks and dark pools exist to handle scale. FalconX operates as a prime brokerage for digital assets, servicing institutions that require depth and discretion. Kraken’s dark pool functions similarly, matching large buyers and sellers away from visible exchange liquidity. These mechanisms reduce slippage and limit short-term volatility. This context challenges the assumption that visible XRP selling pressure reflects fear or distribution into weakness. OTC transactions often signal structured reallocation rather than emotional exits . Large holders typically choose these routes to manage exposure efficiently. XRP’s global liquidity makes this type of activity feasible. The asset trades across many regions and pairs, allowing supply to change hands without immediate disruption. That helps explain why heavy on-chain movement has not consistently caused sustained price breakdowns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Focusing on XRP Claver’s remarks come as he faces criticism from notable figures in the XRP army. They have challenged past price predictions that failed to meet earlier timelines, and raised allegations tied to previous business disputes, including claims of potential fraud. These issues are personal and contested. They do not alter XRP’s on-chain behavior or liquidity structure. XRP remains the focus of his comments. XRP remains the central focus. If OTC desks and dark pools handle a meaningful share of large transfers, public charts only capture part of the picture. The absence of visible selling does not mean inactivity. It indicates activity is happening elsewhere. XRP’s structure remains intact. Ownership may be rotating, but the market continues to absorb volume.

This low volatility signals greater market predictability. The upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $6.05, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $5.55, establishing the support point. UNI/USD 4-hour price chart.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin’s price is decreasing after a bearish trend observed over the current trading session. If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI’s price might decrease to the $5.6 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $16.23 level by 2027 and above $45.20 by 2032. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing negative market sentiment today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are shedding, and so is UNI. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2026? The maximum UNI can reach in 2026 is $10.43, while the average price is expected to be around $8.69. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just below the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.27 and $7.8; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2028, which is quite higher than its current value, making it a good option to buy UNI tokens. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high, which is not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. However, this is not investment advice, and one should seek independent professional consultation before making any investment decision. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2032. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $45.20 by the end of 2032, substantially higher than its current price.

Uniswap historic price sentiment Uniswap price history. Source: Coinmarketcap Uniswap (UNI) token launched on September 17, 2020, starting at $3.00. It quickly rose to $7.00 before reaching an all-time low of $1.03 (CoinGecko) or $0.4190 (CoinMarketCap) on the same day. UNI ended the year at $5.00 after a gradual recovery during the 2020 bull run. In 2021, UNI surged 400% in January to $20. By March, it hit $28; on May 3, it reached an all-time high (ATH) of $44.93, skyrocketing its market capitalization. It ended the year near $18 after a significant decline. Throughout 2022, UNI continued to decline as the cryptocurrency prices kept falling, dropping to around $5.5 by June as the bearish trend persisted. The crypto market rebounded in 2023, and UNI saw bullish momentum, peaking at $7.77 on December 28. UNI began 2024 on a downtrend, briefly recovering to $15 by March 6. After mid-May, it faced selling pressure, falling to $0.14 by July 31, as UNI holders kept selling assets. It stabilized in August at around $5 and traded above $6 at the start of September. In October, UNI reached a peak of $8, and November saw a peak price of $13.58. In December, UNI soared to $18.60. In February 2025, Uniswap was trading near $12, which was below January price levels of $15. In March, it dipped further down, reaching the $7.4 range, and the descent continued into April with a price of $4.7. However, some bullish price action was observed in May, when UNI jumped to $7.5 and finally peaked at $11.74 in July. August proved a bullish month as UNI/USD reached a yearly high price of $12.31, while it remained in a downtrend in September and October. UNI traded near the $5.7 mark in early November. After surging toward $10 in mid-November, the price of UNI declined again toward $5.5 in early December. At the start of January 2026, UNI is trending near the $5.8 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Uniswap,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|UNI|ARB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-03 18:53:24

The numbers that many share on social media can be distorted by exchange moves, not fresh buying. That distortion matters because large transfers tied to exchanges can look like one entity is piling in, when the action is often internal bookkeeping.

When that happens, onchain trackers may count those consolidated addresses as “whales,” inflating the apparent number of very large holders. According to Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, once those exchange-related shifts are removed from the data, the balance held by true large holders is still falling. Balances in addresses holding between 100 to 1,000 BTC have dropped, a trend that lines up with outflows from spot ETFs. No, whales are not buying enormous amount of Bitcoin.

We… pic.twitter.com/dk9XqqckIX — Julio Moreno (@jjcmoreno) January 2, 2026 Long-Term Holders Turning Buyer Reports have disclosed that another group has shifted its behavior. Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, says long-term holders have been net accumulators over the past 30 days after what was their biggest selling spree since 2019. That change could reduce one major source of selling pressure. It does not guarantee a rally, but it does mean at least one key cohort stopped adding to the sell side. Markets react to who is buying and who is selling, and this move by long-term holders softens the case that a single group is driving prices lower. Price Action Shows Mixed Signals Bitcoin has been hovering around the $90,000 area during thin holiday trading. At the time of reporting, the price was about $89,750 Saturday, with 24-hour volume near $52 billion. The token sits roughly 2.8% below a recent day high of $90,250 and carries a market capitalization of about $1.75 trillion based on a circulating supply close to 20 million BTC. Trading has seen sharp moves up and down, but volume has been weak, which means moves lack the support needed for a clear breakout or breakdown. Market Moves Hinge On ETF Flows Since US spot Bitcoin ETFs became active in early 2024, the ownership picture has changed. ETFs now hold a large share of on- and off-chain demand, which can shift where Bitcoin is stored and how flows appear on onchain charts. Reports suggest that ETF outflows have helped drive lower balances in the 100–1,000 BTC band, while at the same time some long-term holders are quietly buying.

Claims of a massive whale reaccumulation wave were overblown because they did not account for exchange consolidation. Yet the story is not one-sided. Long-term holders have shown buying interest, even as large non-exchange addresses continue to shed some holdings. Future price direction will likely depend on whether ETF flows return in size and whether trading volume picks up enough to confirm any move.

While such fears dominate headlines, a closer look at on-chain activity and corporate escrow practices reveals a different story. By maintaining disciplined and transparent supply management, Ripple has established a framework that reduces market uncertainty and builds confidence among investors. Zach Rector recently reinforced this insight, sharing a detailed update on Ripple’s 2026 escrow activity. Rector highlighted how Ripple continues to execute a predictable escrow strategy that balances institutional distribution with supply control, a mechanism that has been consistent through 2025 and appears set to continue into the new year. 2026 Ripple XRP Escrow Update pic.twitter.com/UbhUqco0Rt — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) January 1, 2026 Escrow Mechanics and Market Stability According to Rector, Ripple has maintained a rhythm of locking up 700 million XRP into escrow while retaining 300 million XRP for controlled distribution. The retained XRP is used to supply institutional partners, including emerging XRP ETFs, through over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. By avoiding direct market sales, Ripple ensures that its distribution does not negatively impact XRP’s price, preserving market stability while continuing to support adoption. In early 2026, blockchain monitors, including Whale Alert, confirmed two transactions locking a total of 700 million XRP back into escrow, reinforcing the company’s commitment to disciplined supply management. These actions demonstrate that Ripple prioritizes predictability and responsible distribution over immediate liquidity events that could create short-term volatility. Implications for XRP Price The continued escrow discipline has multiple implications for XRP holders and market dynamics. First, it counters recurring fears of “XRP dumps,” allowing investors to focus on fundamentals rather than speculation-driven FUD. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Second, by supplying institutional partners in a controlled OTC manner, Ripple integrates XRP into growing adoption channels, including regulated financial products like ETFs, without creating artificial price pressure. Such structural predictability enhances investor confidence, particularly among institutional players who require assurance of supply stability when entering the market at scale. Over time, this responsible approach can support a healthier price trajectory for XRP, reducing the risk of sudden supply shocks that historically create short-term volatility in crypto markets. Escrow Discipline as a Signal of Maturity Ripple’s consistent escrow strategy signals maturity in the management of XRP as a reserve currency. By maintaining clear, verifiable patterns for locking and distributing tokens, Ripple demonstrates transparency and operational rigor that strengthens trust across retail and institutional investors. Zach Rector’s update confirms that 2026 will continue the precedent set in 2025, combining escrow discipline with measured institutional distribution. For XRP holders, the takeaway is clear: predictable supply management reduces uncertainty, supports adoption, and creates a foundation for more sustainable price growth.

According to ScamSniffer, the user in question had signed a malicious “permit” signature, which was what led to the theft. That signature was an off-chain approval mechanism, and it allegedly allows tokens to be spent without triggering an immediate on-chain transaction. ScamSniffer shared screenshots of the transactions. As to how the victim was susceptible to the exploit, they believe the scammers would have gotten the victim to sign the permit via a phishing site or cloned dApp, giving them access to drain the wallet. How did the scam happen? SlowMist’s founder, Cosine, commented on the haul, pointing out that the specific phishing group behind the attack is not one of the “mainstream” drainer groups, which suggests an emergence of smaller, sophisticated independent attackers. They also moved fast, rapidly converting the funds to ETH and then laundering the funds immediately via Tornado Cash. The incident was highlighted on January 3 by ScamSniffer via its X page, not long after it dropped its 2025 yearly report. In the report , as reviewed by Cryptoplitan, it revealed there was an overall 83% drop in crypto phishing losses, falling from $494 million to $84 million. However, it emphasized that sophisticated wallet drainers still abound. They just seem to be targeting high-value holders with permit-oriented attacks, as is often the case during a bull market. Permit-based exploits depend on the user’s trust in routine signature requests that actually authorize token transfers off-chain. Unfortunately for scams like these, recovery is very unlikely as the draining happens on-chain and transactions are irreversible. Crypto phishing losses went down, but wrench attacks went up While ScamSniffer has confirmed crypto phishing losses went down in 2025, crypto security experts claim the frequency of so-called “$5 wrench attacks” went up. Ari Redbord, the global head of policy and government affairs at crypto analytics firm TRM Labs, called 2025 a record year for wrench attacks, with roughly 60 reported physical assaults on crypto holders, up from 41 in 2024 and 36 in 2021. However, Redbord believes the actual number of attacks that have happened is significantly higher. “Many incidents are logged simply as robberies or burglaries, with the crypto element omitted, while others are never reported due to victim hesitation or uncertainty about how law enforcement will handle crypto-related crimes,” Redbord claimed. The cybersecurity risk called the “ wrench attack ” derives its name from the idea that even the most sophisticated forms of encryption and data security are susceptible to physical coercion — like getting threatened by a “$5 wrench.” These attacks are inarguably worse than phishing exploits and protocol hacks as they not only put assets at risk but also lives, increasing the stakes for maintaining proper OPSEC beyond wallet management best practices. “No matter how many technical precautions you take or how many factors you authenticate with, no individual is immune to human attack vectors,” Tor Bair, CEO of Hybrid Minds Advisory and former president of the Secret Foundation, said. Although the true number of wrench attacks is difficult to quantify, there appears to be either a higher risk of victimization or, at least, a greater awareness of the threat. Last year May, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau spoke up about the rise of crypto-related assaults in the country, which at the time was the site of about one-third of wrench attacks in 2025, including the high-profile kidnapping and torture of Ledger co-founder David Balland and his wife in January.

CryptoQuant Researcher Says No,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-really-back-in-the-market-cryptoquant-no/,"The price of Bitcoin has made a solid start to the new year, jumping above the $90,000 mark on Friday, January 2nd. While this newly-found momentum could have been triggered by a plethora of factors, an on-chain expert has pointed out that whale activity is not one of them. Look Closer: BTC Whale Holdings Actually In Decline In a recent post on the social media platform X, CryptoQuant’s head of research Julio Moreno argued that the largest Bitcoin investors are not back buying enormous amounts of BTC. This conclusion is based on the Total Whale Holdings and Monthly % Change and Total Dolphin Holdings and Monthly % Change chart. As the name suggests, the Total Whale Holdings and Monthly % Change chart shows the total balance of addresses with more than 1,000 coins and how it has changed in the past month. Meanwhile, the Total Dolphin Holdings and Monthly % Change chart depicts the change in the balance of investors with between 100 and 1,000 BTC (capturing exchange-traded fund holdings). What’s more peculiar is that the Total Whale (and Dolphin) Holdings and Monthly % Change excludes exchange wallet addresses. According to Moreno, the majority of Bitcoin whale data has been skewed by exchanges consolidating a lot of their holdings into fewer addresses with larger balances, explaining why whales seem to be in a reaccumulation phase recently. Interestingly, the data is indeed skewed, as upon removing all exchange addresses’ data, the total Bitcoin whale balances shows a decline rather than an ascent. The same trend can be seen in the lower Total Dolphin Holdings and Monthly % Change chart in the image below. This shrinking balances of Bitcoin whales tells a story of waning demand in the market, sending signals of the start of a bear market. As seen in past cycles, the lack of apparent demand growth is the most telltale sign of impending correction phase for the Bitcoin price. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $90,320, reflecting an over 2% leap in the past 24 hours. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Suffering Historic Losses Since its trading debut, the US Bitcoin ETF market has been an excellent way to judge investor demand in the cryptocurrency market. However, market data hasn’t been telling a pretty story for the flagship cryptocurrency in recent weeks. For context, the largest Bitcoin ETF , BlackRock’s IBIT, posted roughly $244 million in net outflows last week, marking its 2nd-consecutive weekly withdrawal. The fund has now witnessed net withdrawals in 8 of the last 10 weeks, with a total of just 20 weekly outflows since its launch two years ago. According to recent data, crypto funds registered approximately $446 million in net outflows last week, marking the sixth week of withdrawal over the last nine weeks.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc price|BTCUSDT|crypto|Julio Moreno,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-03 19:30:49

When former President Trump sat down with President Xi in South Korea, the two leaders struck a deal to put their trade fight on hold for a year. China gains leverage in U.S.–China trade dispute The agreement showed China can push back against economic pressure from Washington while keeping a tight grip on crucial manufacturing supplies. Beijing made it clear that American businesses could face limits on rare earth elements, materials that go into everything from smartphones to military gear. Joerg Wuttke from DGA Group said the deal could help China boost its share of global manufacturing from around 30 percent up to 40 percent . “They’re telling other countries, don’t mess with us, don’t compete with us, you can’t beat us,” Wuttke said. Yet even as China talks up its industrial muscle, December trade numbers show the country heading for its first merchandise trade surplus above $1 trillion in 2025, problems are piling up at home. A lasting downturn in the property sector has hurt local governments badly. The crisis has led to falling prices and smaller paychecks for workers. Kristalina Georgieva, head of the International Monetary Fund, traveled to Beijing last December and told officials that China needs “more forceful measures to be implemented with greater urgency.” She pushed leaders to address the “imbalances” dragging down the economy, pointing out that such a big country cannot rely only on selling goods abroad. “Boosting consumption would unlock . . . a more durable source of growth,” Georgieva said. China’s supply chain dominance raises global exposure China processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth materials and dominates other key supply chains, including batteries for electric cars, drones, and the processing of lithium and cobalt, according to Eddie Fishman, author of Chokepoints. He noted that heavy American tariffs might hurt China but could trigger a downturn in the United States as well. China also supplies as much as 80 percent of certain ingredients used to make medicines, leaving Western countries more exposed as Beijing moves ahead in new fields like electric vehicles. Chinese leaders said the country wants foreign money coming into its market, as long as it supports “advanced manufacturing, modern services, high-tech industries and sectors related to energy conservation and carbon reduction.” But a fresh report from the EU Chamber of Commerce in China found that “European companies in some strategic sectors are being pushed out, due to regulatory barriers or formidable competition that has benefited from China’s industrial policies.” Europe stands as China’s largest export destination after Southeast Asia. Still, Beijing’s win in the trade dispute with Trump has made it less concerned about other business partners, according to sources close to the matter. For Europe and other major trading countries, China’s growing trade imbalances are becoming what French President Emmanuel Macron described as “unbearable.” China’s merchandise trade surplus with the European Union hit €305.8 billion last year, up from €297 billion in 2023 and below a record of €397 billion in 2022. Beyond industrial policy and market barriers, China’s weakening currency adds another headache for trading partners. The renminbi fell about 8 percent against the euro in 2025, while its real effective exchange rate dropped 18 percent from a high point in March 2022. Falling prices also mask a surge in how much China is actually shipping out, which has grown its slice of world markets. S&P Global Ratings figures show merchandise exports jumped 43 percent since the start of 2020, while imports rose just 15 percent. Rhodium Group expects China’s real exchange rate to keep sliding over the next two to three years as Beijing does little to counter deflation. China’s grip on rare earths – it handles 90 percent of global processing – extends across many other industries, including batteries for electric cars and drones and the processing of lithium and cobalt used in them, according to Eddie Fishman. One of China’s biggest supply chain advantages from a Western viewpoint involves ingredients used to make medicines. In some types, Fishman says China controls 80 percent of the market. As China climbs higher in manufacturing value and takes charge of future technologies like electric vehicles, America and other nations face growing risks, he noted. Even with computer chips, while America holds a technology lead, China’s strong foothold in older chips became clear during the recent Nexperia conflict. China’s trading partners in developing nations face extra risks from this kind of pressure, economists warn. Developing countries depend on Chinese parts for their factories, but might lose their industries due to cheap imports. “Chinese mercantilism is at least as big a threat, if not much bigger, to the prospects of emerging countries as American tariffs are,” said George Magnus, research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre and former chief economist of UBS. At a Beijing meeting, a government adviser noted China’s GDP deflator has stayed negative for a record 10 straight quarters.

Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 88.87 trillion. It is important to note that 87.99 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk network that also drive Bonk’s price. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2026? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2026 and beyond.

The coin has decreased by up to 1.40% during the day. BONK’s key support sits at $0.00000810. On January 3, 2026, Bonk’s price analysis indicates that the trend is in the negative direction as sellers regain control. The memecoin decreased to $0.00000914 after finding resistance around the $0.00000927 level. BONK is down 1.40% in the last 24 hours, signaling bearish momentum and diminishing hopes for bullish traders as the coin loses its recent gains. Bonk 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day BONK price analysis indicates a downtrend. This movement suggests a bearish trend as selling activity dominates buying activity. The chances of reversal also seem low in the face of the larger downtrend. The area between the upper and lower bands of the Bollinger Bands indicator defines market volatility. As the bands are expanded, this signals increased volatility. The upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, serving as the resistance band, is at $0.00000909. Its lower limit, acting as the support, is around $0.00000720. BONK/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral region. Its value is 56; however, its curve is descending. The downward movement of the RSI confirms a negative market sentiment. Moreover, considering the larger downtrend, this marks instability in the trading atmosphere after the return of the selling pressure. BONK/USD 4-hour price chart analysis The 4-hour price chart for BONK also presents a bearish scenario of the market events. The BONK/USD pair value decreased to $0.00000914. The selling activities remained quite intense compared to the buying activities during the day, as the trend has changed again in the past few hours.

Moving ahead, the upper boundary of the Bollinger Bands indicator is at $0.00000968, confirming the resistance threshold. Conversely, the lower boundary of the Bollinger Bands indicator is at $0.00000700, securing stable support. BONK/USD 4-hour price chart.

Bonk price analysis predicts a bearish outcome regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has descended to $0.00000914, as a downturn was recorded today. Moreover, the overall market sentiment remained negative. Technical indicators support the bears, and the price charts also favor the sellers for today. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has numerous side projects that enhance its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2032, Bonk will approach $0.00007046, making it a worthwhile investment tool. However, it is advised to do your own research and consult expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market and lay out a proper investment strategy according to your risk appetite. Why is Bonk down? BONK is experiencing some correction as stakeholders start selling again. However, support still exists at $0.00000810 and is expected to hold over the next trading sessions. Will Bonk reach $0.000045? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000010. Over the last few weeks, BONK saw a downtrend below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000045 by 2030, which is quite higher than the current price. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now, considering BONK’s current value. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. However, analysts are optimistic about BONK, and some suggest long-term targets of $0.00007046, which makes it a viable option to buy Bonk tokens.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history. Source: Coingecko In December 2022, Bonk was launched with an opening price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, giving a bullish outlook according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value. In June 2023, Bonk’s price did not experience much action, and it gradually decreased to $0.0000001927 in September 2023. In October 2023, Bonk started to see bullish sentiment, with the price reaching $0.0000005518, which eventually reached $0.00002445 on December 15, 2023, as the market trends were on the positive side. Bonk closed 2023 with a price tag of $0.00001407, significantly higher than the price at the start of the year but almost 50% down from the highest price point of 2023. Bonk hit key highs in 2024, when the price of BONK rose to $0.00003771 in March and an all-time high of $0.00004115 in May, before dipping to $0.0000223 in August. A late-year rally peaked at $0.00005825 in November, with the token closing 2024 at $0.00003043. At the start of January 2025, Bonk was trading at $0.00002976, and after further depreciation, it plunged to $0.000018 by February, as the market sentiment turned negative. In March, the token dipped to $0.00000959, but it recovered to $0.0000122 in April and $0.000021 in May as Bonk demand increased. In June, Bonk corrected down to $0.00001201, but in July 2025, it became bullish again and reached $0.00004072. In the middle of August, BONK was trending near $0.00002374, and at the start of October, Bonk was trading near $0.00002056. In November, Bonk traded between $0.00000847 – $0.00001379, and at the start of December, the coin was trading between $0.000009769 – $0.00001015.

The market size and maturity of XRP imply a muted rally, which may have to await a positive sentiment drift in the overall market. Conversely, the spotlight has been shifting towards an early-stage DeFi project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently in the presale phase. MUTM is different from XRP, with its strong DeFi focus, an early-stage advantage and rapidly growing holder-base. In no time, the new crypto has surpassed 18660 token holders and has quickly become among the best cryptos to buy for early adopters. XRP Price Prediction XRP’s 2025 was a rollercoaster, with regulatory victories such as the SEC settlement, listing of US-based spot ETFs, and increased engagement with Ripple partners, yet its price declined significantly by 50% from $3.66 to $1.58, failing to reach $5. As XRP embarks on a new year in 2026, technical analysis presents a potential for additional decline if current support levels are broken, although ongoing ETF investments combined with regulatory support might establish a basis for a recovery. While there exists a recovery potential in XRP, its large market and relatively slower pace limits how high it could go compared to Mutuum Finance, which has been termed as the next crypto to explode. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has moved into Presale Phase 7, where the tokens are priced at $0.04. However, this phase is filling up quickly, and as such, the price will go to $0.045 in Presale Phase 8. So far, the presale event has raised $19.6 million. The current token value is 300% higher than Presale Phase 1, at $0.04, and with a projected 50x rally from the current levels, MUTM could touch $2 by the end of the year. In this scenario, a small bet of $500 today could swell to $25,000. Such a growth projection within the first few months makes MUTM the best crypto to buy now and a must-hold in the next bull run. Early investors looking for the next crypto to explode see this as a no-brainer bet. Next-Generation DeFi Platform Mutuum Finance is an open lending and borrowing platform that facilitates the creation of yields, lending of assets, and effortless borrowing. The design and functionality of the platform are focused on the principles of secure returns on investment. The platform uses a two-model approach to lending, which involves Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. Peer-to-Contract relies on smart contracts for automating loans, which adjust interest rates according to market trends. In this way, there is predictability and stability in borrowing and lending. On the other hand, Peer-to-Peer lending facilitates direct transactions between lenders and those seeking loans, thereby cutting off third parties. Say for instance an investor has $7500 ETH lying in their wallet. If ETH doubles in price over the next one year, this investment will only grow into $15,000. On the other hand, if they choose to deposit it in MUTM’s lending pools, it will deliver an 8-12% APY on top of this growth. The initial $7500 will deliver an extra $900 and the investor does not need to sell their ETH. Halborn Security Audit & Sepolia Testnet Launch The lending & borrowing contracts of Mutuum Finance have been audited for security by Halborn Security , and all suggested patches have been successfully implemented. This adds an extra layer of security to the protocol, ensuring that investors have peace of mind, knowing that their assets are safe. The audit process is over, and the V1 protocol is now set to launch on the Sepolia testnet. Testnet will consist of a number of key functionalities, which will include Liquidity Pools related to lending and borrowing, mtTokens that will indicate the deposits made as well as the accumulated interest accrued from these deposits, and an Automated Liquidator Bot. This will enable users to test functionality of the system. First, it will focus on ETH and USDT, which will be its key digital currencies to work with when it comes to lending and borrowing. This, however, will soon be upgraded to enable compatibility with other tokens. Although XRP is currently trading below $2 with limited potential to go higher due to market maturity, a promising opportunity for early investors lies in the Presale Phase 7 token price of $0.04 in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). For investors asking which is the best crypto to buy, MUTM sets itself apart. Its P2P + P2C lending model appeals to all types of DeFi users and their respective risk profiles. The project will soon go live on the Sepolia tesnet where users will get to test its features. This sets it apart from most other projects that launch with no working tools, but empty promises. As 2026 kicks off, analysts see this as the next crypto to explode.

Using a blend of technical analysis, supply dynamics, and adoption trends, ChatGPT provides a grounded forecast for XRP’s price by January 31, 2026, while also contextualizing the outlook with verified forecasts from reputable platforms. AI‑Based Forecast and Range Based on technical, supply, and adoption factors, ChatGPT’s AI‑based model predicts that XRP will most likely trade in the $1.90 to $2.35 range by January 31, 2026, with a median around $2.10. The model suggests that price action will remain range‑bound throughout late January, and it identifies two clear thresholds: upside above $2.35 requires strong bullish catalysts, while downside below $1.90 likely reflects broader crypto market weakness driven by macro conditions or a drop in Bitcoin. Technical Momentum and Market Structure XRP’s price has demonstrated relative upward momentum in the last 24 hours, up by 6.48%. Current trading around $2.00 reflects price appreciation over the early January low. Price movements in late January are likely to remain tethered to broader sentiment and liquidity flows. Adoption and Institutional Factors Institutional interest remains a significant theme for XRP’s prospects. Spot ETFs and inflows from institutional investors have provided measurable support , limiting downside risk and encouraging a more structured market environment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Growing adoption of the XRP Ledger for cross‑border payment services and enterprise integrations further lends weight to the base case that XRP may hold above critical support levels. Positive developments — such as new adoption announcements or integration milestones — could help propel XRP closer to the upper bound of the projected range. External Forecasts for Context Other sources offer complementary projections that, while not definitive, help frame broader market expectations. Finbold’s AI pricing tool, which aggregates forecasts from ChatGPT, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Flash, suggests an average XRP price of around $1.92 by the end of January 2026, which aligns closely with ChatGPT’s forecast. Major institutional forecasts extend beyond short‑term estimates. Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick projects that XRP could reach $8 by the end of 2026, driven by broader adoption and regulatory clarity. Additionally, long‑term forecasts from InvestingHaven suggest XRP could trade between $2.12 and $4.48 in 2026. While these longer‑term views vary widely, they provide context for the potential upside that strong adoption and macro factors could support over the full year. In conclusion, ChatGPT predicts that XRP will likely trade between $1.90 and $2.35 on January 31, 2026, with a median near $2.10. This outlook remains range‑bound in the absence of strong bullish catalysts. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

About 19 .8% of Argentina’s population were using digital assets in 2025, with USDT and Bitcoin being the most popular types in circulation. Why are Argentines into crypto? Argentina led Latin America in cryptocurrency adoption throughout 2025. The country’s adoption rates place it among the world’s top 20 markets. Argentines use virtual assets as protection against inflation and peso volatility, while others view them as more efficient alternatives to traditional payment systems. According to the Blockchain Argentina Foundation’s latest report, which incorporates data from major exchanges including Ripio, Decrypto, and Satoshi Tango, crypto adoption grew by 0.8% during 2025, with 19.8% of the population now using some type of cryptocurrency. This means nearly one in five Argentines has embraced digital assets as part of their finances. “Almost no one today considers having their money stagnant, without ‘working’. That’s why the use of wallets that ‘kill’ for giving a differential is growing and will continue to expand.” Analyst Rodrigo Mansilla noted . Exchanges offer attractive returns on crypto-denominated deposits that traditional banks cannot match. Mansilla explained that adoption was previously related to devaluation and the need to preserve purchasing power; today, crypto usability has significantly expanded with yields in crypto dollars and other attractive uses. The Argentine Fintech Chamber has confirmed that new users continue signing up despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions. Decrypto’s annual growth recorded close to 20% an d de tected sustained interest from a new segment: small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Which cryptocurrencies are Argentines actually using? Stablecoins are the most popular in the region and are used as tools for saving and covering inflation, plus their utility for international transfers. Up to 80% of Decrypto transactions are made using this stablecoin. Satoshi Tango presents Bitcoin as the lead adopted cryptocurrency and USDT as the second, with monthly variations depending on factors like vacations, Christmas bonuses, or elections. In Decrypto, 70% of customers ar e me n with an average age of 35 years, predominantly residing in large cities.

After rallying strongly earlier in 2025 and pushing to new all-time highs, the cryptocurrency has spent much of the recent months digesting those gains through pullbacks and consolidations. That structure was referenced in a chart shared on the social media platform X by Steph, which proposed that XRP’s current market behavior is beginning to resemble the long compression phase that preceded its breakout in 2017. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst XRP Completes Nearly 400 Days Of Sideways Accumulation According to Steph’s analysis, XRP has just completed roughly 393 days of sideways accumulation, a duration that almost perfectly matches the 395-day consolidation phase it went through between 2016 and 2017. During that earlier cycle, XRP spent months moving within a relative range, producing a choppy price action. This kind of extended consolidation reflects a balance between buyers and sellers, where neither side is strong enough to force a decisive trend. In 2017, that balance led to a transition into another technical formation of a descending channel before breaking out. The current setup in 2024-2025, at least structurally, shows XRP once again spending an unusually long time building a base in a range. A more detailed look at the chart shows another important similarity with the transition into another descending channel. Back in the 2016-2017 cycle, XRP transitioned from sideways movement into a descending channel that gradually pushed the price lower over several months. That downward-sloping structure ultimately resolved with a sharp breakout to the upside. The 2024-2025 chart shows XRP moving through a comparable descending channel, with price compressing toward the lower boundary before showing early signs of a breakout while attention is still low. XRP Price Comparison. Source: @Steph_iscrypto on X What To Expect For XRP The 2016-2017 chart segment above shows XRP trading for roughly 395 days in a broad sideways range between about $0.005 and $0.01. Once XRP broke out of the descending channel in early 2017, price moved up very fast, first reclaiming $0.01, then surging past $0.03 and $0.05 within a few days. The expansion did not stop there, as XRP eventually rallied into the $0.40 region later that year, cementing XRP’s first 5,000% move in its history. The 2024-2025 chart shows XRP peaking near the $3.40 zone before entering a sideways consolidation phase throughout 2025. Price action is now in the descending channel, which is gradually compressing around the $1.70-$1.90 area.

A comparable 5,000% move from the current zone of price action would mathematically project the XRP price to about $100.

On-chain data shows the figures fell by 60% compared with those recorded in November. $76 Million Lost Across 26 Incidents According to the Peckshield report revealed via X, hacks and cybersecurity exploits in the crypto sector dropped in December 2025, with only $76.2 million stolen across 26 major incidents. This figure represents a 60% decrease from November’s $194.2 million. The largest single hack during the period was a $50 million address-poisoning scam, where attackers mimicked wallet addresses to trick a user into misdirecting funds. Another notable incident involved a $27.3M multisig breach on a wallet identified as 0xde5f…e965, which was compromised due to a private key leak. Other attacks that made it to the top 5 include the exploit of babur.sol, which resulted in $22 million in losses. The Trust Wallet hack, which occurred around Christmas, involved a trojanized Chrome extension uploaded via a compromised Web Store API key and GitHub secrets, leading to the theft of $8.5 million in user funds. Unleash Protocol also suffered a $3.9 million loss in December after a hacker gained control of its multisig governance and executed an unauthorized contract upgrade. Meanwhile, the Flow blockchain experienced a $3.9 million breach caused by an execution layer vulnerability that allowed the attacker to mint and transfer assets across services before the network was halted. Crypto Industry Loses Over $2.2 Billion in 2025 Hacks Despite the December dip, on-chain data reveals that 2025 was another challenging year for the digital asset sector, with over $2.2 billion lost in the top 10 hacks. Bybit’s $1.4 billion breach in February, which saw attackers drain approximately 401,000 ETH from the exchange’s wallets, remains the year’s most devastating hack. Other major incidents included Cetus, a concentrated-liquidity DEX on Sui, which lost $223 million in May after attackers exploited a protocol flaw to manipulate pricing and drain liquidity. Balancer V2 also suffered a $128 million exploit in November linked to a rounding-error bug in its composable stable pools, while Bitget reported roughly $100 million lost in April due to manipulation of its VOXEL market-making infrastructure. Centralized exchanges were also targeted, with Phemex experiencing an $85 million hot wallet breach in January and Iran-based Nobitex falling victim to $80–90 million stolen from hot wallets in June. In each case, the platforms froze withdrawals, protected the remaining assets, and worked to resume services, while the amount recovered from the losses differed.

Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR up? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a sharp drop to $420 before finding support that enabled it to recover to the current $434 level. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2031 suggests a minimum price of $922.68 and an average trading price of $1,000.34. The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,099.55. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility creating an atmosphere of extreme fear are challenges that Monero traders could face that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and the broader monero project gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Now that 2026 is underway, a Ripple developer has revealed that even more groundbreaking innovations are coming for the crypto project. He encourages the community to prepare for upcoming changes to XRP that could take the project to the next level. Ripple Dev Announces Exciting Changes For XRP In 2026 J. Ayo Akinyele, the Head of Engineering at RippleX, the developer-focused arm of the crypto payments company, has shared an exciting new update for XRP that is gaining traction across the community. In a public post on X, Akinyele sounded optimistic, highlighting steady behind-the-scenes progress on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and unveiling exciting new developments set to transform the network’s future. Akinyele began by recognizing the builders, validators , and community members whose ongoing contributions continue to drive XRPL, emphasizing that their collective efforts remain critical to the blockchain’s long-term growth. The developer also highlighted how RippleX and Ripple are driving progress for the XRP Ledger, noting that they’re both helping to prepare the network for a pivotal phase in its evolution. Looking ahead, Akinyele described 2026 as a potentially transformative and incredible year for the XRP Ledger. He shared plans for several technical upgrades , each aimed at expanding the network’s functionality and making it more appealing to developers and global enterprises. Notably, privacy will be a major focus in 2026. While he did not go into technical details, Akinyele’s remarks suggest ongoing work to improve how transactions and data are managed on the ledger. He also highlighted programmability as a crucial area of growth. Improvements in this area could enable developers to build more complex and flexible applications directly on XRPL, opening the door to broader use cases. The Ripple developer also hinted at new changes to XRPL’s Interoperability, particularly through the use of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology . This development could enable the network to interact with other blockchain ecosystems more securely and efficiently, without compromising data integrity. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is also expected to feature prominently in XRPL’s roadmap in 2026. Akinyele referenced on-chain lending as one example of DeFi functionality that could be introduced, signaling deeper financial tooling on the network. Taken together, these upcoming advancements paint a picture of XRPL evolving into a more versatile and developer-friendly network, capable of a broader range of applications and use cases across the blockchain ecosystem. XRPL Set For Major Technological Overhaul This Year Beyond new features, Akinyele stressed the importance of strengthening XRPL’s technical foundations. He outlined upcoming upgrades for 2026 , including formal specification and verification, as well as a more modular ledger design. These improvements are expected to enhance the blockchain network’s resilience, scalability, and long-term stability. The Ripple developer concluded his post by urging the XRP community to stay committed and focused as they prepare for the next phase of XRPL’s evolution in 2026.",Ripple|decentralized finance|DeFi|J.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-nothing-will-stop-xrp-heres-why/,"XRP Queen (@crypto_queen_x) shared a long-term XRP chart, stating that “NOTHING WILL STOP XRP.” The chart spans more than a decade of data and highlights a repeating sequence of consolidation, breakout, expansion, and then correction. According to the visual structure, XRP is in the middle of an expansion cycle, and she expects that rise to continue. The chart puts the current price action within a pattern that has happened multiple times. Each prior cycle followed a similar progression. XRP moved sideways inside symmetrical triangles before rapid upward surges. After these surges, XRP entered a corrective phase that held above key trend support. The latest structure shows the same behavior. NOTHING WILL STOP #XRP pic.twitter.com/vbdqxcjKD0 — XRP QUEEN (@crypto_queen_x) January 2, 2026 Defining the Trend The chart shows XRP trading inside symmetrical triangles across multiple market cycles. These channels acted as accumulation zones before major upside moves. In earlier periods, XRP respected lower trend support before launching into steep advances. The pattern did not rely on a single breakout, but developed over multiple years. In the current cycle, XRP has already exited its most recent channel to the upside. The asset experienced a surge of over 500% between late 2024 and early 2025, and the price has flipped long-term resistance to support. Failed breakouts often return to the range quickly, but XRP has not returned to the consolidation range. The structure shows higher lows across each major correction, reinforcing the belief that the asset’s upward run will continue . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Fibonacci Extensions Map Historical Peaks XRP Queen’s chart overlays Fibonacci extensions on previous expansion waves. In earlier cycles, the price reached the 1.272 and 1.618 extensions before topping. These levels did not act as resistance early, but marked the final stages of expansion. Those same extensions now sit far above the current price. The 1.272 extension is at $8.44. The 1.618 extension aligns close to $27.23. These levels come directly from historical measurements, and other analysts have shared the same $27 target for the digital asset. The digital asset has already reclaimed the 0.382 retracement near $1.47. In past cycles, holding above that level preceded further upside. Losing it led to deeper corrections. The chart shows XRP above it, and notable dips in late 2025 held above that level. As long as XRP holds above rising support and key retracement levels, the structure remains valid. According to the chart, the cycle has not yet been resolved, and XRP’s upside will continue. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

56783743,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=888032,1767477600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56783743.jpeg,3 Cryptos Investors Are Watching as 2026 Kicks Off,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/3-cryptos-investors-are-watching-as-2026-kicks-off/,"Market participants are monitoring a mix of established cryptocurrencies and early-stage projects when assessing potential opportunities for 2026. Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have been cited for different reasons. Solana for its cheap blockchain, Dogecoin for its hype, and Mutuum Finance for its fresh twist to DeFi. MUTM is in presale and has amassed over $19.6 million faster than analysts predicted. Unlike SOL and DOGE that are already far along the maturity tree, MUTM is building its foundation in DeFi with a dual-lending mechanism. SOL Price Prediction Solana (SOL) has been volatile in the past year, falling from $290 to below $100 at one point. The price of SOL is now around $124, a strong support level that is set to influence its trajectory in the next cycle. If the price manages to rebound, it could pave way for a potential move towards $300. Dogecoin Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) has been shifting within an extremely critical area of support at $0.116-$0.120 after witnessing a sharp correction since its peak levels above $0.16 in mid-December. On the 4-hour chart, DOGE is witnessing lower highs. However, it seems that it is facing critical compression levels. A breakout above $0.124 with increased trading volumes would point towards $0.130-$0.135. MUTM Presale Rise While Solana and Dogecoin are decent picks, they lack the strength of Mutuum Finance. The project’s presale has achieved yet another milestone with more than 18,660 participants and a total of $19.56 million collected. The current price of MUTM per token is set at $0.04 during Phase 7. The presale rewards those who buy early. For instance, when MUTM hits $2 like analysts predict, an investment today will deliver a 5000% ROI. However, those who delay and get in during later stages or at $0.06 listing price will only see a 3200% ROI, a massive 1800% ROI difference. Mutuum Finance also runs a $100,000 giveaway where 10 people participating in the presale get to win $10,000 in MUTM. To qualify, each of the participants needed to buy a minimum of $50 in MUTM, register a valid wallet address on the official site of the giveaway, in order to claim the prizes in case of being picked, as well as undertake quests such as a follow the project on social media. Additionally, there is a $500 award every 24 hours for the top investor buying MUTM. Moreover, the top 50 holders will get rewarded based on their performance on the leaderboard. MUTM DeFi Ecosystem Mutuum Finance is working on a decentralized over-collateralized stablecoin. The stablecoin is pegged 1:1 to the USD. In addition, it is non-algorithmic, saving it from the depeg risks seen in algorithmic stablecoins like TerraUST. The project also has a reward system wherein rewards are given based on a buyback program that utilizes a portion of the fees accrued from the borrowing/lending activities on the protocol to purchase the MUTM tokens on the open market; these are then allocated to the stakers of mtTokens. The mtToken is an ERC-20 yield-bearing asset issued to users when they deposit assets in the project to earn interest on lending. The mtTokens will accrue yields based on the protocol’s usage, ranging between 7-10% or higher. A user could for instance deposit 10 ETH in the platform to receive 10 mtETH which will then see an up to 10% interest per year. Multi-Chain Deployment Mutuum Finance is meant to be capable on both EVM and non-EVM blockchain chains, working with a variety of liquidity pools and communities of users. Such an approach strengthens long-term value by broadening the addressed market and increasing liquidity levels. While Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) continue to make headlines, they face the limitations of market maturity and trading influenced by market sentiment. At $0.04 in Presale Phase 7, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a stronger case with early investor advantage, community rewards, juicy lending yields among other strong features. The project has attracted 18,660 presale participants and $19.56M in raised funds. This is a crucial phase of FOMO and is increasingly being recognized as the top crypto to invest in, while cementing its spot among the best crypto picks for investors looking to diversify in 2026.

Bitcoin Enters Choppy Range As Critical Trend Line Holds Below,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-enters-choppy-range/,"Bitcoin has entered a choppy weekend range, testing traders’ patience as price action slows and volatility compresses. Despite the sideways movement, a critical trend line just below current levels remains intact, keeping the broader market outlook cautious but far from broken. Bitcoin Drifts Into A Typical Weekend Range According to a recent update by Lennaert Snyder, Bitcoin has entered a typical weekend range. Weekend trading is often characterized by low liquidity and choppy price action, which can make moves less predictable and more prone to false signals. Snyder is taking a cautious approach, waiting for a clear trigger at the boundaries of this range before committing to any trades. Related Reading: Bitcoin Key Moving Averages Indicate An Imminent Drop To $38,000 Snyder notes that the $90,930 level could present a strong shorting opportunity if a liquidity sweep occurs and the price fails to hold. On the other hand, if Bitcoin demonstrates strength and manages to break above this threshold, it could signal bullish momentum, making long positions potentially attractive for traders looking to capitalize on a breakout. Similarly, the lower boundary near $88,430 is critical. A sweep below this level followed by a quick reversal could offer long positions. However, if the support fails and the market structure breaks, it would likely trigger continuation shorts. These levels act as key decision points where traders can gauge whether momentum favors buyers or sellers in the short term. Snyder emphasizes that these setups are primarily scalp trades, with lower risk exposure. The expert only executes trades when all confirmation signals align, ensuring that a clear technical rationale backs each position. Looking ahead, external factors could add more volatility to Bitcoin’s price action. Geopolitical tensions and the return of major market participants next week are expected to increase trading volume and momentum, potentially turning these weekend range moves into larger trends. BTC Holds Key Investor Tool Model Support Around $83,900 Crypto analyst Patel recently highlighted that Bitcoin is holding a key support level known as the Investor Tool Model Support, situated around $83,900, which also coincides with the 730-day moving average. This level has historically acted as a major pivot for Bitcoin, helping to gauge the broader market trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Unusual Short-Term Supply Spike, Raising Bearish Flags According to Patel, a decisive break below this support has historically signaled the start of a confirmed bear market, while holding above it typically points to a corrective phase rather than a long-term downtrend. In other words, this level serves as a critical dividing line between temporary pullbacks and structural weakness. Currently, the $83,900 zone is a key area to watch closely. Price action around this support could determine whether Bitcoin resumes its upward trajectory or risks entering a more extended bearish phase, making it a pivotal point for decision-making in the market.

Fed’s Paulson gave a speech on Saturday at the 2026 Allied Social Science Associations Annual Meeting in her hometown. She said that the central bank wants to see how things unfold before making further moves on rates. Paulson laid out what she is expecting. “I see inflation moderating, the labor market stabilising and growth coming in around 2 percent this year,” she said in her speech. If that is how things materialise, “then some modest further adjustments to the funds rate would likely be appropriate later in the year. “ Fe d maintain s re strictive stance to fight inflation Right now, Paulson thinks rates are “still a little restrictive,” and they are helping push inflation down. What makes her view matter more this year is that she gets a vote on the Federal Open Market Committee. That is the group that sets interest rates. Last year, they cut rates three separate times – 25 basis points each time – for a total drop of three-quarters of a percentage point. That put rates at 3.5% to 3.75% after their December meeting. Those cuts were not easy decisions. Fed officials had to walk a tightrope. They needed rates high enough to cool inflation but not so high that they would damage the job market. Things became more complicated when President Donald Trump started calling for bigger cuts, even though some Fed members did not want any cuts at all, with inflation still well above the 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell did not say much about what comes next at the December meeting. However, the Fed’s own forecasts indicate more easing could happen in 2026. The labor market is strained but remains stable. Paulson sai d Sa turda y sh e has “cautious optimism on inflation” but wants “greater clarity on what is pushing growth up and employment down.” She thinks there is “a decent chance that we will end the year with inflation that is close to 2% on a run-rate basis” after price bumps from tariffs settle down. Regarding employment, she stated, “While the labor market is clearly bending, it is not breaking.” The slowdown in hiring is caused by “both supply and demand factors,” and it will need to be closely monitored throughout the year. On the first trading day of 2026, major U.S. stock indexes such as the Dow and S&P 500 closed higher, with gains led by chipmakers and industrials, though a traditional year‑end “Santa Claus rally” failed to materialise. Strategists suggest that investor sentiment remains opportunistic, marked by buying during market pullbacks and expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve, including possible rate cuts later in the year. Markets around the world are trying to figure out what comes next with interest rates. European stocks have climbed higher since the Fed’s last rate cut, and traders are betting there’s more easing on the way. Analysts say investors are still working through how inflation numbers stack up against growth forecasts, trying to guess where policy goes from here.

APEMARS is an early-stage 100x crypto presale designed for maximum early advantage, offering whitelist access and scheduled burns. Unlike LINK and XLM, which are established projects with steady utility, APEMARS gives early participants a chance to secure front-row positioning. Why should I invest in 100x crypto presales? Investors target 100x crypto presales because they offer lower entry prices, structured tokenomics, and early-stage advantages that established coins cannot. Early participation can significantly amplify potential returns as demand grows. Can Chainlink still grow? LINK remains vital to DeFi infrastructure and smart contract accuracy, sustaining consistent long-term demand. Is XLM safer than investing in a presale like APEMARS? XLM offers stable utility through fast, low-fee cross-border payments, but its growth is gradual. Whitelist access to early-stage presales like APEMARS provides higher-risk, higher-reward exposure to the next potential 100x crypto breakout.

According to market analyst Amr Taha, this price gain has been accompanied by significant changes in the derivatives market, which suggest an aggressive shift in investors’ positioning. Related Reading: 2026 Crypto Market Prediction: Will Prices Soar Or Face Continued Declines? Ethereum Traders Flood Market With Long Positions To Usher In 2026 In a QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, Amr Taha shares an in-depth analysis of the Binance derivatives market following ETH’s recent surge in the first days of 2026. Notably, the market expert reports an impulsive rise in ETH open interest on the world’s largest exchange, in what they described as “one of the strongest single-day increases seen recently. As the spot price climbed above $3,100, data from CryptoQuant shows that ETH open interest rose from approximately $6.2 billion to around $7.1 billion, representing a 12% increase in the last day. Taha highlights the importance of the coincidence, stating a rise in open interest amid price appreciation suggested that traders were opening fresh positions, rather than the move being driven solely by short covering. Interestingly, more data showed the ETH Cumulative Volume Delta – which measures the net difference between buying and selling volume over time – also rose alongside open interest, implying several positive developments. One of which is that long positions comprised the majority of the newly opened positions in the market, citing a heavy bullish sentiment around Ethereum. In addition, ETH buyers demonstrated heightened urgency by favoring market orders over passive limit bids, indicating aggressive taker-side demand, implying a strong market conviction that preferred to engage the market immediately rather than wait for lower prices. Related Reading: Popular Crypto Founder Dumps Millions In Ethereum, Here’s What He’s Buying A Potential Bull Trap? In analyzing the liquidation heatmap for the ETH derivative market, Amr Taha unveiled other critical price developments. Notably, ETH’s recent surge was partly driven by a short-squeeze effect around the $3,100 price level. Notably, when the altcoin touched this level, over-leveraged short traders had to defend their positions, effectively creating a market demand that translated into a sudden price gain. While the recent price increase and open interest boost represent positive moments for the market, Taha warns that forced liquidation often results in temporary resistance zones on the lower timeframe, especially when accompanied by rising funding rates. The analyst also explains that Ethereum’s price move appears leverage-driven and highly sentimental rather than structural, suggesting equal room for both opportunity and risk. At press time, the prominent altcoin trades at $3,087, representing a 2.51% gain in the last day.

Local government officials face tough decisions about whether these facilities, which use enormous amounts of electricity and water, belong in their communities. Many places lack clear rules about data centers, forcing boards to consider special exceptions or draft new laws from scratch. What used to be quiet town meetings are now packed with upset residents demanding their leaders say no. “Would you want this built in your backyard?” Larry Shank asked officials in East Vincent Township, Pennsylvania, last month. “Because that’s where it’s literally going, is in my backyard.” The mounting defeats worry major technology companies, property developers, power companies, and labor unions invested in the data center business. Andy Cvengros, who works on data center deals for commercial real estate company JLL, told AP News he’s seen opponents knock on doors, pass out T-shirts, and plant signs in yards for seven or eight recent projects. “It’s becoming a huge problem,” Cvengros said. Data Center Watch, run by AI security firm 10a Labs, reports a major increase in community and government obstacles to data center construction. From April through June, the group tracked 20 proposals worth $98 billion across 11 states that got stopped or stalled because of local fights and state-level opposition. That represented two-thirds of all projects being monitored. Groups working on environmental and consumer issues say they’re getting daily phone calls and helping communities learn how to fight back. “I’ve been doing this work for 16 years, worked on hundreds of campaigns I’d guess, and this by far is the biggest kind of local pushback I’ve ever seen here in Indiana,” said Bryce Gustafson from the Citizens Action Coalition in Indianapolis. Just in Indiana, Gustafson counted over a dozen projects that failed to get approved for rezoning. Common concerns unite different communities Residents share similar worries no matter where they live. Man y al ready upset about rising electricity cost s do n’t want data centers that could push bills even higher. People fear losing farmland, forests, and open spaces. Others worry about noise from backup diesel generators and cooling systems, damage to property values, and health effects. Some are concerne d th eir wells and underground water supplies could dry up, as data centers consume millions of liters of water daily. Legal battles are erupting in both directions over whether local governments followed proper procedures. Major technology companies Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook, spending hundreds of billions worldwide on data centers, didn’t respond to Associated Press questions about how community opposition affects their plans. Microsoft did mention the difficulties in an October filing with securities regulators, listing “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent that may impede or delay infrastructure development” among its operational risks. The resistance is making an impact even when state and federal officials support the projects. Maxx Kossof, an investment executive at Chicago developer The Missner Group, said developers worried about zoning battles are thinking about selling properties after securing electricity access—a valuable asset that makes projects more attractive. “You might as well take chips off the table,” Kossof said. “The thing is you could have power to a site and it’s futile because you might not get the zoning. You might not get the community support.” Industry representatives complain that opponents spread false information about data centers polluting water and air. Still, they’re telling developers to talk with communities earlier, highlight economic benefits, support local programs, and explain conservation efforts. “It’s definitely a discussion that the industry is having internally about, ‘Hey, how do we do a better job of community engagement?'” said Dan Diorio from the Data Center Coalition trade group. Local officials feel the pressure In Matthews, North Carolina, developers withdrew a project from the October agenda after Mayor John Higdon told them it faced certain defeat. Despite promises to fund half the city budget with environmentally friendly features, town meetings overflowed and feedback ran “999 to one against,” Higdon said. Council members who voted yes “would no longer be in office,” he added. “That’s for sure.” Near Duluth, Minnesota, in Hermantown , a proposed campus several times bigger than the Mall of America is stuck in legal challenges over environmental reviews. Residents connected through social media and learned to organize protests and spread their message. They felt deceived when they learne d st ate, county, city, and utility officials knew about the plan for a full year before releasing internal emails confirming it.

And that’s pushing corporate bond trading to levels never seen before. Last year saw an average of $50 billion worth of corporate bonds trade hands every single day. The figure comes from Crisil Coalition Greenwich, which tracks financial market data. That beat 2024’s daily average of $46 billion and set a new record. Companies are rushing to fund big AI projects right now. Data centers that power these new technologies need a lot of money. Wall Street firms like Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase are predicting record sales of top-rated corporate bonds this year. A lot of this borrowing happens in private markets. Last year Cryptopolitan reported Meta Platforms and Blue Owl Capital borrowed roughly $27 billion in high-quality debt to build a data center in rural Louisiana. Deals like this are creating more trading opportunities in private credit. Investors there want more options to exit their positions. Rehan Latif oversees credit trading globally at Morgan Stanley. “I view it very much as the biggest single opportunity coming into 2026,” he said. “Every single time a new market is created, there is a little bit of a lag before the secondary market kicks off. The reality is this is the right time for it to happen.” Tech companies and utility firms often sell bonds with longer payback periods to finance AI-related projects. Sam Berberian leads credit trading at Citadel Securities. He and Jeff Eason, a senior analyst at the firm, say these longer-term bonds create more trading action. These bonds see bigger price swings when interest rates change. Hedge funds and active traders like that because they can profit from market moves. Companies are borrowing more for AI ventures Investors have to watch their holdings carefully. They don’t want too much money tied up in tech companies and utilities. There’s growing worry about a possible AI bubble too. That’s pushing investors to buy more protection through credit default swaps. Market makers say this is adding even more trading activity . Bond trading has been climbing for years. New methods like portfolio trading help. Investors can buy or sell large groups of bonds all at once. The market borrowed tools from stock trading. Bond-focused exchange-traded funds, computer-based execution systems, and fast trading strategies all help. More trading generally narrows the gap between buying and selling prices. Bonds become easier to trade. Investors are moving toward broader strategies now. They use many different financial tools instead of betting on individual companies. Alex Finston helps run credit trading for the United States at Goldman Sachs. He says these changes have cut the cost of trading corporate bonds by up to two-thirds in recent years. “The scalability by which our clients are able to access liquidity has never been better and I would expect that that will continue to grow over time,” Finston said. Automated trading keeps expanding but traditional phone-based trading still matters Grant Nachman started and runs the credit firm Shorecliff Asset Management. He says computer systems can only go so far. They struggle with bonds that don’t trade frequently. Investment firms also risk losing influence if they move too much business away from traditional trading relationships. “There’s likely a ceiling on how much electronic trading there can be,” he said. Getting allocated bonds in new deals matters. So does receiving market research, gathering market insights, and keeping long-standing business relationships. “It helps to be a relevant voice counterparty to get some of that.” However trades happen, 2025 was busy across bonds, crypto, and AI stocks. Activity will probably keep growing. Related markets are seeing increased volume too. Credit ETFs and credit derivatives both are. “We expect trading activity to pick up in 2026,” said Citadel Securities’ Berberian.

Blockchain tracking data shows that the world’s largest asset manager expanded its cryptocurrency holdings by more than $23 billion in 2025, and this is one of the biggest institutional accumulation phases seen in the year. The figures highlight a sustained commitment to Bitcoin and Ethereum, even as price action turned bearish towards the end of the year. BlackRock’s Crypto Portfolio Expansion Through 2025 Crypto was at the forefront of BlackRock’s investment strategy in 2025. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock’s on-chain cryptocurrency holdings at the start of 2025 were $54.83 billion. By January 1, 2026, that figure had risen to about $78.36 billion, representing a net increase of roughly $23.52 billion over the course of the year. These figures mean that by the end of 2025, BlackRock’s crypto portfolio had grown by about 43% compared to the start of the year. Unsurprisingly, the accumulation was concentrated almost entirely in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two biggest assets leading institutional exposure to the crypto industry. Bitcoin was the dominant holding by value. BlackRock’s BTC stash grew from around 552,550 BTC worth about $51.16 billion in January 2025 to about 770,290 BTC valued at $68.05 billion in January 2026. This translates to an increase of approximately 217,740 BTC, adding about $16.88 billion to the firm’s portfolio based on year-end valuations. Even with Bitcoin’s price down about 5% from January 2025, the increase in BTC units held grew by 39%, which, in turn, pushed the total value higher. Ethereum, although smaller in absolute terms, saw even faster relative growth. Holdings expanded from 1.07 million ETH valued at $3.59 billion in January 2025 to about 3.47 million ETH worth $10.31 billion in January 2026. That represents an increase of nearly 2.4 million ETH, contributing around $6.71 billion to BlackRock’s crypto holdings in 2025. These numbers mean that BlackRock’s ETH holdings grew by more than 224% over the year, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 39% increase. ETFs And Institutional Demand Motivated $23 Billion Accumulation The bulk of BlackRock’s crypto buying in 2025 was due to persistent inflows into its spot exchange-traded products. Investor demand for regulated exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum was strong for much of the year, particularly during rallies that pushed both assets toward fresh all-time highs. At the same time, corrective phases in the crypto market were accompanied by notable ETF outflows. This trend supports the view that Bitcoin and Ethereum price action is becoming increasingly linked to ETF activity, and BlackRock is the dominant issuer within those flows. BlackRock has not yet established a presence in the XRP market. The asset manager does not currently offer a Spot XRP ETF, and spokespersons have previously stated that the company has no immediate plans to launch one.

Rethinking Wealth Beyond Token Price Speculation that XRP could reach $100 has led some investors to assume that holding 20,000 tokens would automatically ensure financial security. However, the analyst cautioned against this mindset. He emphasized that a high XRP price alone does not guarantee financial freedom, as taxation, living expenses, and inflation can significantly reduce wealth over time. He added that the financial needs of investors vary depending on age, lifestyle, and planning. For example, younger investors require funds that can last several decades, which may necessitate holdings far beyond $2 million to maintain long-term financial stability. According to the pundit, most individuals would likely need between $5 million and $7 million to achieve true financial independence. Leveraging XRP Without Selling Cypress Demanincor, a community finance commentator, highlighted that wealth should be approached as an income-generating mechanism rather than purely as asset appreciation. Instead of liquidating $1 million in XRP, investors can leverage their holdings to generate cash flow while maintaining exposure to potential price growth. One way people miss the bigger picture is thinking in price only, not passive income. If you had $1M worth of XRP, you don’t spend it or sell it for fiat you deploy it. • Lend the XRP on a lending protocol like @LOAN_Protocol ⁰• Borrow against XRP in stables ~65% instead of… https://t.co/cwbRXRayfI — Cypress Demanincor (@CDemanincor) December 28, 2025 One suggested approach is borrowing against XRP on decentralized lending platforms. Demanincor recommended borrowing no more than approximately 65% of the token’s value to minimize liquidation risk. For a $1 million XRP portfolio, this would allow an investor to access roughly $650,000 in stablecoins such as USDC, while diversifying risk across multiple stablecoins, including USDT. Creating Income Streams from Borrowed Capital Demanincor outlined a structured approach for using the borrowed funds to generate multiple streams of income. About $300,000 could be allocated to real estate, with properties tokenized through platforms like Lofti to yield 4%–8% annually. Additionally, short-term rentals or Airbnb-style stays could supplement returns with more than $1,000 per month. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The remaining $350,000 could be deployed in stablecoin liquidity pools on reputable decentralized exchanges, targeting roughly 10% annual returns. Earnings from these positions could then be reinvested into staking, node operations, or other yield-generating opportunities, potentially producing returns between 4% and 12% per year. Demanincor emphasized that income generated through these strategies can be used to service the borrowed stablecoins, reducing debt while leaving the original XRP position intact. He noted that price fluctuations are less critical than consistent cash flow and financial planning. Nevertheless, he reminded investors that these lending protocols carry inherent risks, underscoring the importance of thorough research and careful risk management before participation. By focusing on generating sustainable income rather than relying solely on token appreciation, XRP holders can maintain long-term exposure while creating a reliable source of cash flow to support retirement or other financial objectives.

56787302,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258302,1767485410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tech Billionaire Stock Sales: The $16 Billion Cash-Out Strategy Behind 2025’s AI Boom,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tech-billionaires-cashed-out-2025/,"BitcoinWorld Tech Billionaire Stock Sales: The $16 Billion Cash-Out Strategy Behind 2025’s AI Boom In a year defined by unprecedented market highs, a staggering $16 billion flowed from corporate equity into the personal accounts of technology’s most prominent leaders during 2025. According to a comprehensive Bloomberg analysis of regulatory filings, executives like Jeff Bezos, Safra Catz, and Jensen Huang executed massive, pre-planned stock sales as an AI-fueled rally propelled tech valuations to record levels. This coordinated cash-out, occurring between January and December 2025, reveals a strategic financial maneuver distinct from panic selling, instead highlighting sophisticated wealth management during a peak market cycle. The $16 Billion Tech Billionaire Stock Sale Phenomenon Bloomberg’s examination of insider trading data provides a clear window into executive confidence and portfolio strategy. Consequently, the $16 billion figure represents one of the largest aggregate cash-outs in a single year. Importantly, these transactions primarily occurred through Rule 10b5-1 plans. These pre-arranged trading plans allow corporate insiders to sell shares at predetermined times, effectively insulating them from accusations of trading on non-public, material information. Therefore, the scale of sales indicates a widespread belief among founders and CEOs that 2025 presented a prime opportunity to diversify holdings after years of explosive growth. The market context for these sales was critical. Throughout 2025, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 Information Technology sector repeatedly shattered records. This surge was fundamentally driven by relentless investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure, cloud computing, and advanced networking. As a result, company valuations reached historic multiples, creating optimal conditions for executives to liquidate portions of their equity stakes without signaling a lack of faith in their companies’ futures. Breaking Down the Major Sales A detailed analysis of the filings shows a tiered structure of sales among the industry’s elite. The following table summarizes the key transactions that contributed to the $16 billion total: Executive Company Approximate Sale Value (2025) Notable Context Jeff Bezos Amazon $5.7 billion Sale of 25M shares in June/July, coinciding with personal milestones. Safra Catz Oracle $2.5 billion Former CEO leveraging cloud and database software rally. Michael Dell Dell Technologies $2.2 billion Capitalizing on AI server and infrastructure demand. Jensen Huang Nvidia $1.0 billion Partial sale as Nvidia achieved first $5T market cap. Jayshree Ullal Arista Networks $1.0 billion Net worth crossed $6B amid networking gear boom. Strategic Motivations Behind the AI Stock Rally Cash-Outs Financial analysts point to several converging factors that motivated these well-timed transactions. Primarily, portfolio diversification remains a cornerstone of prudent wealth management for individuals whose net worth is overwhelmingly tied to a single stock. After a multi-year bull run, converting paper gains into liquid assets allows for investment in other ventures, real estate, philanthropy, or risk-free instruments. Furthermore, potential tax considerations ahead of anticipated regulatory changes often influence the timing of such substantial sales. The role of pre-arranged 10b5-1 plans cannot be overstated. These mechanisms demonstrate that the sales were not reactive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations or undisclosed company news. Instead, they were methodical strategies filed months in advance. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg’s $945 million sale was executed through his philanthropic foundation, channeling wealth into charitable endeavors. Similarly, sales by Palo Alto Networks’ Nikesh Arora and Robinhood’s Baiju Bhatt, each exceeding $700 million, followed their companies’ strong performance cycles. Wealth Diversification: Reducing over-concentration in a single volatile asset. Estate and Tax Planning: Managing capital gains and future liabilities. Liquidity for New Ventures: Funding space exploration, biotech, or climate tech initiatives. Philanthropic Commitments: Fulfilling pledges to foundations and charitable causes. Market Impact and Investor Sentiment Analysis Historically, large insider sales can trigger investor anxiety, perceived as a bearish signal. However, the market’s reaction to the 2025 sales was notably muted. This resilience is attributed to the transparent, plan-based nature of the transactions and the underlying strength of the companies involved. Nvidia, for example, continued its ascent even after CEO Jensen Huang’s sale, underscoring that the market differentiated between personal financial planning and corporate fundamentals. The broader economic impact of $16 billion re-entering the liquidity pool is significant. This capital likely flowed into various sectors, including: Venture capital and private equity funds Real estate and asset markets Government bonds and fixed-income securities Direct investment in startup ecosystems Market regulators and academics closely monitor such activity for patterns. The 2025 data provides a case study in how modern executive compensation, heavily weighted in stock awards, interacts with historic market peaks. It also highlights the maturation of trading protocols designed to ensure fairness and transparency in public markets. The AI Engine Driving Record Valuations The common thread enabling these sales was the pervasive AI rally. Demand for semiconductors, cloud infrastructure, data center networking, and AI software tools created a rising tide that lifted all major tech stocks. Nvidia’s milestone as the first $5 trillion company symbolized this era. Similarly, Arista Networks benefited from the need for high-speed data transfer between AI servers. Consequently, executives found themselves holding equity that had appreciated manyfold over a relatively short period, creating a logical moment to realize some gains. Conclusion The $16 billion in tech billionaire stock sales during 2025 represents a landmark event in modern financial history, not as an indicator of doubt but as a function of cyclical market maturity and personal financial strategy. Executives like Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang utilized established, lawful mechanisms to diversify their vast holdings against the backdrop of an AI-driven market zenith. For investors, this activity underscores the importance of distinguishing between routine, plan-based selling and discretionary sales that might signal deeper issues. As the tech landscape evolves, the patterns established in 2025 will likely serve as a blueprint for how founders and CEOs manage wealth during periods of extraordinary sector-wide growth. FAQs Q1: Why did tech billionaires sell so much stock in 2025? They primarily sold stock to diversify their personal portfolios, which were heavily concentrated in their company’s shares. The sales, executed through pre-arranged 10b5-1 plans, coincided with record-high stock prices driven by the AI boom, making it a strategic time to convert paper wealth into liquid assets for other investments, tax planning, or philanthropy. Q2: Did Jeff Bezos sell the most stock in 2025? Yes, according to the data. Jeff Bezos led the group by selling 25 million Amazon shares for approximately $5.7 billion in June and July of 2025. Q3: Are these large insider sales a bad sign for the tech market? Not necessarily. Because these were almost all conducted under pre-filed 10b5-1 trading plans, they are not interpreted as impulsive decisions based on negative insider information. The market largely viewed them as planned personal financial management, and the stocks of the companies involved generally remained strong. Q4: What is a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan? It is a provision established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that allows corporate insiders to set up a predetermined plan for buying or selling company stock. The plan must be established when the insider is not in possession of material non-public information, shielding the trades from allegations of insider trading. Q5: How did the AI boom contribute to these sales? The AI boom caused the stock prices of major technology companies—especially those in semiconductors, cloud computing, and networking—to soar to all-time highs throughout 2025. This massive appreciation increased the value of the equity holdings of founders and CEOs, creating a powerful incentive to sell a portion and lock in gains.

This surge represents a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, marking its highest valuation in the current market cycle and igniting discussions about its underlying drivers and potential trajectory. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Breaking Down the $91,000 Surge The ascent past $91,000 follows a period of sustained upward momentum for Bitcoin. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the confluence of factors propelling this rally. Market data reveals consistent buying pressure, particularly on major exchanges like Binance. Furthermore, on-chain metrics indicate a reduction in exchange reserves, suggesting a trend toward accumulation rather than immediate selling. This price action is not occurring in isolation. For instance, the broader cryptocurrency market cap has expanded in tandem, though Bitcoin’s dominance ratio remains a key watch metric for institutional and retail investors alike. Several technical indicators aligned to support this breakout. The price convincingly moved above several key moving averages, which now act as potential support levels. Trading volume spiked notably during the ascent, providing validation for the move’s strength. Market sentiment, as gauged by various fear and greed indices, has shifted firmly into optimistic territory, though not yet at extreme levels historically associated with market tops. Historical Context and Market Drivers To understand the importance of the $91,000 level, one must consider Bitcoin’s price history. This milestone sits well above previous cycle highs, establishing a new benchmark. The journey to this point involved overcoming significant resistance zones, each representing a consolidation of seller interest. Macroeconomic conditions continue to play a crucial role. For example, evolving monetary policy, inflation data, and geopolitical stability all influence investor appetite for alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Institutional adoption provides another critical layer of context. Recent filings with regulatory bodies show increased exposure from traditional finance entities. Moreover, regulatory clarity in several major jurisdictions has reduced a longstanding overhang on the market. Technological advancements within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements to the Lightning Network for scaling, also contribute to its fundamental value proposition. The following table compares key Bitcoin price milestones from recent years: Date Price Milestone Notable Context Nov 2021 ~$69,000 (All-Time High) Peak of previous cycle, high institutional interest Nov 2022 ~$16,000 (Cycle Low) Post-FTX collapse, macro risk-off environment Q1 2025 >$91,000 (Current) New cycle high, matured regulatory landscape Expert Perspectives on Sustainable Growth Market analysts emphasize the difference between speculative spikes and sustainable growth. Many point to the changed underlying infrastructure compared to previous bull markets. The investor base is now more diversified, including: Long-term holders (HODLers): Entities with multi-year investment horizons. Corporate Treasuries: Public companies adding BTC to balance sheets. Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs): Providing regulated access for a wider audience. Nation-State Entities: Some countries have adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This diversity can potentially reduce volatility over time. Experts from firms like Fidelity Digital Assets and CoinShares often reference on-chain data, such as the percentage of supply that hasn’t moved in over a year, as a measure of conviction. Their analysis suggests the current rally is supported by strong fundamentals, not merely hype. However, they universally caution that cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile, and past performance never guarantees future results. Potential Impacts and Future Trajectory The breach of $91,000 has immediate and longer-term implications. In the short term, it tests liquidity and can trigger algorithmic trading strategies. It also brings psychological price targets, like $100,000, into clearer view for market participants. For the broader digital asset ecosystem, a strong Bitcoin often acts as a rising tide, lifting other projects. Nevertheless, capital rotation between Bitcoin and altcoins is a dynamic that seasoned traders monitor closely. From a global finance perspective, Bitcoin’s performance challenges traditional asset correlations. Its behavior during periods of currency devaluation or equity market stress is a subject of ongoing study. Regulatory bodies worldwide are undoubtedly observing this price action as they continue to formulate frameworks for digital asset oversight. The network’s security, measured by its hash rate, typically strengthens during price rallies as mining becomes more profitable, creating a positive feedback loop for the protocol’s integrity. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $91,000 marks a definitive chapter in its evolution from a niche digital experiment to a mainstream financial asset. This Bitcoin price achievement reflects a complex interplay of technological adoption, macroeconomic forces, and shifting investor demographics. While the path forward will inevitably include volatility, the current milestone underscores the asset’s growing resilience and its cemented role in the global discussion about money, value, and sovereignty. Market participants will now watch closely to see if this level consolidates as a new support zone for the next phase of growth. FAQs Q1: What was the exact Bitcoin price reported in this surge? According to Bitcoin World market monitoring data cited on April 2, 2025, BTC was trading at $91,188.55 on the Binance USDT market when it rose above the $91,000 level. Q2: Why is breaking the $91,000 level significant for Bitcoin? Surpassing $91,000 represents a new cycle high, demonstrating strong buyer conviction and overcoming previous psychological and technical resistance levels. It establishes a new benchmark price for the asset in its current market phase. Q3: What are some common factors that drive a major Bitcoin price increase? Major rallies are often driven by a combination of factors including increased institutional adoption, favorable macroeconomic conditions (like inflation concerns), regulatory developments, technological upgrades to the network, and broader shifts in global risk sentiment. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s current price compare to its all-time high? The all-time high for Bitcoin prior to this move was approximately $69,000, reached in November 2021. The move above $91,000 therefore represents a new record high, surpassing the previous peak by a significant margin. Q5: Does a high Bitcoin price affect the rest of the cryptocurrency market? Historically, a strong Bitcoin price often has a positive effect on the broader cryptocurrency market, a phenomenon known as the “halo effect.” It can increase overall market capitalization, improve sentiment, and attract new capital into the digital asset space. However, capital sometimes rotates between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Next Crypto to Explode Could Be Brewing Fast, APEMARS Stage Lasts 7 Days as Pre-launch Hype Accelerates",https://timestabloid.com/missed-shiba-inu-next-crypto-to-explode-could-be-brewing-fast/,"Crypto markets move lightning fast. One day, you’re scrolling through charts, and the next, everyone’s talking about the coin that skyrocketed overnight. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and this new meme coin, APEMARS ($APRZ), have captured the imagination of crypto communities worldwide, pre-launch. While SHIB made early adopters millionaires, APEMARS is gearing up to become the next crypto to explode by providing early whitelist access and the opportunity to join Stage 1 at the lowest price. Joining the APEMARS whitelist gives participants a structural advantage before public access begins. Both coins carry massive hype, but APEMARS is engineered for those who want to ride a rocket of momentum while the market is still in its early stages. If you missed SHIB, don’t let history repeat itself. Let’s explore how early participation in these meme-driven crypto marvels could define your next gains. Shiba Inu’s Regretful Losses: A Lesson in Missed ICO Shiba Inu, now a household name in the crypto universe, hit an all-time low of $0.0 10 5637 , leaving many early watchers regretting they didn’t buy. Its all-time high? A staggering $0.00008616 , proving that timing and patience in crypto can turn even small investments into life-changing returns. Currently trading between $0.0 5 7429 – $0.0 5 8549 , Shiba Inu remains a reminder of the wealth opportunities available in the crypto space. Those who got in early are now reaping rewards, while those who hesitated are left watching charts and stories of missed gains. The FOMO is real, and it’s precisely the kind of momentum that APEMARS is built to harness. History shows the potential for exponential gains when narrative, community, and timing align. If you think SHIB was your shot, you might want to shift your focus to a coin built for the ambitious: APEMARS. APEMARS ($APRZ): The Mission-Built Token for the Next-Genz APEMARS ($APRZ) is a story-driven mission to Mars, built around 23 symbolic stages designed to compress seven months of momentum into a weekly thrill ride. Every element of APEMARS is engineered for holders who aim to make the most gains. From its narrative-driven upcoming presale to structured utilities, this coin rewards commitment, creativity, and foresight. Whitelist members gain priority access during the earliest allocation window, significantly reducing the risk of missing entry as demand increases. It acts as the primary entry layer for Stage 1, where pricing is lowest, and token availability is most restricted. Each subsequent stage introduces higher pricing, making early positioning a critical factor for upside potential. The Investment Upside That Will Make You Sit Up! Now, imagine you’re one of the first Stage 1 participants in APEMARS. With a price of $0.000016990 per token and a potential listing price of $0.0055, a modest $1,000 investment could theoretically see an ROI of 32,271.98%, equating to $323,719.84 at listing. Every week, the mission advances through its symbolic stages, and with each stage, the FOMO intensifies. Tokens are limited, demand is building, and the market is watching. APEMARS isn’t just a coin, it’s a movement, a story, and a chance to rewrite your crypto journey. The whitelist opportunity is fleeting, making early participation critical. Don’t let hesitation cost you the momentum that could transform your investment strategy. Secure Your Spot Before it Goes Public: Join The $APRZ Whitelist The $APRZ whitelist is your early gateway to the lowest possible entry before demand explodes. Miss this, and you’re chasing higher prices later. Visit the official APEMARS website. Enter your email in the $APRZ whitelist section. Confirm your spot via email. Once confirmed, you’re officially ahead of the crowd. When Stage 1 opens, whitelist members move first, while others wait.

Final Thoughts: Why APEMARS Could Be the Big Crypto You’ll Regret Missing! APEMARS ($APRZ) is more than a token; it’s a community-driven mission, a structured investment, and a narrative-fueled opportunity.

In a post shared on X, one trader said he made $80,000 overnight using Polymarket by tracking signals tied to US military activity. The trader pointed out that the United States had moved its largest aircraft carrier earlier on, which convinced him a strike on Venezuela was coming. The only unknown was timing, so he built a simple bot to watch Domino’s pizza orders around the Pentagon, a pattern long linked to late-night government work. The trader wrote , “The moment the pizza indicator bot spotted an unusual activity, I was alerted on my phone and immediately purchased as many ‘Will the US strike Venzuela’ shares on Polymarket. GG and thanks for playing.” Early hours of the morning, Trump confirmed the strike on Truth Social, saying the United States had carried out a large-scale operation against Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who were flown out of the country. “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement. Details to follow. There will be a News Conference today at 11 A.M., at Mar-a-Lago,” said Trump. B ets land before Trump confirms capture of Nicolás Maduro By the time Trump spoke , Polymarket positions were already deep in profit. A newly created Polymarket account had invested more than $30,000 on Maduro’s exit from power. After US forces took him into custody overnight, the trader walked away with about $400,000 in under 24 hours. Polymarket bets on Trump’s Venezuela strikes. Source: X/Polymarket On prediction markets, insider trading is allowed. Traders openly act on private analysis and public signals tied to geopolitical events involving Venezuela. Prediction markets have recently drawn scrutiny from regulators. Gaming commissions across the United States argue some platforms act like unlicensed sportsbooks. Sports contracts on Kalshi and Polymarket have grown quickly. Kalshi ended a long legal fight with the Commodity Futures and Exchange Commission in 2025, but that calm ended when state gaming commissions began sending cease-and-desist letters. Crypto and oil markets react as regulators circle prediction platforms Trump later said at a press conference that the United States would temporarily run Venezuela during a transition period. He said the goal was to get oil production moving again. “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure and start making money for the country,” Trump said. He added, “They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been.” Hours after Maduro’s capture, senior figures from his government condemned the military operation and warned against US involvement. Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s chosen vice president, whom Trump said was sworn in on Saturday, called the capture “barbaric” and an “illegal and illegitimate kidnapping.” She said it was an attack on the sovereignty of Venezuela and called for the “immediate release” of Maduro and his wife, saying he remained “the only president of Venezuela.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to reporters at Mar-a-Lago and said Maduro had chances to avoid arrest. “Nicolás Maduro had multiple opportunities to avoid this. He was provided multiple very, very, very generous offers, and chose instead to act like a wild man.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin surged back above $91,000 as more than $60 million in leveraged short positions were wiped out in one hour after prices increased around $3,000 from lows seen after the US began strikes on Venezuela. Trump linked Maduro’s removal to oil supply. He said Venezuela holds roughly 300 billion barrels of oil, the largest reserves in the world, more than Saudi Arabia. “We built Venezuela’s oil industry with American talent, drive, skill, and the socialist regime stole it from us,” Trump said. He added that the oil embargo he imposed remains “in full effect.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|Kalshi|Polymarket|Venezuela,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-04 00:50:10

As DOGE awaits an impending breakout, it seems that most of those searching for another new crypto coin to invest in are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is already in Phase 7 of its presale and growing in popularity. This new crypto coin is still at $0.04 and has managed to raise in excess of $19.5 million. This is set to rise in Phase 8 20% and reach a price of $0.045. This is raising urgency for immediate entry. Those who are investing now are positioning themselves to reap a 500% return on investment in this presale. This is yet another reason why MUTM is quickly emerging as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy that is presently relatively inexpensive in preparation for the next big wave in cryptocurrency. Dogecoin (DOGE) Looks for Recovery With Major Technical Targets Drawing Near Dogecoin (DOGE) has pulled back more than 60% from its 30¢ high, and although a bullish divergence has emerged, indicating a possible reversal, traders can’t expect a strong V-shaped rebound. Trading analysts forecast that there could be a small period of consolidation within a month as DOGE processes these losses and finds support around essential levels. The key level to keep an eye on is breaking above 13.5¢, which would signify a strong fundamental shift, thus contributing towards mending the sluggish market cap, paving a way for a possible positive breakout. MUTM Presale Update: Phase 7 is Live Mutuum Finance, whose ticker symbol is MUTM, is actually in presale stage 7, with the price of the token at $0.04, following presale stage 6, in which the price was set at $0.035, showing a 15% rise in price over the previous phase, and is predicted to go up another 20% in presale stage 8, which is predicted to be launched at a price of $0.045 and is nearly the final stage in which one can acquire this new crypto coin at a cheap price. Many investors see MUTM as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy before its public launch. Currently, the presale has been able to attract more than 18,600 investors, amounting to more than $19.5 million, showing the confidence that they have placed on the platform. The notion that MUTM has dual functionality with its upcoming V1 Sepolia Testnet is what entices investors to invest into this new crypto coin. This makes it a strong contender among the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy for early-stage investment. Mutuum Finance Infrastructure & Price Discovery Mutuum Finance employs the use of Chainlink oracles in order to obtain updated as well as accurate pricing information, which refers to the process of querying token prices in relation to very liquid assets such as USD, ETH, Matic, and Avax. Moreover, fallback oracles, aggregation feeds, as well as on-chain data are also employed in this system in order to obtain updated as well as accurate pricing information, which are considered building bricks in relation to the associated functionality related to this new crypto coin, which deals with valuation, risk, and the process of liquidation in this system. $50,000 Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a bug bounty program, which gives the public the opportunity to receive some share of a pool of rewards that goes up to a total of $50,000. The product has full functionality and can be utilized by the public. This further strengthens MUTM’s position as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy in the current market. The development team has now turned their focus to the service of the MUTM users and investors, in addition to developing the platform. As Dogecoin is treading the waters around $0.15, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues moving upwards, priced at $0.04 during the Presale Phase 7 and moving on to Presale Phase 8, priced at $0.045. More than 18,600 people have already taken the initiative and put money into this new crypto coin, amounting to $19.5 million, solidifying its status as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy for smart investors.

While recent technical improvements suggest momentum is turning in favor of the bulls, key resistance levels remain overhead, which means the recovery seems promising, but not yet fully confirmed. Market Structure Remains Unconvincing Despite The Bounce In a recent market update, crypto analyst Luca expressed a cautious outlook regarding Ethereum’s current market structure. While the price has managed a technical feat by breaking above the 1D Bull Market Support Band, a zone that has historically served as a reliable reversal point over the past several months, Luca remains unconvinced of a broader trend shift. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Momentum Rolls Over, Bearish Move Warning The primary hurdle for a definitive bullish reversal lies at the 0.618 Fibonacci Point of Interest (POI), currently positioned at $3,120. Luca emphasizes that Ethereum must durably reclaim this level to shift the lower-timeframe sentiment. Until this specific price target is secured as support, the risk of the current move being a fake-out remains high. Drawing parallels to the current state of Bitcoin, Luca suggests that the most prudent approach for investors is to remain defensive, as the market has yet to confirm a breakout above the Fibonacci resistance. This cautious stance is intended to guard against emotional trading during a period of high uncertainty and potential volatility. To manage this risk, Luca is maintaining a cash reserve to hedge spot holdings in case a rejection occurs. A failure to hold current levels would likely trigger a deeper pullback toward the previous high-timeframe resistance range near $2,700 before a more sustainable and durable reversal to the upside unfolds. Ethereum Opens 2026 With A Key Trend Shift According to StockTrader_max, Ethereum has started 2026 on a clearly positive technical footing. ETH has printed its first daily close above the 50-day moving average since October 9, a period that coincided with the liquidation-driven shock that rippled through the broader crypto market. This close marks a meaningful shift in trend behavior after months of trading below key short-term averages. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Presses Resistance, but Can The Recovery Survive? From a bullish perspective, reclaiming the 50-day MA is exactly the kind of confirmation sought for following an extended corrective phase. It signals improving momentum and suggests that buyers are beginning to regain control, potentially laying the groundwork for a more sustained recovery rather than a short-lived bounce. Looking ahead, StockTrader_max highlighted the 200-day moving average around $3,550 as the next major upside objective. As capital starts to rotate back into Ethereum and risk appetite improves, the analyst expects price action to gravitate toward this level in the coming sessions.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-xrp-under-2-is-a-great-blessing-heres-why/,"A prominent financial educator within the XRP community has described XRP’s current valuation below $2 as an exceptional long-term opportunity, framing the present market environment as favorable for strategic positioning rather than short-term concern. His remarks reflect a broader sentiment among long-term holders who believe XRP’s current price does not adequately reflect its intended role in future financial systems. Long-Term Positioning Over Short-Term Price Action Coach JV, a widely recognized finance coach and digital asset commentator, recently shared his perspective on XRP’s current market price. According to him, XRP trading below $2 represents a rare opportunity for patient investors who are focused on long-term outcomes rather than short-term volatility. He disclosed that he continues to increase his exposure at current levels, suggesting confidence that broader adoption and institutional integration have not yet been fully reflected in market pricing. XRP under $2.00 is one of the greatest blessings of our lifetime. I am still accumulating. My top crypto holdings: XRP Bitcoin WLFI Solana XLM HBAR VET My top two stocks: ABTC XXI Cash-value life insurance is the foundation of my family’s wealth empire. Cash flow is the… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) January 1, 2026 Rather than emphasizing daily price fluctuations, his commentary centers on delayed valuation recognition. From his viewpoint, XRP’s use case within cross-border payments and financial infrastructure positions it for future relevance, regardless of temporary market weakness. This approach contrasts with the frustration expressed by some investors who remain focused on near-term performance. Investment Strategy Anchored in Conviction Beyond his stance on XRP, Coach JV has openly discussed the structure of his broader investment portfolio. Within digital assets, his largest positions include XRP, Bitcoin, Solana, XLM, HBAR, VET, and WLFI. This allocation highlights a preference for assets tied to infrastructure development, liquidity, and long-term utility rather than speculative trends. In traditional markets, he identified American Bitcoin Corp (ABTC) and Twenty One Capital (XXI) as key equity holdings. Both companies operate as crypto treasury-focused firms, reinforcing his emphasis on exposure to businesses aligned with digital asset accumulation and long-term balance sheet strategies. Collectively, these choices reflect a consistent investment thesis centered on durability and strategic alignment rather than short-term returns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Emphasis on Structure and Financial Discipline A recurring theme in Coach JV’s commentary is the importance of financial systems over reactive decision-making. He has repeatedly stated that long-term success depends on disciplined frameworks rather than frequent trading or emotional responses to market movements. According to him, sustainable wealth is built through predictable cash flow, controlled risk exposure, and intentional asset allocation. He has highlighted tools such as cash-value life insurance as part of his family’s long-term financial planning, alongside maintaining minimal personal debt and evaluating investments through the lens of inflation protection. This structured approach resonates with XRP supporters who view extended periods of low prices as opportunities to strengthen their positions within a broader financial plan. Broader Bullish Sentiment Within the XRP Community Coach JV’s outlook aligns with similar views expressed by other well-known XRP commentators. In recent months, Alex Cobb has also argued that XRP trading below $2 represents a significant valuation disconnect. Cobb has pointed to multiple developments that could support future price appreciation, including upcoming regulatory clarity in the United States. One frequently cited catalyst is the scheduled markup of the CLARITY Act in January 2026, which many industry participants believe could encourage increased institutional participation in crypto markets. Additionally, demand for spot XRP exchange-traded funds has continued to grow, with assets under management now totaling approximately $1.16 billion. Corporate interest in XRP treasury strategies has also increased, with firms such as VivoPower and Wellgistics Health announcing plans to hold XRP as a long-term reserve asset. Supporters argue that sustained institutional accumulation, combined with regulatory progress, could create conditions favorable for long-term price expansion. Taken together, these views reflect a shared belief that XRP’s current market value does not fully capture its long-term potential. For investors who prioritize disciplined planning and extended time horizons, XRP’s sub-$2 price is seen not as a signal of failure, but as an opportunity to build exposure ahead of broader adoption cycles.

This record has been achieved almost two years after the introduction of these crypto ETFs in January 2024. To back this claim, data from a reliable source noted that the $2 trillion achievement was reached on January 2. In comparison, analysts found that the cumulative trading volume reached an all-time high of approximately $1 trillion, recorded on May 6, 2025. This milestone was achieved about 16 months after the launch of the ETFs. Notably, the surge from $1 trillion to $2 trillion took approximately eight months. This duration is half the time consumed to attain the first trillion. Hence, the situation demonstrates a heightened interest from institutions seeking regulated investments in cryptocurrency-related assets. Crypto ETFs demonstrate outstanding net inflows US-based spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs opened 2026 with strong momentum, recording nearly $646 million in combined net inflows on the first trading day despite uneven sentiment across the wider crypto market. Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $471.3 million in net inflows on Friday, while spot Ether ETFs added $174.5 million, lifting total inflows to $645.8 million, according to data from Farside. The inflow marked the strongest single day for US spot Bitcoin ETFs in 35 trading sessions, the largest since Nov. 11, when the 11 funds collectively drew $524 million. Spot Ether ETFs also logged their biggest one-day inflow in 15 trading days, the highest since Dec. 9, when inflows reached $177.7 million. The current cumulative volume encompasses a broader range of assets. To further clarify this point for better understanding, they mentioned that firms introduced spot ETFs that can effectively track Solana, XRP , Dogecoin, Litecoin, Hedera, and Chainlink shortly after new generic listing standards received the green light from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on September 17, 2025. Following this approval, reports highlighted that the agency decided to reduce approval times from 240 days to 75 days. Meanwhile, among the listed new offerings, XRP-based products secured ranking among the most outperformed, generating about $1.2 billion in net inflows since they began operating on November 13. On the other hand, a review from a reliable source declared that Bitcoin ETFs experienced approximately $21.8 billion in net inflows while other ETFs encountered about $9.8 billion in net inflows. In the case of BlackRock’s IBIT , it was confirmed that the spot bitcoin ETF owns approximately 70% of the market share by volume with more than $66 billion in assets under management (AUM). This finding was noted after its volume share hit a high level of 80% in mid-2025. James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, weighed in on the situation. He acknowledged that the authorities have approved several crypto ETF filings. However, Seyffart affirmed that there are at least 126 more of these filings pending approval. Nonetheless, he warned that some may halt their operations if they fail to draw in sufficient steady investments. As the situation becomes more intense, data from SoSoValue claimed that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs showed significant outcomes at the beginning of the new year on January 2.

The largest central bank on the planet is dealing with leadership uncertainty, public attacks from Donald Trump, and a rate strategy narrowed by steady growth and sticky inflation. Policymakers are trying to plan for the year ahead after delivering three straight interest rate cuts while facing louder dissent inside the committee and rising attention on how data is gathered and used. Those three cuts now hang over every 2026 decision.Expectations for solid growth and ongoing price pressures make additional reductions harder to justify.What looks clear is that the turbulence from the prior year did not fade. Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said the attention will not ease. “There’ll be a big spotlight. There’ll be lots of intrigue,” Kathy said. She added that uncertainty keeps the Fed “in the hot seat too.” Trump escalates pressure as legal and leadership deadlines collide The past year pushed the Fed into fights it rarely faces. As Donald Trump began his second term in the White House, he repeatedly threatened to fire Chair Jerome Powell over the pace of rate cuts. Midyear scrutiny then turned to cost overruns tied to a renovation project at the Fed’s Washington headquarters. Between those episodes, Trump sought to remove Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations that have not been proven and were never filed as formal charges. All of this unfolded while the administration searched for Powell’s successor.His chair term expires in May, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ran interviews that included as many as 11 candidates.The clock tightens in January.A Supreme Court hearing on Jan. 21 is scheduled to decide whether Trump has authority to remove Lisa. One week later, the Federal Open Market Committee meets to vote on interest rates. Trump is expected to name his chair pick during the month. Jerome has not said whether he will stay on the Board of Governors, where his term runs until January 2028. There also have been multiple dissents at recent rate votes, and new regional presidents set to come on board at the FOMC have a hawkish bent, meaning they’re likely to resist additional cuts. “It’s still a tough spot for the Fed,” Kathy said. Data, labor, and AI complicate rate planning for 2026 Despite the noise, Wall Street expects policymakers to keep working toward a neutral rate near 3 percent. The federal funds rate sits about half a percentage point above where most committee members see it in the long run. Kathy said Jerome helped guide three consecutive quarter-point cuts and was not blocking action. Future decisions depend on incoming numbers. She expects two cuts, one around midyear and another near year-end. The committee’s dot plot points to one cut. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, and analysts at Citigroup see labor weakness that could support three. Jerome and his colleagues have said decisions will follow data rather than political pressure. Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, sees less room. He expects only one reduction. “The winds are really changing for the U.S. economy,” Torsten said in a CNBC interview. He noted that tariffs, inflation, and uncertainty weighed on 2025, while fiscal stimulus and a steadier labor market now support growth. “The tailwinds are beginning to accumulate and making it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates,” he said. Another variable is artificial intelligence.Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, said its impact on productivity and hiring matters for policy communication.“The Fed this year has got a real challenge in terms of communicating their strategy,” Joseph said, pointing to heavy investment in advanced technology. After a slow start to 2026, the economy grew strongly in the middle quarters and is tracking near 3 percent growth late in the year, based on Atlanta Fed estimates.

The figure points to a 34% increase as the company pushes deeper into China’s crowded EV market and lines up overseas expansion. Billionaire founder Lei Jun announced the goal during a livestream on Saturday, setting expectations for the next phase of the car business. The EV unit turned profitable in November, around 18 months after the first electric sedan hit the road. That timeline landed faster than Tesla, which took years to reach the same point. The profit news did little to calm markets. The stock ranked among the worst-performing Chinese tech names last year as concerns grew around overcapacity, soft demand, and tighter conditions across the EV sector, according to Bloomberg. Xiaomi faces regulation pressure after SU7 crashes Two serious accidents involving the Xiaomi SU7 triggered calls for tougher oversight.The incidents pushed regulators to act.China released draft rules and new standards covering advanced driver assistance systems, door handle design, and battery safety. These changes landed as scrutiny rose around software control and physical build choices in new electric models. Despite that pressure, attention around the vehicles kept spreading beyond China. Karl-Thomas Neumann, former Volkswagen China chief executive, said the SU7 Ultra performance version was a “crying loud warning sign” for Western carmakers. Tech reviewer Marques Brownlee also weighed in, calling the sedan’s software integration “awesome.” The comments circulated as the company prepared its next steps outside the domestic market. Xiaomi expands models as EV growth slows worldwide Xiaomi also plans to widen its lineup by up to four new launches and refreshes, featuring a five-seat model and a seven-seat extended-range SUV. Xiaomi’s extended-range vehicles reportedly carry a small gasoline engine that recharges the battery once power runs low, without full reliance on charging stations. Moreover, in May, Lei announced the Xring O1, a 3-nanometer processor designed for devices such as the Tablet 7 Ultra, promised to target performance levels seen in products from Apple and Qualcomm. At the same time, Xiaomi has warned of the impact of a shortfall in memory chips on its core smartphone business, forecasting a potential supply crunch this year that would raise the price of its mobile devices. Meanwhile, the global EV market is cooling, with sales expecting to grow by 13% to 24 million vehicles in 2026, down from a 22% rally last year. The slowdown comes as Chinese demand eases, Europe grows at a slower pace, and the United States contracts. Policy changes are playing a role. President Donald Trump, back in the White House, ended federal EV tax incentives. The European Union also softened its planned 2035 ban on petrol cars, while China’s growth rate continues to decelerate after years of rapid expansion. In the United States, EV sales are forecast to drop 29% to 1.1 million units after reaching 1.5 million in 2025.Europe is expected to post 4.9 million sales, up 14% from the prior year. China remains the largest market, with volumes projected at 15.5 million vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, compared with 13.3 million in 2025. Even at that level, growth trails the surge from 2020 through 2025, when sales jumped from about 1.1 million to over 13 million. Chinese brands continue to dominate pricing pressure. BYD led the charge with lower-cost models across China and Europe and overtook Tesla in 2025 as the world’s biggest electric-car maker after expanding across overseas markets.

Experts Weigh In,https://timestabloid.com/where-will-xrp-go-in-2026-experts-weigh-in/,"As the digital asset market turns the page on a challenging 2025, discussion has intensified around where major cryptocurrencies, including XRP, could be headed in 2026. Commentary from industry figures highlighted by Digital Perspectives founder Brad Kimes has contributed to an optimistic narrative. The video Kimes shared included insights from Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and Inversion CEO Santiago Roel Santos, shaping expectations for 2026 . Crypto Market Closed 2025 Below Its Peak Despite beginning 2025 with strong momentum, the cryptocurrency market struggled to sustain those gains. Market capitalization reached a record level of approximately $4.27 trillion in early October, only to reverse sharply in the final quarter. By year-end, total market value had declined to about $2.93 trillion, representing a significant retreat from its peak and an overall annual loss of roughly $250 billion. This performance reflected a year-over-year decline of 7.85%. XRP- Where Will Crypto & XRP Go in 2026? – XRP Charts? (includes paid promotion) pic.twitter.com/6jPjub2Ehq — Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) December 28, 2025 XRP mirrored the broader market’s downturn, finishing 2025 with a loss of almost 12%. However, early indicators in 2026 suggest a shift in sentiment , as analysts reassess the structural forces influencing digital assets and reconsider long-standing assumptions about market cycles. Bitwise CIO Questions the Traditional Crypto Cycle Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan challenged the relevance of the traditional four-year crypto cycle , arguing it no longer drives market behavior. He said the industry may now be entering a longer-term growth phase shaped by new structural forces. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Hougan pointed to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, regulatory developments, and the expanding use of stablecoins and tokenization as lasting demand drivers. While cycle thinking still affects sentiment, he expects 2026 to deliver steady gains, lower volatility, and more normalized price action. Hougan also noted that institutional adoption remains slow. He stated that firms such as Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and more approved Bitcoin products well after ETF launches due to lengthy internal processes. This delay helps explain the uneven market action observed over the past year. Inversion CEO Expresses Confidence in XRP’s Potential Kimes also referenced comments from Inversion CEO Santiago Roel Santos. Santos shared a notably bullish view on XRP during a recent Empire podcast episode. He argued that the asset has a credible path back to its all-time high . He believes it is more likely to do so than the other top 10 cryptos, even with weak market conditions. He contrasted this optimism with a more pessimistic outlook on Ethereum, questioning its valuation and product direction. According to Santos, Ethereum’s market capitalization lacks sufficient justification. However, XRP’s lower valuation gives Ripple greater flexibility to deploy its native asset. He emphasized Ripple’s ability to use XRP for expansion, acquisitions, and to strengthen its ecosystem over time.

The fourth quarter alone added 2.5%, even as doubts around artificial intelligence kept showing up in market chatter. Many investors stayed skeptical about what AI could really deliver. Most still stayed invested. The run keeps cooling but refuses to break. Returns hit 21% in 2023, eased to 17.4% in 2024, then slowed again this year. The direction stayed the same. Up. The pace changed. Slower. The Mutual-Fund Yardsticks data shows three strong years back to back. Each year pulled in less than the one before it. None of them slipped below double digits. AI-led rallies narrowed after tariffs shook markets “The biggest surprise in 2025 was how dominant the AI stocks were,” said Ellen Hazen, market strategist at F.L. Putnam Investment Management in Lynnfield, Massachusetts. “Everyone thought the AI trade was over, that the Mag 7 were done, and the market broadening that everyone was eagerly looking forward to was going to happen.” That idea did not survive April.President Donald Trump, the sitting president in 2025, announced broad tariffs during what he called Liberation Day. After that point, leadership tightened again. “The market dramatically narrowed again,” Hazen said. “And since that day the Mag 7 has trounced the rest of the market again.” The gains stayed tied to a small group of names linked to artificial intelligence. The expected spread into other sectors did not arrive. Hazen said the outlook for 2026 remains open. “There are more yellow flags appearing than disappearing for the AI trade, but they do not yet reach the level that makes me bearish on the markets or bearish on AI,” she said. She added that earnings growth outside technology could still widen returns if it shows up. Global funds, bonds, and flows reshaped investor behavior International stock funds outperformed U.S. peers in 2025. These funds posted a 29.8% gain, far above last year’s 4.8% rise. Early tariff turmoil helped drive that result. While U.S. markets pushed to records, investors sent fresh money elsewhere. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times during the year. Bond funds held steady through the moves. Funds focused on investment-grade debt rose 7.3% for the year. The fourth quarter added 1.1% to that total. These funds became a preferred place for new cash. Fund flows showed a clear split. Investors pulled $391.6 billion from U.S. stock mutual funds and ETFs in 2025, based on Investment Company Institute estimates. Most of that came in July, when tariff fears peaked. Those worries faded later in the year, but the money did not rush back. At the same time, $102.1 billion flowed into international stock funds. Bond funds attracted $669.4 billion in net inflows as investors leaned toward stability. Large-cap managers dominated the latest Winners’ Circle rankings of actively managed U.S. stock funds. These managers focused on artificial-intelligence names and other technology holdings. The top spot went to Permanent Portfolio Aggressive Growth Portfolio (PAGRX), a $376.2 million fund that returned 36.9% over the past 12 months, according to Morningstar Direct. Second place went to PrimeCap Odyssey Growth Fund (POGRX) with a 33% gain. Four funds from the Alger group landed in the top ten, including Alger Capital Appreciation Portfolio (ALVOX) at 32.9%. Across the full survey, 1,185 funds with at least $50 million in assets posted an average total return of 11.5% for the year, keeping the long run of positive stock results intact.

Trump said the U.S. will temporarily run Venezuela, though he did not say who would manage the country or how long that control would last. Trump lays out oil takeover plan after Caracas operation Right now, Venezuela holds the largest oil reserves in the world, estimated at about 300 billion barrels, which means it’s above Saudi Arabia, the literal largest oil producer of the OPEC itself. At his press conference, Trump said the U.S. built the oil industry decades ago and accused the prior government of theft. “We built Venezuela’s oil industry with American talent, drive, skill, and the socialist regime stole it from us,” he said. “This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country.” Trump confirmed that the U.S. oil embargo on Venezuela is active. “The embargo is in full effect,” he said, repeating the accusation again directly:- “They stole our oil. They took it over like it was nothing.” When asked how U.S. control of oil supply could affect ties with China, Russia, and Iran, Trump said oil sales will continue globally. “We’ll be selling large amounts of oil to other countries,” he said. “We’re in the oil business. We’re going to sell it to them.” For decades, Venezuela relied on oil exports as its main economic engine. Analysts say China is currently its largest oil buyer, though shipment data remains unclear due to limited transparency. Beijing reacted quickly to Maduro’s removal. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the U.S. action violated international law and Venezuela’s sovereignty and threatened regional security, adding that China firmly opposed the move. Aging infrastructure, sanctions, and Venezuela’s gold reserves take center stage Only one U.S. company currently operates inside Venezuela. Chevron holds a limited license issued by the Trump administration. A Chevron spokesperson said Saturday that the company is focused on employee safety and asset protection and is operating in compliance with all laws and regulations. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said restoring oil production to 1990s levels would cost more than $8 billion, citing estimates from PDVSA, the state oil company. Many oil pipelines are more than 50 years old, and most reserves are extra-heavy crude, which is very expensive to extract and process. The EIA said on Saturday that:- “The extraction of extra-heavy crude oil requires a higher level of technical expertise, which international oil companies possess but their involvement has been limited by international sanctions. Furthermore, budgetary constraints at Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA and a lack of qualified technical personnel and foreign direct investment have all hampered Venezuela’s oil and natural gas development.” Despite those constraints, PDVSA remains the largest revenue source for the Maduro government. Oil markets have not yet reacted. Crude trading resumes Sunday evening. Meanwhile, Venezuela holds 161 metric TONS of gold reserves, which is around 5.18 million troy ounces, worth ~$22 billion at current prices of $4,300/oz. This makes Venezuela the Latin American country with the largest gold holdings. Every $100 that gold rises, these holdings gain +$518 million of value. It’s clear that controlling Venezuela will generate hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue for the US. So will the US take control of these gold reserves? Guess we’ll just have to wait and see.

The rally that started the year didn’t last long, so traders who chased tech gains across Asia are now watching the floor fall out from under them. According to Bloomberg, last year’s market darling, the MSCI Asia Index, beat every major global benchmark by nearly five full points. That win streak just met a brick wall. Asia’s heavy reliance on the global AI supply chain means anything that hits Wall Street’s chip names hits Asia right after. And right now, nobody knows if the AI trade is just taking a break, or running out of gas for good. China ramps up local chip funding as Korea and Taiwan face heat in the Tech Wars AI stocks pushed Asia’s tech index to a record high last Friday. Now, investors are backing off. Everyone wanted a piece of the action last year. This year, they’re nervous. The problem is most of that rally sat on the backs of just a few firms, especially in Taiwan and South Korea. Some are still hopeful that Asia gives them better exposure to AI because of lower prices. But others are warning that too much depends on too few players. Ken Wong, who runs Asian equity portfolios at Eastspring in Hong Kong, said, “We’re calling more of an AI fatigue as opposed to a bubble.” He said if companies cut back spending or if profits start slipping, it’s game over for some of these stocks. While all that’s happening, China is going the other way by working on a massive $70 billion package to support the country’s chipmakers. Two big names (MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai and Moore Threads Technology) just had blockbuster public listings. That kicked off a rush. Now, everyone wants in. Baidu’s AI chip division and GigaDevice Semiconductor are both planning new offerings. Why is money pouring in? Because it’s cheap. Tech stocks listed in Hong Kong are trading at 19 times forward earnings. The Nasdaq 100 is sitting at 25. That’s enough of a gap to grab attention. Rate confusion spreads while investors rotate into weaker markets The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates twice this year. That puts pressure on central banks from India to Thailand to follow suit. The idea is to help economies grow faster. But not everyone’s on board. The Bank of Japan is under fire to raise rates again. The yen is too weak, and inflation’s too hot. New Zealand’s central bank says it’s done cutting for now. Australia is getting ready to hike again. This back-and-forth is leaving traders stuck in guessing mode. Dilin Wu at Pepperstone said India’s low-rate strategy could help its stock market. He also said Thailand, Malaysia, and even China could benefit if their central banks go easier. But companies loaded with debt? They’re in trouble. The crowd chasing AI stocks last year is now digging through the trash pile for anything with upside. India’s Nifty 50 only rose 10.5% in 2025. That was its worst showing against the MSCI Asia Pacific Index since 1998. Now it’s cheap. Lower taxes and possible rate cuts might flip the story. Indonesia is getting some attention too. Its government is still trying to boost spending, and that could help. Southeast Asia fell behind last year. Traders think it might finally catch up. Xin-Yao Ng, who manages money at Aberdeen, said, “India and ASEAN are interesting for being very non-AI.” He’s watching for companies with good cash flow, low drama, and fat dividends. Then there’s South Korea, which absolutely crushed last year when its stocks outstandingly rallied 76% year-to-date, thanks to AI euphoria and hype around market reforms. Just this Friday, Cryptopolitan reported that Korea’s Kospi index added another 2.3%, blasting past 4,300. President Lee Jae Myung wants it to hit 5,000. Samsung is flying. It hit another all-time high after co-CEO said customers were saying, “Samsung is back.” That buzz got louder when data showed semiconductor exports from Korea jumped 43% in December. Between Samsung and SK Hynix, Asia’s still got power players in the global AI race.

He sees enormous potential in expanding into real-world assets (RWAs) and institutional markets, projecting that Aave could ultimately support a $500 trillion asset base and onboard tens of millions of users through the Aave App. Kulechov said: Today, most of Aave’s lending is concentrated around ETH, BTC, or leverage-driven looping strategies correlated with crypto market cycles. When I started Aave (originally as ETHLend) in 2017, the vision was to use smart contracts to power lending across virtually all asset classes and use cases. A core aspect of this strategy is the upcoming Aave V4, a modular architecture designed to integrate new lending models and asset classes safely. The design allows innovation without compromising protocol integrity, enabling both crypto-native and RWA-backed use cases while creating a developer-friendly environment to encourage innovation. Consumer Products, Revenue, And Alignment Addressing operational concerns, Kulechov stressed that mainstream consumer-grade products needed to onboard millions of users should be developed by independent, highly autonomous teams on top of the permissionless Aave Protocol rather than funded or controlled directly by the DAO. This approach ensures rapid execution while allowing the protocol to benefit from increased usage and revenue. Kulechov said: World class consumer products are built by highly opinionated teams with the autonomy to move quickly. While decentralized governance works well for protocol economics, it is not suited for product-level decision making. Kulechov also pledged to share revenue generated outside the protocol with token holders and confirmed that upcoming proposals will include clear guardrails for branding and revenue alignment. In his concluding notes, Kulechov reinforced his belief in Aave’s potential while also appealing for collaboration to drive the protocol and its native token’s success.",Crypto News|aave|Aave DAO|Aave Labs|Aave V4|Governance Dispute|Revenue sharing|Stani Kulechov,EN,0,0,AAVE|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-04 03:00:43

December hiring likely stayed soft, closing a year defined by hesitation instead of momentum. Economists expect about 60,000 jobs were added in the final month, a small figure that capped a year where payrolls rose roughly 670,000. That stands far below the 2 million jobs created in 2024 and shows how sharply conditions cooled. Unemployment probably edged down to 4.5% in December from a four-year high, but that dip offered little comfort. Employers largely stopped expanding payrolls after years of fighting for workers. Job openings stabilized, signaling many firms felt fully staffed. At the same time, shifting trade policies under President Donald Trump pushed companies to protect margins. Cost controls came first. New hires came later, if at all. The labor market did not crash. It simply stalled. Employers slow hiring as costs, AI, and policy risks pile up Hiring slowed across most industries as companies adjusted to a different playbook. Artificial intelligence became a bigger part of daily operations, allowing firms to raise output without adding headcount. That shift limited payroll growth even as demand stayed steady. Still, the slowdown did not trigger mass job cuts. Layoffs remained rare, keeping the labor market locked in a low-hire, low-fire pattern. Meanwhile after delivering three interest-rate cuts at the end of 2025, policymakers are expected to hold off for at least the first 3 to 4 months of this year. Officials want clearer evidence that inflation continues to cool before making further moves. Steady employment, even at low growth, gives them room to wait. But more data is coming fast.The Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release November figures on job openings, quits, and layoffs.Those numbers will show whether workers feel confident enough to leave jobs and whether firms are quietly trimming staff. The Institute for Supply Management will also publish December surveys covering manufacturers and service providers, offering another look at hiring trends inside key sectors of the labor market. The government will release October housing starts next week, and the University of Michigan will publish its preliminary January consumer sentiment index, both updates that will show whether households and builders are reacting to the same uncertainty weighing on employers. Economists warn the hiring freeze cannot last forever With retirements continuing, American companies will eventually need new workers. Claudia Sahm said the labor market faces two clear roads in 2026. They are:- “We really slow down in terms of hiring, and we hit a place where the bottom falls out. And it’s not just about slow hiring, it’s about firing workers and a recession.” “The uncertainty lifts, they’re ready to pick up hiring, and you see things really stabilize and kind of look more like a labor market that we’ve been more used to in terms of the job opportunities and adding workers.” A rise in layoffs would flood the market with job seekers, increasing competition. If hiring improves across sectors while layoffs stay low, conditions would ease for unemployed Americans and workers stuck waiting for openings. Chris Martin, lead researcher at Glassdoor, said change is inevitable. “At some point, something has to happen,” Martin said. He added that even a return to stability could lead to more quits, more hires, and more firings compared with today’s frozen state. A ZipRecruiter survey found in September that 63% of employers expect to hire moderately or significantly in 2024, a 13% drop from 2024.

Vitalik compared Ethereum’s situation to peer-to-peer networks that came long before it, like “BitTorrent (2000): huge total bandwidth, highly decentralized, no consensus.” Ethereum starts large gas limit increases in 2026 through BALs and ePBS Vitalik then pointed to Bitcoin in 2009, saying:- “Bitcoin (2009): highly decentralized, consensus, but low bandwidth because it’s not “distributed” in the sense of work being split up, it’s replicated. Now, Ethereum with PeerDAS (2025) and ZK-EVMs (expect small portions of the network using it in 2026), we get: decentralized, consensus and high bandwidth. But now it’s time to talk about what this combination means for Ethereum.” Vitalik said these upgrades are already running code, not theory. Data availability sampling is active on mainnet today. zk-EVMs already hit production performance levels. Safety checks are the final step, and Vitalik traced that work back ten years, starting with his first data availability research commit and later zk-EVM experiments that began around 2020. The rollout plan is staged. In 2026, Ethereum expects large gas limit increases that do not depend on zk-EVMs, driven by BALs and ePBS. That same year should also bring the first chances to run a zk-EVM node on parts of the network, according to Vitalik. From 2027 through 2030, Ethereum plans even larger gas limit jumps as zk-EVMs become the main block validation method. “ZKEVM becomes the primary way to validate blocks on the network,” Vitalik wrote. Another piece is distributed block building. Vitalik said the long-term goal is a setup where a full block is never built in one place. He said this is not urgent, but worth building toward. In Vitalik’s words:- “Even before that point, we want the meaningful authority in block building to be as distributed as possible. This can be done either in-protocol (eg. maybe we figure out how to expand FOCIL to make it a primary channel for txs), or out-of-protocol with distributed builder marketplaces. This reduces risk of centralized interference with real-time transaction inclusion.” Vitalik said that it also improves geographic fairness. The Ethereum Foundation has it stated on its website that higher gas limits on Ethereum are made safe by zk-EVMs increase capacity, cut congestion, and stabilize fees. The Foundation said :- “Bringing zkEVMs to L1 is a multi-faceted effort.

After a long period recognized for its speed and low fees, the network has also faced criticism around stability, validator performance, and long-term scalability. This upcoming upgrade aims to directly address those concerns that could redefine SOL’s role in the blockchain ecosystem . Performance Improvements That Matter At Scale For Solana Solana is preparing for one of its most significant upgrades with Alpenglow, a consensus overhaul that replaces both Tower BFT and Proof of History (PoH) to achieve sub-second finality. In an X post , Delphi Digital revealed that the upgrade will introduce two protocol components. At the core of this upgrade is Votor, which would replace the Tower BFT’s incremental voting rounds with a lightweight vote aggregation model. Validators can aggregate votes off-chain before committing finality, allowing the block to be finalized in one or two confirmation rounds rather than multiple chained rounds. Due to this, the theoretical finality would drop down to the 100-150 millisecond range, representing roughly a 100-fold reduction from its original 12.8 seconds. Furthermore, Votor would achieve this through two concurrent finalization paths: Fast Finalization triggers when a proposed block gains 80% or more of the total stake approval in the first round, and instantly finalizes. After, Slow Finalization would kick in when the first round reaches 60 to 80%, which will require a second round to exceed 60% before the block is finalized. Both paths operate in parallel and will ensure finality is achieved even when under partial network participation. The other core of this upgrade is Rotor, which has been redesigned to rework the SOL block propagation layer. Meanwhile, the original Turbine gossip network relied on multihop relays with variable latency. Rotor will introduce stake-weighted relay paths that would prioritize bandwidth-efficient propagation, meaning high-stakes validators with reliable bandwidth will become the key relay points. In simulation, block propagation can occur in as low as 18 milliseconds under typical bandwidth conditions. This upgrade is expected to roll out gradually, with initial activation anticipated in early to mid-2026 . How Solana Emerges As The Leading On-Chain Trading Hub The Kobeissi Letter has reported that the Solana on-chain spot volume reached $1.6 trillion in 2025, officially overtaking all off-chain exchanges except Binance. According to data from Jupiter Exchange, SOL on-chain volumes have surged from 1% of total volume to a massive 12% since 2022. In 2025, SOL officially surpassed Bybit, Coinbase Global, and Bitget in total trading volume. Meanwhile, the Binance share has declined from 80% to 55% since 2022.

It rocketed from just over $0.30 to a multi-year peak of $1.30 within the first month, especially since Charles Hoskinson hinted that he would work with the Trump administration in 2025. After a brief correction, it entered 2025 at around $0.85 and experienced enhanced volatility in the first few months. It reclaimed the $1.00 level almost immediately, then dumped below $0.55, and surged back up to almost $1.20 by March. What followed, though, was a prolonged correction with a few brief spikes in late August. Ultimately, ADA dumped hard by the end of 2025, finishing the year with a 60% drop. With 2026 already here, we decided to ask around some AI solutions about ADA’s potential this year, and here are the most shocking scenarios. Bears to Keep Dominating Following such a painful and frustrating year, ChatGPT warned that the landscape might remain the same in 2026, at least in the first couple of months. The hopes from Cardano’s community that ADA might rejoin the larger-cap altcoin leaders after it surged past $1.00 in early 2025 led to a disappointing ending, which, if it persists, could drive the asset further south. More specifically, the AI solution provided a bear target of $0.10-$0.15 if the “broader crypto market remains selective in 2026.” ADA could lose its remaining support and plunge to levels last seen during the depths of the previous bear markets. Such a 60% price drop from current prices could force many long-term holders to capitulate, it added. Base and Bull Scenarios ChatGPT admitted that such a disastrous price decline appears unlikely at the moment, and outlined its most probable scenario for 2026 – a rangebound consolidation between $0.30 and $0.80. However, it also provided a more speculative bull case, in which the asset flies past the $1.00 resistance and aims for new heights, not seen in years. If this “dramatic revival” indeed takes place, driven by real traction in Cardano’s ecosystem, growth of decentralized apps that attract meaningful activity, then ADA could knock on the doors of $2.00 or even $3.00. “Such a move would likely be driven by renewed speculative interest combined with improved on-chain usage – a combination that has fueled explosive rallies in past cycles,” OpenAI’s platform concluded.

Yes the Venezuela invasion indeed is a very big deal, because Washington hasn’t carried out this kind of direct action in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama that removed military leader Manuel Noriega under similar claims. And Cryptopolitan reported earlier that Trump told reporters at a press conference after the fact that the United States would run Venezuela with a group, adding Secretary of State Marco Rubio would work on the details. Around the same time, Trump warned that the U.S. could step in to support protesters in Iran if security forces opened fire, as unrest there left several dead and created the most serious internal challenge for Iranian authorities in years. Oil markets and investors hold steady in the face of massive geopolitical uncertainty Attention in markets has of course stayed on energy, not stocks or crypto. The OPEC+, which includes Venezuela and Russia among others, is gonna meet in a few hours to discuss output levels. Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia, said the reaction across markets is limited. “The overall market reaction will be muted. We might get some market moving news tomorrow during the OPEC meeting,” Jamie said. He added that shares of large oil companies and drillers could attract interest if talk grows around rebuilding the oil industry in Venezuela. Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy and MENA research at RBC Capital Markets in New York, said the scale of any rebuild would be large. “This an enormous undertaking, given the decades-long decline of the oil sector, also the U.S. regime change and nation-building track record is not one of unambiguous success,” Helima said. Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management in Brookfield, Wisconsin, said the situation was expected. Brian added that from an investor’s POV, large oil reserves could become available over time. He also said the move sends a signal to leadership in Iran and possibly Russia about Trump’s willingness to act. “Markets sometimes swing into risk-off mode on expectations of conflict, but once the conflict starts, they rotate quickly to risk-on,” Brian said, adding that oil could be the only market to react, especially with forecasts already pointing to a supply glut. Venezuela is also dealing with a long-standing oil decline and legal disputes Economists say geopolitical pressure is already part of daily trading. Marchel Alexandrovich, an economist at Saltmarsh Economics in London, said current events add to existing strain. “From the unresolved trade tensions around U.S. tariffs, to Ukraine, Iran, Taiwan and, now, Venezuela, it is clear that the markets are having to cope with significantly more headline risk,” Marchel said . Tina Fordham, founder and geopolitical strategist at Fordham Global Foresight in London, said optimism often appears early. “I feel that there’s a lot of optimism about a post-Maduro, post-Chavez Venezuela. I think reality is likely to be messier,” Tina said. She added that the Monday market open could fuel risk appetite tied to possible change in Iran. “We’ve periodically seen these protests. This time, it’s gaining momentum,” Tina said, pointing out that both Iran and Venezuela are energy producers and consumer markets that have remained closed to global investors. The country holds some of the world’s largest estimated oil reserves, yet output has collapsed over decades due to mismanagement and lost foreign investment after oil nationalization in the 2000s, including assets tied to Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips. Chevron remains the only U.S. major operating in Venezuela. ConocoPhillips has sought billions of dollars tied to three seized projects from nearly twenty years ago, while Exxon pursued lengthy arbitration after exiting. In recent weeks, oil tankers chartered by Chevron were among the few leaving Venezuela, after Trump’s December blockade announcement that Cryptopolitan reported.

His winnings have already drawn the attention of the online community and even Congress. Some lawmakers have shared their frustrations about insider trading. According to sources, Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) plans to introduce a bill that would restrict insider trading. The bill would prohibit federal lawmakers, political appointees, and executive branch staff from trading in prediction markets if they possess, or could reasonably be expected to obtain, material non-public information related to those contracts. The Polymarket trader started placing bets on New Year’s Eve. The Polymarket trader began wagering on Maduro’s removal on December 31, 2025, placing multiple bets that the leader would be ousted by the end of January, starting with a $1,238.34 bet on New Year’s Eve. Earlier, speaking about the trader’s activity, left-wing political researcher Tyson Brody had even questioned whether this was some war-related insider trading. Later, sports and business commentator Joe Pompliano reshared Brody’s post, pointing out that the account reportedly earned $400,000 betting on Maduro’s removal. He even noted that prediction markets are now encouraging insider trading. Soon after, several X users jokingly speculated that the insider might be Barron Trump, the president’s son, while others focused on the $400,000 cash-out and additional big winners. Saturday’s focus on Polymarket comes on the back of mounting calls by US officials to rein in the platform and other prediction markets. Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, had previously warned that sports-related prediction markets are growing too quickly, posing legal, economic, and ethical challenges while threatening state control and the integrity of sports. The former governor argued that prediction markets are operating unlawfully in the US, evading the safeguards designed for state-controlled sports betting. According to Jake Sherman, founder of Punchbowl News, Representative Torres intends to introduce legislation titled the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026. The restriction targets prediction market trades linked to public policy, government actions, or political results when conducted on platforms engaged in interstate commerce. Ideally, it would limit US officials or those with access to confidential information from wagering on prediction markets. Representative Torres also criticized the Trump administration for Maduro’s removal Representative Torres had also condemned the Trump administration’s role in Maduro’s removal . He noted, “The US Constitution vests the power to declare war in Congress. No single individual has the authority to commit the nation to a war of regime change without congressional authorization. Power cannot replace principle. Nor can the ends justify the means.” He further stressed that the rule of law should outweigh raw military power, warning that history shows regime-change wars frequently create more chaos than stability. Representative Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY), however, praised the Trump administration’s actions, saying, “This bold and decisive action by the Trump Administration is a major victory for American security and justice.” He referred to the Venezuelan president as an illegitimate leader who has enabled violent gangs and drug cartels. On the other hand, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani shared his criticism, “Unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a violation of federal and international law. This blatant pursuit of regime change doesn’t just affect those abroad; it directly impacts New Yorkers, including tens of thousands of Venezuelans who call this city home.” Rep. Yvette D. Clarke (D-NY) also criticized the Trump administration for “kidnapping” Maduro without Congress’s approval or regard for the potential fallout from their illegal actions.

This article highlights some of the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week, including Ethena (ENA), Jito (JTO), Pump (PUMP), and Pi Network (PI). Ethena to unlock millions of tokens Ethena, a cryptocurrency valued at over $1.8 billion, will be one of the top coins to watch this week. It will unlock 171 million tokens, currently valued at over $41 million on Sunday. This unlock comes as the unlock progress stands at 51.9%. Ethena token has rebounded in the past few days, moving from a low of $0.1935 in December to the current $0.2400. It still remains about 72% below the highest point in 2025, a decline that mirrors that of other cryptocurrencies . ENA has seen intense buying by Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMex, who has accumulated tokens worth over $3.8 million even as the total value locked has slumped to $6.4 billion from last year’s high of $14.3 billion. Jito token in focus ahead of a big token unlock Jito, a major player in the Solana ecosystem, is another top crypto to watch this week as it unlocks 11.3 million tokens worth over $5.39 million, which is equivalent with 1.14% of its market cap. Like Ethena, Jito has a long way to go in terms of its token unlocks as it has unlocked just 37.28% of its tokens. Jito’s TVL, which is made up of staked Solana tokens, has dropped from last year’s high of $3.37 billion to the current $1.9 billion. Other cryptocurrencies with large unlocks this week are Movement (MOVE), Rain (RAIN), Linea (LINEA), Pump, and Gods Unchained. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum price has rebounded in the past few days, moving to a high of $3,150, its highest level since December 12. It has jumped by 20% from its lowest level in November last year. The token will be in the spotlight this week as investors watch the ongoing trends in the ETF market. Spot Ethereum ETFs added over $160 million in inflows last week, a big improvement from the previous week’s outflows of $102 million. They had shed over $643 million in assets a week earlier. Spot Ethereum ETFs now hold over $19 billion in assets, which are equivalent to 5% of its market capitalization. Ethereum price will also be in focus as BitMine continues to invest and stake it. The company has now accumulated tokens worth over $12 billion and has started staking them. It will also announce its financial results on Friday. Pi Network (PI) Chart shows that Pi Network price moved above the upper side of the falling wedge Pi Network token has held steady in the past few days. It has remained at the key support at $0.200, its highest level since December 20th. The main reason it will be in the spotlight is that, as the chart above shows, it has moved slightly above the upper side of the falling wedge pattern. As such, there is a likelihood that this could lead to more upside in the near term. Pi Network will unlock over 36 million tokens worth over $7. 2 million as part of its daily tokens. Also, traders will likely watch the developments on the ongoing DEX and AMM testnet.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/researcher-the-digital-euro-uses-xrp-heres-how/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE directed attention to a specific institutional trajectory that is already unfolding within the European Union. His post centered on the Digital Euro and its apparent alignment with XRP-based infrastructure, pointing readers to publicly available developments rather than hypothetical partnerships. The post highlights how regulatory timelines, pilot programs, and existing distributed ledger technology initiatives collectively form a coherent narrative around settlement architecture in Europe. The Digital Euro using XRP. @DigPerspectives pic.twitter.com/LvkzyaKvbM — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 31, 2025 Digital Euro Timelines and Official Signals The substance of SMQKE’s post was reinforced by commentary from Digital Perspectives, who revisited recent statements from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. Lagarde confirmed that preparatory work for a Digital Euro is advancing, with key decisions expected in the near term and a formal rollout projected for 2029. This timeline aligns with prior disclosures from the European Union regarding central bank digital currency preparation, providing an official anchor for broader infrastructure discussions. The emphasis was not on whether a Digital Euro will exist, but on how it is being engineered. SMQKE’s reference underscored that the EU has already moved beyond conceptual design into applied testing environments, particularly through distributed ledger initiatives. DLT Pilot Programs and Settlement Infrastructure Central to the analysis was the EU’s Distributed Ledger Technology pilot program, which has been established to test issuance and settlement mechanisms for digital financial instruments, including potential central bank digital currencies. SMQKE highlighted that this program is not theoretical; it is designed to evaluate real-world performance under regulatory supervision. Within this framework, Axology was identified as a key technological layer. Axology operates as an XRP Ledger–based settlement system designed to handle DLT transactions efficiently. Its role within the EU context is especially relevant given its involvement in initiatives connected to tokenized securities and secondary market settlement. Digital Perspectives’s commentary suggests that this infrastructure positioning places XRP-linked technology inside the operational perimeter of European financial experimentation. Tokenization and Network Capabilities The post also drew a clear distinction between settlement networks designed for institutional finance and those optimized primarily for value storage. Tokenized securities , which are a core focus of the EU’s DLT efforts, require features such as compliance-aware settlement, interoperability, and high-throughput transaction finality. SMQKE emphasized that these requirements are being actively addressed within the EU pilot environment.

This comparison was not presented as an attack on Bitcoin , but as a functional observation about differing design objectives across blockchain networks. Why the Observation Matters By connecting official EU timelines, DLT pilot programs, Axology’s XRP Ledger foundation, and the push toward tokenized securities, SMQKE presented a consolidated view of how the Digital Euro’s technical pathway is forming. The implication was not that outcomes are finalized, but that infrastructure decisions are already being made within regulated environments. For observers tracking institutional adoption, the post highlighted where practical implementation appears to be taking shape rather than where market narratives are most visible.

Two of the tokens linked to the US President, WLFI and TRUMP, are among the biggest gainers, with the former skyrocketing by 14%, while the latter is up by nearly 7%. Given the consequences of the attack and the fact that Trump said the US will run the Venezuela oil industry for now, analysts expect further volatility on Sunday at 6 PM ET when the oil futures open in some markets. The Kobeissi Letter explained that Venezuela has over 300 billion barrels of crude oil reserves, which will reportedly be under US control. With oil prices at $57 per barrel, this would put the country’s total reserves at $17.3 trillion. The analysts added that even if the US sells this oil for half the market rate, the value of $8.7 trillion would be larger than the GDP of all countries except China and the US. Consequently, they noted that “most people do not realize how much the world just changed,” and warned that more volatility is expected once financial markets, especially oil, open for trading. This is absolutely insane: Venezuela currently has 303 billion barrels of crude oil reserves, which Trump says the US now controls.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-showing-early-breakout-behavior-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto has presented a comparative analysis that places XRP’s current market structure alongside its behavior in the 2016–2017 cycle. The focus of the post is not on short-term price fluctuations, but on the duration and character of consolidation preceding major upside movements. According to the analysis, XRP has just completed approximately 393 days of sideways accumulation, a timeframe that closely mirrors the period observed before the well-documented breakout in early 2017. The charts attached to the post align two multi-month windows: one covering from 2016 to 2017 and the other spanning from 2024 to 2025. In both cases, price action is shown moving within a tightening range after an extended period of volatility. The comparison emphasizes time symmetry rather than price symmetry, suggesting that market participants should focus on how long XRP has been consolidating rather than how high or low it has traded during that phase. $XRP just completed 393 days of sideways accumulation — the same duration seen before the 2017 breakout. Back then, price chopped, compressed, and bored everyone out before expanding aggressively. Now, $XRP is showing early breakout behavior while attention is still low. pic.twitter.com/9kayvuTdF7 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 31, 2025 Compression and Market Fatigue Before Expansion Steph Is Crypto’s assessment highlights that the earlier cycle was characterized by prolonged price compression that gradually reduced volatility and market interest. During that period, XRP traded within narrowing boundaries, creating conditions where participation declined, and sentiment became increasingly indifferent. Only after this extended phase did price expansion occur, resulting in a sharp and sustained move higher. The current chart structure is presented as following a similar progression. XRP has spent more than a year moving laterally, forming a descending compression pattern that has limited upside while steadily absorbing supply. The analyst notes that this type of environment historically tends to remove speculative excess and weak positioning, leaving the market structurally prepared for a directional move once resistance is resolved. Early Signs of Structural Change The post argues that XRP is now exhibiting what Steph Is Crypto describes as early breakout behavior, despite broader market attention remaining subdued. Rather than pointing to a completed breakout, the emphasis is on subtle changes in structure that often precede stronger moves, such as price pressing against descending resistance and holding higher lows within the compression zone. An additional perspective was provided in a reply by X user dibscrypto, who reinforced the relevance of the 393-day accumulation period. The commenter described the pattern as a powerful fractal, noting that the descending triangle formation and reduced public interest closely resemble conditions seen ahead of the 2017 expansion. The comment further suggested that sustained closes above the descending trendline, accompanied by volume, would be a critical confirmation signal. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for the Current Market Phase Both the original post and the response frame the current period as one where patience is central. The implication is not that price appreciation is guaranteed, but that extended accumulation phases have historically preceded significant repricing events for XRP. The comparison to 2016–2017 is used to contextualize the present market, highlighting how long-term structural setups often develop quietly before attracting wider attention. In this view, XRP’s prolonged consolidation is less a sign of stagnation and more an indication that the market may be approaching a transitional phase similar to prior cycles.

Key Takeaways: Hut 8 expanded its Coinbase credit line to $200M to support its AI and HPC push. A $7B Fluidstack deal makes Hut 8 a long-term power supplier for AI data centers. Strong stock gains and a large BTC treasury set Hut 8 apart from struggling miners. The amended facility, disclosed in a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, will be used for “general corporate purposes.” T he expansion builds on Hut 8’s strong momentum through 2025, a period when many Bitcoin miners struggled with compressed margins and rising costs. Hut 8’s $7B AI Deal With Fluidstack Powers Major Data Center Push The credit increase follows a landmark $7 billion agreement signed in December with AI cloud provider Fluidstack. Under the deal, Hut 8 will supply 245 megawatts of energy over 15 years to power a large-scale AI data center, marking one of the largest partnerships between a crypto-native firm and an AI infrastructure company. Hut 8’s strategic pivot has been rewarded by markets. The company’s shares have risen more than 134% over the past year and are trading around $51, according to Yahoo Finance. The rally sets Hut 8 apart from much of the mining sector, which has faced sustained pressure since the April 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Beyond AI, Hut 8 has continued to expand its Bitcoin mining and treasury strategy. Through its majority ownership of American Bitcoin, a mining and crypto treasury company, the firm has increased exposure to Bitcoin at a time when many peers have been forced to sell holdings to cover operating costs. JUST IN: #Bitcoin mining company Hut 8 just announced it partnered with Google for financial backing on a 15-year lease. Bullish pic.twitter.com/NQN9JmW0ob — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 17, 2025 Industry-wide challenges have included higher energy prices and macroeconomic uncertainty, as well as rising equipment costs linked to US tariffs introduced under President Donald Trump. The measures have heightened concerns over supply chains, particularly given China’s role as a major producer of application-specific integrated circuits used in Bitcoin mining. Despite those headwinds, Hut 8 remains one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders globally. The company ranks ninth among Bitcoin treasury firms, with 13,696 BTC worth more than $1.2 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.Net. American Bitcoin ranks twentieth, holding 5,098 BTC valued at roughly $458 million. Bitmain Slashes Bitcoin Miner Prices as Industry Pressure Mounts As reported, Bitmain is cutting prices aggressively across multiple generations of Bitcoin mining hardware as pressure builds across the mining sector, according to recent promotional campaigns and internal price lists circulated to customers. One promotion dated Dec. 23 offered a package of four S19 XP+ Hydro units paired with an ANTRACK V2 container, implying an effective price of roughly $4 per terahash for the 19 J/TH machines. Shipments for that batch are scheduled to begin in January 2026, suggesting Bitmain is willing to lock in low pricing well ahead of delivery. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s network hashrate fell 4% in the month through Dec. 15, a development that could set the stage for stronger price performance in the months ahead, according to analysts at VanEck. “When hash rate compression persists over longer periods, positive forward returns tend to occur more often and with greater magnitude,” the analysts wrote.

After blaming the country’s officials for certain drug operations, the US military bombed its capital, Caracas, and arrested its leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife. In his first interview and address to the nation after the attacks, US President Donald Trump claimed that his country will now run the oil industry in Venezuela, which reportedly has over 300 billion barrels of oil, valued at more than $17 trillion at market prices. One of the statements he made caused even more controversy as he claimed that he didn’t tell Congress about the military operation, as it would have leaked. The democrats used this opportunity to criticize Trump’s actions, including Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, who called the attacks “reckless.” He also warned that any plan for the US to run Venezuela should “strike fear in the hearts of all Americans.” He added that the Trump administration had denied pursuing regime change or military action, which was evidently not the case. Some reports indicated later that the Trump impeachment odds reached a new all-time high on prediction platforms such as Kalshi. However, a closer look at the charts today actually shows a different story. The odds on both Kalshi and Polymarket have declined slightly since the start of the year on almost all scales (by June 1, 2026, January 1, 2027, and January 1, 2028). The chances for an impeachment by December 31, 2026, on Polymarket have declined by 3% since the attacks took place. Trump Impeachment Odds on Polymarket Interestingly, the attacks against Venezuela have impacted the two largest cryptocurrencies linked to the US President. Aside from BTC jumping past $91,000 for the first time since mid-December, WLFI has skyrocketed by more than 16% on a daily scale to almost $0.18. TRUMP has returned to the top 100 alts, soaring 7.5% to $5.40.

They have a small number of big caps to hold on, yet they also go in search of a smaller Altcoin which can still have an unexpectedly better side to the upside. This explains why next big crypto talk usually spikes at tokens less than 0.1. When a project is actually underway and there is an usher-in route, the shift of attention may be high-speed. Certain observers consider that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) would be appropriate for such an arrangement at present. It is also not completely deployed on mainnet, but is no longer a secret concept either. It is in that in-between place where 20x conversations are likely to begin. Presale That Pushes Momentum In phase 7, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.04. The presale has been held in the format of a system of stages, and the stage includes a predetermined price and a predetermined number of tokens. Having a higher demand, a given stage will be filled quicker, and the price will be advanced. The project shows it raised $19.6M and had approximately 18,700 holders and sold approximately 822M tokens, up to now. The pricing trend is also narrated. The initial price of Mutuum Finance was $0.01 in Phase 1, and now to $ 0.04 in presale Phase 7. That is a 300% rise across phases. An official launch price is also mentioned in Mutuum Finance and is $0.06. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Developing Mutuum Finance is developing a non custodial protocol of lending and borrowing. The point of focus is dual lending markets. Users are able to lend in a shared pool format and also to avail direct lending terms between users. That is important since it is compatible with various forms of demand as the protocol expands. One more primary entity is mtTokens. When assets get provided by users, that position is represented by mtTokens. These tokens are set for earnings over time. To customers of the DeFi, this is the way which lending would be easy to monitor as well as being easy to navigate. Also included is the trend story of security. Mutuum Finance uses a CertiK token scan of 90/100 and that an independent audit of its V1 lending and borrowing protocol was performed by Halborn . It has also mentioned a bug bounty of $50k, which is an indicator of added testing before broader implementation. V1 Timing and Phase Speed Per official statements by Mutuum Finance , V1 is being tested in Sepolia testnet and then designed to work on mainnet, and it is stated that it will be launched soon. V1 encompasses such integral elements as the Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and a Liquidator Bot, with initial assets of lending, borrowing as well as collateral being ETH and USDT. Your Phase 6 quick selling and whale allocations were also asked about. This is the clean version of putting it without number inventions. The presale proceeded out of Phase 6 with a price of $0.035 to Phase 7 with a price of $0.04 and subsequent phases tend to move rapidly due to increase in attention as delivery approaches. According to some market commentators, bigger buyers are likely to show up in such late stages as they want to see more than they worry. Nonetheless, precise numbers of whale transactions have not been framed in the official statistics that have been made available to date. In a bullish scenario, projections show that a 5x increase from Phase 7’s $0.04 level would place MUTM around $0.20, while a 7x move would imply about $0.28. That is why the present moment is important. Provided that V1 growth continues to be linear and stage distributions continue to become tighter, the transition to the presale token to a widely-followed Altcoin might become fast as Q1 2026 gets closer.

The BMNR stock ended the week at $31.20, up from last week’s low of $27. BitMine shareholder to vote on increasing shares to 50 billion The BMNR stock price will likely be highly volatile in the coming days as the shareholders vote on authorizing more shares. They will determine whether to boost the outstanding shares from 500 million to 50 billion. In a statement, Tom Lee noted that the new fundraising will enable it to have selective at-the-money (ATM) and capital raising opportunity over time. At the same time, he noted that the new authorization will enable opportunistic deals such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Most importantly, he noted that the new fundraising will enable the company to execute future share splits as he expects that the Ethereum price will continue rising in the long term. However, critics have pointed to some major holes in Lee’s argument. First, analysts argue that the new share expansion will be too much, considering that it is nearing its goal of its Ethereum accumulation strategy. Tevis @FunOfInvesting · Follow $BMNR I read through the proposal to increase authorized shares from 500M to 50B, as well as Tom’s thread below.Here are my TOP 3 concerns:I should start by highlighting that I very much appreciate the transparency of the thread by Tom. In it, he argues this is not about 2:42 AM · Jan 4, 2026 296 Reply Copy link Read 99 replies It has bought 4.1 million tokens so far and now holds about 3.4% of the ETH supply. As such, it needs to buy 1.6% of the supply, which is smaller than what it has bought so far. At the current price, the company needs to authorize 190 million more shares. Second, analysts noted that the share split argument is vague as Lee argued that it will happen when Ethereum surges, potentially to $250,000, an event that will happen many years later. Finally, there are concerns that the company’s market net-asset value (mNAV), which has slumped to 0.93. Increased dilution when the stock is trading below NAV is relatively risky as we have seen with other companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which is selling shares worth billions a month. Ethereum price technical analysis suggests more upside ETH price chart | Source: TradingView Meanwhile, technicals suggest that Ethereum price has more upside in the coming weeks. It has formed a double-bottom pattern at $2,766, its lowest level in December last year. Its neckline is at $3,475, its highest level on December 10. A double-bottom is one of the most common bullish reversal signs in technical analysis. The token is also about to move above the Supertrend indicator. It has also moved above the 50-day moving average, while the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has moved to the neutral level. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the next key resistance level at $3,475. A move above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the psychological level at $4,000. BMNR stock price technical analysis BitMine stock chart | Source: TradingView The daily timeframe chart shows that the BMNR stock price has crashed in the past few months, moving from a high of $160 in July last year to the current $30. A closer look shows that the stock has remained below all moving averages and the Supertrend indicator, which is a highly bearish sign. However, like Ethereum, the stock has formed a double-bottom pattern with a neckline at $42. Therefore, the stock will likely rebound this week, potentially to the next key resistance level at $42. A move above that level will be the psychological point at $50.READ MORE: Here’s why BitMine stock price is ripe for a strong comeback The post BMNR stock forecast as BitMine shareholders votes on increasing share count appeared first on Invezz",Crypto|Stock Market|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2026-01-04 07:51:20

This eye-catching event could imply several market developments, especially following the asset’s bearish struggles in Q4 2025. Meanwhile, Ethereum has notably opened 2026 on a positive note, climbing to above $3,100 for the first time since mid-December. Related Reading: Ethereum Finds Its Footing Again, But Here’s Why Bulls Still Have Work To Do Ethereum Sees $960M Inflows As Investor Sentiment Shifts In a QuickTake post on December 3, the analysis page CryptoOnChain reports an important change in Ethereum investors’ activity. Notably, the Ethereum net inflow in December reached $960 million on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The development is particularly important and compelling because it represents an impressive shift from the negative inflow record that had existed since July 2025. For the majority of H2 2025, investors had chosen to continually withdraw more ETH than deposit, likely in favour of long-term accumulation, i.e., bullish, or to divert potential selling pressure elsewhere. However, the figures recorded in December suggest an abrupt change in investors’ behavior, which bears multiple possible implications for the market. Generally, increased exchange inflows are considered a bearish signal interpreted as market participants’ preparation for a potential asset offload. Considering ETH price struggles in Q4 2025, this recent spike in net inflows could be indicative of a potential repositioning for an anticipated long-term bear market. However, CryptoOnChain highlights some possible positive effects of this event. The huge inflows recorded in December could also reflect a revival in buyer interest, suggesting renewed demand for Ethereum as investors prepare to accumulate at lower price levels. In addition, the heavy net inflows could also represent a new capital injection in the Ethereum market that has been moved to exchanges for active trading. In line with this thought, CryptoOnChain also states that traders may be moving capital to exchanges to capitalize on trading opportunities driven by an expected high volatility. In conclusion, the analysts emphasize that the sudden reversal leading to the massive inflows in December is a vital market signal potentially indicating a new phase of accumulation or heightened trading activity.

The tweet highlights Kidd’s concise response to a question about XRP’s price outlook. According to the post, Kidd focused the discussion on two core concepts, liquidity and supply, emphasizing underlying market mechanics rather than short-term price narratives. The tweet references a video in which Kidd outlines his position in detail, providing context that continues to resonate within the digital asset community. Digital Asset Investor’s post does not introduce new commentary from Kidd. However, it instead emphasizes the continued relevance of his earlier explanation, particularly as XRP remains a subject of debate regarding long-term pricing potential . When asked about XRP Price Greg Kidd(10th employee @ripple ) had two words. Liquidity & Supply pic.twitter.com/VFSfP5FN2i — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) December 31, 2025 Liquidity as a Core Requirement In the attached video, Kidd explains that for Ripple’s business model to function effectively, XRP must be highly liquid. He stresses that ease of entry and exit is essential, arguing that reduced friction in transactions is more critical than focusing solely on the nominal price level. His remarks suggest that liquidity underpins utility, particularly in environments where assets are intended to move efficiently across markets and jurisdictions. Kidd further states that, in his view, liquidity outweighs absolute price considerations. This perspective aligns with a functional approach to digital assets, where consistent market depth and accessibility are prerequisites for broader adoption. The tweet underscores this portion of the video to reinforce the idea that price appreciation is not the primary metric by which XRP’s success should initially be measured. Demand, Supply, and Price Formation While prioritizing liquidity, Kidd also acknowledges the role of supply and demand in determining price outcomes. In the same video, he explains that when demand exceeds available supply, upward price movement is a natural consequence. He notes that those who anticipate sustained demand may benefit if such an imbalance develops over time. The tweet frames this statement as Kidd’s recognition that price increases are a byproduct of market conditions rather than an objective in themselves. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This aspect of the video has drawn mixed reactions from viewers. One X user, Guy Schiefelbein, commented that the remarks remain relevant and speculated that Kidd may still hold a significant amount of XRP. Another user, cryptos_smalls, offered a more critical interpretation, arguing that XRP’s large and expanding supply has historically outpaced demand, contributing to prolonged price stagnation. That user further asserted that XRP’s long trading history weakens the case for future double-digit valuations. Ongoing Relevance of the Discussion Digital Asset Investor’s post primarily serves to reintroduce Kidd’s comment into the current discourse. By focusing on liquidity and supply rather than projections, the tweet reinforces a foundational view of how XRP’s market behavior should be assessed. The contrasting reactions in the replies illustrate that while Kidd’s explanation remains widely cited, interpretations of its implications continue to differ.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin held near $90K despite a major US–Venezuela military escalation that dominated headlines. BTC staying above its 21-day moving average signals short-term support and potential January upside. Analysts warn volatility could rise once institutional traders return when US markets reopen. Bitcoin briefly dipped below $90,000 in early trading before recovering, showing limited reaction to an event that dominated global headlines. “The US bombed a country and captured its leader, on a weekend no less, and yet Bitcoin has barely moved,” said Nic Puckrin , founder of crypto media firm Coin Bureau, in a post on X. Bitcoin’s Calm Amid Geopolitical Shock Puts Focus on Key Support Level The muted response stood out in a market where risk assets often see sharp sell-offs during geopolitical crises. From a technical perspective, analysts point to encouraging signals. Michaël van de Poppe noted that Bitcoin remains above its 21-day moving average, a level often viewed as short-term support. Holding above that threshold could open the door to further price gains in January, assuming broader market conditions remain stable. The resilience is notable given Bitcoin’s recent volatility. Historically, sudden geopolitical shocks or macroeconomic stress have triggered abrupt drawdowns in risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. This time, the response has been restrained, at least so far. The situation stems from an announcement by US President Donald Trump, who confirmed airstrikes on Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. While the news sparked intense debate online, financial markets appeared largely unfazed over the weekend. Some analysts caution that the calm may not last. “There’s a lot of geopolitical tension, and next week the big players will return,” said crypto trader Lennaert Snyder, warning that volatility could increase once traditional markets reopen. Institutional investors typically sit out weekends, meaning reactions may still come when US markets open on Monday. $BTC has entered the weekend range.

After a flash crash in October, Bitcoin fell more than 30% from an all-time high above $125,000 to around $80,000 in November, before rebounding toward current levels. Bitcoin Seen Entering Accumulation Phase in Early 2026 Analyst Linh Tran believes Bitcoin entered a corrective phase in late 2025 after peaking near $126,000 and falling roughly 35% to around $80,000. In a note shared with Cryptonews.com, she said this pullback reflects a structural shift in the market, with Bitcoin now driven less by retail speculation and more by macroeconomic conditions, institutional flows, and regulatory developments. Meanwhile, Abra CEO Bill Barhydt believes Bitcoin could benefit in 2026 as easing monetary policy injects fresh liquidity into global markets, reviving risk appetite after a prolonged period of tight financial conditions. Barhydt said the US central bank is already laying the groundwork for looser policy. He pointed to early signs of renewed balance sheet support, describing the current environment as “quantitative easing light,” with the Federal Reserve stepping in to support demand for government debt.

Costello is the final member of four Teesside pals who were convicted of running a global drugs ring. Prosecutors mentioned that his bank account and crypto stash grew with dirty cash. Prosecutors mentioned that he funneled money into several investments in the UK, noting his affinity for digital assets. Initially, the prosecutors had filed a proceeds of crime application over his five-bedroom home, which led to them selling it. In addition, his quad bikes and a number of luxury vehicles have also been confiscated and liquidated under the ruling. United Kingdom prosecutors want to seize Costello’s assets The prosecutors mentioned in court that Costello worked alongside his business partners John Watson, Steven Beazley, and Dave Wright, managing the Teesside arm of a global drugs ring between 2015 and 2016. The quartet worked under Stockton drugs baron Jon Moorby, who operated the network alongside Merseyside gangster Lance Kennedy. The pair directed the movement of drugs from Spain and Belgium into the UK. Prosecutors mentioned that Kennedy organized and controlled an estimated £17 million of cocaine imports into the United Kingdom. The operation led to the inflow of class A drugs across several Channels in chartered helicopters from 2015 to 2016. Couriers also moved the cocaine up to Merseyside from Kent and across the North East. The four-man gang, including Costello, was convicted of conspiracy to supply class A drugs in 2021 after Cleveland police put them under surveillance to gather evidence. Costello was not present in court during the jury’s verdict, with UK prosecutors mentioning that he had fled the country for the Middle East. He was later taken to court while driving in Amsterdam and brought back to the United Kingdom in 2022 to begin his nine-year sentence. Meanwhile, financial investigators claim that Costello made about £1.6 million in illegal profits. Prosecutors have also identified several payments into his bank account. Investigators continue to track Costello’s account The investigators claim that the payments into his account were consistent with drug trafficking profits. They mentioned that they have also traced £4,012.21 worth of Ethereum Classic in Costello’s name, which they claim originated from his drug sales. While prosecutors are zeroing in on the digital assets, it remains to be seen if Costello has some other hidden stash kept somewhere to be retrieved at a later date. The exact amount to be seized from Costello has yet to be settled due to the proceeds from the sale of his house not being finalized between him and his former partner, Victoria Costello, who initiated divorce proceedings after he was sent to prison. Paperwork from the proceeds of crime application showed that the equity in the house is £107,722. The outstanding mortgage owed to the Royal Bank of Scotland and a debt to the government agency had been settled. The separated couple attended the Durham Crown Court last month, where prosecutor Steve McNally mentioned that Mrs Costello is claiming to have paid cash as part of the deposit on the home when it was originally bought. The CPS has paused the former couple’s divorce proceedings until the finances are settled. According to reports, the convicted drug trafficker has been found to have more than £137,577 in cash and assets available to be confiscated by the authorities. A Judge is expected to sign the confiscation order early this year. Costello’s former drug pals also had their proceeds of crime applications finalized some time ago. John Watson, Dave Wright, and Steven Beazley paid back less than £300,000 from a £4 million profit.

According to reports, the elderly man was approached by someone who claimed to be able to help him make profits from crypto investments. However, the elderly Malaysian doctor ended up becoming a scam victim. In the statement released by Perak Police Chief Datuk Noor Hisam Nordin, the Ipoh District Police Headquarters (IPD) received the report yesterday from the victim, a 67-year-old man, regarding the incident. The police statement mentioned that, sometimes in late September 2025, the victim received a message from an acquaintance on the TikTok application. The message contained an investment link, with the suspect subsequently explaining to the man how the investment worked. Malaysian doctor becomes victim of a crypto scam The Malaysian police claimed that the suspect was able to deceive the elderly victim through his explanation, asking him to invest in a digital asset investment for big rewards. The police mentioned that the victim made several transfers to the various bank accounts provided by the suspect. He noted that the total transfers made to the bank accounts totalled RM 320,000 ($78,000). The elderly man also claimed that the bank accounts had names of different firms. Trouble started when the man tried to withdraw his promised profits from the account that was maintained on his behalf. After realizing that he had become a victim of a hack, he took to Facebook. He claimed to have read about an entity known as International Justice Malaysia (IJM), which purported to help scam victims find justice and resolve their cases. The victim contacted a lawyer who claimed he could help him, but said he had to make various payments. The lawyer mentioned that the payments were to kickstart the recovery process. In all, the Malaysian victim suffered another loss of RM 209,200 ($51,635), bringing the total losses to about RM 529,200. After a while, the victim realized that the lawyer was not working on his case as he claimed, seeing that he was just using him for a payday. After a while, he lost trust in the legitimacy of the Facebook page and subsequently contacted the police. Police warn the public over a rise in bogus crypto investment schemes The Malaysian police mentioned that the case has been registered and is being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating. They mentioned that all information that would lead to the apprehension of the suspects is being gathered, and moves to arrest both suspects for questioning would commence. The police have also warned the general public to be mindful of their crypto dealings. If users discover that they have been scammed , they should report it to the authorities. The police mentioned that this is not the first case where a victim would be cheated out of their hard-earned money over a bogus crypto investment. In June 2025, a retired doctor discovered he had been scammed after 11 years. The police chief mentioned that the victim in this case lost RM 3.9 million ($962,606) to a nonexistent crypto investment. He added that the victim was an elderly person, noting that the criminals are now going after them because of their ignorance. According to the police report, the victim said he joined the investment scheme because the person who introduced him to the platform was a friend of his late wife. From December 2014 to April 2025, the victim claimed that he transferred the entire funds to the suspect either by physical cash or by transferring it to a bank account that had the name of the suspect. The police claimed that the victim started suspecting he had been scammed after he didn’t receive any returns on his investments.

On one hand, Bitcoin-powered travel is gaining ground in El Salvador with the expansion of Airbtc, a booking platform built exclusively for BTC users and already showing strong local adoption. On the other hand, Argentina’s older adults are leading the region’s growth in digital wallet usage, proving that crypto and fintech adoption are accelerating across generations. Furthermore, Bitget Wallet ended 2025 with increased on-chain activity in trading, payments, and yield products, demonstrating that self-custodial wallets are becoming mainstream financial instruments rather than niche solutions for cryptocurrency traders. Together, these developments underscore a clear trend: crypto in LATAM is increasingly about real-world utility, inclusion, and economic transformation. Airbtc is a Bitcoin-only platform that is redefining travel Airbtc is a global booking platform where consumers can only pay with Bitcoin (BTC). The business, which launched in August 2024, operates similarly to Airbnb but is developed by and for bitcoiners. According to cofounder Jake Seifert, the platform already features properties across more than a dozen countries, with a strong presence in El Salvador. Destinations include El Zonte, San Salvador, Santa Ana, Berlín, Costa del Sol, and Punta Mango. Airbtc intends to improve the circular Bitcoin economy by making it easier for visitors to spend BTC in real-world circumstances. Airbtc presents itself as a decentralised alternative to existing booking platforms by eliminating financial intermediaries and charging lower prices. Guests can save up to 8%, and hosts can save up to 18% compared to services like Airbnb or Booking.com. Payments are held in cold storage until the stay is complete, after which they are released to hosts in BTC, either on-chain or over the Lightning Network. El Salvador accounts for around 15% of Airbtc’s global inventory, making it one of the biggest concentrations by nation, showing increased local interest in taking Bitcoin and the country’s favourable legislative climate for Bitcoin-focused enterprises. Seniors drive digital wallet adoption in Argentina Today, 3.3 million Argentinians over the age of 60, or 42% of the population, use a virtual wallet to access digital payments, transfers, and basic savings features. The data was published by the Argentine Fintech Chamber on December 29, citing Central Bank records that show retirees had the highest increase in digital payments and transfers over the previous year. While overall virtual wallet ownership increased by 13% between June 2024 and June 2025, use among those over 60 increased by 29.7%, more than doubling the norm. This growth suggests a deliberate transition rather than a gradual adoption. Older folks are increasingly using digital wallets for better convenience, security, and access to yields, reducing their need for currency. According to Invecq, seniors who use virtual wallets make up to 80% fewer cash withdrawals than those who just use bank accounts, contributing to a general decrease in cash usage across the economy. Beyond payments, wallets have become an important savings tool: 42% of retirees transfer funds to earn returns, and many advocate for the ability to collect and manage pensions in an increasingly digitised financial system. Bitget Wallet sees 2025 on-chain activity signal shift toward everyday crypto finance Bitget Wallet finished 2025 with increased on-chain activity in trading , payments, and yield products, indicating that self-custodial wallets are becoming mainstream financial instruments rather than specialist goods for crypto traders. The data show a gradual shift in user behaviour as adoption expanded beyond early, trading-focused audiences and into more ordinary financial use. The findings are based on internal data described in a press release sent to Invezz , which shows how wallet usage continued to rise even as broader crypto market activity slowed near the end of the year. The pattern indicates a gradual decoupling between market sentiment and real-world cryptocurrency usage, notably in areas related to payments and stablecoin-based activity. Trading activity on the blockchain increased significantly throughout 2025. Bitget Wallet’s monthly swap trading volume surpassed $900 million, representing a 232% increase over the previous year. Users increasingly depended on decentralised exchange routing to gain access to a wider range of assets across various blockchains, demonstrating a rising demand for on-chain liquidity and execution.

In several developments spinning off this incident, Representative Ritchie Torres is reportedly moving to introduce a bill targeting insider trading on prediction markets amid traders’ netting heavy profits on forecasted capture of President Nicolás Maduro. The Push For Integrity In Prediction Markets On January 3, US President Donald announced a successful military mission in Venezuela resulting in the capture of President Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The Republican-led administration in Washington accuses Maduro and his spouse of running a “narco-terrorist organization,” and both parties have been arraigned to face charges of drug trafficking in New York. Amid the numerous condemnations and reactions to this move by the US government, there have been revelations of insider trading around the event in the predictions market. Blockchain analysis page Lookonchain reports that three insider wallets placed Polymarket bets on the capture of Maduro just hours before the attack. Data shows that these three wallets were recently created, funded, and only placed bets relating to Venezuela and Maduro’s capture to net total profits valued at $630,848. The largest of these transactions came from a trader who invested $34,000 to record gains of $409,900. According to the founder of PunchBowl News, Jake Sherman, Rep Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) aims to introduce a bill that illegalizes this act among government officials and protects important state-related information. The bill, which would be titled the Public Integrity In Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026, aims to ban all affiliated government persons from participating in the prediction market bets when exposed to certain information. Sherman states that the description of the proposed law read: This bill prohibits federal elected officials, political appointees, and Executive Branch employees from engaging in certain transactions involving prediction market contracts when they either possess material nonpublic information relevant to the transaction or could reasonably obtain such information through their official duties. The restriction applies to buying, selling, or exchanging prediction market contracts tied to government policy, government action, or political outcomes on platforms engaged in interstate commerce Notably, prediction markets surged in late 2025 following growing Wall Street interest in the blockchain market infrastructure. Kalshi, which presently ranks as the largest prediction platform, is presently valued at $11 billion after a $1 billion fundraising in December. Crypto Market Resilient Amid Venezuela Attack In other news, the crypto market has shown no significant negative reaction to the US attack on Venezuelan soil. Over the last day, Bitcoin has moved by 2.13% to trade at $91,414 as the total crypto market cap climbed to $3.08 trillion.",Crypto News|drug-trafficking|insider trading|Polymarket|President Donald Trump|President Nicolas Maduro|Public integrity|US Invasion|Venezuela,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-04 09:00:38

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/why-1-6-billion-xrp-just-vanished-from-exchanges-heres-what-happened/,"BullRunners founder Nick Anderson drew attention to a significant shift in XRP market dynamics, highlighting that approximately 1.6 billion XRP have effectively disappeared from cryptocurrency exchanges. According to Anderson, exchange-held XRP balances have fallen to levels not seen in seven years, dropping sharply from roughly 3.76 billion tokens recorded in October 2025 to around 1.6 billion currently. This contraction in readily available supply, he explained, alters the balance between liquidity and potential sell pressure and warrants closer examination as the market moves into 2026. BREAKING!! Why 1.6 Billion #XRP Just Vanished From Exchanges!? pic.twitter.com/qCL9hS9A27 — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) January 2, 2026 Broader Market Context and Near-Term Structure Anderson first placed XRP within the wider digital asset landscape, noting that Bitcoin remains near the lower end of its recent trading range. While Bitcoin has shown signs of attempting a recovery toward the $90,000 area, Anderson emphasized that confirmation above key resistance levels would be necessary before a broader market rebound could be expected. Within this environment, he suggested that XRP appears to have completed its short-term downward phase, forming higher lows that could support a recovery toward previous local price levels if momentum continues. He also observed that overall crypto market capitalization has hovered around the $3 trillion mark, reflecting limited volatility during the holiday period. Despite short-term uncertainty, Anderson expressed the view that 2026 could be a constructive year for the sector, even if early market structure adjustments produce temporary weakness. Escrow Unlocks and Supply Dynamics Addressing concerns around Ripple’s scheduled escrow releases, Anderson described the January unlock of one billion XRP as a routine event rather than a market shock. He reiterated that such releases occur monthly and that a substantial portion, typically between 70 and 80%, is historically returned to escrow. In his assessment, price behavior following recent unlocks suggests that these events have not exerted meaningful downward pressure. Instead, Anderson argued that the more relevant development is the sustained reduction in exchange reserves. He noted that XRP held on exchanges has declined by more than half over the past three months, tightening available supply. If demand remains steady or increases under these conditions, he suggested that upward price pressure becomes more likely. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Activity and Forward Outlook Anderson further pointed to institutional factors supporting XRP, including continued inflows into XRP-focused exchange-traded products and growing interest in Ripple as a company. He referenced significant financing activity involving major financial players and emphasized that institutional stakeholders have a clear incentive to see long-term value appreciation. While cautioning against extreme price predictions, Anderson stressed that adoption trends, regulatory progress, and diminishing exchange supply are tangible indicators worth monitoring. In his view, these elements collectively suggest that XRP is positioned to benefit from institutional growth and evolving market infrastructure in 2026, even as short-term volatility remains part of the landscape.

56802165,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=888636,1767517539,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56802165.jpeg,Why Venezuela’s oil boom is still out of reach,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-venezuelas-oil-windfall-pipe-dream/,"After a military operation ousted President Nicolás Maduro, the White House pivoted from drug enforcement to energy interests in Venezuela, with President Trump saying U.S. oil firms would move in to tap the country’s vast reserves. “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” he said. Trump’s remarks made clear the real prize: getting U.S. energy firms into a nation sitting on massive oil deposits that have been off-limits for years. Chevron stands alone as companies weigh risks Still, convincing companies to rush back into Venezuela won’t be simple. Right now, Chevron stands alone as the single major American oil player operating there and holds the position of the biggest foreign investor in the country. Other executives will need to carefully measure whether conditions on the ground are stable enough to justify the risk in a nation where the oil business has crumbled after more than 20 years of poor management and crooked dealings. Another hurdle stands in the way of Trump’s push to flood global markets with Venezuela’s thick crude: nobody really wants more oil right now. American oil sits under $60 per barrel , a price point that makes most U.S. producers think twice about new investments. Worldwide supplies keep climbing this year. “One thing that works against it is the price of oil,” said Ali Moshiri, the former head of Chevron’s operations in Latin America and Africa. “In the environment we’re in, if you’re going to invest, do you put it in the Permian [Basin in the U.S.] or do you put it in Venezuela? That’s going to be a tough choice.” The government hasn’t spelled out exactly how it plans to bring more American oil companies into Venezuela to ramp up production. People who study the industry say the process might let companies compete for oil and gas territories and wonder if European firms might also get a chance to bid their way into the country. Chevron put out a statement Saturday saying its main concerns are keeping employees safe and protecting its property in the country. The company and the businesses it partners with have roughly 3,000 workers there. Venezuela pumps around 900,000 barrels daily this year, with Chevron responsible for about one-third of that total. The crude Venezuela pulls from the ground is heavier and thicker than most oil traded worldwide, but refineries from the American Gulf Coast to China and India can squeeze better profits from it compared to other types, which makes fuel producers eager to get their hands on it. The U.S. shale revolution created record-breaking oil output, but the light crude American drillers bring up doesn’t perform as well as the heavy stuff from Venezuela, Canada, and Mexico. Venezuela’s government puts its proven oil reserves above 300 billion barrels , which would give it the world’s largest supply if the numbers hold up. Other large oil corporations potentially interested in going back to Venezuela will almost definitely wait and watch before making moves because the country has a history of seizing oil properties, which happened in the 1970s and again in the 2000s, according to analysts. ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil left Venezuela in 2007 after President Hugo Chávez, at the time, took over their operations. Conoco went to court later seeking more than $20 billion from the Venezuelan government; Exxon asked for $12 billion. Both companies ended up getting small portions of what they lost after long legal fights. Conoco and Exxon didn’t respond right away when asked for their thoughts. Rebuilding requires massive effort Orlando Ochoa, a Caracas-based economist and a visiting fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, painted a picture of the enormous challenge ahead in restarting the broken energy sector, which has lost tens of thousands of skilled workers who left the country during Maduro’s rule. He explained this includes writing a comprehensive economic recovery plan to pull in the money Venezuela desperately requires from international lenders to fix infrastructure and rusty oil equipment. Domestic laws must change to let private energy companies work without government interference, he said. The government also needs to reorganize about $160 billion in debt and settle ongoing legal disputes with foreign companies to persuade them to return. “What the U.S. needs to do is to implement a form of a Marshall Plan,” said Ochoa, pointing to the economic program that rebuilt Europe after World War II. “This is about much more than coming into the oil and gas sector just to extract crude from the ground.” One American oil executive who spent years working in Venezuela said the U.S. government might have finished the simple part by pushing Maduro out. But questions remain about whether a temporary government could provide the safety and stability foreign oil companies need before flooding back into Venezuela, the executive noted. On Saturday, while questions kept coming about how Venezuela’s government would operate and what role America would play, Trump repeatedly returned to talking about the country’s oil. The reasoning behind the military move showed how the president has consistently seen oil as both war treasure and a tough instrument for showing American strength. Trump has spent years saying the U.S. should have claimed other nations’ oil during military operations in Syria, Libya, and Iraq, either to cover military expenses or to counter rivals’ power.

Key Takeaways: Wallet drainer phishing losses fell 83% in 2025, but attackers remain active and adaptive. Phishing spikes tracked market rallies, with Ethereum’s Q3 surge driving the year’s highest losses. Permit-based approvals and new EIP-7702 exploits remain key risks for users. The number of affected users also fell to about 106,000, marking a 68% year-over-year decrease, according to a new report from Web3 security platform Scam Sniffer . The findings point to a significant slowdown in one of crypto’s most persistent threats, with fewer victims and smaller aggregate losses, even as attackers continue to refine their methods. Crypto Phishing Losses Spike During Market Rallies, Report Warns Despite the steep decline, the report cautioned that phishing activity has not disappeared. Instead, losses tracked closely with broader market cycles. Periods of heightened onchain activity were followed by spikes in phishing incidents, while quieter markets saw losses ease. The third quarter of 2025, which coincided with Ethereum’s strongest rally of the year, recorded the highest losses at $31 million. August and September alone accounted for nearly 29% of total annual losses. Scam Sniffer described phishing as a “probability function of user activity,” noting that higher transaction volumes tend to increase the pool of potential victims. Monthly losses ranged from just $2.04 million in December, the calmest month, to $12.17 million in August, when trading activity peaked. Scam Sniffer 2025 Report is out! Crypto phishing losses dropped 83% — $494M → $83.85M, with 106K victims (-68%). But the threat followed the market: Q3 rally = highest losses. EIP-7702 exploitation emerged post-Pectra. Full report https://t.co/qziSEjiEVx — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) January 3, 2026 The largest single incident of the year involved a $6.5 million theft in September tied to a malicious Permit signature. Permit and Permit2 approvals remained the most effective tools for attackers, accounting for 38% of losses in cases exceeding $1 million. The data suggests that approval-based exploits continue to pose a major risk, particularly for users interacting with unfamiliar applications. The report also highlighted the emergence of new attack vectors. Following Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, attackers began abusing EIP-7702–based malicious signatures, which enable multiple harmful actions to be bundled into a single user approval. Two such incidents in August resulted in $2.54 million in losses, underscoring how quickly attackers adapt to protocol changes. Crypto Phishers Shift From Big Heists to Mass Retail Attacks Large-scale attacks became less frequent, with only 11 cases above $1 million in 2025, down from 30 the previous year. At the same time, attackers appeared to shift toward lower-value, higher-volume campaigns. The average loss per victim fell to $790, pointing to a broader focus on retail users rather than isolated, high-profile thefts. As reported, an attacker has siphoned funds from hundreds of crypto wallets across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)–compatible networks, draining small amounts from each address in what onchain investigator ZachXBT described as a broad, low-value operation. While individual losses were limited, typically under $2,000 per wallet, the incident’s scope points to a coordinated campaign rather than an isolated breach. Meanwhile, crypto-related losses from hacks and cybersecurity exploits fell sharply in December , dropping 60% month-on-month to about $76 million.

This Altcoin Is Poised For 500% Growth,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-next-big-crypto-under-0-045-this-altcoin-is-poised-for-500-growth/,"The markets tend to reward two things: timing and evidence. Most people miss one of them. They will purchase either too soon when no one starts to build anything or too late, when the move becomes overcrowded. When there is actual advancement on a project and yet priced like a new face, then that is the sweet spot. Some analysts think that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already entering that window at the moment. It remains below $0.045, but it is developing a working DeFi lending product. When that rollout takes off, market observers are saying that it may not be long before the difference between as quiet as a builder and as popular as watched. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a protocol of non custodial lending and borrowing. The core idea is simple. Individuals are providers of assets to generate yield. Overcollateralized loans are handed over to borrowers. The protocol regulates rates and safety guidelines in order to keep liquidity stable. Mutuum Finance is developing two complementary markets. The former one is pool based lending, commonly referred to as P2C. Depositors are depositing to common pools. Those pools supply liquidity to the borrowers. The rates are pegged to utilization which entails the extent to which the pool is borrowed. At times when there is plenty of liquidity, the rates would remain smaller. As liquidity becomes constrained, the rates increase to demand deposits and spur repayment. For example, if a pool is only 20% utilized, the supply APY could stay relatively low, such as 2% to 4%, since borrowing demand is light. If utilization rises toward 80% to 90%, borrowing demand becomes intense and supply APY can move higher, such as 8% to 12%, to attract more deposits and balance liquidity. In a simple USDT case, a depositor who supplies $1,000 at 3% APY would earn about $30 over a year, but if utilization pushes the supply APY to 10%, the same deposit could earn about $100 over a year, assuming rates stay near those levels. The second path is P2P. Direct consent of the terms can be agreed by the user. Under some circumstances, Mutuum Finance also stipulates variable rates and selling rates in stable rates borrowing. In most cases, stable-rate mortgages happen to be higher in the beginning as they provide predictability in repayment. The balancing can also be restored to steady rates when the situation in the market changes drastically. Presale Signals and Supply There has already been high participation. The Mutuum Finance shows that the project has raised $19.6M, 18,700 holders, and an approximate of 822M tokens sold. That is a significant portion of the Presale distribution already circulating in the market, which is capable of influencing the trading of the token when it reaches the visibility. Pricing is also shifted in an organized manner. In Phase 1 which started in early 2025, the Presale started at $0.01. It is now $0.04 in Phase 7. That is a 300% rise across phases. Mutuum Finance cites a formal launch at price 0.06, which would put Phase 1 purchasers within 500% of appreciation at the launch marker. One of the driving forces of demand is the stage system. Each of the stages is allocated a price and a fixed allocation. The stage will be sold more quickly when the demand is greater, and the price will increase to the following level. This is why MUTM is frequently encountered in case of the search for the most promising cheap crypto to buy today. The 500% Path Analysts Discuss Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also straining towards a definite point of V1 Protocol delivery . Officially, it will be prepared first on Sepolia testnet and then finalized on mainnet, timings being characterized as predicted to come soon. V1 consists of Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token and a Liquidator Bot, and the first assets to be lent, borrowed, and pledged are ETH and USDT. This is another reason analysts monitor this build because of security. Mutuum Finance states that it has a CertiK token scan score of 90/100 and has already undergone an independent audit of its V1 lending and borrowing protocol by Halborn. It has cited a $50k bug bounty as well. A 500% appreciation from $0.04 implies about $0.24. Some analysts argue that this is a realistic bullish scenario should two occurrences to this happen; V1 progress remains on schedule and post-launch demand grows with increased visibility and actual use.

According to the statement, the pair lost the funds after the criminals convinced them to invest in a fake crypto and stock trading platform. The Indian police mentioned that the criminals targeted the residents because of their age, noting that they had little or no knowledge about how crypto worked. The victims were just looking for ways to double their income and make profits, according to the police statement. The first victim filed a complaint alleging that he lost more than Rs. 2.58 crore ($310,000) to the criminals, while the second victim told the police that he lost Rs 63.15 lakh ($76,000) to criminals using the same format. Senior Indian citizens lose funds to fake crypto investment platforms According to the complaint filed by the first victim, he was approached by the administrator of a Telegram group after he found himself in a group that he identified as AP Helping Hand India. The administrator introduced himself as Aman Kumar, and he trades stock for a living. The victim claimed that the scammer told him he had several ways to help him make money, but promised to help him make high returns from cryptocurrency arbitrage. The victim claimed that after he agreed to invest, he paid an initial Rs. 8,500 or $100 registration fee in September 2025. After the payment, he was asked to download Base, a crypto wallet, through a link that was provided to him by the scammers. In addition, he was asked to share his personal and banking details before he began to invest using the application. The Indian police said that after he invested, the scammers took control of his account. In the statement released by the Indian police, they said the scammers claimed it was the only way they could help him maximize returns on his investments. Police mentioned that the account was operated by one of the fraudsters who claimed he was Ajit Doval, the profit distribution manager of the platform. After a while, the scammers showed the victim a fake dashboard which had an account balance of Rs. 4.55 crore or $5.48 million. Scammers are now targeting elderly victims The police mentioned that showing the big balance was a play the scammers run to force the victims into making bigger deposits. Between September 4 and December 27, the victim transferred more than Rs. 2.58 crore or $310,000 to the criminals for investments, taxes, and transaction charges. The problem started after he tried to make multiple withdrawals, and they all failed, even after he paid additional taxes to be able to withdraw the funds. The victim claimed he confronted the fraudsters after encountering issues with withdrawals, but they asked him to pay an additional Rs. 80 lakh or $96,000 to process the withdrawal. It was then that the victim realized he had been scammed and reported to the Rachakonda cybercrime police. The Indian police claimed they have filed a report under the relevant sections of the BNS along with Sections 66C and 66D of the IT Act. In the second case, the 69-year-old retired Bank manager lost more than Rs. 63.15 lakh or $76,000 after he was contacted by someone on WhatsApp claiming to be a stockbroker in the United States. Police said the victim was lured into registering on a fake portal and initially invested Rs. 13.56 lakh or $16,300.

Meanwhile, a longer term channel chart still shows Bitcoin holding its multi year uptrend into early 2026. Bitcoin rebounds from New Year dip as Venezuela headlines hit risk appetite Bitcoin climbed back above $91,000 by Jan. 4 after a sharp New Year pullback pushed prices into the $87,000 area on the Bitstamp 1 hour chart. Price later held near $91,243 at the Jan. 4, 08:03 UTC snapshot, after topping out just under $92,000 and then moving sideways. Bitcoin U.S. Dollar 1 Hour Price Chart: Source: CoinCodex First, Bitcoin traded choppy into Dec. 31, then it sold off into the turn of the year. However, buyers stepped in quickly, and the market began building higher lows through Jan. 1 and Jan. 2. As a result, the chart shows a steady grind higher that carried Bitcoin back through $89,000 and $90,000. Then, volatility spiked around Jan. 2 and Jan. 3, with wider candles and heavier bursts of volume. This swing lined up with broader risk off behavior after headlines tied to a U.S. attack involving Venezuela. Still, Bitcoin stabilized after the initial drop, and it resumed its climb into Jan. 4, when it pushed into the low $91,000s and paused near resistance. Bitcoin holds long term rising channel as price trends toward upper range Bitcoin continues to trade inside a multi year rising channel that has guided price action since the 2018 cycle, according to a long term BTCUSD index chart shared by Trending Bitcoin on X. The chart shows Bitcoin rebounding from the lower boundary of the channel near the mid $80,000 area and then resuming its broader upward structure into early 2026. Bitcoin U.S. Dollar 1 Day Index Long Term Rising Channel Chart. Source: Trending Bitcoin on X (AO btc analyst) First, the chart highlights repeated reactions along the channel’s lower trendline across multiple market cycles. Each major drawdown since 2019 found support near that rising base before price rotated higher. This pattern repeated again in late 2025, when Bitcoin briefly slipped toward the lower channel range before stabilizing and turning upward. Then, Bitcoin pushed back above the mid channel zone, where price had previously consolidated during earlier expansion phases. That region acted as a pivot area rather than a reversal point, as buyers defended pullbacks and prevented deeper breakdowns. As a result, the structure remained intact despite short term volatility. Finally, the chart projects Bitcoin trending toward the upper boundary of the channel over the longer horizon. While the blue projection extends well beyond current price levels, the key takeaway remains the same. Bitcoin continues to respect the rising channel that has defined its long term market structure, keeping the broader trend intact as of early 2026.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-04 09:34:56

ETH breaks descending channel on 12H chart The Ethereum–U.S. dollar pair pushed above the upper boundary of a descending channel that has guided price action since late summer. The breakout appeared on the 12-hour timeframe, where price also began to hold closer to the 50-period moving average. This move suggests sellers are losing control of the prior downtrend, at least in the near term. Ethereum U.S. Dollar 12H Bitstamp Descending Channel Breakout. Source: Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) Carter said the breakout confirms completion of the descending channel pattern. He pointed to follow-through buying after the move above trendline resistance as evidence of rising upward pressure. The chart shows Ethereum stabilizing above former channel resistance, which now acts as a short-term pivot area. Based on the updated structure, Carter outlined upside reference levels derived from prior congestion and volume zones. He identified $3,410 as the first target, followed by $3,770 and then $4,250 if momentum continues. These levels align with earlier resistance areas where price previously stalled during the broader decline. The analysis comes as Ethereum trades near the lower $3,000 range after weeks of consolidation. While the breakout shifts the immediate technical bias higher, continuation depends on whether price can sustain above the former channel boundary and nearby moving averages on subsequent candles. Ethereum ecosystem sets late 2025 transaction peak Ethereum-linked networks ended 2025 with a fresh high in transaction activity, as monthly counts climbed into year-end and extended a multi-quarter uptrend, according to a chart shared on X by analyst Leon Waidmann. The chart tracks monthly transactions across major Ethereum-connected chains and shows the combined total rising steadily through 2024 before accelerating into 2025. The final bars of 2025 reach the highest level on the display, which supports Waidmann’s claim that the ecosystem closed the year at an all-time high for transaction count. Most of the visible growth came from high-throughput networks tied to Ethereum’s scaling stack rather than Ethereum mainnet alone. In the legend, Base leads the last 30-day total, while Polygon PoS and Arbitrum also rank among the largest contributors. As activity broadened across these chains, the stacked bars thickened into late 2025, which indicates more transactions spread across several venues instead of a single-network spike. The right edge of the chart also shows a sharp increase heading into early 2026, with the highest cluster of bars packed into the most recent months. That shape signals that transaction demand remained elevated after the year-end peak, while the ecosystem’s growth stayed concentrated in rollups and other execution layers that settle back to Ethereum. Ethereum price path points higher into January Ethereum’s rebound from the mid-December low near $2,850 shifts the short-term bias upward. Price reclaimed the $3,000 level and then extended toward $3,100, which now acts as the nearest pivot. As long as Ether holds above this zone, the structure favors continued upside rather than a return to December lows. Ethereum Price USD, December 2025–January 2026. Source: CoinCodex The slope of the recent move suggests momentum is rebuilding after a prolonged consolidation phase. Higher lows formed into late December, and the early January push shows follow-through instead of a single spike. If this pattern persists, price can probe the $3,250 to $3,300 area, where selling pressure capped earlier rallies in December. The projected curve on the chart aligns with a continuation scenario rather than a sharp breakout. That implies gradual gains instead of a vertical move.

After three years of double-digit gains, financial experts say 2026 could be a lot different. The big stock indexes just finished their third straight year of impressive returns, but things are getting complicated. Many companies look overpriced, and the economy’s future isn’t as clear anymore. There are still good reasons to be upbeat, but some market watchers aren’t sure stocks can keep rising this fast. Experts warn the winning streak may be hard to match “We probably have an OK market, but certainly not what we’ve seen in the last couple years,” said Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide. The S&P 500 climbed 16% last year. A strong economy, fresh interest-rate cuts, and all the buzz around artificial intelligence pushed the benchmark to 39 new records in 2025. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13% while the Nasdaq composite jumped 20%. Big banks still think the party continues. Bank of America expects the S&P 500 to reach 7,100 by the end of this year—a 3.7% gain from where 2025 closed. JPMorgan Chase says 7,500. Goldman Sachs predicts 7,600. That kind of across-the-board confidence makes some investors nervous. The S&P 500 has surged roughly 80% from the start of 2023 through New Year’s Eve. That’s a crazy pace that’s tough to keep up under almost any circumstances. “It behooves investors to at least offer a little skepticism when there is such a broad consensus that everything will go well,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. This rally is getting old by Wall Street standards. If the S&P 500 rises in 2026 for a fourth year in a row, it would be the longest such streak since 2007, when the benchmark completed a five-year run. Looking back through the index’s history, there have only been five streaks of four or more consecutive years of gains, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The December jobs report is coming soon, which will give investors their next real look at how the economy’s doing. Big banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup, will also start reporting earnings in the next few weeks. Last year’s rally went way beyond stocks. Gold and silver had their best year since 1979. Bonds saw their best showing since 2020. Individual investors jumped back into speculation, creating a new class of meme stocks and driving options trading volumes to records again. Lower interest rates should help the market this year. The Federal Reserve penciled in one quarter-point cut for 2026, and some expect President Trump’s pick for the next Fed chair after Jerome Powell’s term expires in May will lean more dovish. Tax cuts are also poised to boost corporate coffers. Warning signs flash as prices climb too high But there are warning signs that prices have run up too far, too fast. Bitcoin finished last year below $88,000 after sliding more than 30% from its record above $126,000 set in early October. Many of the meme stocks that saw huge swings higher have come down just as quickly. Some analysts are concerned that the huge gains in artificial-intelligence stocks—which have fueled much of the market’s gains over the past three years—have limited room to run further. A lot of people believe AI will be transformative, but they worry the promised returns on multibillion-dollar investments between the major AI players will be difficult to realize. That could weigh on future gains. Valuations are looking rich. Companies in the S&P 500 are trading at 22 times their expected earnings over the next 12 months, above their 10-year average of 19 times. Around half of the valuation metrics for the S&P 500 tracked by Bank of America are higher than levels seen in March 2000, near when the dot-com bubble burst. Still, many expect the economy to hold up and provide fresh fuel for stocks. The U.S. economy stayed resilient last year despite Trump’s tariffs, persistent inflation, and immigration shocks. Americans kept spending, and businesses kept investing mammoth amounts in data centers and other critical parts of AI infrastructure. Corporate earnings growth is expected to stay robust. Analysts polled by FactSet expect companies in the S&P 500 to report a 15% jump in profits this year, which would mark the highest annual rate of growth since 2021. “The base case is one in which there is sufficient momentum in the economy,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Capital Management.

It helped it reclaim two crucial resistance-turned-support levels, and even surpassed Binance Coin in terms of market cap. Perhaps the most notable reason behind this impressive increase, including a 5% jump since yesterday to $2.07, is the overall market gains seen by numerous altcoins and bitcoin, even after the US attacked Venezuela and captured its leader. However, data from SoSoValue shows that there might be another reason behind XRP’s weekly increase. The spot XRP ETFs, which have been on a mind-blowing roll since the first one launched in mid-November, continue to be well in the green, attracting another $13.6 million on Friday. Thus, the total value of net inflows into the financial vehicles has neared $1.20 billion. With its price pump to almost $2.10, though, XRP has neared several key sell walls, which could provide immediate resistance and halt its progress. If the first one falls, the second is close by at $2.17, followed by another one at just over $2.25. $XRP has reached a sell wall.

Samsung Electronics CEO Roh Tae-moon and LG Electronics CEO Lyu Jae-cheol will make a pitch at the global CES 2026 event in Las Vegas this week. CES 2026 is expected to play host to some of the companies producing the largest consumer electronics. The exhibition is also scheduled to run from Monday to Friday, with industry participants following the event. Followers are also anticipating happenings at the event after both Samsung and LG recently announced the appointment of new leaders at the end of last year. Now, both leaders face mounting pressures to increase artificial intelligence (AI) transformations while improving profitability. Samsung and LG to make AI push at CES 2026 event in Las Vegas According to several sources , Roh is expected to be the keynote speaker at Samsung Electronics’ First Look event on Sunday, two days before the official opening of the event. The program will be held at a large exhibition space set up for Samsung at the Wynn Las Vegas, rather than its traditional venue at the Las Vegas Convention Center. The exhibition hall is one of the largest spaces at CES, spanning 4,628 square meters. The company is expected to showcase new products and technologies, host presentations and technology talks, and hold meetings with global partners as part of its event. At the main program, Samsung will present its vision of becoming an AI companion for everyday life. The exhibition space will be designed as an AI living platform, showcasing how Samsung’s TVs, mobile devices, and other home appliances can be connected seamlessly through artificial intelligence. Samsung’s choice to use a less crowded environment instead of the convention center stems from its choice to deliver a more immersive experience, according to the company statement. The company also plans to improve its guided tour programs to help visitors better understand its AI ecosystem. Roh was appointed as the CEO and head of Samsung’s Device Experience (DX) Division in November last year, and has talked about his dreams to transform the company through AI. LG Electronics to debut AI-powered home robot LG Electronics is also expected to draw its global crown as CEO Lyu delivers the keynote speech at the LG World Premiere on Monday. The annual event before CES will introduce the company’s vision and key technologies for this year. Its theme is set as “Innovation in Tune with You.” LG has plans to debut a home robot that can assist with chores. Unlike earlier AI assistant robots, this new model takes a human shape, with two arms and five fingers. The build will allow the robot to carry out carrying and other tasks. The robot will also function as the AI home hub and will support better interactions, such as responding to gestures. Lyu was promoted from the head of LG’s Home Appliance Solution business to CEO in November 2025, and has identified AI-powered homes and robotics as a way to grow future engines. He wants to use LG’s technological strengths and strategic partnerships to secure a competitive edge for the firm. However, both CEOs have some challenges to face before they achieve their aim. Samsung has been struggling with profitability in the home appliance business, while LG has posted back-to-back losses in straight quarters in its TV division. At the same time, Chinese firms like TCL and Hisense have been able to improve their global TV market share. During CES, Samsung and LG plan to counter their Chinese rivals by strengthening their premium TV lineups. Analysts have also noted that CES would serve as an important test for Roh and Lyu.

One project quietly standing out is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced low, structured smartly, and built around real defi crypto use cases, MUTM is starting to show early signs of being one of the fastest movers in its category as momentum builds during its presale journey. Early Entry Means Clear Advantage Currently valued at $0.040, the MUTM token is progressing through Phase 7 of its presale after starting at just $0.01. That move already reflects a 300% increase from the initial phase, achieved without hype cycles or speculative spikes. With a total supply capped at 4 billion tokens and 45.5% of that supply, or 1.82 billion tokens, allocated to presale participants, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is structured in a way that supports appreciation as demand grows. What is creating urgency is the project’s staggered pricing model. Each presale phase raises the token price by nearly 20%. That means buyers entering at Phase 7 are still securing a noticeably lower entry point compared to later phases. Someone purchasing MUTM at $0.040 secures more tokens for the same capital than someone entering Phase 9 at $0.05 or Phase 11 at $0.06. As the presale advances, the same investment amount will translate into fewer tokens, locking late entrants into a smaller upside window. The token remains discounted at this stage, and the gap between current buyers and future buyers continues to widen with every phase progression. Accessibility has also improved. Besides crypto, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has introduced card purchases with no limits, removing friction for new participants and making entry faster for those who want exposure without navigating complex swaps. A Practical DeFi Model Built for Real Use Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed to let users earn, borrow, and stay liquid without selling their crypto. The platform will operate using two distinct lending models that serve different asset types and risk profiles. The Peer-to-Contract model will focus on widely used assets such as stablecoins and well-known cryptocurrencies. In this model, lenders will pool assets like USDT, DAI, and other major coins into audited smart contracts. Borrowers will access these pools by providing overcollateralized assets. Interest rates will adjust automatically based on how much of each pool is being used. When demand for borrowing rises, rates increase, encouraging more deposits and maintaining balance within the system. Depositors in this model will receive mtTokens, which represent their share of the pool and grow in value as interest accrues. These mtTokens will also be usable as collateral, allowing users to unlock additional flexibility. A user lending $150,000 in USDT through the protocol will receive mtUSDT at a 1:1 ratio. With an average annual yield around 10%, driven by pool usage, that position will generate $15,000 in passive income over a year, all while remaining on-chain and transparent. Borrowers benefit as well. Someone holding $5,000 worth of ETH will be able to use it as collateral and borrow a portion of its value based on the assigned loan-to-value ratio. This approach provides liquidity without forcing the sale of long-term holdings, keeping exposure intact while unlocking usable funds. For higher-risk assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a Peer-to-Peer lending model. Tokens such as SHIB, and PEPE will be isolated from core liquidity pools. In this environment, lenders and borrowers will set terms directly, including rates and duration. While this model carries more risk, it also offers higher return opportunities, all while protecting the stability of the main protocol. Upcoming Protocol Launch Will Pull Investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced via its official X channel that the V1 release of its protocol is set to go live on the Sepolia Testnet in the near term. This initial rollout will introduce the platform’s core functionality, including the liquidity pool, mtToken and debt token systems, and an automated liquidator bot designed to protect collateral positions and ensure stable protocol operations. At this stage, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. Launching V1 on the testnet gives the community early access to explore the protocol ahead of the mainnet launch. This structured rollout improves transparency, encourages early participation, and allows the development team to gather real-world feedback for optimization. As user activity increases, overall interest in the ecosystem may strengthen, supporting sustained confidence and long-term demand for the MUTM token. Road to $1: Utility, Security, and Community-Driven Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built with long-term utility at its core. Its smart contracts have already undergone a full security audit by Halborn in November 2025. The assessment identified six issues, including one high-severity item, all of which were resolved before completion. Halborn confirmed full remediation, reinforcing confidence as the protocol moves toward testnet deployment and beyond. Unlike projects driven purely by speculation, project ties MUTM demand directly to platform activity. Lending, borrowing, staking, and buyback mechanisms will all rely on MUTM usage. As on-chain activity grows, token circulation increases organically rather than through artificial incentives. Future expansion includes an over-collateralized stablecoin system. Users will be able to mint a decentralized $1-pegged asset by locking approved collateral such as ETH or SOL. Every mint and repayment will create transactional demand within the ecosystem, adding another layer of real utility tied to MUTM. The protocol will also support stable interest rates for selected assets. Borrowers choosing this option will lock predictable repayment costs at a higher starting rate, balancing certainty with system safety. Rebalancing mechanisms will protect liquidity if market conditions shift sharply, ensuring fairness for all participants. All loans will remain overcollateralized, and a stability factor will trigger liquidation when thresholds are breached, preventing bad debt from spreading. Community growth is already a strong pillar. With over 12,000 followers on Twitter, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $100K giveaway where ten winners receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. The live dashboard allows users to track holdings and calculate ROI, while the Top 50 leaderboard rewards the largest participants with bonus tokens. A daily incentive now grants $500 in MUTM to the top contributor every 24 hours, resetting at 00:00 UTC and encouraging consistent engagement. Conclusion As the market shifts toward substance after the crypto crash, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a defi crypto project built on structure, security, and real demand. With its presale still in Phase 7, a disciplined pricing model, and expanding utility, MUTM is shaping up as a low-priced asset showing early signs of rapid movement toward higher valuations. For those watching timing closely, the current phase represents a narrowing window before the next price step locks in.

Public Integrity In Focus According to reporting, a newly created Polymarket account placed roughly $32,500 in bets on a contract that asked whether Maduro would be out of power by January 31, 2026. That stake bought about 438,000 shares when the market price was as low as $0.07 per share late Friday.

Social media users and some investors flagged the purchase as suspicious because it came hours before the public announcement. Observers noted that prediction markets can move quickly on small flows of information, and that enforcement rules vary across platforms. Reports note that other markets, like Kalshi, had priced similar outcomes at roughly $0.13, underlining how unexpected the outcome was to many traders. A newly created Polymarket account invested over $30,000 yesterday in Maduro’s exit. The US then took Maduro into custody overnight, and the trader profited $400,000 in less than 24 hours.

The draft language aims to make it unlawful for covered government figures to trade on contracts tied to government actions or political events when they possess nonpublic information because of their official roles. The measure would also task regulators with clarifying which platforms are covered and how violations would be enforced. Market Reaction And Questions Platform operators have long said their terms forbid trading on material nonpublic information, but critics say those rules are hard to police in real time.

56803742,https://timestabloid.com/?p=93994,1767520934,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: XRP Ready to Ride to Valhalla. 2026 Moonshot Is Already Here,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-ready-to-ride-to-valhalla-2026-moonshot-is-already-here/,"Recent market activity surrounding XRP has caught the eye of crypto analyst Xaif Crypto, who, in a post, highlighted a decisive upward move on short-term charts. The technical structure presented shows XRP trading near the $1.95 level after pushing above recent intraday resistance, with price action holding close to the session high. The move occurred alongside expanding volume, reinforcing the view that buyers are actively supporting the trend rather than relying on thin liquidity. The chart shared by the analyst reflects a clear bullish configuration across multiple exponential moving averages. Shorter-term averages have surpassed longer-term ones, while price remains comfortably above all key indicators. This alignment typically reflects strengthening momentum and growing confidence among market participants. The sequence of higher lows and higher highs further supports the assessment that XRP is currently in a continuation phase rather than a short-lived reactionary bounce. Well, well, well… The 2026 moonshot is already here. $XRP Ready to ride to Valhalla. pic.twitter.com/JbSbMPQGNR — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) January 2, 2026 Momentum Builds as Volume Confirms the Move Volume dynamics play a central role in the analyst’s assessment. Trading activity increased notably during the upward impulse, suggesting that the move was backed by participation rather than speculative spikes. This matters because sustained trends generally require consistent inflows to remain intact. The combination of rising volume and firm price structure reinforces the interpretation that XRP is transitioning into a more constructive market phase. At the time of the observation, XRP briefly tested levels just below $2 before consolidating, indicating that the market is actively evaluating this price zone. Holding above prior resistance levels converts those zones into potential support, which can be significant if momentum persists. Exchange Supply Decline Adds Structural Context In response to the chart, an X user pointed to the historically low level of XRP held on exchanges, describing it as the lowest seen in eight years. This observation aligns with broader on-chain data trends reported in recent months. Independent data referenced in coverage by Times Tabloid, citing Cointelegraph’s analysis, shows that XRP balances on centralized exchanges have fallen sharply to approximately 1.6 billion tokens. As recently as October, exchange balances were approximately 3.76 billion, highlighting the scale and speed of the contraction. This reduction reflects a sustained movement of XRP away from trading platforms , limiting the amount readily available for immediate sale. While a lower exchange supply does not guarantee price appreciation, it changes how the market responds to demand. With fewer tokens accessible, buying pressure can have a more pronounced impact when it emerges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ETFs and Market Structure Implications The supply dynamic is further influenced by the launch of multiple XRP exchange-traded funds . These products require direct backing with XRP, meaning inflows translate into tokens being removed from active circulation. Unlike short-term trading demand, ETF-related accumulation introduces steady, non-speculative pressure on supply. When declining exchange balances are combined with consistent institutional absorption, the overall market structure tightens. This backdrop provides important context to the technical strength highlighted by Xaif Crypto. Together, the chart structure and on-chain trends suggest that XRP’s current move is not occurring in isolation but within a broader shift in availability and demand dynamics.

Before implementing this move, it had alerted its users of this intention in a statement published on December 31, 2025. Notably, the firm adopted this decision the same year it received approval to begin its operations in the country. This sudden decision prompted reporters to contact the firm’s representatives for comment. The spokespersons claimed that they had embraced this move after conducting a review of their performance in the local markets. They added that, “This is a thoughtful pause that allows us to rethink and improve our strategy so we can come back with a stronger and more sustainable product.” Coinbase decides to halt its operation in Argentina In Argentina, Coinbase focused on key aspects of its regional plans in 2024, developing strategies to enter the market effectively. In January 2025, the company officially announced the launch of its local operations. Following the current situation, several individuals raised concerns about Coinbase’s sudden decision, with the main question raised in the ecosystem being, “What does this current pause mean?” In an attempt to answer this question, Coinbase released a statement intended for its users in Argentina. The statement noted that users in the country will no longer be able to access the exchange to purchase or sell the stablecoin USDC using Argentine pesos, the local currency, beginning January 31, 2026. However, it did not disclose the reason behind this decision. Another thing that the exchange unveiled was that cryptocurrency transactions, such as sending and receiving, will still be accessible to users. To silence the controversy raised in the ecosystem, Coinbase informed the press that it still values Argentina as a crucial market for new ideas. Following this claim, the firm made it clear its intentions to revive its operations in the nation in the future with an enhanced user experience. The Coinbase team asserted that they seek to achieve their firm’s goal of improving economic freedom by linking the world through blockchain technology. With this goal in mind, Latin America remains a key area of focus. As discussions continued among individuals, several analysts weighed in on the situation. They pointed out that although Coinbase adopted this move, the decision comes at a time when Argentina has solidified its position as a hub for cryptocurrencies. To support this claim, reports indicate that both local and global firms have recently shown a heightened interest in the Argentine market. For instance, Ripio launched the local peso-pegged stablecoin. Nexo, on the other hand, acquired the Buenbit exchange as part of its long-standing aim to expand. An unexpected power outage in Argentina raises concerns among individuals Apart from Coinbase, reports revealed that Bitfarms , a popular Bitcoin mining firm, also halted its Bitcoin mining operations in Argentina, based in Rio Cuarto. The company alleged that the reason behind this decision was an unexpected power outage from its local energy supplier. This information was published in Bitfarms’ earnings report for the first quarter. In this report, the firm noted that the power supply interruption began on May 12. It resulted from Generación Mediterránea S.A. (GMSA), the company responsible for providing this electricity supply to Bitfarms in Argentina. The outage occurred shortly after GMSA notified Bitfarms regarding matters related to a financial reorganization process with creditors. At this particular moment, sources highlighted that the team initially vowed to continue offering power supply to the mining company. Meanwhile, Bitfarms argued that this interruption has caused growing uncertainties concerning when or if power will be restored. Due to these uncertainties, the firm began exploring various alternatives to support operations at the facility. It is worth noting that Bitfarms’ operations in Argentina generated approximately $6.9 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2025. This figure contributed approximately 10% of the firm’s total revenue, which amounted to $66.8 million during this period. In their report, Bitfarms stated that this outage incident left them with no other choice but to halt their cryptocurrency mining operations based in Argentina. After making this claim, the company warned that this situation could significantly impact their operations if not resolved.

BTC Eyes $92K After closing 2025 as the first post-halving year in the red, bitcoin began 2026 on the right foot and quickly surged from $88,000 to almost $91,000 on Friday. It faced an immediate rejection there on Saturday morning when reports about explosions in Venezuela’s capital went live and slipped to $89,300. Interestingly, BTC started to regain traction once the US confirmed it carried out a successful military mission in Venezuela and captured its president. Hours later, after Trump addressed the nation, bitcoin climbed even further and neared $92,000 earlier this morning for the first time since mid-December. It was stopped there, but still trades above $91,000, which represents a 4.2% weekly increase. For now, its market capitalization has surged to $1.825 trillion.

In this context, the cryptocurrency is showing signs of a significant price move as it continues to compress within a well-defined symmetrical triangle on the four-hour chart, a structure that often precedes sharp volatility. According to market analysis highlighted by Ali Martinez in an X post on January 4, the ongoing consolidation points to a potential breakout of around 15%, bringing a decisive move into focus for traders and investors. The outlook indicates that the asset is trading within a tightening range, reflecting declining volatility and growing market indecision, conditions that typically resolve with a strong directional move once the price breaks out. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ali Martinez The upper resistance trendline currently caps price action just below the $91,000–$92,000 zone, while rising support has held above the $86,800 area. A confirmed breakout above the descending resistance would imply a measured move of roughly 15%, placing Bitcoin near or above the psychologically important $100,000 level. Such a move would likely be reinforced by momentum traders re-entering the market after the prolonged consolidation period. Conversely, a breakdown below the ascending support would open the door to a corrective move toward the low $80,000s, though current price action favors an upside test. Bitcoin moves past $90,000 It is worth noting that Bitcoin rallied above the $91,000 mark on Sunday as risk appetite improved across the broader cryptocurrency market , extending the early 2026 rebound in major digital assets. The advance was fueled in part by a sharp liquidation event that flushed out crowded positions and reset near-term leverage. Roughly $180 million in futures positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours, with short positions accounting for about $133 million. This imbalance suggests many traders were positioned against the move, triggering forced buybacks as prices climbed. Geopolitical developments also contributed to the rally. Fast-moving headlines out of Venezuela added to market volatility and encouraged risk-taking, reinforcing the upward push in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $91,460, up about 2% over the past 24 hours. On a weekly basis, BTC is up more than 4%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold As things stand, Bitcoin is trading above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ), with the price around $91,555 compared with the 50-day SMA near $90,018, indicating that short- to medium-term momentum remains constructive. However, the price remains well below the 200-day SMA at roughly $99,664, suggesting the broader trend has yet to fully turn bullish and that overhead resistance remains significant. The 14-day RSI stands at 56.48, placing Bitcoin in neutral territory. This reading reflects modest upside momentum without signs of overbought conditions, implying room for further gains if buying pressure strengthens, though not yet enough conviction to signal a strong trend continuation.

A convergence of corporate moves, institutional accumulation, regulatory developments, and shifting market structure has thrust Bitcoin back into the spotlight, reaffirming its role as the bellwether of the digital asset market. Several major developments are driving the surge in Bitcoin chatter. Bitfarms’ decision to sell a Paraguay mining site for up to $30 million highlights strategic capital reallocation as miners adapt to post-halving economics and rising cost pressures. Meanwhile, Tether has become the fifth-largest Bitcoin holder, amassing roughly $8.42 billion in BTC, underscoring growing institutional-scale confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset. Regulatory and market infrastructure shifts are further fueling Bitcoin’s momentum. South Korea’s largest crypto exchange is reportedly laying the groundwork for Bitcoin ETFs, even as regulatory approvals lag, underscoring mounting global pressure to fold Bitcoin into mainstream financial products. In the U.S., spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows of $348 million toward the end of 2025. While seemingly bearish, analysts view these flows as routine portfolio rebalancing rather than a weakening of long-term conviction in Bitcoin. Price action and trading dynamics are further fueling the hype. Bitcoin has seen sharp intraday swings, surging trading volumes, and heightened options activity, especially around major contract expiries that tend to amplify short-term volatility. With BTC trading near $91,428, market momentum remains firmly in focus. On X, formerly Twitter, discourse is dominated by Bitcoin’s recent performance, increasingly bullish 2026 outlooks, narratives of institutional accumulation, and comparisons with traditional assets like gold and equities, reinforcing an overall strongly bullish market sentiment. Beyond Bitcoin, several altcoins are capturing market attention. PEPE (PEPE) is surging with volatile price swings and skyrocketing trading volumes typical of meme-driven tokens. Ethereum (ETH) hovers near $3,000, buoyed by institutional inflows, active smart contract deployment, and strong network activity. Dogecoin (DOGE) dominates social chatter, with debates over its market performance and long-term potential. Solana (SOL) trends on discussions of staking, ecosystem growth, and its role as a high-performance blockchain. Conclusion Bitcoin top weekend discussions, driven by major institutional moves, regulatory shifts, and heightened volatility, while the broader crypto market balances speculation with innovation. Altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, PEPE, and Dogecoin attract attention through network activity and social momentum, but Bitcoin remains the key market barometer. This weekend’s trends suggest that, despite short-term swings, strong investor interest and strategic positioning could set the stage for a bullish start to 2026, highlighting both opportunities and risks in an interconnected crypto ecosystem.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-04 10:34:30

Este tipo de decisiones suele aparecer… pic.twitter.com/FCa5YfAzQ3 — Criptolawyer (@criptolawyer) December 31, 2025 Rapid Expansion Followed by Swift Contraction Coinbase launched operations in Argentina on January 28, 2025, after receiving approval from the National Securities Commission (CNV) to operate as a Virtual Asset Service Provider. The exchange appointed Matías Alberti, an experienced fintech professional from companies such as Buenbit and Clara, to lead regional operations, with regulatory compliance and security as core priorities. Argentina was seen as a compelling market opportunity at the time, with economic challenges such as high inflation and currency volatility driving widespread crypto adoption. A Coinbase study particularly revealed that 87% of Argentinians viewed cryptocurrency as a path to financial independence, while 79% expressed openness to receiving salaries in digital assets. This, the study shows, makes the country six times more likely to use crypto daily than the average Latin American nation. The exchange’s optimistic market entry coincided with Argentina expanding crypto investment opportunities through CNV approval of U.S. exchange-traded funds, including Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs under the CEDEAR program, ending a six-year prohibition under Law No. 27440. Political Scandal Reshapes Argentina’s Crypto Landscape Coinbase’s withdrawal follows devastating political fallout from the Libra meme coin scandal that erupted in February 2025 when President Javier Milei endorsed the Solana-based token on social media. The coin surged from fractions of a cent to over $4.50 within hours before collapsing by more than 96%, with losses estimated at between $100 million and $251 million, after what investigators described as a classic pump-and-dump scheme. Argentina’s federal court froze over $507,000 in assets belonging to U.S. businessman Hayden Davis and two crypto operators as part of an expanding fraud investigation that drew links to Milei’s inner circle. Argentina freezes $507K in $Libra Meme Coin case connected to President @JMilei , suspecting indirect payments to officials. #Libra #Argentina #memecoin . https://t.co/T7aFM5svOP — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 11, 2025 Prosecutors traced transactions and alleged that intermediaries converted crypto into fiat for Davis and Argentine lobbyists Mauricio Novelli and Manuel Terrones Godoy, with one key transfer of $507,500 occurring just 42 minutes after Milei posted a selfie with Davis. Argentina’s lower house voted 128-93 in April 2025 to launch a congressional investigation summoning Economy Minister Luis Caputo, Justice Minister Mariano Cúneo Libarona, and National Securities Commission head Roberto Silva to examine potential misconduct surrounding the token’s promotion and collapse. Despite political turbulence that dropped Milei’s approval rating from 47.3% to 41.6%, his pro-crypto party, La Libertad Avanza, scored a surprise victory in Argentina’s midterm elections, winning 40.68% of the national vote. Broader Strategic Shift Amid Regulatory Uncertainty The discontinuation of peso trading comes as Argentina’s central bank reportedly weighs regulations that would allow traditional banks to offer crypto trading and custody services, potentially approved around April 2026, according to local exchanges. While Coinbase is drawing back from the country, it is growing in other countries and verticals. Earlier this month, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced an “ everything exchange ” strategy for 2026, combining crypto, equities, prediction markets, and commodities globally while partnering with federally regulated platform Kalshi for event-based markets. Coinbase’s decision to maintain crypto trading while exiting peso operations suggests the exchange might be repositioning for regulatory changes rather than abandoning the Argentine market entirely. However, some users and the community have criticized the action, with the lead DevRel at Talent Protocol calling the move “ wild .” Coinbase removing the option to buy USDC for Argentinians is wild.

56805350,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=888697,1767524159,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56805350.jpeg,"Dubai hands woman two months jail time, $1M penalty over crypto wallet theft",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dubai-jails-woman-crypto-wallet-scam/,"A Dubai court has sentenced a woman to two months in jail with an additional fine payment after she was found guilty of a crypto wallet scam. According to news sources, the woman secretly swapped a cryptocurrency wallet during a business meeting in Dubai, defrauding an investor of digital assets worth about $1 million. Court records revealed that the woman carried out the act discreetly while the meeting was ongoing in order not to arouse suspicion. It claimed that she secretly replaced a hardware wallet containing private key information with another identical device that she had prepared before attending the meeting. The crypto wallet swap enabled the digital assets contained in the wallet to be transferred to another wallet without the knowledge of the owner. Dubai court jails woman for crypto wallet theft According to reports, the incident occurred after the victim was introduced to a man who claimed to own an investment company and expressed interest in financing a business project. After protracted investment discussions, the man asked the investor to show proof of financial capability before finalizing agreements. This meant that the man asked the investor to demonstrate if he had the needed funds to complete the business project, noting that the investor had to show a substantial amount in crypto. A verification meeting was agreed to by both parties, and it was arranged in Dubai to complete the process. The man failed to attend the meeting, noting that something urgent came up at the last minute. However, he assured the investor that his wife would attend the meeting and oversee everything he needed to on his behalf. According to investigators, the woman attended the meeting in Dubai, and while handling the verification procedure, swapped the genuine wallet and replaced it with a similar-looking device. The investor discovered later that his digital assets had been transferred to another party and reported it to the police. The authorities kick-started their criminal investigation and referred the case to the Dubai Misdemeanours and Infractions Court after its finalization. The court convicted the woman of theft and sentenced her to two months in prison. In addition, she was also asked to pay a fine worth the value of the stolen assets at the time of the offense. Finally, the court also ordered her deportation from the UAE. The court orders $1 million in compensation to the victim The woman took the case to the Dubai Court of Appeals, which upheld the initial criminal ruling. Following the criminal judgment, the investor filed a civil lawsuit seeking compensation for financial losses and profits lost to the theft. He argued that the value of the stolen digital asset had increased after the woman stole his assets. The civil court ruled in his favor and ordered the defendant to pay Dh. 4.3 million ($1,170,768) in compensation. In addition, she was ordered to pay 5% annual legal interest until a full repayment is made. The court mentioned that digital assets are recognized as financial properties under the law and are protected. The woman’s husband, who was identified as a key participant in the scheme, has since absconded and remains at large. The case highlights growing legal recognition of digital assets in the UAE, as well as the serious consequences of fraud involving digital assets . Meanwhile, analysts have called on crypto holders to store their digital assets using the best techniques. The call came after Chainalysis released a report mentioning that the UAE was responsible for the highest crypto loss per person. The report mentioned that each victim of crypto theft in the UAE has lost approximately Dh. 293, 600 ($80,00). In addition, they also advised traders to strengthen their passwords, implement two-factor authentication, and be wary of phishing scams . The report mentioned that victims in the US came second, followed by victims in Chile, India, Lithuania, Japan, Israel, Norway, and Germany.

56805351,https://bitzo.com/2026/01/brand-visibility-in-the-age-of-ai-a-new-framework-for-crypto-pr,1767524178,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/56805351.jpeg,Brand Visibility in the Age of AI: A New Framework for Crypto PR,https://bitzo.com/2026/01/brand-visibility-in-the-age-of-ai-a-new-framework-for-crypto-pr,"Public relations has always been about one thing: getting seen. For years, that meant strong search rankings, backlinks, and coverage in major media outlets. If your brand showed up on Google and in top publications, visibility was considered a job well done. Generative AI systems, from Google’s AI Overviews to ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity, are rapidly becoming the first place people go for answers. Instead of clicking through links, users increasingly consume AI-generated summaries. As a result, how brands are discovered and which brands are mentioned at all is changing fundamentally. Outset PR, a data-driven crypto PR agency, has been tracking this transition closely and has launched a new service, PR for GenAI Discovery , designed to help brands appear not just in search results, but inside AI-generated answers themselves. From SEO to AIO Search engine optimization (SEO) once defined digital visibility. The objective was straightforward: rank on page one, ideally in the top three results. Today, audience behavior tells a different story. AI assistants are rapidly gaining ground: Usage of AI chat tools has surged by more than 80% year over year, surpassing 55 billion visits, while growth in traditional search traffic has largely stalled. AI-generated summaries are becoming standard on Google: Research indicates that roughly 13–18% of queries now trigger AI Overviews that appear at the very top of search results. User clicks on organic links are declining: When AI Overviews are present, engagement with traditional search results drops sharply, with click-through rates falling from around 15% to approximately 8%. The takeaway is clear: traditional SEO alone is no longer enough. As AI Overviews increasingly mediate discovery, visibility now depends on whether AI systems can recognize, interpret, and surface your brand. In other words, visibility can disappear at the moment it matters most if your brand’s story is not designed to be recognized and cited by AI systems. How Generative AI Actually Surfaces Brands Unlike search engines, large language models (LLMs) do not rank pages in real time. Instead, they generate answers based on patterns learned from large volumes of trusted, frequently referenced content. In practice, AI systems tend to rely on: High-authority media outlets Repeated syndication across trusted aggregators Clear, consistent brand descriptors Structured, factual, and easily extractable content A single high-profile article is often not enough. Fragmented messaging or inconsistent positioning can lead to AI-generated answers that are incomplete or exclude a brand entirely. GenAI Discovery is about ensuring that when AI systems summarize a topic, your brand becomes part of the default answer. Why This Shift Matters Especially for Crypto PR Crypto audiences are early adopters by nature. They are already using AI assistants for: Token research Project comparisons Ecosystem overviews Market and protocol explanations Increasingly, these users bypass traditional search results altogether. Outset PR has observed a clear pattern: AI systems consistently draw signals from syndication-ready crypto outlets and aggregators. Placements that appear across multiple distribution networks are far more likely to be absorbed, reinforced, and reproduced by AI models. For example, content that propagates through ecosystems like Binance Square tends to surface repeatedly in AI-generated summaries not because of a single article, but because of cumulative authority signals. This insight underpins Outset PR’s Syndication Map , a proprietary dataset and analysis method that identifies high-leverage outlets, predicts amplification paths, and helps structure content for maximum AI readability and reuse. What GenAI-Optimized PR Looks Like in Practice To improve visibility in AI-generated results, PR strategy must evolve beyond traditional tactics. 1. Clarity and Structure AI systems favor content that mirrors how people ask questions. Clear headlines, logical subheadings, and concise explanations significantly increase extractability. 2. Authority Through Syndication Credibility is reinforced through repetition across trusted sources. Strategic syndication matters more than isolated Tier-1 hits. 3. Consistent Brand Context Brand names, project descriptions, and positioning statements must be uniform. Consistency ensures AI systems associate the correct attributes with the brand. 4. AI-Friendly Content Formats Beyond press releases, formats like FAQs, Q&A interviews, explainers, and data-driven articles are especially effective — because they map directly to how AI constructs answers. Summing up: Traditional Crypto PR vs. GenAI-Aware PR Traditional Crypto PR GenAI-Aware PR Prioritizes logo prestige and brand-name publications Prioritizes syndication networks and AI-trusted sources Optimizes for backlinks and domain authority Optimizes for extractability and AI comprehension Measures success by coverage volume and impressions Measures success by AI mentions, summaries, and narrative accuracy Treats placements as isolated wins Designs coverage for cumulative reinforcement Focuses on search rankings and referral traffic Focuses on AI-generated answers and summaries Relies on one-off Tier-1 hits Builds repeat exposure across distribution ecosystems Assumes humans are the primary readers Assumes AI is the first interpreter Messaging can vary by outlet Messaging is intentionally consistent across channels Press releases are the core asset FAQs, explainers, Q&As, and data-led content are core assets Evaluates impact shortly after publication Tracks long-term narrative persistence in AI systems The fundamentals of public relations have mostly stayed the same in its core but the mechanism of discovery has changed. Traditional crypto PR was built for search engines and human readers. GenAI-aware PR is designed for machines that summarize, rank, and recommend information on behalf of those readers, making the difference structural rather than conceptual. Outset PR: Built for the AI Era Landing coverage in publications like Cointelegraph or Forbes still plays an important role in building credibility. But heading into 2026, those wins alone no longer define visibility. Outset PR is helping Web3 brands adapt to this reality by developing PR strategies designed for GenAI discovery. The agency is already building its campaigns with GenAI visibility as a core principle. By combining media intelligence, syndication-first distribution, and content structures optimized for AI comprehension, Outset PR helps brands become reliable reference points in AI-generated answers.

The move reflects a broader reassessment of where mining companies deploy capital as they balance volatile crypto prices with rising energy and infrastructure demands. By monetising assets in South America, Bitfarms is bringing forward cash flows that were previously expected years down the line. The proceeds are set to be redirected into new energy infrastructure tied to high-performance computing and artificial intelligence in North America, a segment the company sees as offering stronger long-term returns. Paraguay site sale The company has agreed to sell its Paso Pe facility in Paraguay to the Sympatheia Power Fund, managed by Singapore-based Hawksburn Capital. The transaction values the site at up to $30 million and is subject to customary closing conditions. Bitfarms expects the deal to close within the next 60 days. Under the terms, Bitfarms will receive $9 million upfront. The remaining consideration of up to $21 million will be paid over the following 10 months, depending on the achievement of specific payment milestones. This structure allows the company to secure immediate liquidity while retaining exposure to near-term value from the asset. Capital redeployment Rather than reinvesting in additional mining capacity in Latin America, Bitfarms plans to channel the proceeds into North American energy infrastructure linked to HPC and AI workloads. Management has indicated that this approach effectively accelerates two to three years of anticipated free cash flows from operations. Those funds are expected to be redeployed during 2026, aligning with the company’s broader push to diversify beyond traditional bitcoin mining. The strategy highlights a growing trend among listed miners to explore adjacent computing markets that can offer steadier revenue streams. By reallocating capital, Bitfarms aims to improve returns on invested capital while reducing exposure to regions it no longer views as central to its long-term plans. Latin America exit The Paso Pe transaction completes Bitfarms’ withdrawal from Paraguay following an earlier divestment in the country. Just under a year ago, the company sold its Yguazú site to Hive Digital Technologies. Together, the two sales signal a full exit from Latin American operations. For Bitfarms, the decision underscores a strategic narrowing of focus. The company is prioritising jurisdictions and assets that can support both crypto mining and next-generation computing, rather than maintaining a broad international footprint. Market reaction The announcement adds to a wave of strategic repositioning among listed bitcoin miners as they reassess capital allocation amid shifting energy economics and rising interest in alternative compute uses. By accelerating cash realisation from legacy mining assets, Bitfarms is seeking greater flexibility to fund infrastructure that supports both digital asset mining and broader compute demand, reducing reliance on a single revenue stream.

56805780,653422,1767524412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56805780.jpeg,Bitcoiners Celebrate ‘Genesis Day’ As US Debt Swells Past $38 Trillion,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoiners-celebrate-genesis-day-as-us-debt-swells-past-38-trillion/,"The US federal debt passed $38 trillion on January 3, 2026, according to Treasury tracking. That new milestone was reached as some in the cryptocurrency community observed Genesis Day, the anniversary of Bitcoin’s first block. Reports note the timing drew attention because it highlighted contrasts between public borrowing and Bitcoin’s fixed supply. Debt Hits New High According to Treasury figures , the gross federal debt climbed past $38 trillion on January 3. The rise has been sharp over the last two years, moving from about $34 trillion in early 2024 to roughly $36 trillion by late 2024, and then at $38.5 trillion in late 2025. Analysts have calculated that the debt has been increasing by roughly $6 billion per day recently, a pace that pushes interest costs higher and narrows options for future budgets. Some of the increase comes from continuing budget shortfalls where spending outstrips revenue. On 3 January 2009, the Bitcoin network launched with the mining of its first block, known as the Genesis Block. Embedded in that block was a headline from @TheTimes newspaper: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” The message permanently anchors Bitcoin’s origin… pic.twitter.com/hGozJOYd3I — Bitcoin Policy UK (@bitcoinpolicyuk) January 3, 2026 Drivers Behind The Surge According to market coverage , several factors are behind the jump: sustained annual deficits, increasing interest payments on existing debt, and large spending bills enacted in recent sessions of Congress. Debt held by the public and amounts owed to federal trust funds together make up the headline figure. Economists warn that as the debt grows relative to the size of the economy, more taxpayer dollars will be needed just to service interest payments, which could crowd out other priorities. Bitcoin Community Responds On January 3, many Bitcoin supporters marked Genesis Day, a date they view as symbolic of financial change when Bitcoin’s first block was mined in 2009. Some users posted about the contrast between a national debt that keeps climbing and Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins. Others used the anniversary to elevate broader questions about fiscal rules and money supply. The reactions were mixed; some view it as a warning, others saw it as a moment for commemoration. Investors and commentators have weighed the implications. A portion of the market treats scarce assets like Bitcoin and gold as hedges against what they view as the risks of heavy borrowing. At the same time, mainstream economists caution that running large and persistent deficits can raise borrowing costs and slow growth over the long run. Treasury officials monitor cash needs closely and sometimes change borrowing schedules to cover gaps between receipts and outlays.

A single viral post was enough to trigger liquidations, spike volume, and reignite speculation around the token’s longer-term prospects. This content is delivered by Outset PR , where crypto-native communication meets data-driven intelligence. Viral Tweet Sparks Liquidation-Driven Rally The rally coincided with PEPE’s official account posting “We ride at dawn,” a message that quickly spread across social platforms. The surge in attention translated directly into market activity, triggering approximately $2.65 million in short liquidations and pushing daily trading volume to around $805 million. With 83% of liquidations on January 2 coming from short positions, the move was largely mechanical. Bearish traders were forced to buy back PEPE, amplifying upside pressure in a short time frame. Momentum Without Fundamentals While the price action was strong, the underlying structure remains fragile. PEPE does not offer fundamental utility, revenue mechanisms, or protocol-driven demand. Its price behavior continues to rely almost entirely on sentiment, virality, and speculative positioning. This makes rallies highly sensitive to shifts in social attention. As quickly as momentum can build, it can fade once engagement slows or traders rotate capital into the next narrative. Whale Concentration Adds Risk Another structural factor shaping PEPE’s outlook is supply concentration. A whale-dominated distribution increases volatility and raises the risk of abrupt reversals if large holders take profits. In such environments, retail-driven hype often supports price temporarily but struggles to sustain longer-term trends. Without broader utility or ecosystem growth, PEPE remains exposed to sharp swings driven by positioning rather than adoption.

Its analytical model makes every step verified by performance insights. Its boutique approach ensures campaigns feel like they’ve been built inside your team. For crypto, blockchain, or AI enterprises that need clarity and velocity—this is what PR should feel like. PEPE’s Key Technical Levels From a technical perspective, the $0.0000056 Fibonacci level stands out as a critical threshold. A clean break and sustained hold above this level would help validate bullish continuation targets and suggest momentum is extending beyond a short squeeze. Failure to hold higher levels, however, would likely shift focus back to the $0.00000420 support zone. A retracement toward this area would reinforce the view that the recent surge was sentiment-driven rather than structural. Outlook PEPE’s 26% rally highlights how quickly meme coins can move when social momentum aligns with crowded positioning. Short liquidations and viral engagement can generate explosive gains, but they do not resolve the absence of fundamental demand. Whether PEPE can emerge as a leading meme coin in 2026 depends on its ability to sustain attention and technical momentum in a market that constantly rotates narratives. For now, price action remains powerful but fragile, driven more by sentiment than substance.

After months of stalled negotiations, both chambers of Congress are preparing hearings and procedural steps that could shape how digital assets are regulated in the United States. The focus now shifts to committee calendars, where early January dates signal the first concrete push of the new year. Lawmakers and industry observers see this window as a test of whether bipartisan momentum can translate into binding rules for crypto markets. Market structure bill heads toward Senate action Attention centers on the Senate Banking Committee, which is preparing to advance a market structure proposal that aims to clarify regulatory authority over digital assets. The bill seeks to define when a token falls under securities law and when it qualifies as a commodity, effectively drawing clearer lines between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Committee leaders have indicated that January will bring formal consideration of the text, including a markup process where senators debate amendments and vote on final language. That step matters because it determines whether the bill can move to the Senate floor later in the session. Meanwhile, the House has already passed its own version of market structure legislation. As a result, January discussions are expected to focus on aligning Senate language with the House framework, setting up negotiations that could eventually lead to a unified bill. Stablecoin oversight shifts toward implementation Stablecoins form the second pillar of the January agenda, although the legislative posture differs from market structure. Congress approved a stablecoin framework last year, establishing rules for dollar-backed tokens, reserve requirements, and issuer oversight. As 2026 begins, the emphasis turns to how regulators will apply those rules in practice. Federal agencies are expected to outline supervision standards, licensing pathways, and compliance timelines for issuers operating under the new law. Lawmakers plan to use January hearings to review early implementation and address gaps that surfaced after passage. These sessions could also influence future amendments, especially around the role of banks, payment firms, and nonbank issuers in the stablecoin ecosystem. Why January matters for crypto policy January serves as a critical inflection point because committee action sets the pace for the rest of the year. Hearings and markups do not guarantee passage, but they signal political commitment and establish negotiating positions. For the crypto industry, this phase offers clearer signals than broad policy speeches or draft proposals. Concrete dates and committee votes show whether Washington is ready to move from debate to enforcement-ready rules.

Latest on‑chain data from CryptoQuant shows renewed accumulation, sparking debate over whether this signals a bullish surge or market caution ahead. Whale accumulation can drive bullish momentum. By removing coins from circulation, large investors support prices during consolidation. Historically, such buying during dips has often preceded upward moves, fueling optimism for a broader market recovery. Bitcoin ATM Fraud Hits Record Levels as Adoption Surges in the U.S. Bitcoin ATMs are booming across the U.S., but so are the risks. From January to November 2025, the FBI’s IC3 logged over 12,000 complaints and $333.5 M in losses, surging past 2024 levels and highlighting growing vulnerabilities in the crypto ecosystem. In 2025, over 10,000 people fell victim to Bitcoin ATM fraud. Scammers exploit crypto’s speed and anonymity through fake tech support, bogus investments, and high-pressure schemes, tricking users into irreversible ATM transfers. As Bitcoin ATMs surged past 30,000 in the U.S.,over 80% of the global total by the end of 2024, fraud has risen in tandem. While these machines offer easy crypto access, their rapid expansion has opened new avenues for criminal activity. Law enforcement continues to track Bitcoin ATM fraud and urges prompt reporting of suspicious activity. IC3 data highlights the need for public awareness, stronger security, and education to reduce losses. While cryptocurrency adoption grows, rising fraud underscores that financial innovation often attracts sophisticated criminal schemes. As the U.S. leads globally in bitcoin ATM installations, users and regulators must balance accessibility with safety. Enhanced vigilance, smarter reporting tools, and informed education are essential to curb fraud in this rapidly evolving sector. Conclusion Bitcoin accumulation by whales can signal bullish potential. By absorbing available supply, they reduce coins in circulation, often supporting prices during consolidation. Historically, whale buying on dips has preceded upward moves, suggesting the market could be gearing for a broader recovery. On the other hand, the rapid spread of Bitcoin ATMs in the U.S. has fueled a surge in fraud, underscoring the urgent need for user vigilance and education. While these machines make crypto accessible, transactions are irreversible, making caution essential. Strengthening awareness, reporting, and security measures is key to safeguarding consumers and ensuring the safe, sustainable growth of digital finance.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-04 11:22:54

BTC pulls back for a few days. ETH stalls near a key level. Meme coins begin to dry up and the charts are growing weary. When it occurs, traders are rotated. They turn their backs on pure narrative plays and to projects that could be interesting in pure utility. Rotation is recurring with some analysts thinking that it is going to take place into Q1 2026. And they say that the focus is shifting quickly towards one particular DeFi altcoin that at any rate, is under $0.1 but no longer early on paper. That one is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a non custodial borrowing and lending writing protocol. Put simply, simple cases would be where users provide assets to earn yield, and borrowers provide overcollateralized debts. It is a protocol that is meant to handle rates and risk policies to ensure that liquidity remains intact. This is relevant to stormy markets. Lending is not a trend. It is a need. The traders borrow to remain in circulation. Others lend to earn yield. In cases where sentiment is shaky, such utility can hold demand steady as compared to meme cycles. Mutuum Finance has also a definite milestone that grounds the story. As announced by its official sources , V1 is in preparation phase for Sepolia testnet and then this version should be prepared to mainnet, though it is defined as soon. The V1 consists of the Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token and a Liquidator Bot and the initial assets to be listed as collateral, lent and to be lent are ETH and USDT. Participation Signals and What the Numbers Suggest When a smaller project begins trending, social posts are not the first to consider. It is participation. Who is actually positioning. Mutuum Finance has reported having raised $19.6M and approximately 18,700 holders. What is significant about those figures is that they represent a wide base. It implies that interest is not being generated by a small group of people. It also portends that there are numerous holders who are not only ready to sit through the build, but it is a better indicator than a one week spike. Selling a story is not the deal in this section. It is about reading the room. The increase in the number of holders, accompanied by a constant funding, is what tends to appear in front of the broader market before a project should be spotted. In the case of crypto investing, that typically is the initial indicator of the larger attention shift. The trend of the price has been consistent. Phase 1 started at $0.01. Now it is $0.04. It is a 300% increase in stages. Mutuum Finance also cites a planned launch price of $0.06 as the reason why Phase 1 purchasers are set for 500% appreciation post launch at the specific mark. That is a comparison of prices, not an assurance. During the next stage of crypto, the vital piece of information is a straightforward one. There is a set allocation on each stage. With an increase in demand, the stages are filled quicker and the entry price is increased. That is the reason why intermediate stages tend to seem as a narrower window. Security and Infrastructure Lending habits die and meme on security. That is why the security layer of MUTM falls under the change of attention. Mutuum Finance refers to a CertiK scan score of 90/100. It further indicates that Halbon security performed an independent audit of its V1 lending and borrowing protocol. It has mentioned an amount of fifty thousand dollars bug bounty as well. Such watches are not able to eliminate uncertainty, but they may increase confidence among risk-averse users. On infrastructure, Mutuum Finance specifies plans of oracle that proposes Chainlink style feeds, fallback options, and potential aggregated sources. This is significant as oracles are associated with liquidations and maintain collateral regulations when today crypto prices are rapidly growing. An overcollateralized stablecoin plan and calldata compression cost reduction are also described by Mutuum Finance. Those are not nice extras. They are indications that the protocol is designed to scale. For some investors, these kinds of concrete infrastructure plans build trust because they show the team is thinking beyond launch and focusing on long-term usability. Early investor sentiment indicates that this is one reason new participants keep joining, since scaling features can support broader adoption over time. In a bullish scenario, projections show that this strengthens the case for a 15x path from the current $0.04 level, which would imply roughly $0.60, as usage and visibility expand through 2026. The Urgency Window Ahead of Q1 2026 Later construction sites are traditionally changeable. Allocation tightens. There are more of the tokens in determined hands. And the other stage price moves higher. Other commentators in the market opine that this is also where the interest of the whales may be observed, as bigger buyers would like to see the evidence upon which to base their early uncertainty on. The official figures presented so far have not been verified to be exact numbers of whales, so it should be presumed that it is a pattern and not a proven statement. Now the 15x idea. A 15x move from $0.04 implies about $0.60. Others describe that in the event where V1 delivery is on schedule and it is used upon its introduction, it will be a bullish event. Nothing is certain, but it clarifies why MUTM is being followed as a potential best cheap crypto to invest in currently, with it entering Q1 2026.

In the past three days, the premier cryptocurrency has gained by 3.4% to trade at $90,500. Bitcoin now lies at a decision point as multiple implications hinge on the next price move. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Whale Comeback Story May Be Overblown, Onchain Data Shows $123,500 Rebound Or $86,000 Pullback: What Next For Bitcoin? In an X post on January 3, pseudonymous analyst Bitcoin Meraklisi shares a two-pronged price analysis of the Bitcoin market. Following its recent rally, the expert explains that Bitcoin sits on top of a three-month downtrend, putting the asset at a decision point. In the bullish scenario of a decisive and convincing breakout past $90,500, Bitcoin is expected to immediately reach $94,800. If this target is met, there would be a strong potential to trade as high as $107,300, moving Bitcoin into the six-figure zones for the first time since mid-November. With an overwhelming bullish conviction, Meraklisi states that the premier cryptocurrency could also rebound to $123,500, representing a potential 36.5% on present market prices. On the other hand, if Bitcoin experiences another rejection, the analyst explains investors should expect an initial price drop to $88,000. However, a continued pullback to around $86,000 also remains on the card. Interestingly, Bitcoin Meraklisi notes that price prediction is presently difficult, considering the market’s heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic and external events. Over the past year, Bitcoin continued to experience growing adoption, reflected in rising institutional and government participation. However, the premier cryptocurrency has also suffered price declines due to geopolitical tensions and renewed trade-war concerns Related Reading: Why The Ethereum Price Could Bounce Above $3,500 Soon Bitcoin RSI Flashes Positive Signal Amid the present market uncertainty, Meraklisi also notes that the Bitcoin relative strength index is showing a positive market signal after breaking out of an ascending triangle pattern to end a 3-month downtrend. If treated as a leading signal, this RSI breakout suggests that Bitcoin may overcome its current resistance level and potentially transition into a bullish price trajectory. At press time, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at $90,603, reflecting market gains of 0.76% and 3.13% in the last one and seven days, respectively. However, the monthly chart reports a minor loss of 1.68%, suggesting the market recovery is yet to commence. Bitcoin boasts a total market cap of $1.8 trillion and is ranked the largest cryptocurrency and eight largest asset in the world.

At the same time, capital is quietly rotating into utility-driven digital assets that can operate alongside traditional finance. Bitcoin has begun the year reclaiming momentum above $89,000, but it’s not the only one. Against this backdrop, Remittix , a new PayFi solution on Ethereum, is also starting to enjoy increased attention and adoption. Bitcoin Shows Early Signs of a Macro Trend Shift Towards the end of 2025, Bitcoin price predictions were very bearish because of the high number of token sell-offs. However, since the start of this year, the BTC price has been performing well again. Currently, Bitcoin is trading very close to $90,000 again, with a demonstrable marked refusal to break below the $88,000 mark. Because of this, traders are now speculating whether Bitcoin has enough momentum to ride this wave all the way back above $100,000. Even institutional behavior appears to support this narrative. Tether’s decision to add nearly $800 million worth of Bitcoin to its treasury, bringing total holdings above 96,000 BTC. By allocating up to 15% of quarterly profits to Bitcoin acquisitions, Tether has reinforced the idea that Bitcoin remains central to crypto’s financial infrastructure, especially during uncertain macro conditions. Analysts and price prediction models expect it to happen. But in the meantime, Bitcoin investors are also diversifying exposure into lower-priced tokens with similar upside potential like Remittix. Remittix Emerges as the Leading Utility Counterpart to Bitcoin As discussions about Bitcoin’s performance abound and market speculations about its future continue, Remittix , a PayFi altcoin on Ethereum, is also enjoying lots of attention. Remittix has already secured over $28.6 million in private funding from investors and secured token listings on top exchanges like BitMart and LBANK, signalling strong adoption. According to analysts, the adoption strength Remittix is enjoying comes down to its incredible utility. Remittix is currently positioned at the intersection of cryptocurrency, payments, and global remittance with a focus on solving the $19 trillion problem of global payments. The Remittix wallet is already live on the app store, marking its first major product release. More importantly, the team has announced the launch of its crypto-to-fiat platform on February 9, 2026 , a milestone that could materially expand real-world usage. Here are some other things investors love about Remittix: Remittix is fully audited and verified by CertiK , boosting investor trust Impressive global adoption potential with Remittix already delivering live crypto-to-fiat support for individuals, merchants, and institutions in 30 different countries New limited-time 200% bonus on new deposits Clear payment-focused utility rather than speculative narratives The 2026 macro cycle appears increasingly favourable for assets that serve distinct but reinforcing roles. Bitcoin continues to anchor the crypto market as a monetary benchmark, while Remittix is positioning itself as a utility layer designed for real financial activity.

According to analysts, now appears to be a good time to buy Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has been gaining strength since the start of 2026, and investor patterns suggest strong institutional backing. This is in line with the current market trend of investor focus on products with solid real-world use. What makes Remittix different from other payment tokens? Remittix combines a live mobile wallet, planned crypto-to-fiat rails, and integrations for merchants with strong security practices. A CertiK audit, Skynet number one ranking, KYC verified team and confirmed listings on crypto exchanges give it a more complete profile than many purely speculative payment tokens.

His analysis centers on historical momentum behavior and how similar RSI conditions have previously preceded notable changes in trend structure. The current setup, according to the analyst, closely resembles prior instances where XRP transitioned from extended corrective phases into periods of renewed strength. The monthly RSI has returned to the 50 zone, an area that has historically acted as a reset point for momentum rather than a signal of sustained weakness. Egrag Crypto emphasizes that this level has often marked the point where selling pressure diminishes, speculative excess is removed, and a structural base begins to form. Importantly, the RSI is described as bouncing upward from this zone rather than breaking down, a distinction that separates constructive resets from failed recoveries. #XRP – Monthly RSI Is Talking… And It’s Interesting: The Monthly RSI drop into the 50 Zone and bouncing is presenting the following: Momentum resets Weak hands exit Base forms Expansion follows We’re back in that zone and #RSI is bouncing up, not breaking down. This… https://t.co/5Bcx3oqpnR pic.twitter.com/Mzr7dLRfhU — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 3, 2026 Historical Context and the Importance of the RSI Bounce The chart shows previous market cycles with a recurring pattern. When the monthly RSI declined into the 50 region and successfully rebounded, XRP later experienced gradual trend strengthening followed by expansion phases. These prior bounces contrast with a single historical failure case, where RSI did not hold the zone and broader conditions deteriorated. Egrag Crypto notes that the current configuration aligns more closely with the successful bounce scenarios than with the exception. The analysis suggests that this phase represents a maturing accumulation period rather than an immediate breakout environment. The RSI is not yet indicating extreme momentum conditions, which supports the view that the market is still in a structural rebuilding phase. According to the analyst, this lack of overheating reduces the probability of an abrupt reversal and keeps longer-term upside scenarios technically viable. Probability Outlook and Structural Expectations Egrag Crypto assigns weighted probabilities to possible paths forward based on the current RSI behavior. The most likely outcome in his view is a gradual strengthening of the trend from current levels, reflecting improving momentum without excessive volatility. A secondary scenario involves extended sideways consolidation, allowing price action to stabilize further while maintaining structural support. The least likely outcome is a breakdown scenario, which the analyst links specifically to a failure in broader macroeconomic support rather than to XRP’s internal structure alone. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The analysis underscores that confirmation remains essential. While the RSI bounce suggests that the reset phase may be complete, further validation is expected through sustained structure and continued momentum development. Expansion, according to Egrag Crypto, would become more probable if the monthly RSI advances toward the 70 to 80 range, a zone historically associated with stronger trend phases for XRP. XRP: Structure Before Momentum The central conclusion of the analysis is that XRP’s market structure is taking precedence over short-term excitement. Egrag Crypto frames the current RSI behavior as evidence that accumulation is progressing and that the market is transitioning toward a more constructive phase. However, the analyst stresses that structure must lead, confirmation must follow, and momentum should be the final signal, reinforcing a disciplined, long-term technical perspective rather than premature expectations of rapid price acceleration.

The collapse erased household savings and pushed the prices of essential goods higher. According to reports, inflation rose to 42.2% year over year in December, while food prices and health-related costs climbed to 72% and 50%, respectively. The reports have worsened public frustration amid fears of hyperinflation. Demonstrations have expanded across several areas in Tehran and some major cities. Shopkeepers near the Grand Bazaar closed their stores and gathered in protest, adding their voices to the frustration of the masses. Stablecoin usage on the rise in Iran as rial plunges According to videos scattered online, there are several groups chanting against the ruling class, though authorities dispute the timelines around the footage. President Masoud Pezeshkian has also acknowledged the unrest, urging officials to move swiftly to tackle the issues that he describes as legitimate economic concerns. He has instructed the interior minister to engage directly with the leader of the protest. Parliament Speaker Mohammed Bagher Qalibaf has also called for urgent measures to protect the Iranian rial. He made the call while accusing foreign adversaries of taking advantage of the unrest. Despite these statements, footage has shown security forces deploying tear gas in some areas. Meanwhile, Iranians are now swiftly turning to cryptocurrencies and stablecoins as the rial continues to lose value. Most of them confirmed to have made the move to protect their purchasing power. Blockchain analysts have long tracked this trend in sanctioned economies, where access to traditional banking remains limited. Iranians are particularly gravitating towards stablecoins pegged to the United States dollar, as they see it as a practical hedge against local currency declines, especially during periods of instability and rapid devaluation cycles. The shift is also in line with Iran’s engagement with digital assets. According to earlier reports, Iran’s Ministry of Defense Export Center has signaled its intention to accept digital assets for payments for sales of arms overseas. Chainalysis also previously reported that sanctioned countries received more than $16 billion in digital assets in a single year, showing how digital assets and their underlying technology have been supporting cross-border transactions under pressure. Geopolitical tensions and economic turmoil The economic crisis has also caused a swift fallout as Central Bank Governor Mohammed Reza Farzin resigned on Monday, according to state media. Meanwhile, the renewed United Nations sanctions in 2025, which are tied to Iran’s nuclear program, have further restricted its access to three global markets, intensifying capital flight. Authorities have also announced temporary shutdowns across Tehran and other provinces, citing energy shortages and cold weather. Meanwhile, residents claim that despite the government shutdown, there has been a history of crypto firms tied to the administration carrying out energy-intensive mining operations . Geopolitical risks have resurfaced as the United States has warned Iran against any attempt to rebuild nuclear or missile capabilities. United States President Donald Trump has said that the United States would act again if Iran moved ahead to restore its nuclear program, though he noted that there could be a negotiated deal.

Others believe the following 12 months will be generous only for the bears, envisioning a severe pullback. The Bullish Scenario The largest cryptocurrency had its shining moments in 2025, and its price reached a new record of over $126,000 at the beginning of October. However, the following months were brutal, and BTC closed the year at around $87,000, marking an annual loss. In fact, this was the first time the asset ended a post-halving year in the red. Numerous analysts seem unconcerned about this, though, predicting that 2026 will be much more successful. X user KAY noted the latest resurgence to over $90,000, claiming that BTC’s “Adam and Eve” pattern is in play. The chat resembles a short dump followed by a rounding bottom formation. According to the market observer, BTC now needs a strong breakout above $94,000, after which “the bulls will be back in control.” JAVON MARKS and Crypto GEMS were even more optimistic. The former sees the asset rising to a new all-time high of $126,200, whereas the latter expects it to top around $210,000 sometime this year. Earlier this week, Ali Martinez revealed that approximately 20,000 BTC had left exchanges in the past week alone. The USD equivalent of the stash is almost $1.8 billion, and it supports the bullish thesis. Shifting from centralized exchanges to self-custody methods reduces selling pressure, while increased exchange balances could be interpreted as a pre-sale step. Major Dump Incoming? Some analysts stand in the opposite corner, forecasting that 2026 could be a devastating year for BTC. X user CryptoBullet said the asset’s 2025 looks “very bad,” rejecting the possibility that it could reach a fresh peak in 2026. “If you think that wasn’t the Cycle Top and in 2026 BTC will somehow go to a new ATH, you’re an idiot,” they added. According to many experts, Bitcoin’s historical four-year cycle may no longer be valid. However, if the pattern remains intact, some analysts warn that a sharp price collapse could occur as early as this month. X user Chiefy, for instance, commented : “If the 4-year cycle is still in play, BTC will dump to $32,000 in January. Do you think you’re prepared for this scenario?” For their part, Crypto Caeser forecasted that BTC may trade in the wide range between $80,687 and $98,880 “for a while.” The post Top Bitcoin (BTC) Price Predictions for 2026 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2026-01-04 12:23:07

At the time of that initial unlock, XRP was trading at approximately $2.20 during the peak of the broader cryptocurrency bull market. Now, an investor who allocated $100 to XRP on that date would have purchased about 45.45 XRP. As of press time on January 4, with XRP trading at $2.09, that holding would be valued at roughly $94.55, representing a decline of about 5.5% over seven years. XRP all-time price chart. Source: Finbold Ripple unlock mechanism Notably, Ripple introduced its escrow mechanism in late 2017, locking 55 billion XRP into time-based contracts to manage supply. Up to 1 billion XRP is unlocked monthly , with much of it typically re-escrowed, aiming to provide a predictable supply and support liquidity. While this structure has improved transparency and reduced fears of sudden releases, it has also fueled ongoing concerns about supply pressure and long-term valuation. Since 2018, XRP’s price has been shaped by both macro and asset-specific factors, including the post-2018 crypto bear market, shifting risk appetite, and regulatory pressure stemming from Ripple’s long-running case with the US SEC. Broader market cycles, rising competition in blockchain payments, and adoption trends for Ripple’s cross-border products have also influenced performance. Despite sharp rallies and deep pullbacks over the years, XRP now trades slightly below its level at the first escrow unlock, leaving early long-term investors with modest nominal losses. XRP price analysis As things stand, XRP is trading around $2.09, sitting just above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) at $2.04, suggesting short-term price action remains relatively stable and mildly supportive. However, the token remains well below its 200-day SMA near $2.46, highlighting a broader bearish trend and indicating that longer-term momentum has yet to turn decisively positive. This gap between the short- and long-term averages underscores ongoing downside pressure despite recent consolidation. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI stands at around 57, placing XRP firmly in neutral territory. This suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, with momentum modestly tilted to the upside but lacking strong conviction.

However, the underlying data show that reduced figures do not translate to a decline in security threats. Crypto Phishing Losses Down From $494M To $84M In 2025 A phishing attack occurs when an unsuspecting user is tricked into giving up sensitive information or signing off on malicious transactions. In the crypto space, signature phishing attacks are a major security concern and are facilitated using wallet drainers. According to Web3 security outfit Scam Sniffer , total phishing losses in 2025 were valued at $83.85 million across 106,106 victims, representing respective drops of 83% and 68% from 2024. There were also 11 large cases of theft over $1 million compared to 30 in 2024. Meanwhile, the single largest theft was a $6.5 million loss via a permit signature attack in September, which was 8x lower than that of 2024. While the latest figures represent a significant decline from the previous year, Scam Sniffer analysts state there is no direct translation to decreased market threat as losses moved in parallel with the market cycle. Therefore, losses increased or decreased in relation to the global crypto user activity. Notably, monthly losses varied from $2.04 million in December to $12.17 million in August. However, Q3, which was the busiest market period, accounted for the largest portion (29% i.e $31 million) of the yearly losses. However, figures dropped to $13 million in Q4, as user activity cooled off. Related Reading: Aave Founder Responds To Governance Tension With Strategic Plan – Details EIP-7702 Emerges As Latest Phishing Signature Type According to Scam Sniffer’s report, EIP-7702 exploitation emerged as a new threat in the signature-based wallet-drainer ecosystem. Leveraging account abstraction introduced in the Pectra upgrade in May 2025, attackers can bundle multiple malicious operations into a single signature. Notably, the largest EIP-7702 losses, with two incidents culminating in $2.54 million, were recorded in August. Meanwhile, Permit/ Permit2 signature types lead the space, accounting for $8.72 million in losses across three major incidents, I.e. 38% of all large-case losses. Beyond signature phishing types, Scam Sniffer also highlighted other phishing attack types that threaten the crypto space. The Bybit incident in February stands out, after the Lazarus group breached a Safe (Wallet) developer machine and launched a program that imitated the multi-sig interface, resulting in losses of $1.46 billion. In conclusion, while reported signature phishing losses have declined, the threat landscape remains active. Moreover, the fall in trackable losses may suggest attackers are employing harder-to-track vectors such as private key breaches or targeted social engineering.",Crypto scam|Phishing|Crypto Phishing|EIP-7702|Phishing Signature|scam sniffer|Wallet Drainer,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-04 13:00:19

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-xrp-is-missing-a-blow-off-top-rally-heres-why/,"XRP’s long-term price behavior is being re-examined after crypto analyst ChartNerd pointed to what he considers an important structural absence on the chart. In his latest commentary, the analyst stated that XRP has not yet experienced a blow-off top, a phase typically associated with the final surge in an extended market cycle. According to ChartNerd, this missing element suggests that XRP’s broader market structure remains unfinished rather than exhausted. The analyst’s view is based on a multi-year chart that highlights recurring phases of accumulation and distribution. These phases are presented within the context of Wyckoff market theory, which tracks how assets move through periods of demand absorption, markup, and eventual supply-driven distribution. ChartNerd’s assessment implies that XRP is still progressing through this sequence rather than concluding it. $XRP is missing a blow-off-top. https://t.co/CFKhsiMRxK pic.twitter.com/KSK28Bziuu — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 3, 2026 Wyckoff Accumulation as the Central Framework ChartNerd previously addressed the same chart in a post dated December 10, where he described XRP as sitting within its second Wyckoff accumulation range. In that earlier assessment, he argued that the market was consolidating within a defined demand zone, preparing for a rally continuation. He noted that this phase would likely precede one final rally, culminating in a blow-off top before a broader distribution phase begins. The chart images captioned in both analyses illustrate multiple accumulation areas marked by sideways price action, followed by impulsive upward moves. These are contrasted with projected distribution zones, where volatility increases and price struggles to maintain higher levels. ChartNerd emphasized that while short-term deviations from this structure can occur, they do not invalidate the broader setup as long as the price remains within the macro demand zone. Short-Term Variability Versus Macro Structure A key element of ChartNerd’s commentary is the distinction between short-term price movement and long-term structural positioning. He acknowledged that temporary pullbacks or irregular price behavior are possible within the current range. However, he maintained that these fluctuations should be viewed as part of the accumulation process rather than signs of weakness or failure. The analyst’s latest statement reinforces this stance by reiterating that the absence of a blow-off top indicates unfinished upside potential rather than a completed cycle. From his perspective, the current structure does not yet reflect the characteristics typically seen at major market peaks, particularly the rapid expansion and subsequent instability associated with final distribution. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for XRP’s Ongoing Market Phase Taken together, ChartNerd’s observations frame XRP as an asset still operating within a broader accumulation-to-expansion narrative . The repeated identification of accumulation zones suggests sustained interest and absorption of supply at current levels. His conclusion that XRP is missing a blow-off top positions the market as structurally incomplete, with at least one major phase still ahead before a prolonged distribution period emerges. While the analysis does not provide a precise timeline, it underscores the importance of monitoring macro demand zones and overall structure rather than reacting solely to short-term price movements.

At the same time, co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a major roadmap that could redefine the blockchain’s structure over the next four years. Together, the technical and network fundamentals are aligning for what could be Ethereum’s most transformative phase since The Merge. Ethereum Re-Claiming Its Ground Above $3,100 Ethereum’s up 1.24% over the past 24 hours and is currently hovering around $3,100, with a market cap of a tidy $378 billion. After finally breaking free from that pesky descending channel, it’s looking like the sideways trading is finally done and dusted for now – which is good news for the short-term bulls. On the 4-hour chart, you can see ETH is putting up a string of higher lows and higher highs – a nice sign that buyers are regaining their strength, and it’s all thanks to that 50-EMA crossing above the 100-EMA. And if we take a look at the RSI, it’s ticking along just above 70, which tells us the uptrend is in good health without getting too overexcited. Of course, the first bit of resistance it’ll face is the $3305 mark, followed closely by $3432. ZK-EVM and PeerDAS Transform the Network Vitalik Buterin said Ethereum has reached a “fundamentally new kind of decentralized network” as ZK-EVMs and PeerDAS move from concept to implementation. Now that ZKEVMs are at alpha stage (production-quality performance, remaining work is safety) and PeerDAS is live on mainnet, it's time to talk more about what this combination means for Ethereum. These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 3, 2026 He described the combination as a breakthrough that “solves the blockchain trilemma” — achieving decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously. Key milestones from Buterin’s post include: 2026: ZK-EVM nodes begin rolling out. 2027–2030: Gas limits increase, and distributed block building reshapes network throughput. Long-term, Ethereum aims to enable distributed block construction — ensuring no single entity can control the transaction flow. These innovations could lower costs and accelerate adoption, reinforcing Ethereum’s long-term value proposition beyond speculation. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Technical Setup Hints at $3,430–$3,600 Range Ethereum price prediction has turned bullish as candlestick patterns are sending out some strong signals. A bullish engulfing candle helped nudge it out of that channel, and that was followed up with a spinning top, which suggests the market might take a little breather before it gets going again. The measured move from this pattern is looking at $3430 as the next target – and if this momentum keeps going, then it could easily push towards $3600. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Price Chart – Source: Tradingview On the flip side, we’ve still got support holding around $3070, but if it drops below $3010, that breakout will be invalidated. For traders who are looking to get in on the action, a long entry near $3100 with targets between $3300 and $3430 might be the way to go. Long-Term Outlook: A New Ethereum Era Ethereum’s alignment of strong fundamentals, network innovation, and technical resilience paints an optimistic picture for early 2026. If Vitalik’s vision for distributed block building materializes, Ethereum could evolve into a faster, fairer, and more scalable blockchain — one capable of handling the next wave of decentralized finance and AI-driven applications. With momentum building both on-chain and on the chart, ETH looks poised to test the $3,600–$3,700 zone before targeting $4,000 later in the year.

Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.0002765, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase.

TRX is the native token of the Tron network used to govern and settle transaction fees. In retrospect, Tron (TRX) has performed better than most mega-altcoins.

The TRX/USD price has slightly increased to $0.294 in the past few hours. Immediate support is also present just below the current price level at $0.291, as the token started recovering before reaching that level.

Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022, as per crypto market data. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May, while it observed its yearly high price of $0.370 on August 14. In October, Tron started its descent and fell below $0.30 by the end of the month. In December, Tron was trending below the $0.30 range, maintaining its price above $0.23. At the start of 2026, TRX is trading near $0.28, as the current Tron sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|ICO|LINK|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX|USDT|RESEARCH|BNB|USDD|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-04 13:27:00

On Saturday, Malaysian authorities announced that they are investigating Grok for producing offensive and illegal content using AI. The country’s Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) confirmed it received complaints that Grok was generating manipulated images of women and minors in sexually explicit forms. The agency made it clear that distributing such content is a criminal offense in Malaysia. According to their statement, they will also go after the users of X who requested or posted the content and plan to summon X representatives for questioning. The MCMC said , “While X is not presently a licensed service provider, it has the duty to prevent dissemination of harmful content on its platform.” India, France, and EU raise legal threats over Grok’s images Just one day earlier, India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology issued a formal warning to X, demanding a complete review of Grok and its ability to generate nudity, sexualized material, or anything that’s unlawful. Bloomberg claims it saw a copy of the notice, dated January 2, which gave X 72 hours to submit a full report on actions taken. The letter warned of potential criminal charges and additional penalties under the country’s IT laws. India’s Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told CNBC-TV 18, “The Parliamentary Committee has recommended a strong law for regulating social media. We are considering it.” Meanwhile, France’s government didn’t hold back either. Officials said on Friday that Grok had generated “clearly illegal” sexual material on X without people’s consent. They said the chatbot’s behavior was likely in violation of the European Union’s Digital Services Act , which demands large platforms take strong action to limit illegal content. According to France, Grok’s actions show a complete failure in enforcement of platform rules. Some of the pictures were taken down after backlash, but officials said the damage was already done. Even Grok’s own policy bans sexualization, making the violation even worse. In response to the controversy, a post by Grok on X claimed it had “identified lapses in safeguards” and said fixes were “being urgently applied.” But that hasn’t slowed down the demands from governments for accountability. Musk rages as EU slams X with €120 million penalty Meanwhile, just last month, the European Union fined X €120 million (about $140 million) for breaking the Digital Services Act. The fine was for deceptive blue checkmark designs, opaque advertising systems, and refusal to give researchers data access. But Elon still blew up on the platform. In one reply to the EU’s official post, Elon simply wrote: “Bullsh*t!” Then the next day, he posted, “The EU should be abolished and sovereignty returned to individual countries, so that governments can better represent their people.” Andrew Puzder, the U.S. ambassador to the EU, backed Elon on X, saying, “Today’s excessive €120M fine is the result of EU regulatory overreach targeting American innovation.” He added that President Trump’s administration opposes censorship and will fight unfair international rules. “We expect the EU to engage in fair, open, & reciprocal trade — & nothing less,” Puzder posted. As the backlash over Grok builds, so do the threats of regulation and lawsuits. But instead of cooling things down, Elon and his team replied to an email request from Bloomberg with just two words: “Legacy Media Lies.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Tech|EUR|INR|X|xAI,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-04 13:41:34

With prices breaking out of a long-term downtrend, traders are now eyeing $2.20 and $2.28 as the next key targets. Ledger Transactions Hit 5-Month Peak The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has recorded a sharp rebound in network usage since mid-December, with daily transactions rising to roughly 1 million, according to Ripple’s public metrics dashboard. This jump reflects stronger on-chain utility, driven by growing remittance volumes and increased integration with financial platforms adopting XRP for settlement. Historically, transaction spikes have preceded notable price expansions, and the current uptick aligns with XRP’s latest technical breakout, suggesting synchronized network and market growth. XRP/USD Technical Analysis: Chart Points to $2.28–$2.40 From a charting perspective, XRP price prediction has turned bullish as XRP has broken cleanly above its descending trendline, a level that had capped gains since November. The 50-EMA crossing above the 100-EMA on the 4-hour chart reinforces bullish momentum, while RSI levels near 72 suggest controlled overbought strength rather than exhaustion. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick formations add credibility to this move: a three white soldiers pattern accompanied the breakout, signaling sustained buying interest. Short-term consolidation near $2.05–$2.10 could offer a springboard toward the $2.21 and $2.28 resistance levels, while holding above $1.97 remains vital for trend continuation. Institutional Flows and 2026 Outlook Improved sentiment around crypto ETFs and renewed focus on Ripple’s institutional payment partnerships have added a macro tailwind to XRP’s rally. If bullish momentum persists above $2.20, analysts see room for XRP to challenge the $2.40–$2.50 zone in early 2026. Beyond price, the growing alignment between XRPL’s transaction volume and XRP’s technical strength suggests that the token is regaining its role as a high-efficiency settlement asset. If this synergy holds, XRP could be entering a new growth phase — one supported by real usage rather than speculation. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives.

The strikes took place at around 6 a.m. UTC and lasted for about 30 minutes, reports show. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Whale Comeback Story May Be Overblown, Onchain Data Shows Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, wrote on X that he does not expect “a widespread correction” tied to the attack, arguing the event was planned and has already passed market participants. Other analysts shared a similar view, saying dramatic moves usually come when traders expect worse things ahead. Bitcoin: Market Moves And Liquidations Based on reports, Bitcoin held firm above the $90,000 mark. CoinGecko data showed a rise of 1.50%, putting the token at $91,320 at the time of publication. I don’t think we’ll see a widespread correction based on the attack in Venezuela on #Bitcoin. It’s a planned and coordinated attack on Maduro, and is already past us. The likelihood of more negativity on the markets from that single event are relatively slim. I would assume… — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 3, 2026 CoinGlass figures indicate about $60 million in Bitcoin positions were liquidated over the prior 24 hours, with roughly $55 million of that coming from short bets. That kind of forced selling can amp up volatility for a short period. Still, the broader pattern this time looked muted. Historical Drops Have Happened Fast There have been episodes when conflict pushed prices down quickly. In June 2025, for example, Bitcoin fell nearly 3%, sliding from $106,000 to $103,000 inside roughly 90 minutes after explosions in Tehran. Traders point out that sudden moves often follow when markets fear ongoing escalation. Here, many market watchers see less chance of follow-up actions that would deepen panic. Federal Debt And Genesis Day In The Middle Of Market Noise Based on reports, the US national debt passed $38 trillion on Saturday, with the US National Debt Clock placing it near $38.5 at the time. That milestone came as Bitcoin fans marked “Genesis Day,” the anniversary of the first block mined by Satoshi Nakamoto. Happy Bitcoin Genesis Block day — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) January 3, 2026 Paolo Ardoino, CEO of stablecoin issuer Tether, posted a celebratory message, while Sam Callahan, director of strategy and research at BTC treasury firm OranjeBTC, echoed the sentiment. For many in the community, the headline embedded in the Genesis Block remains a symbol of a monetary system capped in supply and not subject to the same printing pressures as fiat. Yeah generally the market really nukes when we expect things to get worse afterwards which doesn’t seem to be the case. Could see this actually bring some green to the market as people take this as a sign of strength tho — Tyler Hill (@Tylerhill) January 3, 2026 Community Reaction And Context Reports have shown some in the crypto space treated events like the strike and the rising US debt as separate but related stories. A few traders said the strike could bring “green” to markets as investors interpret decisive action as a sign of control, an outlook voiced by analyst Tyler Hill.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/top-trader-xrp-is-getting-ready-for-massive-bullish-rally-heres-why/,"Recent market activity surrounding XRP is drawing analytical focus following a technical update shared by crypto analyst Maxi. The analyst’s assessment centers on a visible change in XRP’s price structure after an extended corrective phase. Relying on chart-based signals, the analyst suggests a possible transition from consolidation into a bullish continuation phase. The accompanying chart, based on the XRP/USDT pair on the 12-hour timeframe, highlights key trendlines that have guided price action for several months. For a prolonged period, XRP traded within a descending channel defined by a series of lower highs and controlled pullbacks. This structure reflected sustained selling pressure and limited upside momentum. According to the chart shared by Maxi, that structure has now been challenged, with price moving decisively toward the upper boundary of the channel and beginning to break beyond it. $XRP is getting ready for Massive bullish Rally #XRPUSDT #XRP #Crypto pic.twitter.com/S7ZoXn1oO7 — Maxi (@Maxi_Dec2020) January 2, 2026 Breakout From a Long-Standing Downtrend The most prominent feature of the chart is a descending resistance line that has repeatedly capped XRP’s advances since late 2024. Maxi’s analysis suggests a recent bullish candle that pushes through this resistance, signaling a potential invalidation of the prior downtrend. At the same time, XRP appears to be holding above a gently rising support line, suggesting improving market balance rather than a short-lived price spike. The projected move on the chart outlines a potential upside expansion toward the region slightly above the $3.00 level. This projection is not presented as a guaranteed outcome, but rather as a measured technical target derived from the channel’s height and the breakout area. The structure means that if the price sustains above the former resistance, market participants may begin to reassess XRP’s near-term valuation range. Momentum Context and Market Conditions Maxi’s outlook is framed within broader momentum considerations. The chart reflects higher lows near the lower boundary of the channel before the breakout attempt, a pattern often associated with seller exhaustion. The recent expansion in bullish candle size further supports the view that buying pressure is beginning to outweigh distribution, at least on the observed timeframe. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While the analysis is primarily technical, it aligns with a period in which XRP has remained one of the more actively traded digital assets, benefiting from deep liquidity and consistent market participation. These conditions can amplify the impact of structural breakouts when they occur. Supporting Factors Beyond the Chart Beyond the immediate technical setup, XRP is positioned as a settlement-focused digital asset with established infrastructure and ongoing ecosystem development. Market participants often factor this into their reaction to technical signals, particularly when the price emerges from extended consolidation phases. In this context, Maxi’s assessment presents XRP as entering a phase where technical structure and market conditions are beginning to align. Whether the projected move fully materializes will depend on sustained follow-through and broader market stability. However, the chart highlights a shift that traders and analysts are likely to monitor closely in the sessions ahead.

The price increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00024675 to $0.00024770. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market inched higher over the past 24 hours as Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the crucial $90,000 mark. Ethereum (ETH) and other tokens registered marginal gains as the crypto market cap rose almost 1% at $3.11 trillion. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Ready For Move To $0.00024470 Husky Inu (HINU) is set for its next price increase during the pre-launch phase, which will see the value of the HINU token rise from $0.00024675 to $0.00024770. The regular increases in the value of the HINU token enable the project to continue fundraising while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. The primary goal of the pre-launch phase is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project’s official launch is on March 27, 2026. However, the team is open to moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The project team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Can Husky Inu AI Raise $1M? Husky Inu AI faced a dramatic slowdown in fundraising towards the end of 2025 as the markets faced a notable slowdown after the October flash crash. As a result, fundraising crawled to a halt as the project struggled to raise funds. The project has raised $917,618 so far as fundraising picks up once again. Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 in October. However, fundraising has picked up again over the past few days as investor sentiment turns positive. Cryptocurrency Market Remains Positive Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market continued in positive territory over the past 24 hours as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and other altcoins registered notable gains. BTC finally reclaimed the $90,000 mark as it rallied from Saturday’s low of $89,407 to cross $90,000 and reach an intraday high of $91,352. The flagship cryptocurrency is trading around $91,236, up 1.12%. ETH continued consolidating above $3,000, rising from a low of $3,081 to an intraday high of $3,159. The world's second-largest cryptocurrency is trading around $3,147, up almost 1%. Ripple (XRP) has reclaimed $2 and is trading around $2.04, up almost 1%, while Solana (SOL) is up 1.29% at $134. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up nearly 4% and Cardano (ADA) is up 0.68% at $0.397. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin (LTC) have also registered notable increases over the past 24 hours. However, Polkadot (DOT) bucked the bullish trend and is down nearly 1% at $2.13.

Only two virtual asset service providers (VASPs) were approved in 2025, down from four in 2024. South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit has also increased approval times from 11 months to 16 months. South Korea’s FIU is delaying approval for VASPs South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) approved only two new virtual asset service providers (VASPs) for the entire year of 2025. Happy Block received approval in January for exchange and trading operations, while Blosafe was approved in August for transfer and storage management services. The average period from application submission to approval increased from 11 months in 2024 to 16 months in 2025. Blosafe’s application took over 600 days to get approved. Industry sources indicate that numerous virtual assets are unable to launch their operations due to these extended delays . Bit Korea, a joint venture with Hana Bank established in 2024, submitted its application to South Korea’s FIU, but so far, the company has not received approval and cannot conduct business. Under South Korea’s regulatory structure, companies can register as virtual asset operators but cannot operate without receiving approval. On December 23, a year and four months past the deadline, the FIU approved the license renewal for Dunamu, which operates Upbit , South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The FIU imposed a 35.2 billion won fine on Dunamu in November 2025 for violations, including negligence in anti-money laundering obligations. Korbit submitted its renewal application in September 2025, while Bithumb, Coinone, and Gopax filed in October. On December 31, Korbit received notification of an institutional warning and a 2.73 billion won fine for regulatory violations. Are suspicious crypto transactions surging in South Korea? Between January and August 2025, virtual asset service providers filed 36,684 suspicious transaction reports with the Financial Intelligence Unit, already exceeding the combined totals of 16,076 reports in 2023 and 19,658 reports in 2024. The Korea Customs Service reported that from 2021 through August 2025, about 9.56 trillion won was involved in cryptocurrency-linked crimes. Approximately 90% of these cases involved hwanchigi schemes, which are illegal foreign remittance operations where criminal proceeds are converted into cryptocurrency through overseas exchanges, routed into domestic platforms, and cashed out in Korean won. As Cryptopolitan reported , South Korea announced plans in November 2025 to expand its Travel Rule requirements to cover all transaction sizes, eliminating previous exemptions for transfers under 1 million won.

While the price has shown signs of recovery, momentum remains muted, keeping the market in a fragile equilibrium. Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC has registered a bullish breakout above the descending channel that previously defined the corrective structure. This breakout is technically constructive, as it signals a shift away from persistent lower highs and sustained sell-side control. However, the quality of this breakout remains questionable due to the lack of strong bullish momentum and follow-through. The price has moved higher, but candles remain relatively shallow and overlapping, suggesting that buyers are not yet acting with conviction. Bitcoin is now approaching the main resistance zone around the $94K–$96K region, which aligns with a prior high-volume supply area. This level is critical, as it represents the first major test of the bullish breakout. A failure to reclaim and hold above this resistance would increase the risk of a false breakout, potentially pulling the price back into the prior range. For the daily structure to shift decisively bullish, BTC needs sustained acceptance above resistance, supported by volatility expansion and directional momentum. Until then, the breakout should be treated cautiously rather than as confirmation of a new impulsive cycle. BTC/USDT 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart highlights the current indecision more clearly. The asset is consolidating within a tightening wedge structure, reflecting compression after the initial rebound. Higher lows are forming gradually, but upside progress remains capped by local resistance, keeping the price locked in a narrow range. This type of structure typically precedes expansion, but direction remains unresolved. The ongoing consolidation suggests that both buyers and sellers are positioning ahead of a decisive move. Without a clean breakout above the wedge resistance, the recent advance remains corrective within the broader context. A sustained break higher, followed by acceptance above local resistance of $95K, would be required to support the case for another bullish cycle. Conversely, failure to resolve higher could result in renewed downside pressure and a return toward the lower demand zones at the $80K range. Until resolution occurs, range-bound and liquidity-driven price action remains the dominant theme. Sentiment Analysis The liquidation heatmap provides valuable context for near-term price behaviour. A clear concentration of liquidation levels has built up below the current price, particularly around the $85K–$87K region, indicating a dense cluster of leveraged long exposure. This liquidity acts as a downside magnet in the event of weakness, as a sharp move lower could trigger cascading liquidations. At the same time, overhead liquidity appears more fragmented, suggesting that upside continuation may require additional buildup before a sustained squeeze can occur. The recent grind higher has already cleared short-term liquidation pockets above with little momentum, reinforcing the idea that current price action lacks strong directional urgency. As long as Bitcoin remains within this liquidity balance, short-term moves are likely to be driven by stop-hunts rather than trend expansion. A decisive breakaway from these liquidation clusters will be necessary to confirm the next meaningful directional move.

In 2029, it will range between $107.74 and $123.13, with an average price of $115.44. In 2032, it will range between $184.70 and $200.09, with an average price of $192.40. Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability to support the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s Hyperliquid price prediction for 2026 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Hyperliquid Token HYPE Price $25.02 (-2.71%) Market Cap $8.49B Trading Volume $132.79M Circulating Supply 339.34M HYPE All-time High $59.30 (Sep 18, 2025) All-time Low $3.2 (Nov 29, 2024) 24-hour High $25.44 24-hour Low $24.34 Hyperliquid Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $18.84 (-24.95%) Price Volatility (30-day variation) 8.72% 50-Day SMA $30.28 200-Day SMA $33.57 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) Hyperliquid Price Analysis: HYPE finds resistance, sinks toward $25.02 TL;DR Breakdown: Hyperliquid price analysis confirms a downward trend at $25.02. Cryptocurrency has lost 2.71% of its value. HYPE token faces resistance around the $26.79 range. On January 4, 2026, Hyperliquid price analysis revealed a downward trend for the altcoin. The coin is trading at $25.02 after finding resistance at $25.73. From an overall perspective, the currency lost 2.71% in its value in the last 24 hours. The decrease creates relatively unfavorable circumstances for investors, as the altcoin is now shedding value. HYPE/USDT 1-day chart analysis The one-day price chart of Hyperliquid Coin confirmed a bearish trend in the market. The cryptocurrency’s value slightly decreased to $25.02 during the day, as bears strive to suppress the price further. At the same time, red candlesticks on the price chart signify the presence of bearish elements. Sellers are leading the price action, as the coin is losing value as a result of the return of the bearish trend. HYPEUSD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance is narrow, leading to low volatility levels, as the bands are shrinking. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating resistance, has shifted to $26.79. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $23.13. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the lower half of the neutral region. The indicator’s score has decreased to 42 today. This condition is reflected by a downward-pointing RSI curve. If selling activities continue to intensify, the indicator’s reading can decrease further towards the index 35. HYPE/USDT 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of Hyperliquid also indicates negative sentiment in the market. The HYPE/USD price has decreased to $25.02 over the past few hours as selling pressure triggers again. However, the comparatively low volatility also suggests a lower probability of an imminent reversal or significant price depreciation. HYPEUSD 4-hour price chart.

Technically, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $25.66, acting as a key resistance level. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $23.86, indicating a strong zone of support. The RSI indicator is trending in the neutral region for now. However, its value has decreased to 50 in the last four hours. Overall, selling activity remained high during the last four hours of the day, which has resulted in a decrease in the indicator’s score.

According to an overall analysis, the currency lost 2.71% in its value today. Technical indicators give bearish signals, and the price charts also showcase a bearish market scenario at the time of writing. Why is Hyperliquid down? The cryptocurrency market is showing negative trends, and HYPE is receiving the same sentiment. Moreover, it is encouraging that HYPE marked a new ATH a few months ago, on September 18, 2025. However, from a broader perspective, the HYPE price decreased to $25.02, shedding 2.71% in its total value today. Is Hyperliquid a Good Investment? HYPE has growing utility, and its Ethereum compatibility helps it steal a share of DeFi industry. While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will Hyperliquid reach $50? The current price action does justify predicting a $50 target. In the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, but if the token maintains its price levels, a rally can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by any time in 2026 once again, as it did in September and October. Can Hyperliquid Coin reach $100? According to Hyperliquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2027. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $119.01. Will Hyperliquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, Hyperliquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will Hyperliquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan’s HYPE price prediction, Hyperliquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2032. How high can Hyperliquid go? The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $200.09, which it will achieve in 2032. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future? Hyperliquid is trading higher than its December 2025 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $200.09 by the end of 2032, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Negative market sentiment, such as market crashes, could derail the predictions. Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history: Coingecko The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved during this period, reaching above $8 billion, showing significant growth, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February, when the broader trend turned bearish again. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025, which significantly decreased the market capitalization. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On June 16, 2025, HYPE reached a high price of $45.57. A month later, on July 14, it marked another all-time high of $49.75, and on August 27, it discovered the $50.99 level with changing market dynamics.

Interestingly, the biggest gainers since Friday come from the meme coin niche, which could signal a significant change in investor behavior. Data from CoinGecko shows that BONK has emerged as the top performer in the past 24 hours. The asset has returned to the top 100 alts by market cap after suring by 40% daily and more than 60% since this time last Sunday. PEPE follows suit . The frog-shaped meme coin is up by 13% daily and more than 66% weekly. Shiba Inu is also well in the green on both charts, 11% and 21%, respectively. Dogecoin became the biggest gainer from the larger-cap alts. The OG meme coin has surged by 6% since yesterday and 23% weekly. The Official Trump (TRUMP) token has performed even better today (a 7% surge), perhaps due to the most recent actions undertaken by the US President. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Jake Kennis, Senior Research Analyst at Nansen, said this early-year rotation into larger-cap meme coins may suggest “traders are positioning for upside after months of consolidation.” He added that these more speculative assets have been some of the hardest hit during the October crash in terms of downside volatility. “Markets may have been extremely bearish on memes based on price action and the risk appetite not being there,” he added. However, Kennis admitted that the meme coins have been trending down relative to bitcoin, and these brief upticks would “have to be confirmed on higher timeframes as both PEPE and DOGE are still down around 80% from their respective ATHs.” The post DOGE, SHIB, PEPE Explode: Is Meme Coin Frenzy Back in Full Force? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Dogecoin|PEPE|Shiba Inu (SHIB),EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|PEPE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2026-01-04 14:50:14

The firm shared the alert on X on Sunday, stating, “We have identified a potential critical vulnerability and reached out via DM in advance under responsible disclosure, but have not yet received a response. ” SlowMist also added that the exchange should contact them “promptly to coordinate next steps.” How did HitBTC respond to the security threat disclosure? Going by recent public announcements from SlowMist security analysts, exchanges don’t tend to act with the level of urgency one would expect from custodians of user funds. The latest one involving HitBTC is at least the third time in recent weeks that SlowMist has publicly disclosed attempted security warnings after failing to establish contact with cryptocurrency exchanges. In December, the security firm issued similar notices to Seychelles-registered Azbit and Turkish exchange ICRYPEX Global, both of which handle significant daily trading volumes but failed to acknowledge the warnings. HitBTC is one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges still in business since its founding in 2013. The platform, registered in the British Virgin Islands, has a trading volume of over $110 million in the past 24 hours as of the time of writing. Over 250 cryptocurrencies and 800 trading pairs are available on the exchange. Security concerns are persistent SlowMist’s 2025 annual security report documented 200 security incidents resulting in losses of approximately $2.935 billion, representing a 46% increase in financial damage compared with the previous year, despite fewer total incidents being recorded as opposed to 2024. According to SlowMist’s report, “Exchange-related incidents numbered only 12 but caused staggering losses of up to USD 1.809 billion.” By comparison, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols experienced 126 incidents resulting in $649 million in losses. According to data shared by security firm Certik , around $117.8 million was lost to exploits in the crypto space in December 2025 alone. The shift from higher incident counts to larger individual losses shows that these attacks are becoming more sophisticated and targeted. Security analysts note that professionalized hacker groups, including state-sponsored actors with alleged North Korean links, are moving from opportunistic attacks to systematic, multi-step operations designed to extract maximum value from fewer high-profile targets. As Cryptopolitan reported yesterday, one crypto user lost approximately $1.08 million worth of Aave-wrapped Ethereum LBTC (aEthLBTC) in a phishing attack after signing a malicious “permit” signature. Major AI companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google have also reported that criminals are tapping into their platforms to orchestrate complex phishing operations, develop harmful software, and execute various digital attacks. Security specialists warn that criminals are also producing fake audio and video clips of company leaders to trick employees into giving up sensitive information. How should crypto exchanges respond to threat warnings? Security experts usually recommend that cryptocurrency platforms establish clear contact points for reporting vulnerabilities, including publicly available security email addresses and long-term public keys for encrypted communication. Industry guidelines expect that affected parties respond within two working days of initial contact. When security researchers like SlowMist in this case struggle to establish contact after multiple attempts, they are left with no other option than public disclosure to ensure transparency, especially when user funds face potential risk. SlowMist has built a reputation for lending weight to the blockchain security apparatus. The firm assisted in freezing or recovering approximately $19.29 million in stolen funds during 2025 through its threat intelligence network and MistTrack analysis platform. Across 18 major incidents, roughly $387 million of $1.957 billion in stolen funds was frozen or recovered, yielding a recovery rate of 13.2%.

It is generally at that point that smaller tokens with actual product advancements start to shine through. This is the reason why some analysts think that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be received with more attention in Q1 2026. It is below half a dollar, yet, its pricing has since shot up sharply by the lower ranks and its V1 milestone is approaching. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is developing two types of markets of non custodial lending and borrowing protocol. P2C is pool based. Liquidity deposits are made by the users to common pools, and liquidity is obtained by borrowers through common pools. Interest rates vary according to the use and this is the extent to which the pool is borrowed. Liquidity is high and as a result, the rates of borrowing remain low. In case there is low liquidity, the rates will be increased. That has the ability of increasing the lender APY since borrowers are paying a higher amount in order to access capital. P2P is direct matching. Users are able to negotiate terms as opposed to borrowing through a pool. This structure can be appropriate to those borrowers who desire more detailed terms. The stable-rate borrowing, together with variable borrowing, is also defined under specific circumstances by Mutuum Finance so that users should have more options. The options of risk control are founded on the LTV and liquidations. LTV imposes an upper limit on the amount of a collateral that can be borrowed by a user. In case of collateral falling and the position turns to be insecure, this protocol may cause liquidation. Part of the debt is lost through liquidators and bonus-discounted collateral being taken, and this assists in protecting the system. At this point data is becoming the driver of demand. MUTM is priced at $0.04 in Phase 7. The Presale began in early 2025 at $0.01, $0.04 in Phase 1 and Phase 2 respectively and therefore this increase to $0.04 will be a 300 increase through phases. Mutuum Finance boasts of $19.6M raised, approximately 18,700 holders, and 822M tokens sold to date. First Analyst Target V1 is being prepared followed by finalization on Sepolia testnet before mainnet Mutuum Finance has said it will come soon, followed by Sepolia testnet, then mainnet. V1 is made up of basic components such as the Liquidity Pool, mtToken, the Debt Token, and a Liquidator Bot and ETH and USDT are initial assets to be lent out, borrowed and to be used as collateral. The change in attention includes security as well. Mutuum Finance provides an example of 90/100 CertiK token scan and indicates that Halborn Security just had its V1 lending and borrowing code independently audited. It has also cited a $50k bug bounty, which opens more widespread testing stress. These steps reduce the “unknowns” that usually surround new DeFi crypto launches, since audits and bounties are aimed at catching weak points before large liquidity arrives. Early investor sentiment indicates that visible security work helps build baseline trust, which can widen participation and make the project easier to track with more confidence. Some analysts believe this is why MUTM is appearing on more watchlists, with expectations that stronger trust and smoother rollout conditions can support token appreciation over time if usage grows. mtTokens and Demand One of the mechanics is the use of mtTokens. Users will get mtTokens which represent their pool position when they provide assets. The mtTokens will in the long run be able to reflect earned yield of borrowing activity. Oracles support that system. The design of Mutuum Finance also expects Chainlink style price feeds, fallback options, and potential aggregated sources. Proper pricing is an important issue since it drives liquidations and maintains LTV regulations in swingy markets. This is the x increases that are discussed by analysts. Under a bullish scenario, estimates record that a 7x projection within the price range of $ 0.04 would bring MUTM within the price range of $0.28. That is not because of it, yet it is the type of positive returns that attract individuals seeking the next great crypto beneath $0.05. Why Analysts compare this Setup to Early Solana Other analysts have likened the operations of MUTM to the initial Solana not that the initiatives are parallel but because the trend is used to. A clear build. A strong focus on shipping. A late-notice and rapid-catch-on market. Mutuum Finance is working towards a scalable lending stack. It is geared towards the two markets, based on structure borrowing conditions, and risk management measures such as LTV and liquidations. It also describes oracle infrastructure and a stablecoin track, which leads to a larger vision of DeFi platforms. This is why MUTM appears in the first place in crypto-related topics even before the mainnet is launched. Assuming that the delivery of V1 remains on time, some analysts assume that the project may cease to be a new crypto coin but will be a well-observed Altcoin at the end of Q1 2026.

The flagship cryptocurrency briefly lost its hold above the $90,000 mark after US President Donald Trump announced the capture of the Venezuelan leader, Nicolas Maduro. While the long-term impact of the latest US military strikes on the cryptocurrency market remains unknown, the Bitcoin price seems to be gearing up for an upward move in the short term. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data suggests that the cryptocurrency market leader could potentially reach a correction low. Could A Bottom Be Forming For BTC Price? Crypto analyst Darkfost revealed in a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform that the most reactive group of Bitcoin investors, known as short-term holders (STHs), have remained under pressure, as the BTC price oscillates between the $85,000 and $92,000 levels. Darkfost shared that the Bitcoin short-term holders have their estimated cost basis around $103,000, after accounting for the on-chain impact of Coinbase’s recent large BTC transfers . Based on data from CryptoQuant, the average unrealized losses for this investor cohort stand at around 15%. As Darkfost explained in their Quicktake post, this figure was arrived at based on the percentage deviation from the short-term holder cost basis. “Using this approach makes it possible to identify periods when the most reactive and sensitive investors in the market are under stress,” the on-chain analyst said. From a historical perspective, when Bitcoin short-term holders witness significant drawdowns, and their average unrealized losses stand at around 15%, the formation of a correction low is often next for the premier cryptocurrency. According to Darkfost, BTC could be staring at a similar situation here. However, the crypto analyst noted that this signal could be false, especially if the Bitcoin price is at the start of an extended bear market. A deep or prolonged bear market could cause the STH’s unrealized losses to stay above 15% for longer periods or open the door to persistent distribution. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $91,160, reflecting a more than 1% jump in the past 24 hours.

The chart focuses on the weekly XRP/USD pair and maps out a structure that could send XRP to $27. Rather than reacting to short-term volatility, the chart centers on a large cup and handle pattern that unfolded over an extended period. XRP’s rise to its all-time high in July 2025 marked the completion of the cup. What followed was a controlled decline that persisted through the remainder of 2025. That decline formed the handle portion of the pattern. This extended consolidation also aligned with corrective wave behavior on the Elliott Wave pattern shown on the chart. $XRP : Confluence with our $27 macro targets. FIBS never lie. Patience wins every time. https://t.co/pCouW0xN6E pic.twitter.com/HlSaWb1oR5 — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 2, 2026 Cup and Handle Structure Aligns With Wave 2 Completion According to the labeling on ChartNerd’s chart, XRP completed a macro Wave 1 advance before entering a prolonged Wave 2 correction. The handle phase coincides with this corrective move. XRP respected multiple Fibonacci retracement levels during the decline, including the 61.80% and 78.60% zones. The chart also marks an 88.70% retracement near $1.84, which acts as a key invalidation level. Despite multiple dips below this level , XRP quickly recovered and continued within the handle pattern. With XRP near the end of the cup, a confirmed breakout would signal the transition from Wave 2 into Wave 3. Wave 3 Targets Point to Double-Digit Levels Wave 3 is typically the strongest impulse in Elliott Wave theory. ChartNerd’s chart projects Wave 3 targets using Fibonacci extensions from the prior impulse. The first major extension sits at 161.80%, placing the price near $5.59. Higher extensions cluster around $7.17 and $13.45, based on the 261.80% and intermediate projections marked on the chart. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 These levels align with Wave 3, reinforcing the analyst’s view that a breakout from the handle would represent a major move. The chart shows no intermediate resistance zones between the breakout area and those targets, which supports the idea of a sharp expansion phase if momentum enters the market. Wave 5 and the $27 Macro Target Beyond Wave 3, the chart extends projections into Wave 5. Fibonacci extensions between 161.80% and 261.80% place final targets in the $19 to $28 range. The upper projection aligns with the $27 macro target referenced in ChartNerd’s post. Wave 4 is projected as a consolidation zone between Wave 3 and Wave 5, with retracement levels marked near $4.15 and $6.14. That range suggests volatility but not structural failure if XRP reaches it after a Wave 3 advance. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The breakthrough marks the culmination of a decade-long technical journey that began with Buterin’s first data availability sampling commit in 2015 and early ZKEVM development around 2020. “ These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network ,” Buterin wrote in a post on X, describing how the protocol now delivers decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously, a feat previously considered impossible. Now that ZKEVMs are at alpha stage (production-quality performance, remaining work is safety) and PeerDAS is live on mainnet, it's time to talk more about what this combination means for Ethereum. These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 3, 2026 Technical Milestone Reshapes Blockchain Architecture Buterin explained that early peer-to-peer networks faced stark limitations, with BitTorrent offering massive bandwidth and decentralization but no consensus mechanism. At the same time, Bitcoin achieved decentralization and consensus at the cost of extremely low throughput due to replicated rather than distributed work. Ethereum’s new architecture breaks this pattern by splitting computational work across nodes while maintaining cryptographic verification of all state transitions. ZKEVMs have achieved production-quality performance, with proving times dropping from 16 minutes to 16 seconds and costs falling 45-fold, with 99% of Ethereum blocks now provable in under 10 seconds on target hardware. Meanwhile, PeerDAS enables nodes to verify data availability by sampling small portions rather than downloading entire blocks, dramatically expanding throughput without sacrificing decentralization. The Ethereum Foundation set a security-first roadmap requiring teams to achieve 128-bit provable security by the end of 2026, with intermediate milestones at 100-bit security by May 2026 and mandatory integration with the soundcalc security estimation tool by February. Ethereum Foundation prioritizes zkEVM security over speed with a new 2026 roadmap targeting 128-bit provable security standards. #Ethereum #Roadmap https://t.co/MI00jkIF91 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 21, 2025 “ If an attacker can forge a proof, they can forge anything: mint tokens from nothing, rewrite state, steal funds, ” the foundation warned in December, emphasizing that performance gains cannot compromise cryptographic integrity. George Kadianakis from the foundation’s cryptography team stressed the importance of securing architectures before they become moving targets. “ Once teams have hit these targets and zkVM architectures stabilize, the formal verification work we’ve been investing in can reach its full potential, ” he wrote, noting that recent advances in compact polynomial commitment schemes like WHIR and techniques such as JaggedPCS now make ambitious security targets achievable. Rollout Timeline Extends Through 2030 Buterin outlined a four-year deployment schedule beginning with large non-ZKEVM-dependent gas limit increases in 2026 through Balance Attack Limits and enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation, alongside the first opportunities to run ZKEVM nodes. Between 2026 and 2028, developers will implement gas repricing, state structure changes, and the migration of execution payloads into blobs to safely support higher throughput. By 2027 through 2030, Buterin expects ZKEVM validation to become the primary block verification method as gas limits increase substantially beyond current capacity. The roadmap also includes distributed block building as a third critical component, with Buterin describing a “ long-term ideal holy grail ” in which full blocks are never concentrated in a single location, reducing centralized interference risks and improving geographic fairness. While celebrating technical progress, Buterin warned in a separate January 1 post that Ethereum must resist the urge to chase “ fleeting trends ” like tokenized dollars or political memecoins. “ Ethereum needs to do more to meet its own stated goals, ” he wrote, calling for applications that pass the “ walkaway test ” by continuing to function even if original developers disappear and remain stable regardless of external disruptions, including hypothetical scenarios like Cloudflare being compromised by state actors. Vitalik Buterin calls on Ethereum to focus on long-term decentralization goals rather than chasing fleeting trends like tokenized dollars and political memecoins in 2026. #Ethereum #VitalikButerin https://t.co/sB4aFA9OfT — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 1, 2026 The co-founder also cautioned separately last month that the protocol complexity undermines trustlessness by limiting the number of people who can understand the system end-to-end. “ If only five people can understand how your privacy protocol works, you haven’t achieved trustlessness, you’ve just changed who you trust, ” privacy network INTMAX stated, echoing Buterin’s concern that growing technical abstractions risk concentrating functional control among experts. Institutional adoption continues to accelerate despite these architectural challenges, with Ethereum’s total value locked projected to rise tenfold in 2026 . Already, JPMorgan is launching a $100 million tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum, and Deutsche Bank is developing a Layer 2 using ZKsync technology, alongside 24 financial institutions testing asset tokenization under Singapore’s regulatory framework.

The announcement comes just as DeFiLlama published its top 10 protocol list by total value locked (TVL), naming Aave as the number one in the report. ETH deposits on Aave protocol reached a new record high. Source: Token Terminal Aave has seen record highs in Ethereum deposits since 2025 To truly appreciate how far Aave has come in 2026, one needs to zoom out and return to 2024, which is around the time when TVL started to take off on Aave. The borrowed liquidity metric also paints a clearer picture of the utility the network has come to be associated with. Between 2024 and 2025, the Aave protocol processed billions in debt, recording just over $3 billion in borrowed funds at the start of 2024, a figure that ballooned to over $30.5 billion when it reached an all-time high in September 2025. In the same year, Aave saw its highest monthly revenue reach $14.4 million in January, with revenue crossing $13 million in September before ending the year at $7.57 million. All that has positioned Aave as the top lending protocol . As of January 2026, its overall TVL has reached $35 billion, and most of it is parked in the Ethereum mainnet. Going into 2026, Aave still leads the lending industry, and its relationship with ETH only solidifies that link. Token Terminal called the arrangement between both chains a win-win situation because, as Aave creates demand for ETH, ETH expands the revenue-generation capacity of Aave. This has spurred investor confidence in the Aave protocol and kept it ahead of other lending protocols. Aside from the Aave platform , Compound Finance, Morpho, and Spark, the lending arm of MakerDAO, also reported high ETH deposits. Vitalik Buterin is bullish on Aave’s role in Ethereum According to an article from Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, low-risk DeFi like Aave has the potential to become the “search” to Ethereum, which he likened to “Google.” According to him, low-risk DeFi is a great solution because it has irreplaceable value and is good for sustainability due to its ability to generate significant transaction fees without becoming a parasite. Buterin also mentioned how, unlike Google’s ad model, which is focused on data harvesting, low-risk DeFi is a great option because it does not unnecessarily subject the L1 to pressure for the sake of speed. As far as he is concerned, this signals alignment and makes more sense as a revenue generator. He claimed it also makes it easier to defend Ethereum’s impact because its biggest use case would not be to facilitate “digital monkey” sales. Buterin called low-risk DeFi a stepping stone that can ultimately help the Ethereum ecosystem get closer to its more advanced goals. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

According to market analyst Xaif Crypto, the altcoin saw an extraordinary $23 million in global trading volume in just one minute, fueling fresh speculation, excitement, and debate over its near-term price direction. Such sudden volume surges are rare and often mark a turning point in market dynamics. Trading volume captures the intensity and conviction of buyers and sellers, and when it spikes this rapidly, it usually signals aggressive participation from whales, institutional players, or coordinated trading activity. In XRP’s case, a one-minute volume explosion points to an extraordinary influx of liquidity hitting the market all at once. Volume spikes of this scale often foreshadow sharp volatility, signaling the start of a decisive price move in either direction based on market sentiment and sustained demand. Therefore, XRP’s surge is widely viewed as bullish, suggesting aggressive accumulation or strategic positioning ahead of a potential breakout, especially with price already climbing to around $2.09, according to CoinCodex data . Several factors may be contributing to this sudden influx of activity. XRP has long been a closely watched asset due to its utility in cross-border payments and its ongoing relevance in discussions around crypto regulation and institutional adoption. Any renewed optimism around these themes can rapidly translate into trading momentum, especially for a high-liquidity asset like XRP. Market watchers also emphasize the psychological impact of such events. A $23 million trade volume in just one minute creates a powerful narrative, drawing in retail traders who fear missing out and amplifying short-term momentum. This feedback loop can further increase volatility, reinforcing XRP’s reputation as one of the market’s most reactive and closely monitored altcoins. Well, Xaif Crypto’s observation underscores one undeniable reality that XRP is firmly back in the spotlight. Whether this surge marks the early stages of a larger move or a brief flash of heightened speculation, the market is watching closely. Notably, XRP’s one-minute, $23 million volume surge serves as a reminder of how quickly momentum can ignite in the crypto space, and how important it is to stay informed and vigilant. Conclusion XRP’s staggering $23 million trading volume in a single minute underscores its ability to command intense market attention almost instantly. As noted by Xaif Crypto, the surge reflects strong participation, deepening liquidity, and rising speculation around XRP’s next move. While such spikes don’t guarantee a sustained rally, they often signal pivotal moments where market sentiment can quickly shift. Whether fueled by institutional positioning, renewed confidence, or broader momentum, the event reaffirms XRP’s relevance in today’s crypto market.

Brussels prepares fresh tech crackdown despite US pressure The European Commission plans to put greater emphasis on making sure tech giants comply with digital regulations in 2026, according to officials and lawmakers in Brussels. This shift comes after several years spent creating sweeping new laws designed to rein in powerful technology platforms. The enforcement push carries significant political risk. Trump’s team has already called for modifications to Europe’s tech legislation and warned that tariffs could be imposed if European authorities continue targeting Silicon Valley firms. European regulators find themselves walking a tightrope. They want to uphold their digital laws while avoiding a trade dispute across the Atlantic or pushing Trump closer to Russia regarding Ukraine. Teresa Ribera, who leads competition policy for the EU, spoke plainly about the challenge in an interview with the Financial Times. She said there have been times when she needed to be direct with US counterparts, telling them Europe would not reverse its regulations simply because they objected to them. The strategy centers on maintaining two major pieces of legislation. The Digital Markets Act targets what regulators call online gatekeepers, requiring them to open their platforms to competitors. The Digital Services Act pushes internet companies to do more to stop illegal material on their sites. People involved in implementing these laws said the real work has always happened away from public view, focusing on getting companies to follow the rules rather than announcing big penalties. Both Apple and Meta adjusted their operations after receiving fines during the spring months. The changes addressed specific concerns raised by European authorities. Brussels has started looking into new potential violations. Last month, investigators began examining whether Meta blocks competing artificial intelligence developers from using WhatsApp. They also launched a probe into how Google uses material found online to train its AI systems. Separate investigations were opened to check if there is adequate competition among cloud computing providers. Fiona Scott Morton, who studies antitrust issues at Yale University, described the approach as measured and professional. She noted that officials might be keeping a lower profile than they otherwise would because public announcements offer little advantage in the current climate. Still, she emphasized that moving forward with enforcement delivers real benefits for European citizens and businesses. Some technology cases will inevitably attract widespread notice. European officials must decide how aggressively to pursue their case against Google over claims it gives preference to its own offerings in search results. This includes determining whether to levy substantial fines against Alphabet, the search engine’s parent company. The Digital Services Act could prove even trickier to enforce this year. So far, the emphasis has been on safeguarding children online, ensuring online marketplaces like Temu and Shein operate safely, and combating financial scams. These topics have support from officials on both sides of the Atlantic. European officials acknowledged this was partly a deliberate choice given the political sensitivities surrounding the law. Washington hits back after X penalty Last month brought a turning point when the commission fined X, owned by Elon Musk, €120 million for breaking transparency requirements. The penalty triggered harsh criticism of Europe from US government officials, while Musk called for abolishing the EU entirely. That same month, the United States imposed a visa ban on Thierry Breton, a former EU commissioner, along with four other individuals. Washington accused them of censorship and pressuring American social media platforms. US officials specifically targeted Breton for his role in creating the Digital Services Act and for warning Musk that X needed to follow rules about illegal content. Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, said the US was taking action to prevent key figures in what he called the global censorship-industrial complex from entering the country. He warned the list could grow if others did not change their approach. Meanwhile, European legislators and advocacy groups are urging Brussels to accelerate more delicate investigations. These include examining whether X is doing enough to stop illegal content from spreading and looking into whether TikTok influenced elections. Legal experts and officials argue that Europe could take much stronger action regarding competition in artificial intelligence. Damien Geradin, an antitrust attorney who has represented companies in cases involving Google and others, pointed out that enforcing EU digital regulations has become harder because of the aggressive position taken by the current US administration. Political factors have given major technology companies confidence to push back through intense lobbying in both Europe and America. Google said the EU’s investigation into its AI models threatens to hamper innovation in a highly competitive market. Apple has demanded that Brussels eliminate the Digital Markets Act completely. Meta criticized the commission for trying to disadvantage successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different rules. Mario Marinello, who works with the Brussels think tank Bruegel, warned that yielding to internal or external pressure on enforcement would harm the European economy. He said strong competition enforcement is necessary for competitiveness. Alexandra Geese, a European parliament member with the Greens, argued that even current enforcement efforts are inadequate and delayed. She described the situation as an assault on democracy led by tech oligarchs through social media, with Europe failing to mount an adequate defense.

Former SWIFT CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt highlights the promise and challenges of bringing digital assets into traditional finance. “I think that the big part of Ripple’s value proposition is the cryptocurrency XRP,” Leibbrandt acknowledged, noting that banks remain hesitant to adopt it due to currency volatility. His remarks show the cautious stance of global financial institutions, where the promise of faster, cheaper cross-border payments is tempered by the risks of fluctuating digital asset values. SWIFT’s cautious stance is largely driven by the uncertain legal status of cryptocurrencies like XRP. With regulations still evolving across jurisdictions, risk-averse banks face potential legal and compliance pitfalls that often outweigh operational benefits. Experts note that until regulatory clarity improves, large-scale adoption of digital currencies by banks remains unlikely. Despite regulatory and volatility challenges, crypto adoption in traditional finance is accelerating. Ripple’s XRP, built for cross-border payments, delivers faster settlements, lower fees, and greater transparency than conventional banking systems. SWIFT’s eventual integration of XRP could transform international transfers, replacing slow, costly processes with efficient, near-instant transactions. Leibbrandt indicates that SWIFT is closely watching the crypto space and could move once volatility eases and regulatory clarity improves, especially as Crypto Clarity & Market Structure Bills progress. As the ecosystem matures, adopting digital assets may shift from a tech upgrade to a strategic necessity for banks to stay competitive. Conclusion SWIFT’s adoption of XRP depends on clearer regulations and stabilized markets, but its impact could be transformative. By combining traditional banking with cryptocurrency efficiency, XRP promises faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments. As regulatory frameworks evolve, this move marks a pivotal step toward integrating digital assets into mainstream finance, positioning XRP as a cornerstone of the future global payment system.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-04 15:58:50

Increasingly, experts now describe MUTM as the number one cryptocurrency investment choice that investors should opt for today. Having already raised $19,600,000 and with 18,660 supporters on board, early adopters are set to gain massively. For example, an initial investment of as little as $1,000 will procure 25,000 units of the MUTM token. Assuming that the subsequent hype creates a market value of $0.50 per token, as predicted, the profit potential will be 12.5x the initial buy. Cardano Price Cardano has just observed the first golden cross of the year 2026, as the 9-day moving average crossed above the 26-day average at the value of $0.3380. The trading volume increased by 31.35%, pulling the price of ADA to a temporary high of $0.3429. However, Cardano’s current development has some risks involved. Its Relative Strength Index is now close to the oversold area with a value of 33.85. Without any new utilities and improved fundamentals, Cardano continues to be undermined by bearish reversals, causing large investors to search for opportunities in assets that offer clearer growth triggers, making MUTM the most advantageous cryptocurrency to buy, even without focusing on trading trends. Unlike ADA, MUTM is already in a position to reward investors with 30x returns in months, similar to Cardano’s early returns. Consequently, choosing MUTM now proves to be a better choice than investing in ADA. Mutuum Finance Sees Growth Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 7 with tokens costing $0.04. This is 300% more from Phase 1’s price of $0.01. Given the pace of filling up of the presale, now is the last chance to buy MUTM tokens at this price before Phase 8 kicks in with a price rise. Over 18,660 individuals have already placed investments to raise $19,600,000. Putting off purchases will mean increased prices for the same tokens. Buyers can take advantage of the best possible prices before the tokens start trading from $0.06 in the open market. MUTM is thus an appealing choice to investors who are looking to benefit from a fast rising project with a 30x ROI well within reach. In essence, those who spend even $50 to buy MUTM now will get over $1500 in a matter of months. The more investors spend, the more they gain from this project. Price Forecast Those acquiring the coin currently are poised to realize a gain of around 400% based on the impending market launch price of $0.06. Analysts peg the innate drivers of demand in the project, protocol revenue share, multi-chain strategies, and the expansion of liquidity pools, as a result of which the value of MUTM may just exceed the barrier of $0.15 in the subsequent months after the launch. An investment of $2,000 currently will purchase 50,000 tokens, of which the value at $0.15 will be $7,500, registering a gain of $5,500. Strong Security Creates Confidence Security is essential for investor trust, and as such, Mutuum Finance has undergone a thorough Halborn Security audit for their lending and borrowing contracts. Halborn’s audit is now complete and all their recommendations incorporated before MUTM’s V1 protocol launch . This is critical in an industry where unaudited contracts often see exploits in the tens of millions, as was witnessed with other DeFi projects. Portable Risk Parameters & Stability Tools Loan-to-Value ratios are set between 72% to 78% for well-established coins, while ratios are between 33% to 38% for more volatile instruments. If a lender’s collaterals fall below liquidation ratios, automated smart contract liquidations occur to ensure a healthy environment within the system. The borrowing system supports a minimum amount of additional collaterals, where $12,500 worth of deposited ETH could allow a user to borrow $9,000 worth of stablecoins with a Loan-to-Value ratio of 72%. Lenders on the other hand earn mtTokens, which are ERC-20 deposit receipts allocated in a proportional manner (e.g., 8,000 USDC deposited results in an allocation of 8,000 mtUSDC), passively accruing interest between 10% to 12% APY. Positioning for Long Term Gains With a highly attractive presale, audited infrastructure, and innovations targeting the DeFi market, Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the top options for cryptocurrency investments. Those involved in Phase 7 are positioned for capturing huge gains as adoption grows.

Dogecoin, the largest meme coin by market capitalization, has jumped by nearly 24% since the turn of the year. According to the latest on-chain data, the price of Dogecoin appears to be in a critical region at the moment. The relevance of this zone suggests that the meme coin may be merely at the start of an extended upward trend over the next few months. Is It Time To Buy DOGE? In a January 3 post on X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson said that Dogecoin has entered its most important accumulation zone. This on-chain observation is based on the recent changes in the CVDD (Cumulative Value Days Destroyed) Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Flips Into Negative Territory— Is The Recovery Back On? For context, the CVDD Channel is an on-chain indicator that tracks the volume of aged capital being sent into the market (Dogecoin, in this case). This metric is typically used in highlighting zones of long-term support or resistance based on the movement of aged coins on-chain. Wedson highlighted in his post that the CVDD channels depend on Fibonacci-based levels on top of the CVDD curve. This metric creates historical value zones where price tends to react; with the blue CVDD lines, for instance, acting as strong structural support for the price of Dogecoin. As observed in the chart above, DOGE’s recent surge to around $0.15 came after its price bounced from the first blue level. In essence, these lower blue levels have historically proven to be good support cushions for the Dogecoin price. According to Wedson, the lower CVDD Fibonacci zones often coincide with long-term accumulation phases for Dogecoin. Hence, it might be time to accumulate the meme coin, especially as its price is wedged within the blue CVDD zones. Dogecoin Price Outlook 2026 As of this writing, the price of DOGE stands at around 0.1415, reflecting an over 2% jump in the past 24 hours. A broader look at the chart shows that Dogecoin seems to be heating up at the moment. According to data from CoinGecko, the meme coin’s value has increased by more than 15% in the last seven days.
