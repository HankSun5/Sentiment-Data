Synthetix Coin price analysis shows an upward trend regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has increased to $1.14 in the last 24 hours. If the bullish momentum continues, the SNX price might retest resistance at the $1.27 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan‚Äôs SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $5.24 by 2030. Why is SNX up? The cryptocurrency market is in a bullish mode, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting positive sentiment as the SNX price increased to $1.14, gaining a massive 25.72% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.21 for the current year, which is still quite higher than the current Synthetix price. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2031. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level after 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts‚Äô price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don‚Äôt expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $5.24, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $5.24 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Source: Coinmarketcap Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3, as per historical SNX market data. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token‚Äôs price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and in July, the token peaked at $0.781. In August, SNX‚Äôs average price remained around $0.65, and at the start of September, it is trending near $0.67 as the current sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,SNX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-27 20:30:00

One expert noted that XRP has just printed a rare and bullish setup, with multiple chart indicators aligning in support of upward momentum. XRP Price Forms Rare Multi-Layered Bullish Setup According to crypto market expert Bobby A, XRP is in a rare market position, consolidating above key historical levels while preparing for a move that could lead to new all-time highs. He noted that different indicators are aligning in support of a possible uptrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Again? $10 Million Stock Buyback Sparks Fresh Price Hopes In a chart shared on X social media, Bobby explained that XRP‚Äôs market capitalization has been holding above its 2018 peak for more than 300 days, an uncommon show of strength amid the recent downturn. This long consolidation above a major resistance-turned support level suggests a massive build-up of energy before the next leg higher. He argues that this base formation signals a potentially explosive move to the upside, with the next market cap targets identified at $173 billion and a peak around $727 billion. On the price front, Bobby reveals that XRP has been forming a multi-month bullish flag pattern on its charts. He labels the critical support zones as ‚ÄúBase Camp 1‚Äù around $1.9 and ‚ÄúBase Camp 2‚Äù at $2.89‚Äîboth of which have been successfully defended. He further highlighted that the monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also positioning itself for one final push toward overbought territory, often a precursor to a sharp upward move. Based on his projections, XRP‚Äôs take profit zones sit between $5 and $13, levels that would mark fresh all-time highs. Bobby‚Äôs analysis highlights that XRP‚Äôs indicators are ‚Äúfiring on all cylinders,‚Äù with momentum across higher timeframes aligning for a potentially powerful surge. He further pointed out that Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), currently at 58.7%, is set to retrace toward the mid-to-low 40% zone soon. Such a move would enable altcoins like XRP to capture a larger market share, thereby reinforcing the likelihood of a bullish breakout. The analyst described this rare alignment as a generational setup that occurs only a few times in a decade. Bearish Divergence Sparks Short-Term XRP Sell-Off While XRP appears to be resisting the present market downturn, not all analysts share an immediate bullish sentiment. Crypto expert JD has warned about a Bearish Divergence forming on XRP‚Äôs weekly chart‚Äîa signal that has now played out as expected. As shown in the chart, while XRP‚Äôs price made higher highs, the RSI indicator printed lower highs, creating a textbook Bearish Divergence pattern. This divergence has already led to a sharp 27% correction from the $3.37 take profit level that JD had previously identified. According to him, many market participants are now questioning why XRP has been under pressure despite broader optimism. Related Reading: Hyperliquid‚Äôs Days Numbered? Expert Forecasts ‚ÄòPainful Death‚Äô JD argues that the Bearish Divergence was the clearest warning signal, and those who ignored it are now witnessing its full effect. He cautions that while XRP may still avoid a deeper breakdown into the ‚Äúgrey box‚Äù supply zone, the short-term trajectory remains bearish until momentum resets.

This week, a significant trend has emerged: a growing number of Solana (SOL) holders are diversifying into a new AI project, Ruvi AI (RUVI). This migration is putting a major spotlight on the newcomer, whose fast-paced presale, lucrative early bonuses, and explosive demand are creating a powerful wave of market-wide FOMO. This surge in attention is fueled by a presale that is performing at a truly historic level. Ruvi AI has officially stormed past the $4 million fundraising milestone, selling over 285 million tokens in a remarkably short period. Analysts are highlighting that this sales velocity is exceptionally rare, a feat typically seen only in projects that go on to become industry titans. The demand is so intense that after a rapid sell-out of Phase 2, Ruvi AI saw 20% of its Phase 3 supply claimed in just days , growing its global community to over 3,900 holders. Why Solana Holders Are Making the Move Solana investors are known for backing projects with strong technology and high growth potential. Their move into Ruvi AI signals a belief that it possesses these same qualities, but with the added advantage of a ground-floor entry point. While SOL has already delivered massive returns, its large market cap limits its potential for another 100x run. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, offers the perfect combination of a low-cap opportunity, the powerful AI narrative, and a clear mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . The project‚Äôs credibility has been a key factor in attracting this wave of savvy investors. A successful smart contract audit by CyberScope has verified its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap provides the transparency that today‚Äôs market demands. This combination of a powerful vision, verifiable security, and overwhelming demand is why Ruvi AI is capturing the attention of some of crypto‚Äôs most successful communities. The Super App Fueling the FOMO The engine driving Ruvi AI‚Äôs explosive growth is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is engineered to become an indispensable tool for content creators, which will in turn generate powerful, organic demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving users a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency and output. Urgent: A Guaranteed 40% Price Increase Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . With 20% of this stage already sold out at record speed, this ground-floor opportunity is rapidly closing. According to the project‚Äôs official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. The project‚Äôs VIP bonus structure is designed to maximize returns from this anticipated rally: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures deep liquidity upon launch, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway further rewards early supporters, strengthening its unstoppable momentum. The Next Big Opportunity Is Here The movement of Solana holders into Ruvi AI is a major vote of confidence. It shows that smart money is identifying this project as the next big opportunity. With its record-breaking presale, powerful utility, and incredible early bonuses, Ruvi AI is on a path to becoming one of this cycle‚Äôs biggest success stories. The time to join this movement is now.

Currently, the XRP and Solana ETFs appear to be next in line to hit the market, pending the approval of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On Thursday, September 25, Bitcoinist reported that the final spot XRP and Solana amendments are expected before the end of this week. As expected, many potential issuers have updated their applications to launch the Solana exchange-traded fund in the United States. Is SEC Approval For SOL ETF Inevitable? On Friday, September 26, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart shared on the social media platform X a bunch of updated applications for the spot Solana ETF prospectuses. According to the expert, this wave of amendments shows signs of movement between the issuers and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. These latest updates to the applications mean that the launch of a spot Solana ETF is closer than ever. As indicated by Bloomberg expert Eric Balchunas in response to Seyffart‚Äôs post on X, investors can begin the final countdown to the approval of these crypto-linked investment products. As earlier reported by Bitcoinist , ETF Store president Nate Geraci had already predicted that the final batch of amendments to the Solana ETF applications would come in before the close of this week. Geraci arrived at this conclusion after the SEC‚Äôs new generic listing standards resulted in the approval of the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF. These ‚Äúgeneric listing standards‚Äù opened a door for firms to be able to issue spot exchange-traded products besides Bitcoin and Ether. According to the SEC, exchanges will now be able to list qualifying crypto-linked ETFs without first submitting a proposed rule change (19b-4). Spot Solana ETF To Include Staking: Expert In a Friday post on X , Geraci also acknowledged the flurry of S-1 amendments for the spot Solana ETF applications. Some of the potential issuers with new updates to their filings include: Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, CoinShares, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, and Canary, according to the ETF Store.

Digital asset treasury (DAT) firms are publicly traded companies that raise capital to acquire and manage crypto on their balance sheets. In a Sept. 23 blog post and an accompanying thread on X, Watkins said DATs already hold roughly $105 billion in assets across bitcoin, ether and other majors, a scale that few market participants have fully considered. His core claim: a small number of these firms may mature into durable operators that help finance, govern and build within the networks whose tokens they hold. Beyond speculation Watkins said most attention has fixated on near-term trading dynamics ‚Äî premiums to net asset value, fundraising announcements and ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the next token‚Äù‚Äîwhich misses the larger arc. ‚ÄúWe imagine select DATs becoming for-profit, publicly traded counterparts to crypto foundations, but with broader mandates to deploy capital, operate businesses, and participate in governance,‚Äù he wrote. Because some DATs already control meaningful slices of token supply, their treasuries can be more than vaults; they can be policy and product levers inside ecosystems. He pointed to crypto-native examples where scale matters: on Solana, RPC providers and proprietary market makers that stake more SOL can improve transaction landing and spread capture; on Hyperliquid, front ends that stake more HYPE can lower user fees or increase take rates without raising costs. Access to large, permanent pools of native assets can help such businesses bootstrap and scale, he said. Programmable money, productive balance sheets Watkins contrasted these plays with MicroStrategy‚Äôs bitcoin-only strategy, which is largely about capital structure around a non-programmable asset. He went on to say that by comparison, tokens on smart contract platforms ‚Äî ETH, SOL, HYPE ‚Äî are programmable and can be put to work on-chain. DATs holding them can stake for fees, supply liquidity, lend, participate in governance and acquire ‚Äúecosystem primitives‚Äù such as validators, RPC nodes or indexers, turning treasuries into yield-generating balance sheets. Structurally, he likened winning DATs to a hybrid of familiar models: the permanent capital of closed-end funds and REITs, the balance-sheet orientation of banks, and the compounding ethos of Berkshire Hathaway. What makes them distinct, he said, is that returns accrue in crypto per share rather than via management fees, making the vehicles closer to pure plays on underlying networks than to traditional asset managers. He argued that tools like common equity, convertibles and preferreds give DATs flexible funding to expand balance sheets, while on-chain yields can help manage that funding over time. Winners‚Äîand risks Watkins cautioned that ‚Äúnot all DATs will make it.‚Äù He expects many first-generation vehicles‚Äîthose heavy on financial engineering and light on operating substance ‚Äî to fade as conditions normalize. As competition intensifies, he anticipates consolidation, experiments with more exotic financing and, at times, reckless balance-sheet moves if premiums flip to discounts and pressure builds. In his view, the survivors will be those that pair disciplined capital allocation with operating chops, recycling cash flows into token accumulation, product building and ecosystem expansion. ‚ÄúOver time, the best managed ones could evolve into the Berkshire Hathaways of their blockchains,‚Äù he wrote.",Markets|Digital Asset Treasury|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-27 21:22:48

After a 9% decline over the past week, the token trades at $0.00001176 , with its market capitalization holding steady at $6.93 billion. This figure aligns with both its fully diluted valuation and unlocked market cap, showing that nearly all tokens are circulating. Despite this, trading activity has slowed significantly, with 24-hour volume falling 42.47% to $110.6 million. The volume-to-market-cap ratio now stands at 1.68%, signaling subdued investor participation. Symmetrical Triangle Consolidation Since May, SHIB has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, a pattern often signaling an imminent breakout. At present, the token is testing a pivotal support level near $0.000011, which coincides with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement. This support has historically acted as a key pivot for price movements, making it a decisive point for the token‚Äôs next directional push. SHIB/USD daily price chart, Source: TradingView Failure to maintain this support could shift market sentiment toward bearish territory. A breakdown below $0.000011 may intensify selling pressure, with the next downside target around $0.000010. This level aligns with the broader ascending support trendline, suggesting buyers could lose control if the token dips further. Conversely, holding this support could pave the way for a rebound toward $0.000013, near the 50% Fibonacci retracement, representing potential upside of roughly 14% from current levels. Technical Indicators Show Mixed Signals SHIB/USD daily price chart, Source: TradingView The MACD line remains below its signal line, while the histogram sits in negative territory, indicating ongoing bearish momentum. Traders may interpret this as a sign of continued selling unless buyers step in to reverse the trend. Meanwhile, the RSI sits at 46.64, reflecting a near-neutral market. This level indicates neither extreme buying nor selling pressure, leaving room for movement in either direction. Liquidation Levels Highlight Balanced Pressure Source: Coinglass Analysis of SHIB‚Äôs liquidation heatmap reveals significant clusters around $0.000012 and $0.0000111. These green-yellow zones indicate concentrated leveraged positions, meaning that aggressive price movements could trigger cascading liquidations. Since liquidity pools are balanced on both sides, the token may continue range-bound trading until either buyers push above $0.000012 or sellers break below $0.0000111. SHIB Futures and Open Interest Source: Coinglass Shiba Inu futures open interest has eased after previous surges, dropping from highs of over $500 million to approximately $177 million. This decline signals lower speculative activity, reduced momentum, and a market in consolidation. Typically, contraction in open interest precedes sideways trading, as participants wait for stronger signals before initiating new positions. ETF Absence Highlights SHIB‚Äôs Limited Institutional Appeal Another factor affecting SHIB‚Äôs momentum is its absence from U.S. spot ETF filings. While rivals like Dogecoin and other meme coins have received multiple ETF proposals, SHIB has largely been ignored by prospective issuers. This indicates a diminishing perception of SHIB‚Äôs relevance among institutional investors, which could weigh on market sentiment.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-27 21:35:03

Regulators believe some investors may have profited from having prior, non-public knowledge of these crypto-treasury announcements, potentially violating fair disclosure rules. Possible Breach of Fair Disclosure Rules The investigation focuses on publicly traded digital asset treasury (DAT) firms, which are companies that declare plans to acquire capital and buy cryptocurrencies. More than 200 DATs went public this year, and some of them are currently in contact with regulators. Regulators identified ‚Äúsuspicious trading patterns‚Äù, including high trading volume spikes and sudden price rises in the days or hours before firms announced their crypto-buying plans. The actions suggest that at least some investors might have been profiting by trading on inside information. SEC officials have already cautioned several companies over potential Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) breaches, a provision requiring material, nonpublic information to be broadly disclosed rather than selectively. The financial watchdog is concerned that some were tipped about impending crypto buys and profited by selling the companies‚Äô stock ahead of the news release. Experts agree that these breaches put market value at risk and expose businesses to legal repercussions and reputational consequences. Even in the larger non-crypto financial market, the agency has never had such reservations about Reg FD violations. Therefore, this level of scrutiny raises the likelihood that crypto-treasury firms will face tighter restrictions in the near future. Corporate Crypto Boom Under the Microscope The investigation occurs against a backdrop of more businesses moving to adopt cryptocurrency. Early movers have already helped digital asset treasuries attract over $20 billion in venture capital this year, with more than $100 billion committed to crypto buying plans. Public firms now hold over 1 million BTC, valued at $113 billion, and 5.26 million ETH, worth $20.6 billion. Monthly DAT raises peaked at $6.2 billion in July, representing the highest single-month total ever recorded. Regulators now face the challenge of ensuring this growing trend does not open new avenues for insider trading and selective disclosure. Advocates argue that investment by corporate treasuries signals confidence in the long-term value of cryptocurrencies. However, there remain concerns over the pace at which companies disclose market information and raise funds, which could encourage selective disclosure, leaks, and manipulative trading. The SEC and FINRA have said that the crypto treasury boom must operate within existing securities laws and are moving proactively against suspicious patterns. If misconduct is uncovered, enforcement action could follow, setting a precedent for future regulation of corporate digital asset adoption.

Mutuum Finance is currently at presale phase 6 for $0.035 and is 50% sold out. The protocol has garnered over $16.4 million from over 16,600 holders already. Mutuum Finance will increase more than 7,250% because of its new double-lending model that unifies Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) models. This new system is about to unleash more efficient liquidity, grow yields, and invite retail and institutional investors, advantages which SHIB, despite all its goliath base, still lacks. As sentiment turns away from meme tokens to utility-based protocols, Mutuum Finance is at the forefront for investors on the prowl for horrifically high returns in the coming bull cycle. Shiba Inu Targets 250% Growth Shiba Inu (SHIB) is back in the center of the market with technical charts pointing towards a probable 250% surge, with key resistance levels nearing the $0.00003400 and $0.00006700 levels, as shown in the chart above. Price activity is showing a strong accumulation base near the $0.00001010 support level, and if SHIB manages to maintain this critical level, there are possibilities of bullish momentum building up. With capital still pouring in towards utility-based protocols over meme coins, Mutuum Finance is a high-upside bet in the ensuing market cycle. MUTM Presale Dominance Mutuum Finance has launched presale stage Six with the tokens valued at $0.035 after a 16.17% increase from the previous round. The demand is strong, with more than 16,600 investors and more than $16.4 million in total capital. As part of promoting security to be included in the platform, Mutuum Finance is announcing a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The bugs have been divided into four divisions to ensure that they are discovered and fixed to their full potential, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The system is based on disciplined collateral management of funds to safeguard the system and counterparties. It is managed through some collateral ratios, credit thresholds, and deposit ceilings. Building An Efficient Platform Efficiency is achieved through reducing Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, especially for overcollateralized credit. Reserve requirements are also a shock-absorber in the market, and excess reserves can be drawn upon for use in risk-absorbing activities for risky assets. The global vision of Mutuum Finance is to reboot the DeFi model on foundations of long-term sustainability, dependability, and usability. The project does not just provide a safe borrowing and lending facility but is also adding into the mix a new generation for decentralized finance to be made available to retail as well as institutional investors. In a bid to encourage early adoption as well as development of community, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway , contest where 10 winners will each get $10,000 in MUTM tokens. This is centered around the project‚Äôs dedication to empowering its supporters while raising funds and giving back in the market. Forget 250%, Mutuum Finance Could Surge 7,250% Shiba Inu‚Äôs possible 250% increase is impressive, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting itself up for something much more impactful. Already in Stage 6 of presale and 50% sold out at a mere $0.035, the project has raised over $16.4 million from over 16,600 investors. Its hybrid lending model of P2P and P2C models and its strong security architecture will provide long-term adoption, high returns, and scalable liquidity. With projections showing a probable 7,250% growth, MUTM is quickly becoming the investor favorite of the day for earning out-of-proportion gains beyond meme coin manias. Those who wish to be prepared for the next DeFi boom need to take action on their MUTM tokens now before the presale vanishes and the price soars.

Estimates for Uniswap‚Äôs average price in 2028 range from $40.04 to $45.76. UNI‚Äôs average price in 2031 will be $71.50, with a maximum price of $74.36. Uniswap, a DeFi protocol founded in 2018 by former mechanical engineer Hayden Adams. The Uniswap exchange is a 100% on-chain automated market maker (AMM) protocol on the Ethereum¬†blockchain.

The altcoin‚Äôs price decreased to $7.54 in the past 24 hours. Overall, the cryptocurrency lost up to 1.44% of its value. Sellers have continued their lead again following the retreat observed yesterday, as resistance appeared around $7.65. This situation also indicates that selling pressure is high around the $8 level, as the coin has faced a recent rejection below that price point. Uniswap price analysis on the daily time frame The one-day price chart of Uniswap coin confirmed a bearish trend in the market. The UNI/USD value has dipped to an intraday low of $7.54. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify a continuous selling pressure and a continuation of a downtrend. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is widening again, leading to an increase in volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $10.75. Whereby its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $7.29. UNI/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the oversold region. The indicator‚Äôs value has been recorded at index 28.61 today, and the decreasing trend is represented by a downward curve on the RSI graph. Further instability in the market can be expected if the selling momentum continues. Uniswap price analysis on 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of Uniswap shows the presence of some degree of buyers‚Äô support. The coin has been struggling to maintain its price above $7, but the price is slowly increasing and may increase further in the coming hours. Moreover, the mild volatility signifies a lower chance of a reversal or more price oscillations. The Bollinger bands are covering less area, leading to mediocre volatility.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin‚Äôs price is decreasing after a continued bearish wave observed over the current trading session. If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI‚Äôs price might plunge below the $7 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $36.22 level by 2027 and above $74.36 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a bearish phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are shedding value, and so is UNI. As sellers gained ground around $7.65, negative sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $17.16, while the average price is expected to be around $14.30. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $9 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $10 and $10.7; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2026. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it‚Äôs worth waiting, as the coin‚Äôs value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI‚Äôs price to reach $74.36 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price. Recent news/opinions on Uniswap Network Uniswap Labs revealed the top tokens swapped by volume during the past week, excluding WBTC, ETH, and stablecoins. LINK, BIO, and PEPE were among the top three tokens swapped on Uniswap apps.

In older systems like Uniswap V2, an LP‚Äôs funds were spread evenly across a price range from zero to infinity. This was inefficient because most trading happens within a very small price range. To solve this, Uniswap V3 introduced concentrated liquidity. This feature allows LPs to choose a specific, or ‚Äúcustom,‚Äù price range on a chart where they want to provide their liquidity.

That search is now leading them to Ruvi AI (RUVI), a newcomer whose record-breaking presale performance is drawing direct comparisons to Tron‚Äôs formative days. As its presale races ahead, experts are confidently predicting that Ruvi AI has the potential to create a new wave of crypto millionaires. This incredible forecast is backed by a presale that is performing at a truly historic level. Ruvi AI has officially soared past the $4 million fundraising milestone, with over 285 million tokens sold at a velocity that has left the market in awe. Analysts are highlighting that such rapid sales are exceptionally rare and are often the hallmark of projects that go on to become industry titans. The demand is undeniable; after a rapid sell-out of Phase 2, Ruvi AI saw 20% of its Phase 3 supply get claimed in just days , growing its global community to over 3,900 holders. Mirroring Tron‚Äôs Path to Success The comparison to Tron‚Äôs early success is not made lightly. Like TRX in its initial stages, Ruvi AI is capturing the market‚Äôs imagination with a powerful vision and overwhelming demand. However, Ruvi AI adds another potent ingredient to the mix: the red-hot AI narrative. Its mission is to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy , a tangible goal that provides a solid foundation for growth. This blend of historic demand, a low entry point, and a powerful, real-world use case is the formula that experts believe could make it a millionaire-maker project. The project‚Äôs credibility has been a key factor in attracting this unprecedented level of investment. A successful smart contract audit by CyberScope has verified its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap provides the transparency and legitimacy that serious investors demand. This combination of powerful fundamentals and verifiable security is what sets Ruvi AI apart as a top-tier opportunity. The Super App Fueling the Millionaire Forecast The engine driving Ruvi AI‚Äôs potential to create new millionaires is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is engineered to become an indispensable tool for content creators, which will in turn generate powerful, organic demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving users a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency and output. Urgent: A Guaranteed 40% Price Increase Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . With 20% of this stage already claimed at a record-breaking pace, this ground-floor opportunity is rapidly disappearing. According to the project‚Äôs official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. The project‚Äôs VIP bonus structure is designed to turn this opportunity into life-changing wealth: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000 , achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway further rewards early supporters, strengthening its unstoppable momentum. The Birth of a New Giant? As the presale continues its historic run, the market is witnessing something special. Ruvi AI is not just another altcoin; it is a project that is mirroring the early success of an industry giant and is on a trajectory to create significant wealth for its early supporters. The opportunity to be part of this journey is here, but it won‚Äôt last long.

52356127,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84520,1759010456,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top 3 ‚ÄúBuy the Dip‚Äù Strategies You Should Know,https://timestabloid.com/top-3-buy-the-dip-strategies-you-should-know/,"A sudden market pullback can feel chaotic: order books shift, sentiment sours, large liquidations cascade. But for those with a plan, dips aren‚Äôt disasters, they are windows for strategic entry. Over the last 12 hours, crypto markets faced another wave of selling pressure, triggering over $1 billion in liquidations as derivative positions unraveled and stop-losses cascaded across exchanges. This kind of volatility is the stage upon which ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù becomes more art than blind optimism. In this environment, having a disciplined approach is nonnegotiable. Not all dips are created equal. Whether you prefer precision entries with confirmation, smoother accumulation via layering, or aggressive bounce snipes in fast markets, each method has its place. And amid all that, there‚Äôs room for speculative optionality, which is where MAGACOIN FINANCE quietly enters your radar. Reversion entry after confirmation The safest dips to buy are those that flirt with established supports and then show signs of exhaustion. You wait for the price to approach a technical zone, whether trendline support, a long timeframe moving average, or historical demand region, and only enter after you see a reversal signal. That could be a strong wick rejection, a bullish engulfing candle, or divergence in RSI or MACD. High conviction comes when that turnaround is supported by rising volume: it suggests smart money is stepping in, not just noise. Because you‚Äôre letting the market reveal its bottom tendencies, you avoid ‚Äúcatching the falling knife.‚Äù The trade is backed by evidence. But it won‚Äôt always trigger: sometimes price breaks through, and your setup fails. In such cases, respect your stop just outside the support zone, and move on On-chain & market context signals Even the best dip strategy underperforms without contextual confirmation. As you scan opportunities, monitor key flows: exchange outflows (accumulation signals), whale transfers, and derivatives liquidation clusters. Recently, heavy liquidations revealed where weak hands were flushed and where resilient players might be stepping in. Combine that with sentiment indicators (fear extremes, social volume) and macro cues from equities and policy shifts. When technical setups and context align, your edge is stronger. It‚Äôs this alignment that separates a lucky entry from a repeatable method. Traders who only focus on charts often miss the behavioral layer: who is buying, who is selling, and whether the overall market environment supports risk-taking. Pairing charts with on-chain data and funding trends creates the discipline needed to avoid gambling in uncertainty. Where MAGACOIN FINANCE fits in Buy-the-dip strategies are everywhere right now, but the biggest question remains: which tokens can actually multiply? While most focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been positioned as a high-beta candidate with outsized upside. Analysts suggest presales like this often deliver dramatic moves when broader markets rebound, with projections floating around 48x multipliers under favorable conditions. The key is its scarcity model: each stage increases in price, forcing urgency among participants. Social engagement shows buyers treating it as a dip entry within the presale cycle itself. Instead of waiting for majors to recover, many are considering MAGACOIN FINANCE as the speculative dip play that could mirror the strategy, but with exponentially higher payoff potential. Layered accumulation strategy When volatility is prolonged, a layered approach becomes your shield. Divide your capital into several tranches and spread entries across dips that meet your criteria, bounce attempts around support, oversold signals, or structural consolidation zones. You‚Äôre not trying to pick a single bottom; you‚Äôre gradually building exposure across multiple points. This method buffers your average entry and guards against committing too early. If the downtrend continues, you still have ammo to deploy. If the bounce begins early, you‚Äôve already locked in part of your position. The key discipline is to never overextend: always leave reserve capital for deeper dips and stick to predetermined sizes per tranche. Many long-term investors, particularly those focused on Bitcoin or Ethereum, swear by this method. It avoids emotional overreactions and turns volatility into an ally. By spreading exposure, you trade stress for structure, and that structure compounds over cycles. Flash dip snipes in fast moves For more aggressive traders, the flash dip snipe is where speed and conviction collide. You scan markets for sharp intraday or intra-block dives, say, sudden 5‚Äì10% moves, and jolt in when reversal cues flash: a rapid wick, order book imbalance flip, or a strong counter volume bar. Your entry is triggered once price moves above the short-term high of that dip. These are adrenaline trades. You‚Äôre not aiming to ride the full rebound, just to catch the bounce. Because the environment is fast, you need tight stop rules and small exposure. Many of these trades reverse quickly; your win target should be modest, your risk control strict. Traders who succeed in this arena rely on preparation: alerts set, capital reserved, and execution automatic. Conclusion ‚ÄúBuy the dip‚Äù isn‚Äôt a single strategy, it‚Äôs a mindset that adapts to conditions. Confirmation entries offer safety and patience. Layering provides balance and risk control. Flash snipes deliver aggression and speed. Each method has a place, and combining them helps investors turn volatility into opportunity. And in this ecosystem of dip strategies, speculative presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE deserve a mention. Its scarcity-driven model, rapid community growth, and audit-backed credibility make it a presale that traders are treating as a dip opportunity in its own right. For investors balancing majors with speculative exposure, it represents the torque side of the portfolio, the piece designed to deliver multiples when markets recover.

The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $110,369 on Friday but failed to retain momentum, ultimately settling at $109,697. Bitcoin traders had reduced bullish positions, indicating mixed market signals ahead of Friday‚Äôs $22 billion monthly Bitcoin options expiry. BlackRock Files For New ETF BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, has registered a Delaware trust company for its new Bitcoin Premium Income ETF. The yield-generating product will use covered call options on BTC futures to collect premiums for regular distributions, trading potential upside for steady income. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called the new ETF a sequel to the $87 billion IBIT, noting that covered call options would provide a BTC yield through options premiums. ‚ÄúBlackRock registered the name iShares Bitcoin Premium ETF, filing coming soon. This is a covered call Bitcoin strategy to give BTC some yield. This will be a '33 Act spot product, sequel to the $87b.‚Äù Delaware trust registrations typically follow S-1 or 19b-4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to begin formal approval processes. The SEC has become increasingly open to crypto investment products under the Trump administration. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT ETF was launched in January 2024 and has registered over $60 billion in inflows. BlackRock Raises Bitcoin Exposure BlackRock‚Äôs global Allocation Fund increased its holdings in IBIT by over 38% during the second quarter, a September 26 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revealed. The fund held 1,000,808 IBIT shares valued at $66.4 million as of July 31. This represents a substantial increase from the 723,332 shares it held as of April 30. Year-over-year growth shows rising Bitcoin adoption within BlackRock‚Äôs portfolio management. IBIT currently represents 0.4% of the Global Allocation Fund‚Äôs $17.1 billion assets under management. This is a 62% increase from the 0.25% allocation during the first quarter. BlackRock has recommended a 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation as a ‚Äúreasonable range‚Äù in its model portfolio on February 28. The fund‚Äôs recent increases in allocations suggest it is moving towards the recommended exposure level through gradual accumulation. BlackRock‚Äôs Global Allocation Fund invests across US and international equities, debt securities, money market investments, and other short-term assets. Next Fed Chair Pick Could Be The Biggest Bull Catalyst Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz believes Bitcoin (BTC) could see a sharp rally if the next Federal Reserve Chair is exceptionally dovish. Speaking during an interview with Kyle Chasse, Novogratz stated, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the potential biggest bull catalyst for Bitcoin and the rest of crypto. Fed‚Äôs cutting when they shouldn‚Äôt be, and you put in a massive dove. Can Bitcoin get to $200K? Of course, it could because it becomes a whole new conversation if that happens.‚Äù However, Novogratz stated that while aggressive rate cuts will be bullish for crypto, they would come at a very steep cost, adding that he hoped they would not happen. ‚ÄúDo I want it to happen? No. Why? Because I kind of love America. It would be really shitty for America. He also stated that there was a real chance the Federal Reserve could lose its independence. Daleep Singh, vice chair and chief global economist at PGIM Fixed Income, echoes Novogratz‚Äôs views, stating, ‚ÄúThere's a very decent chance that the FOMC looks and acts quite differently after Powell‚Äôs term expires in May 2026. On a cyclical basis, I think the risks to the dollar are skewed to the downside.‚Äù Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) hopes for a recovery over the weekend faded as it lost momentum after briefly crossing $110,000 on Friday. The flagship cryptocurrency has endured a brutal week, struggling to recover after two separate crashes over the week took prices below key levels. BTC showed signs of a recovery on Wednesday but suffered a dramatic crash on Thursday, dropping nearly 4% to $109,035. It recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% to $109,697. However, BTC is back in the red, marginally down during the ongoing session. BTC‚Äôs drop to $109,000 on Thursday was its lowest level in three weeks and triggered over $275 million in liquidations, mostly of leveraged bullish positions. Friday‚Äôs options expiry has also failed to breathe life into price action so far, although that could change on Monday. Meanwhile, traders have been reducing their long positions, driving the long-to-short ratio to 1.7x, the lowest in over 30 days. However, BTC‚Äôs drop below $112,000 saw traders reverse course and add upward exposure, with the indicator slowly climbing towards 1.9x in favor of longs. Analysts fear bears could drag prices even lower, with the rebound quickly losing momentum. 10x Research head Markus Thielen stated, ‚ÄúThe bounce back from that dip quickly lost momentum, and with prices now hovering close to this level again, another wave of stop-loss selling could emerge. This comes at a time when many are positioned for a Q4 rally ‚Äî making the bigger surprise not a surge higher, but a correction instead.‚Äù BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.56% and settling at $115,314. The price faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $115,381. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rose 1.26% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,832. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $114,724. It recovered from this level to settle at $116,484, ultimately dropping 0.30% BTC reached an intraday high of $117,998 on Thursday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $117,117. The price lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.22% to $115,690. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend, with BTC registering a marginal increase on Saturday.

The raise comes amid growing rumors that the exchange is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO). The funding round involved participation from several firms and investors, and did not have a lead investor. Kraken Raised $500M Ahead Of Potential IPO Kraken has raised $500 million at a $15 billion valuation as speculation about an initial public offering grows. The funding significantly strengthens the exchange‚Äôs financial position, and was first reported by a report in Fortune, which cited a source close to the negotiations. The report also stated that the funding round had no lead investor and was closed on Kraken‚Äôs terms. Participants in the funding round included venture capital firms, investment managers, and Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi, who invested through his Tribe Capital Fund. Sethi joined Kraken as co-CEO after co-founder Jesse Powell stepped down in 2022, following a federal investigation into his role at a Sacramento-based nonprofit. Powell had named Dave Ripley as his successor after stepping down. However, the exchange announced Sethi‚Äôs appointment as co-CEO last year. Sethi is responsible for Kraken‚Äôs growth over the past year. Paperwork Still Pending Kraken is yet to file any official paperwork for a public listing. However, several of the exchange‚Äôs actions are consistent with companies preparing for an IPO. However, it has yet to submit an S-1 registration statement to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The S-1 registration statement is a necessary step before any public offering in the US. Kraken is one of the oldest exchanges in the cryptocurrency market and was launched in 2013. The exchange ranks among the top 15 global cryptocurrency exchanges and processed around $1.9 billion in trading volume, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Crypto‚Äôs IPO Obsession Kraken‚Äôs public offering comes amid a surge of crypto firms becoming public. Gemini, the Winklevoss brothers-founded exchange, recently went public, and was 20 times oversubscribed during its Nasdaq debut. The exchange raised $425 million on its Nasdaq debut, and its market capitalization has ballooned to $2.8 billion since going public. Meanwhile, USDC issuer Circle completed a billion-dollar IPO in June, with its shares surging 167% on opening day. Blockchain-based lender Figure Technology Solutions also registered an impressive debut, with its market capitalization rising above $8 billion since going public. Crypto custodian BitGo has filed S-1 registration documents with the SEC. The company plans to list its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.

According to multiple reports , the firm is exploring a $15 billion to $20 billion equity raise that could value the company at about $500 billion if the deal is priced at the levels under discussion. Funding Targets And Valuation Based on reports, Tether is looking to sell roughly a 3% stake in the deal, which is how the $500 billion figure is being calculated. The plan, as reported, would involve new shares rather than existing owners selling down their holdings. The raise size under discussion ‚Äî $15‚Äì$20 billion ‚Äî would make this one of the largest private placements seen in the crypto sector. Tether‚Äôs Major Funding Round May Include SoftBank Group and Ark Investment Management According to @Bloomberg , @SoftBank_Group and Ark Investment Management are in talks to participate in a funding round of @Tether_to Holdings SA. The round could value Tether at as much as $500‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/gSmzdf2RJ0 ‚Äî ME (@MetaEraHK) September 26, 2025 Tether‚Äôs USDT token currently has a market cap roughly in the $170 billion to $175 billion range, highlighting why investors are watching the talks closely. The company has expanded its activities beyond issuing stablecoins and is said to be moving into areas such as cloud services, telecom and real estate investments. Potential Backers Join Talks Reports have disclosed that Ark Investment Management, led by Cathie Wood, and SoftBank are among the parties exploring a stake in the round. Cantor Fitzgerald is named as an adviser on the process. None of the interested firms, including Tether, has confirmed a final agreement publicly, and those discussions are described as early-stage. Why would big investors consider this? For one, Tether generates revenue from interest on its reserves, largely held in US Treasuries. One report said Tether made about $13.4 billion in profit last year from such returns. The company also serves roughly 500 million users worldwide, and USDT remains a major on-ramp between fiat currency and crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ether. Regulatory And Profit Details Past scrutiny over reserve disclosures and other controversies means any major investment will draw extra attention from regulators. Observers note that a lofty private valuation could amplify those concerns, especially as Tether moves toward broader business lines and prepares a US-focused stablecoin product reportedly called USAT. Cantor Fitzgerald‚Äôs role and the involvement of big-name investors would likely intensify the public and regulatory spotlight. Talks could still fall apart or change shape. Based on reports, the numbers are ambitious and represent the top end of what Tether is said to be seeking. Investors and regulators are watching closely as details emerge.

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $932.70, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana‚Äôs price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $2,160.19 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the current solana price within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors , driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform‚Äôs continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana‚Äôs innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price action, as indicated by the technical analysis, solana price forecast and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators.

Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL falls to $200 Solana enjoyed bullish momentum as buyers tried to climb past $250, however, the rejection at the level has sent the price falling to the $190 mark. However, the price found support at the level and was able to climb up to $200 where it trades at press time.

SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour chart indicates support around $200. The chart suggests a correction before the bulls can continue upwards. As the price falls back to $200, SOL can be expected to hold steady at the level and continue rising towards the $215 level before finding a strong resistance. However, if the price fails to hold at the level and establish foothold above $215, SOL may fall back to the $192 support continuing the bearish trend. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its robust scalability and speed due to various technological advancements, particularly in the crypto space boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for future growth. Why is SOL down? Solana observed bullish momentum as buyers tried to climb past $250, however, the rejection at the level has sent the price falling to the $200 mark. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of 331.81, driven by fundamental factors in the market. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030, influenced by trends in the broader crypto market . Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset‚Äôs adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential ROI due to its high scalability, Solana‚Äôs low fees, robust ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana‚Äôs forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth¬†with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana‚Äôs (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset‚Äôs volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-27 23:30:00

His remarks come amid growing speculation about possible government involvement with Ripple and increased attention on upcoming regulatory decisions. Community Split on U.S. Government Role Earlier this week, Cryptoinsightuk launched a poll asking whether the U.S. government could eventually acquire a stake in Ripple or take control of part of the XRP escrow. The survey drew thousands of responses, revealing a divided community. Roughly 29.6% of participants believe such a move could occur before 2026, while 27.3% think it might happen during 2026. Another 12.2% expect it later, but the largest share, 30.9%, dismissed the possibility altogether. Analyst Points to October as a Key Month In a follow-up post, the analyst indicated that he sees October as potentially decisive for XRP . He outlined several developments that could take shape in the coming weeks, including the possible approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States and movement on the Clarity Act, a legislative effort aimed at establishing clearer rules for digital assets. I personally feel we are very close to some big news for $XRP . I think ETF in October, then clarity act and with that something big. Whether it‚Äôs the below or something else idk. Charts are kind of lining up for this too. I do think we see something like the below, but when‚Ä¶ https://t.co/loAhHMmOmX ‚Äî Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) September 26, 2025 He also noted the chance of government involvement with Ripple, highlighting past remarks from President Donald Trump, who in March stated that XRP would be among the digital assets held by the government. Some XRP supporters have since speculated that Ripple‚Äôs escrowed XRP could play a role in this plan, though discussion around the topic has lessened in recent weeks. The speculation coincides with the final stage of the XRP ETF approval process . Several issuers, including Grayscale , Bitwise, Canary, and Franklin, submitted their last amendments to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week. Bloomberg analysts currently estimate a 95% probability of approval before the end of the year. Final deadlines for these applications fall between October 10 and October 25. If approved, trading in spot XRP ETFs could begin within days, mirroring the rollout seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Interest Already Growing Even before spot products are introduced, institutional demand for XRP is increasing. The newly launched REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) recorded $37.7 million in natural volume on its first trading day, marking the strongest debut for any U.S. ETF in 2025. Additionally, CME Group‚Äôs XRP futures have crossed $1 billion in open interest, while futures-based XRP ETFs collectively manage more than $800 million in assets. Analysts suggest inflows could exceed $5 billion within weeks if spot ETFs begin trading. Industry figures such as Oliver Michel , CEO of Tokentus Investment AG, believe that altcoins, including XRP, may present the most significant growth potential following ETF approvals, projecting possible gains of up to fourfold. With XRP currently consolidating around the $3 mark, upcoming regulatory decisions and potential Ripple-related announcements may support the ‚Äúmajor news‚Äù that Cryptoinsightuk anticipates. While no official confirmation has been provided, the convergence of regulatory deadlines, institutional momentum, and persistent community speculation makes October an important month for XRP. Whether these expectations result in transformative news or not, the coming weeks are likely to shape the asset‚Äôs market outlook for the remainder of the year.

52360056,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=178703,1759017565,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/52360056.jpeg,"Solana Might Become Wall Street‚Äôs Next Big Bet, While Retailers Found a New Opportunity",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/solana-might-become-wall-streets-next-big-bet-while-retailers-found-a-new-opportunity/,"The crypto conversation has tilted once again toward Solana. Analysts, traders, and even market reporters have highlighted its growing presence in discussions around institutional adoption. Its high throughput and fast settlement continue to attract speculation that it could one day sit alongside Ethereum as a backbone for tokenized assets, ETFs, and Wall Street-aligned products. The idea of ‚Äúinstitutional Solana‚Äù has been floated before, but the recent uptick in derivatives activity, chatter in financial media, and expansion of its developer ecosystem give the thesis renewed strength. But while Wall Street‚Äôs attention is notable, the retail side of the equation is unfolding on a different front. Communities are buzzing about alternative opportunities that mirror the spirit of early crypto adoption, projects where high risk pairs with high potential. It‚Äôs here that retail investors, less concerned with regulation and more with asymmetric payoff, are finding their voice. Within this dual narrative of institutional strength and retail speculation, MAGACOIN FINANCE surfaces as a name worth weaving into the broader conversation. Wall Street‚Äôs Growing Fascination with Solana Institutions are not blind to Solana‚Äôs unique structure. Its capacity to process thousands of transactions per second with low fees positions it as an attractive infrastructure layer for tokenization experiments. In recent sessions, derivatives markets tied to Solana have seen significant volume spikes, suggesting growing interest among hedge funds and structured product issuers. Even without confirmed ETF filings, the narrative of Solana as a candidate for Wall Street packaging has grown louder. Reports indicate investment firms are exploring structured notes and certificates linked to Solana exposure, treating it as a candidate for mainstream inclusion. As tokenization continues to make its way into financial discourse, Solana sits in a sweet spot: fast, efficient, and liquid. The psychological impact of this cannot be overstated. If Ethereum represented ‚ÄúWall Street‚Äôs first blockchain experiment,‚Äù Solana is increasingly seen as its potential sequel. Retail Investors Seek the Parallel Play While institutional desks debate whether Solana is ready for prime time, retail traders have taken a different route. They look for projects that carry the same ‚Äúearly cycle‚Äù characteristics Solana once had, community energy, meme-driven momentum, and rapid adoption in informal circles. In Telegram channels, X spaces, and Discord groups, the conversation is less about infrastructure readiness and more about narrative explosiveness. For them, the opportunity is not necessarily to front-run institutional desks, but to spot the altcoins and presales that thrive when community energy and scarcity combine. This divergence in focus has created a two-track market: Wall Street leaning into scalable infrastructure, and retail pouring into speculation that thrives on early entry. This split defines the current crypto environment. Both sides may ultimately converge, but for now, institutions and retail are marching to different drums. MAGACOIN FINANCE as Retail‚Äôs Opportunity Solana‚Äôs rising institutional adoption has sparked speculation that Wall Street might make it a major bet, but retail investors are still looking for hidden gems with stronger upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered that discussion as a project built for speculation yet structured for longevity. Analysts suggest potential 62x multipliers are within range if listing conditions align, far beyond what Solana could realistically offer in a single cycle. The branding has resonated with communities hungry for narrative tokens, while presale mechanics build scarcity at every stage. The comparison is striking: institutions may capture steady Solana growth, while retail could amplify gains with smaller presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. It‚Äôs this divergence, steady Wall Street bets versus retail multipliers, that makes MAGACOIN FINANCE a focal point in current discussions. Institutional Confidence vs. Retail FOMO The current landscape highlights a fascinating divergence: Wall Street seeks regulatory clarity, liquidity, and institutional wrappers, while retail gravitates toward hype cycles, memes, and community-driven narratives. Solana is increasingly painted as a long-term institutional bet, the kind that underpins structured products and ETF discussions. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE embodies the speculative, retail-driven culture, rapid community adoption, grassroots branding, and scarcity-led tokenomics. Both play vital roles in the crypto market‚Äôs evolution. One gives traditional finance a new tool; the other gives retail a chance to replicate early winners. For portfolio builders, the question isn‚Äôt either/or. It‚Äôs whether they want exposure to both worlds: the solidity of infrastructure adoption and the potential lightning strike of speculative presales. Conclusion Crypto markets are rarely singular in their direction. They expand by narratives running in parallel, infrastructure gaining Wall Street adoption, and retail energy chasing the next breakout. Solana may very well become the blockchain Wall Street leans on for tokenized products, ETF structures, and regulated exposure. At the same time, retail investors are not sitting idle; they are already hunting for speculative projects that can replicate early-cycle gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as one of those plays, audited, scarcity-driven, community-powered, and carrying ambitious upside projections. While Solana captures institutional credibility, MAGACOIN represents retail‚Äôs willingness to place bold bets. Both threads matter, and together they define the rhythm of today‚Äôs crypto market.

He noted that his attention remains on Bitcoin for the moment, but emphasized that XRP‚Äôs reaction during this period could determine his next move. In a recent post , he wrote, ‚Äútrying to work out where I‚Äôm going to bid XRP here,‚Äù making clear that timing is central to his strategy. Rather than rushing into a position, the analyst explained he wants to see whether XRP makes a decisive move to take liquidity. According to him, once he gets a clearer picture, he will update followers, showing his intent to wait for stronger confirmation before acting. Waiting for Confirmation The comments highlight a patient approach, as he stated that he will only buy more XRP if conditions become clearer. He acknowledged that he does not plan to force an entry at current levels, but is open to taking action when he sees a viable setup. His measured stance illustrates the caution many traders adopt when markets appear uncertain. Trying to work out where I‚Äôm going to bid $XRP here. I‚Äôm mainly watching this right now for $BTC and I want to see how $XRP reacts during this time / if we get this move to take the liquidity. As and when I get a clearer picture I‚Äôll let you know. If I don‚Äôt get any extra $XRP ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/eJWMq7tpgv ‚Äî Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) September 26, 2025 This perspective also places Bitcoin in an important role. The analyst specified that he is mainly watching Bitcoin at the moment, underlining how movements in the largest cryptocurrency continue to influence his outlook for XRP. While XRP has its own momentum, Bitcoin remains the wider market driver that can sway sentiment and price action. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price Direction Considerations In a follow-up exchange with community members, the analyst addressed possible ranges for XRP before any rebound. One user suggested that the asset may fall toward the $2 to $2.2 region. Cryptoinsightuk responded by acknowledging that he is eyeing $2.35, while also highlighting the risk that XRP could show strength against Bitcoin and mislead traders. This exchange gives more context to his earlier remarks. The $2.35 level appears to serve as a reference point for him, though he remains aware that market behavior does not always follow clean levels. By recognizing both downside possibilities and the chance of sudden relative strength, he shows an openness to different outcomes rather than committing to a single path. Balancing Patience and Readiness The overall message from the analyst‚Äôs posts is one of patience combined with readiness. He made clear that he will not bid for XRP without greater clarity, but left open the possibility of seizing the next available buying opportunity . With Bitcoin liquidity patterns still on his radar, XRP‚Äôs next decisive move may depend heavily on how Bitcoin trades in the near term. Until then, his updates suggest that followers can expect caution until stronger signals emerge. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This caused the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index to plunge by 16 points in a single day, sinking to 28 yesterday, its lowest level since March. At the time of writing, the index has recovered slightly to 33, but it still in the Fear zone. This may unsettle many investors, but history shows that fearful conditions may be blessings in disguise for Bitcoin investors. Related Reading: XRP Eyeing Explosive Move In Next Few Months, Research Shows Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Drops To 28 This week has been tough for many cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. Bitcoin, which started the week above $115,000, entered into an extended decline that saw it break below $110,000, which in turn led to liquidations of over $1 billion worth of positions across the industry. This move also saw Ethereum break below $4,000, alongside altcoins likes XRP, Solana extending to the downside. Taken together, these moves erased the cautious optimism of last week, when the index sat at a neutral level of 48. Instead, Bitcoin‚Äôs Fear and Greed Index fell to as low as 28, which is a dramatic 16 point plunge in a single day. This crash in the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index shows just how fast sentiment can reverse when important price thresholds fail to hold. However, while the fearful mood might appear to be a bearish hint, these conditions could be an opportunity for long-term traders. The Fear and Greed Index has historically been a contrarian indicator, with extreme fear levels typically appearing before significant rebounds. Earlier in March, when the index last reached similar depths, Bitcoin was trading at a relative low around $83,000. Today, even after breaking below 30 on the index again, Bitcoin is about $27,000 higher than it was in March. Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index. Source: Alternative.me Constructive Outlook For The Coming Weeks The broader takeaway from this sentiment shift is that the crypto market may be closer to its next recovery phase than many expect. The index‚Äôs slight rebound to 33 today from yesterday‚Äôs low of 28 shows that some traders are already positioning for a turnaround. For one, Bitcoin‚Äôs current prices could give savvy investors the chance to accumulate Bitcoin at discount prices. Bitcoin rarely sustains rallies in conditions of overwhelming greed. Instead, consolidations and corrections reset sentiment and make room for healthier growth. For instance, crypto analyst Michael Pizzino said in a post on X, that the most recent fear could be the turning point Bitcoin and crypto has been waiting for.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the new kid on the block is taking the top spot. Dubbed ‚ÄúADA 2.0‚Äù by several analysts, Mutuum Finance is capturing attention for its dual-lending architecture, combining Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) systems to maximize capital efficiency and returns. Priced at $0.035 in presale, the project is now at phase 6 which is 50% sold out. At presale, Mutuum Finance already has over $16.4 million. While ADA continues to battle through significant stages of resistance and meets slower momentum in prices, Mutuum‚Äôs value at an early stage and expectations for explosive growth have made it a solid hedge. Cardano is Struggling with Resistance While Investors Await Breakout Signal Cardano (ADA) remains in the conservative phase, trading at the $0.89 level while struggling to break past a significant resistance of $0.93, which must be overcome in order to develop a stronger bullish leg. The recent price action also hints at the chances of a short-term correction, and ADA can even pullback to the $0.80‚Äì$0.85 demand area before making another attempt at surging. These levels are still important for traders as it will take persistently active buying pressure above the resistance levels to set up ADA for a more powerful surge upwards. Until then, investors are observing the setup of ADA carefully for hints at the turn in momentum that will revive its next wave of bulls. Mutuum Finance Blows Up During Presale Mutuum Finance is providing investors an opportunity to be among the first to get into this project and buy tokens at a discount. $0.035 for each MUTM in phase 6 is a bargain. Presale has been a success, with more than $16.4 million raised and more than 16,600 token holders, proof of trust in the project. Mutuum Finance has introduced an official Bug Bounty Program on CertiK with a reward limit of $50,000 USDT. The program invites white-hat hackers, developers, and researchers to try the codebase for bugs. Bounties are paid on bugs of any severity level so that even minor-level bugs are rewarded. Mutuum Finance uses hybrid lending protocol borrowing from Peer-to-Contract (P2C) as well as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models for ultimate flexibility. The P2C model is employed for the acceptance of the contracts in such a manner so that it can monitor the market so that the interest rates can be fixed. It is designed in such a manner so that the investors will receive passive income and the lenders will lend at minimal interest rates and the contracts will automatically conduct the transaction. P2P model allows the lenders and borrowers to communicate directly with one another in real time. The model introduces the potential of lending riskier assets such as meme coins. In the quest for accuracy and up-to-date prices, Mutuum Finance is leveraging Chainlink oracles of top cap token price aggregators USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, combined feeds, and on-chain data feeds are being used in bear market protection. Strong foundation of accurate prices is being leveraged in collateral management, liquidation, and risk calculation for the stability and efficiency of the protocol irrespective of market conditions. Cardano‚Äôs consolidation has investors seeking better-upside options such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). At Phase 6 presale at $0.035, already 50% sold out, MUTM has already raised more than $16.4 million from 16,600+ investors. Its dual-lending P2P and P2C model and early-stage potential have made it the moniker ‚ÄúADA 2.0.‚Äù With solid growth projections, the time to snap up MUTM tokens before the presale ends is now.

Here‚Äôs the most important one so far ‚Äî how does it affect price? Network Activity On Decline As Price Rises In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, crypto pundit CryptoOnchain highlighted a growing negative divergence between Bitcoin‚Äôs price and the number of active addresses within the cryptocurrency‚Äôs network. The analyst‚Äôs report depended on the Bitcoin Active Addresses metric, which, as is apparent, tracks the number of unique wallet addresses participating in transactions on the network within a given period. The value of this metric reflects the amount of user activity or engagement of the crypto network. From the chart shared by CryptoOnchain, there is ‚Äúa clear negative divergence between Bitcoin‚Äôs price and the 14-day moving average of active addresses.‚Äù What this means is that the broader Bitcoin bull rally is happening against a backdrop of reduced network activity and user engagement. The on-chain analyst further explained that such divergence typically functions as an early warning or signal that the bullish momentum might be losing its strength. As the cryptocurrency thus loses its bullish momentum , the risk of the BTC price undergoing correctional activity may simultaneously increase. Aside from the risk of correction, there is also the possibility of the Bitcoin network activity falling even further. When this happens, demand for BTC could further weaken, which could temporarily translate to increased selling pressure. BTC Buyers On Binance Losing Against The Sellers In another post on CryptoQuant, online pundit Arab Chain published data from Binance showing that the net Buy-Side Pressure vs Bitcoin Price remained negative for most of the day. This means that more sell transactions have been executed compared to the buys on Binance over the past 24 hours. The crypto expert also explained that attempts by buyers to push Bitcoin‚Äôs price above $113,000 fell short, as Buy-Side Pressure on the world‚Äôs largest exchange by trading volume continued to lag within the negative territory. On the positive side of the market outlook, Arab Chain noted that ‚Äúa clear and sustained positive turn‚Äù in the Buy-Side Pressure, with a close above $113,000, is critical for the market‚Äôs picture to become a little more optimistic. As of press time, Bitcoin is valued at about $109,610, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|binance|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-28 01:00:06
