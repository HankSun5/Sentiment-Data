Synthetix Coin price analysis shows an upward trend regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has increased to $1.14 in the last 24 hours. If the bullish momentum continues, the SNX price might retest resistance at the $1.27 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan‚Äôs SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $5.24 by 2030. Why is SNX up? The cryptocurrency market is in a bullish mode, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting positive sentiment as the SNX price increased to $1.14, gaining a massive 25.72% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.21 for the current year, which is still quite higher than the current Synthetix price. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2031. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level after 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts‚Äô price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don‚Äôt expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $5.24, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $5.24 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Source: Coinmarketcap Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3, as per historical SNX market data. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token‚Äôs price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and in July, the token peaked at $0.781. In August, SNX‚Äôs average price remained around $0.65, and at the start of September, it is trending near $0.67 as the current sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,SNX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-27 20:30:00

One expert noted that XRP has just printed a rare and bullish setup, with multiple chart indicators aligning in support of upward momentum. XRP Price Forms Rare Multi-Layered Bullish Setup According to crypto market expert Bobby A, XRP is in a rare market position, consolidating above key historical levels while preparing for a move that could lead to new all-time highs. He noted that different indicators are aligning in support of a possible uptrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Again? $10 Million Stock Buyback Sparks Fresh Price Hopes In a chart shared on X social media, Bobby explained that XRP‚Äôs market capitalization has been holding above its 2018 peak for more than 300 days, an uncommon show of strength amid the recent downturn. This long consolidation above a major resistance-turned support level suggests a massive build-up of energy before the next leg higher. He argues that this base formation signals a potentially explosive move to the upside, with the next market cap targets identified at $173 billion and a peak around $727 billion. On the price front, Bobby reveals that XRP has been forming a multi-month bullish flag pattern on its charts. He labels the critical support zones as ‚ÄúBase Camp 1‚Äù around $1.9 and ‚ÄúBase Camp 2‚Äù at $2.89‚Äîboth of which have been successfully defended. He further highlighted that the monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also positioning itself for one final push toward overbought territory, often a precursor to a sharp upward move. Based on his projections, XRP‚Äôs take profit zones sit between $5 and $13, levels that would mark fresh all-time highs. Bobby‚Äôs analysis highlights that XRP‚Äôs indicators are ‚Äúfiring on all cylinders,‚Äù with momentum across higher timeframes aligning for a potentially powerful surge. He further pointed out that Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), currently at 58.7%, is set to retrace toward the mid-to-low 40% zone soon. Such a move would enable altcoins like XRP to capture a larger market share, thereby reinforcing the likelihood of a bullish breakout. The analyst described this rare alignment as a generational setup that occurs only a few times in a decade. Bearish Divergence Sparks Short-Term XRP Sell-Off While XRP appears to be resisting the present market downturn, not all analysts share an immediate bullish sentiment. Crypto expert JD has warned about a Bearish Divergence forming on XRP‚Äôs weekly chart‚Äîa signal that has now played out as expected. As shown in the chart, while XRP‚Äôs price made higher highs, the RSI indicator printed lower highs, creating a textbook Bearish Divergence pattern. This divergence has already led to a sharp 27% correction from the $3.37 take profit level that JD had previously identified. According to him, many market participants are now questioning why XRP has been under pressure despite broader optimism. Related Reading: Hyperliquid‚Äôs Days Numbered? Expert Forecasts ‚ÄòPainful Death‚Äô JD argues that the Bearish Divergence was the clearest warning signal, and those who ignored it are now witnessing its full effect. He cautions that while XRP may still avoid a deeper breakdown into the ‚Äúgrey box‚Äù supply zone, the short-term trajectory remains bearish until momentum resets.

This week, a significant trend has emerged: a growing number of Solana (SOL) holders are diversifying into a new AI project, Ruvi AI (RUVI). This migration is putting a major spotlight on the newcomer, whose fast-paced presale, lucrative early bonuses, and explosive demand are creating a powerful wave of market-wide FOMO. This surge in attention is fueled by a presale that is performing at a truly historic level. Ruvi AI has officially stormed past the $4 million fundraising milestone, selling over 285 million tokens in a remarkably short period. Analysts are highlighting that this sales velocity is exceptionally rare, a feat typically seen only in projects that go on to become industry titans. The demand is so intense that after a rapid sell-out of Phase 2, Ruvi AI saw 20% of its Phase 3 supply claimed in just days , growing its global community to over 3,900 holders. Why Solana Holders Are Making the Move Solana investors are known for backing projects with strong technology and high growth potential. Their move into Ruvi AI signals a belief that it possesses these same qualities, but with the added advantage of a ground-floor entry point. While SOL has already delivered massive returns, its large market cap limits its potential for another 100x run. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, offers the perfect combination of a low-cap opportunity, the powerful AI narrative, and a clear mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . The project‚Äôs credibility has been a key factor in attracting this wave of savvy investors. A successful smart contract audit by CyberScope has verified its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap provides the transparency that today‚Äôs market demands. This combination of a powerful vision, verifiable security, and overwhelming demand is why Ruvi AI is capturing the attention of some of crypto‚Äôs most successful communities. The Super App Fueling the FOMO The engine driving Ruvi AI‚Äôs explosive growth is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is engineered to become an indispensable tool for content creators, which will in turn generate powerful, organic demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving users a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency and output. Urgent: A Guaranteed 40% Price Increase Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . With 20% of this stage already sold out at record speed, this ground-floor opportunity is rapidly closing. According to the project‚Äôs official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. The project‚Äôs VIP bonus structure is designed to maximize returns from this anticipated rally: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures deep liquidity upon launch, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway further rewards early supporters, strengthening its unstoppable momentum. The Next Big Opportunity Is Here The movement of Solana holders into Ruvi AI is a major vote of confidence. It shows that smart money is identifying this project as the next big opportunity. With its record-breaking presale, powerful utility, and incredible early bonuses, Ruvi AI is on a path to becoming one of this cycle‚Äôs biggest success stories. The time to join this movement is now.

Currently, the XRP and Solana ETFs appear to be next in line to hit the market, pending the approval of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On Thursday, September 25, Bitcoinist reported that the final spot XRP and Solana amendments are expected before the end of this week. As expected, many potential issuers have updated their applications to launch the Solana exchange-traded fund in the United States. Is SEC Approval For SOL ETF Inevitable? On Friday, September 26, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart shared on the social media platform X a bunch of updated applications for the spot Solana ETF prospectuses. According to the expert, this wave of amendments shows signs of movement between the issuers and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. These latest updates to the applications mean that the launch of a spot Solana ETF is closer than ever. As indicated by Bloomberg expert Eric Balchunas in response to Seyffart‚Äôs post on X, investors can begin the final countdown to the approval of these crypto-linked investment products. As earlier reported by Bitcoinist , ETF Store president Nate Geraci had already predicted that the final batch of amendments to the Solana ETF applications would come in before the close of this week. Geraci arrived at this conclusion after the SEC‚Äôs new generic listing standards resulted in the approval of the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF. These ‚Äúgeneric listing standards‚Äù opened a door for firms to be able to issue spot exchange-traded products besides Bitcoin and Ether. According to the SEC, exchanges will now be able to list qualifying crypto-linked ETFs without first submitting a proposed rule change (19b-4). Spot Solana ETF To Include Staking: Expert In a Friday post on X , Geraci also acknowledged the flurry of S-1 amendments for the spot Solana ETF applications. Some of the potential issuers with new updates to their filings include: Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, CoinShares, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, and Canary, according to the ETF Store.

Digital asset treasury (DAT) firms are publicly traded companies that raise capital to acquire and manage crypto on their balance sheets. In a Sept. 23 blog post and an accompanying thread on X, Watkins said DATs already hold roughly $105 billion in assets across bitcoin, ether and other majors, a scale that few market participants have fully considered. His core claim: a small number of these firms may mature into durable operators that help finance, govern and build within the networks whose tokens they hold. Beyond speculation Watkins said most attention has fixated on near-term trading dynamics ‚Äî premiums to net asset value, fundraising announcements and ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the next token‚Äù‚Äîwhich misses the larger arc. ‚ÄúWe imagine select DATs becoming for-profit, publicly traded counterparts to crypto foundations, but with broader mandates to deploy capital, operate businesses, and participate in governance,‚Äù he wrote. Because some DATs already control meaningful slices of token supply, their treasuries can be more than vaults; they can be policy and product levers inside ecosystems. He pointed to crypto-native examples where scale matters: on Solana, RPC providers and proprietary market makers that stake more SOL can improve transaction landing and spread capture; on Hyperliquid, front ends that stake more HYPE can lower user fees or increase take rates without raising costs. Access to large, permanent pools of native assets can help such businesses bootstrap and scale, he said. Programmable money, productive balance sheets Watkins contrasted these plays with MicroStrategy‚Äôs bitcoin-only strategy, which is largely about capital structure around a non-programmable asset. He went on to say that by comparison, tokens on smart contract platforms ‚Äî ETH, SOL, HYPE ‚Äî are programmable and can be put to work on-chain. DATs holding them can stake for fees, supply liquidity, lend, participate in governance and acquire ‚Äúecosystem primitives‚Äù such as validators, RPC nodes or indexers, turning treasuries into yield-generating balance sheets. Structurally, he likened winning DATs to a hybrid of familiar models: the permanent capital of closed-end funds and REITs, the balance-sheet orientation of banks, and the compounding ethos of Berkshire Hathaway. What makes them distinct, he said, is that returns accrue in crypto per share rather than via management fees, making the vehicles closer to pure plays on underlying networks than to traditional asset managers. He argued that tools like common equity, convertibles and preferreds give DATs flexible funding to expand balance sheets, while on-chain yields can help manage that funding over time. Winners‚Äîand risks Watkins cautioned that ‚Äúnot all DATs will make it.‚Äù He expects many first-generation vehicles‚Äîthose heavy on financial engineering and light on operating substance ‚Äî to fade as conditions normalize. As competition intensifies, he anticipates consolidation, experiments with more exotic financing and, at times, reckless balance-sheet moves if premiums flip to discounts and pressure builds. In his view, the survivors will be those that pair disciplined capital allocation with operating chops, recycling cash flows into token accumulation, product building and ecosystem expansion. ‚ÄúOver time, the best managed ones could evolve into the Berkshire Hathaways of their blockchains,‚Äù he wrote.",Markets|Digital Asset Treasury|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-27 21:22:48

After a 9% decline over the past week, the token trades at $0.00001176 , with its market capitalization holding steady at $6.93 billion. This figure aligns with both its fully diluted valuation and unlocked market cap, showing that nearly all tokens are circulating. Despite this, trading activity has slowed significantly, with 24-hour volume falling 42.47% to $110.6 million. The volume-to-market-cap ratio now stands at 1.68%, signaling subdued investor participation. Symmetrical Triangle Consolidation Since May, SHIB has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, a pattern often signaling an imminent breakout. At present, the token is testing a pivotal support level near $0.000011, which coincides with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement. This support has historically acted as a key pivot for price movements, making it a decisive point for the token‚Äôs next directional push. SHIB/USD daily price chart, Source: TradingView Failure to maintain this support could shift market sentiment toward bearish territory. A breakdown below $0.000011 may intensify selling pressure, with the next downside target around $0.000010. This level aligns with the broader ascending support trendline, suggesting buyers could lose control if the token dips further. Conversely, holding this support could pave the way for a rebound toward $0.000013, near the 50% Fibonacci retracement, representing potential upside of roughly 14% from current levels. Technical Indicators Show Mixed Signals SHIB/USD daily price chart, Source: TradingView The MACD line remains below its signal line, while the histogram sits in negative territory, indicating ongoing bearish momentum. Traders may interpret this as a sign of continued selling unless buyers step in to reverse the trend. Meanwhile, the RSI sits at 46.64, reflecting a near-neutral market. This level indicates neither extreme buying nor selling pressure, leaving room for movement in either direction. Liquidation Levels Highlight Balanced Pressure Source: Coinglass Analysis of SHIB‚Äôs liquidation heatmap reveals significant clusters around $0.000012 and $0.0000111. These green-yellow zones indicate concentrated leveraged positions, meaning that aggressive price movements could trigger cascading liquidations. Since liquidity pools are balanced on both sides, the token may continue range-bound trading until either buyers push above $0.000012 or sellers break below $0.0000111. SHIB Futures and Open Interest Source: Coinglass Shiba Inu futures open interest has eased after previous surges, dropping from highs of over $500 million to approximately $177 million. This decline signals lower speculative activity, reduced momentum, and a market in consolidation. Typically, contraction in open interest precedes sideways trading, as participants wait for stronger signals before initiating new positions. ETF Absence Highlights SHIB‚Äôs Limited Institutional Appeal Another factor affecting SHIB‚Äôs momentum is its absence from U.S. spot ETF filings. While rivals like Dogecoin and other meme coins have received multiple ETF proposals, SHIB has largely been ignored by prospective issuers. This indicates a diminishing perception of SHIB‚Äôs relevance among institutional investors, which could weigh on market sentiment.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-27 21:35:03

Regulators believe some investors may have profited from having prior, non-public knowledge of these crypto-treasury announcements, potentially violating fair disclosure rules. Possible Breach of Fair Disclosure Rules The investigation focuses on publicly traded digital asset treasury (DAT) firms, which are companies that declare plans to acquire capital and buy cryptocurrencies. More than 200 DATs went public this year, and some of them are currently in contact with regulators. Regulators identified ‚Äúsuspicious trading patterns‚Äù, including high trading volume spikes and sudden price rises in the days or hours before firms announced their crypto-buying plans. The actions suggest that at least some investors might have been profiting by trading on inside information. SEC officials have already cautioned several companies over potential Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) breaches, a provision requiring material, nonpublic information to be broadly disclosed rather than selectively. The financial watchdog is concerned that some were tipped about impending crypto buys and profited by selling the companies‚Äô stock ahead of the news release. Experts agree that these breaches put market value at risk and expose businesses to legal repercussions and reputational consequences. Even in the larger non-crypto financial market, the agency has never had such reservations about Reg FD violations. Therefore, this level of scrutiny raises the likelihood that crypto-treasury firms will face tighter restrictions in the near future. Corporate Crypto Boom Under the Microscope The investigation occurs against a backdrop of more businesses moving to adopt cryptocurrency. Early movers have already helped digital asset treasuries attract over $20 billion in venture capital this year, with more than $100 billion committed to crypto buying plans. Public firms now hold over 1 million BTC, valued at $113 billion, and 5.26 million ETH, worth $20.6 billion. Monthly DAT raises peaked at $6.2 billion in July, representing the highest single-month total ever recorded. Regulators now face the challenge of ensuring this growing trend does not open new avenues for insider trading and selective disclosure. Advocates argue that investment by corporate treasuries signals confidence in the long-term value of cryptocurrencies. However, there remain concerns over the pace at which companies disclose market information and raise funds, which could encourage selective disclosure, leaks, and manipulative trading. The SEC and FINRA have said that the crypto treasury boom must operate within existing securities laws and are moving proactively against suspicious patterns. If misconduct is uncovered, enforcement action could follow, setting a precedent for future regulation of corporate digital asset adoption.

Mutuum Finance is currently at presale phase 6 for $0.035 and is 50% sold out. The protocol has garnered over $16.4 million from over 16,600 holders already. Mutuum Finance will increase more than 7,250% because of its new double-lending model that unifies Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) models. This new system is about to unleash more efficient liquidity, grow yields, and invite retail and institutional investors, advantages which SHIB, despite all its goliath base, still lacks. As sentiment turns away from meme tokens to utility-based protocols, Mutuum Finance is at the forefront for investors on the prowl for horrifically high returns in the coming bull cycle. Shiba Inu Targets 250% Growth Shiba Inu (SHIB) is back in the center of the market with technical charts pointing towards a probable 250% surge, with key resistance levels nearing the $0.00003400 and $0.00006700 levels, as shown in the chart above. Price activity is showing a strong accumulation base near the $0.00001010 support level, and if SHIB manages to maintain this critical level, there are possibilities of bullish momentum building up. With capital still pouring in towards utility-based protocols over meme coins, Mutuum Finance is a high-upside bet in the ensuing market cycle. MUTM Presale Dominance Mutuum Finance has launched presale stage Six with the tokens valued at $0.035 after a 16.17% increase from the previous round. The demand is strong, with more than 16,600 investors and more than $16.4 million in total capital. As part of promoting security to be included in the platform, Mutuum Finance is announcing a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The bugs have been divided into four divisions to ensure that they are discovered and fixed to their full potential, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The system is based on disciplined collateral management of funds to safeguard the system and counterparties. It is managed through some collateral ratios, credit thresholds, and deposit ceilings. Building An Efficient Platform Efficiency is achieved through reducing Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, especially for overcollateralized credit. Reserve requirements are also a shock-absorber in the market, and excess reserves can be drawn upon for use in risk-absorbing activities for risky assets. The global vision of Mutuum Finance is to reboot the DeFi model on foundations of long-term sustainability, dependability, and usability. The project does not just provide a safe borrowing and lending facility but is also adding into the mix a new generation for decentralized finance to be made available to retail as well as institutional investors. In a bid to encourage early adoption as well as development of community, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway , contest where 10 winners will each get $10,000 in MUTM tokens. This is centered around the project‚Äôs dedication to empowering its supporters while raising funds and giving back in the market. Forget 250%, Mutuum Finance Could Surge 7,250% Shiba Inu‚Äôs possible 250% increase is impressive, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting itself up for something much more impactful. Already in Stage 6 of presale and 50% sold out at a mere $0.035, the project has raised over $16.4 million from over 16,600 investors. Its hybrid lending model of P2P and P2C models and its strong security architecture will provide long-term adoption, high returns, and scalable liquidity. With projections showing a probable 7,250% growth, MUTM is quickly becoming the investor favorite of the day for earning out-of-proportion gains beyond meme coin manias. Those who wish to be prepared for the next DeFi boom need to take action on their MUTM tokens now before the presale vanishes and the price soars.

Estimates for Uniswap‚Äôs average price in 2028 range from $40.04 to $45.76. UNI‚Äôs average price in 2031 will be $71.50, with a maximum price of $74.36. Uniswap, a DeFi protocol founded in 2018 by former mechanical engineer Hayden Adams. The Uniswap exchange is a 100% on-chain automated market maker (AMM) protocol on the Ethereum¬†blockchain.

The altcoin‚Äôs price decreased to $7.54 in the past 24 hours. Overall, the cryptocurrency lost up to 1.44% of its value. Sellers have continued their lead again following the retreat observed yesterday, as resistance appeared around $7.65. This situation also indicates that selling pressure is high around the $8 level, as the coin has faced a recent rejection below that price point. Uniswap price analysis on the daily time frame The one-day price chart of Uniswap coin confirmed a bearish trend in the market. The UNI/USD value has dipped to an intraday low of $7.54. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify a continuous selling pressure and a continuation of a downtrend. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is widening again, leading to an increase in volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $10.75. Whereby its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $7.29. UNI/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the oversold region. The indicator‚Äôs value has been recorded at index 28.61 today, and the decreasing trend is represented by a downward curve on the RSI graph. Further instability in the market can be expected if the selling momentum continues. Uniswap price analysis on 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of Uniswap shows the presence of some degree of buyers‚Äô support. The coin has been struggling to maintain its price above $7, but the price is slowly increasing and may increase further in the coming hours. Moreover, the mild volatility signifies a lower chance of a reversal or more price oscillations. The Bollinger bands are covering less area, leading to mediocre volatility.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin‚Äôs price is decreasing after a continued bearish wave observed over the current trading session. If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI‚Äôs price might plunge below the $7 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $36.22 level by 2027 and above $74.36 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a bearish phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are shedding value, and so is UNI. As sellers gained ground around $7.65, negative sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $17.16, while the average price is expected to be around $14.30. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $9 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $10 and $10.7; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2026. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it‚Äôs worth waiting, as the coin‚Äôs value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI‚Äôs price to reach $74.36 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price. Recent news/opinions on Uniswap Network Uniswap Labs revealed the top tokens swapped by volume during the past week, excluding WBTC, ETH, and stablecoins. LINK, BIO, and PEPE were among the top three tokens swapped on Uniswap apps.

In older systems like Uniswap V2, an LP‚Äôs funds were spread evenly across a price range from zero to infinity. This was inefficient because most trading happens within a very small price range. To solve this, Uniswap V3 introduced concentrated liquidity. This feature allows LPs to choose a specific, or ‚Äúcustom,‚Äù price range on a chart where they want to provide their liquidity.

That search is now leading them to Ruvi AI (RUVI), a newcomer whose record-breaking presale performance is drawing direct comparisons to Tron‚Äôs formative days. As its presale races ahead, experts are confidently predicting that Ruvi AI has the potential to create a new wave of crypto millionaires. This incredible forecast is backed by a presale that is performing at a truly historic level. Ruvi AI has officially soared past the $4 million fundraising milestone, with over 285 million tokens sold at a velocity that has left the market in awe. Analysts are highlighting that such rapid sales are exceptionally rare and are often the hallmark of projects that go on to become industry titans. The demand is undeniable; after a rapid sell-out of Phase 2, Ruvi AI saw 20% of its Phase 3 supply get claimed in just days , growing its global community to over 3,900 holders. Mirroring Tron‚Äôs Path to Success The comparison to Tron‚Äôs early success is not made lightly. Like TRX in its initial stages, Ruvi AI is capturing the market‚Äôs imagination with a powerful vision and overwhelming demand. However, Ruvi AI adds another potent ingredient to the mix: the red-hot AI narrative. Its mission is to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy , a tangible goal that provides a solid foundation for growth. This blend of historic demand, a low entry point, and a powerful, real-world use case is the formula that experts believe could make it a millionaire-maker project. The project‚Äôs credibility has been a key factor in attracting this unprecedented level of investment. A successful smart contract audit by CyberScope has verified its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap provides the transparency and legitimacy that serious investors demand. This combination of powerful fundamentals and verifiable security is what sets Ruvi AI apart as a top-tier opportunity. The Super App Fueling the Millionaire Forecast The engine driving Ruvi AI‚Äôs potential to create new millionaires is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is engineered to become an indispensable tool for content creators, which will in turn generate powerful, organic demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving users a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency and output. Urgent: A Guaranteed 40% Price Increase Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . With 20% of this stage already claimed at a record-breaking pace, this ground-floor opportunity is rapidly disappearing. According to the project‚Äôs official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. The project‚Äôs VIP bonus structure is designed to turn this opportunity into life-changing wealth: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000 , achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway further rewards early supporters, strengthening its unstoppable momentum. The Birth of a New Giant? As the presale continues its historic run, the market is witnessing something special. Ruvi AI is not just another altcoin; it is a project that is mirroring the early success of an industry giant and is on a trajectory to create significant wealth for its early supporters. The opportunity to be part of this journey is here, but it won‚Äôt last long.

52356127,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84520,1759010456,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top 3 ‚ÄúBuy the Dip‚Äù Strategies You Should Know,https://timestabloid.com/top-3-buy-the-dip-strategies-you-should-know/,"A sudden market pullback can feel chaotic: order books shift, sentiment sours, large liquidations cascade. But for those with a plan, dips aren‚Äôt disasters, they are windows for strategic entry. Over the last 12 hours, crypto markets faced another wave of selling pressure, triggering over $1 billion in liquidations as derivative positions unraveled and stop-losses cascaded across exchanges. This kind of volatility is the stage upon which ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù becomes more art than blind optimism. In this environment, having a disciplined approach is nonnegotiable. Not all dips are created equal. Whether you prefer precision entries with confirmation, smoother accumulation via layering, or aggressive bounce snipes in fast markets, each method has its place. And amid all that, there‚Äôs room for speculative optionality, which is where MAGACOIN FINANCE quietly enters your radar. Reversion entry after confirmation The safest dips to buy are those that flirt with established supports and then show signs of exhaustion. You wait for the price to approach a technical zone, whether trendline support, a long timeframe moving average, or historical demand region, and only enter after you see a reversal signal. That could be a strong wick rejection, a bullish engulfing candle, or divergence in RSI or MACD. High conviction comes when that turnaround is supported by rising volume: it suggests smart money is stepping in, not just noise. Because you‚Äôre letting the market reveal its bottom tendencies, you avoid ‚Äúcatching the falling knife.‚Äù The trade is backed by evidence. But it won‚Äôt always trigger: sometimes price breaks through, and your setup fails. In such cases, respect your stop just outside the support zone, and move on On-chain & market context signals Even the best dip strategy underperforms without contextual confirmation. As you scan opportunities, monitor key flows: exchange outflows (accumulation signals), whale transfers, and derivatives liquidation clusters. Recently, heavy liquidations revealed where weak hands were flushed and where resilient players might be stepping in. Combine that with sentiment indicators (fear extremes, social volume) and macro cues from equities and policy shifts. When technical setups and context align, your edge is stronger. It‚Äôs this alignment that separates a lucky entry from a repeatable method. Traders who only focus on charts often miss the behavioral layer: who is buying, who is selling, and whether the overall market environment supports risk-taking. Pairing charts with on-chain data and funding trends creates the discipline needed to avoid gambling in uncertainty. Where MAGACOIN FINANCE fits in Buy-the-dip strategies are everywhere right now, but the biggest question remains: which tokens can actually multiply? While most focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been positioned as a high-beta candidate with outsized upside. Analysts suggest presales like this often deliver dramatic moves when broader markets rebound, with projections floating around 48x multipliers under favorable conditions. The key is its scarcity model: each stage increases in price, forcing urgency among participants. Social engagement shows buyers treating it as a dip entry within the presale cycle itself. Instead of waiting for majors to recover, many are considering MAGACOIN FINANCE as the speculative dip play that could mirror the strategy, but with exponentially higher payoff potential. Layered accumulation strategy When volatility is prolonged, a layered approach becomes your shield. Divide your capital into several tranches and spread entries across dips that meet your criteria, bounce attempts around support, oversold signals, or structural consolidation zones. You‚Äôre not trying to pick a single bottom; you‚Äôre gradually building exposure across multiple points. This method buffers your average entry and guards against committing too early. If the downtrend continues, you still have ammo to deploy. If the bounce begins early, you‚Äôve already locked in part of your position. The key discipline is to never overextend: always leave reserve capital for deeper dips and stick to predetermined sizes per tranche. Many long-term investors, particularly those focused on Bitcoin or Ethereum, swear by this method. It avoids emotional overreactions and turns volatility into an ally. By spreading exposure, you trade stress for structure, and that structure compounds over cycles. Flash dip snipes in fast moves For more aggressive traders, the flash dip snipe is where speed and conviction collide. You scan markets for sharp intraday or intra-block dives, say, sudden 5‚Äì10% moves, and jolt in when reversal cues flash: a rapid wick, order book imbalance flip, or a strong counter volume bar. Your entry is triggered once price moves above the short-term high of that dip. These are adrenaline trades. You‚Äôre not aiming to ride the full rebound, just to catch the bounce. Because the environment is fast, you need tight stop rules and small exposure. Many of these trades reverse quickly; your win target should be modest, your risk control strict. Traders who succeed in this arena rely on preparation: alerts set, capital reserved, and execution automatic. Conclusion ‚ÄúBuy the dip‚Äù isn‚Äôt a single strategy, it‚Äôs a mindset that adapts to conditions. Confirmation entries offer safety and patience. Layering provides balance and risk control. Flash snipes deliver aggression and speed. Each method has a place, and combining them helps investors turn volatility into opportunity. And in this ecosystem of dip strategies, speculative presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE deserve a mention. Its scarcity-driven model, rapid community growth, and audit-backed credibility make it a presale that traders are treating as a dip opportunity in its own right. For investors balancing majors with speculative exposure, it represents the torque side of the portfolio, the piece designed to deliver multiples when markets recover.

The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $110,369 on Friday but failed to retain momentum, ultimately settling at $109,697. Bitcoin traders had reduced bullish positions, indicating mixed market signals ahead of Friday‚Äôs $22 billion monthly Bitcoin options expiry. BlackRock Files For New ETF BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, has registered a Delaware trust company for its new Bitcoin Premium Income ETF. The yield-generating product will use covered call options on BTC futures to collect premiums for regular distributions, trading potential upside for steady income. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called the new ETF a sequel to the $87 billion IBIT, noting that covered call options would provide a BTC yield through options premiums. ‚ÄúBlackRock registered the name iShares Bitcoin Premium ETF, filing coming soon. This is a covered call Bitcoin strategy to give BTC some yield. This will be a '33 Act spot product, sequel to the $87b.‚Äù Delaware trust registrations typically follow S-1 or 19b-4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to begin formal approval processes. The SEC has become increasingly open to crypto investment products under the Trump administration. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT ETF was launched in January 2024 and has registered over $60 billion in inflows. BlackRock Raises Bitcoin Exposure BlackRock‚Äôs global Allocation Fund increased its holdings in IBIT by over 38% during the second quarter, a September 26 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revealed. The fund held 1,000,808 IBIT shares valued at $66.4 million as of July 31. This represents a substantial increase from the 723,332 shares it held as of April 30. Year-over-year growth shows rising Bitcoin adoption within BlackRock‚Äôs portfolio management. IBIT currently represents 0.4% of the Global Allocation Fund‚Äôs $17.1 billion assets under management. This is a 62% increase from the 0.25% allocation during the first quarter. BlackRock has recommended a 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation as a ‚Äúreasonable range‚Äù in its model portfolio on February 28. The fund‚Äôs recent increases in allocations suggest it is moving towards the recommended exposure level through gradual accumulation. BlackRock‚Äôs Global Allocation Fund invests across US and international equities, debt securities, money market investments, and other short-term assets. Next Fed Chair Pick Could Be The Biggest Bull Catalyst Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz believes Bitcoin (BTC) could see a sharp rally if the next Federal Reserve Chair is exceptionally dovish. Speaking during an interview with Kyle Chasse, Novogratz stated, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the potential biggest bull catalyst for Bitcoin and the rest of crypto. Fed‚Äôs cutting when they shouldn‚Äôt be, and you put in a massive dove. Can Bitcoin get to $200K? Of course, it could because it becomes a whole new conversation if that happens.‚Äù However, Novogratz stated that while aggressive rate cuts will be bullish for crypto, they would come at a very steep cost, adding that he hoped they would not happen. ‚ÄúDo I want it to happen? No. Why? Because I kind of love America. It would be really shitty for America. He also stated that there was a real chance the Federal Reserve could lose its independence. Daleep Singh, vice chair and chief global economist at PGIM Fixed Income, echoes Novogratz‚Äôs views, stating, ‚ÄúThere's a very decent chance that the FOMC looks and acts quite differently after Powell‚Äôs term expires in May 2026. On a cyclical basis, I think the risks to the dollar are skewed to the downside.‚Äù Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) hopes for a recovery over the weekend faded as it lost momentum after briefly crossing $110,000 on Friday. The flagship cryptocurrency has endured a brutal week, struggling to recover after two separate crashes over the week took prices below key levels. BTC showed signs of a recovery on Wednesday but suffered a dramatic crash on Thursday, dropping nearly 4% to $109,035. It recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% to $109,697. However, BTC is back in the red, marginally down during the ongoing session. BTC‚Äôs drop to $109,000 on Thursday was its lowest level in three weeks and triggered over $275 million in liquidations, mostly of leveraged bullish positions. Friday‚Äôs options expiry has also failed to breathe life into price action so far, although that could change on Monday. Meanwhile, traders have been reducing their long positions, driving the long-to-short ratio to 1.7x, the lowest in over 30 days. However, BTC‚Äôs drop below $112,000 saw traders reverse course and add upward exposure, with the indicator slowly climbing towards 1.9x in favor of longs. Analysts fear bears could drag prices even lower, with the rebound quickly losing momentum. 10x Research head Markus Thielen stated, ‚ÄúThe bounce back from that dip quickly lost momentum, and with prices now hovering close to this level again, another wave of stop-loss selling could emerge. This comes at a time when many are positioned for a Q4 rally ‚Äî making the bigger surprise not a surge higher, but a correction instead.‚Äù BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.56% and settling at $115,314. The price faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $115,381. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rose 1.26% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,832. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $114,724. It recovered from this level to settle at $116,484, ultimately dropping 0.30% BTC reached an intraday high of $117,998 on Thursday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $117,117. The price lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.22% to $115,690. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend, with BTC registering a marginal increase on Saturday. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, dropping 0.41% to $115,282. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to an intraday low of $111,761 on Monday as bearish sentiment intensified. It recovered from this level to reclaim $112,000 and settle at $112,736. Buyers attempted a recovery on Tuesday as BTC reached an intraday high of $113,357. However, it failed to stay at this level and settled at $112,017, ultimately dropping 0.64%. The price fell to an intraday low of $111,066 on Wednesday as selling pressure intensified. Despite the bearish sentiment, it recovered to register a 1.19% increase and settle at $113,348. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, reaching an intraday high of $110,369 before settling at $109,697. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers struggle to keep it above the $109,000 mark.

The raise comes amid growing rumors that the exchange is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO). The funding round involved participation from several firms and investors, and did not have a lead investor. Kraken Raised $500M Ahead Of Potential IPO Kraken has raised $500 million at a $15 billion valuation as speculation about an initial public offering grows. The funding significantly strengthens the exchange‚Äôs financial position, and was first reported by a report in Fortune, which cited a source close to the negotiations. The report also stated that the funding round had no lead investor and was closed on Kraken‚Äôs terms. Participants in the funding round included venture capital firms, investment managers, and Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi, who invested through his Tribe Capital Fund. Sethi joined Kraken as co-CEO after co-founder Jesse Powell stepped down in 2022, following a federal investigation into his role at a Sacramento-based nonprofit. Powell had named Dave Ripley as his successor after stepping down. However, the exchange announced Sethi‚Äôs appointment as co-CEO last year. Sethi is responsible for Kraken‚Äôs growth over the past year. Paperwork Still Pending Kraken is yet to file any official paperwork for a public listing. However, several of the exchange‚Äôs actions are consistent with companies preparing for an IPO. However, it has yet to submit an S-1 registration statement to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The S-1 registration statement is a necessary step before any public offering in the US. Kraken is one of the oldest exchanges in the cryptocurrency market and was launched in 2013. The exchange ranks among the top 15 global cryptocurrency exchanges and processed around $1.9 billion in trading volume, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Crypto‚Äôs IPO Obsession Kraken‚Äôs public offering comes amid a surge of crypto firms becoming public. Gemini, the Winklevoss brothers-founded exchange, recently went public, and was 20 times oversubscribed during its Nasdaq debut. The exchange raised $425 million on its Nasdaq debut, and its market capitalization has ballooned to $2.8 billion since going public. Meanwhile, USDC issuer Circle completed a billion-dollar IPO in June, with its shares surging 167% on opening day. Blockchain-based lender Figure Technology Solutions also registered an impressive debut, with its market capitalization rising above $8 billion since going public. Crypto custodian BitGo has filed S-1 registration documents with the SEC. The company plans to list its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.

According to multiple reports , the firm is exploring a $15 billion to $20 billion equity raise that could value the company at about $500 billion if the deal is priced at the levels under discussion. Funding Targets And Valuation Based on reports, Tether is looking to sell roughly a 3% stake in the deal, which is how the $500 billion figure is being calculated. The plan, as reported, would involve new shares rather than existing owners selling down their holdings. The raise size under discussion ‚Äî $15‚Äì$20 billion ‚Äî would make this one of the largest private placements seen in the crypto sector. Tether‚Äôs Major Funding Round May Include SoftBank Group and Ark Investment Management According to @Bloomberg , @SoftBank_Group and Ark Investment Management are in talks to participate in a funding round of @Tether_to Holdings SA. The round could value Tether at as much as $500‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/gSmzdf2RJ0 ‚Äî ME (@MetaEraHK) September 26, 2025 Tether‚Äôs USDT token currently has a market cap roughly in the $170 billion to $175 billion range, highlighting why investors are watching the talks closely. The company has expanded its activities beyond issuing stablecoins and is said to be moving into areas such as cloud services, telecom and real estate investments. Potential Backers Join Talks Reports have disclosed that Ark Investment Management, led by Cathie Wood, and SoftBank are among the parties exploring a stake in the round. Cantor Fitzgerald is named as an adviser on the process. None of the interested firms, including Tether, has confirmed a final agreement publicly, and those discussions are described as early-stage. Why would big investors consider this? For one, Tether generates revenue from interest on its reserves, largely held in US Treasuries. One report said Tether made about $13.4 billion in profit last year from such returns. The company also serves roughly 500 million users worldwide, and USDT remains a major on-ramp between fiat currency and crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ether. Regulatory And Profit Details Past scrutiny over reserve disclosures and other controversies means any major investment will draw extra attention from regulators. Observers note that a lofty private valuation could amplify those concerns, especially as Tether moves toward broader business lines and prepares a US-focused stablecoin product reportedly called USAT. Cantor Fitzgerald‚Äôs role and the involvement of big-name investors would likely intensify the public and regulatory spotlight. Talks could still fall apart or change shape. Based on reports, the numbers are ambitious and represent the top end of what Tether is said to be seeking. Investors and regulators are watching closely as details emerge.

The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for future growth. Why is SOL down?

The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030, influenced by trends in the broader crypto market . Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset‚Äôs adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential ROI due to its high scalability, Solana‚Äôs low fees, robust ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana‚Äôs forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth¬†with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana‚Äôs (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset‚Äôs volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-27 23:30:00

His remarks come amid growing speculation about possible government involvement with Ripple and increased attention on upcoming regulatory decisions. Community Split on U.S. Government Role Earlier this week, Cryptoinsightuk launched a poll asking whether the U.S. government could eventually acquire a stake in Ripple or take control of part of the XRP escrow. The survey drew thousands of responses, revealing a divided community. Roughly 29.6% of participants believe such a move could occur before 2026, while 27.3% think it might happen during 2026. Another 12.2% expect it later, but the largest share, 30.9%, dismissed the possibility altogether. Analyst Points to October as a Key Month In a follow-up post, the analyst indicated that he sees October as potentially decisive for XRP . He outlined several developments that could take shape in the coming weeks, including the possible approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States and movement on the Clarity Act, a legislative effort aimed at establishing clearer rules for digital assets. I personally feel we are very close to some big news for $XRP . I think ETF in October, then clarity act and with that something big. Whether it‚Äôs the below or something else idk. Charts are kind of lining up for this too. I do think we see something like the below, but when‚Ä¶ https://t.co/loAhHMmOmX ‚Äî Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) September 26, 2025 He also noted the chance of government involvement with Ripple, highlighting past remarks from President Donald Trump, who in March stated that XRP would be among the digital assets held by the government. Some XRP supporters have since speculated that Ripple‚Äôs escrowed XRP could play a role in this plan, though discussion around the topic has lessened in recent weeks. The speculation coincides with the final stage of the XRP ETF approval process . Several issuers, including Grayscale , Bitwise, Canary, and Franklin, submitted their last amendments to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week. Bloomberg analysts currently estimate a 95% probability of approval before the end of the year. Final deadlines for these applications fall between October 10 and October 25. If approved, trading in spot XRP ETFs could begin within days, mirroring the rollout seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Interest Already Growing Even before spot products are introduced, institutional demand for XRP is increasing. The newly launched REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) recorded $37.7 million in natural volume on its first trading day, marking the strongest debut for any U.S. ETF in 2025. Additionally, CME Group‚Äôs XRP futures have crossed $1 billion in open interest, while futures-based XRP ETFs collectively manage more than $800 million in assets. Analysts suggest inflows could exceed $5 billion within weeks if spot ETFs begin trading. Industry figures such as Oliver Michel , CEO of Tokentus Investment AG, believe that altcoins, including XRP, may present the most significant growth potential following ETF approvals, projecting possible gains of up to fourfold. With XRP currently consolidating around the $3 mark, upcoming regulatory decisions and potential Ripple-related announcements may support the ‚Äúmajor news‚Äù that Cryptoinsightuk anticipates. While no official confirmation has been provided, the convergence of regulatory deadlines, institutional momentum, and persistent community speculation makes October an important month for XRP. Whether these expectations result in transformative news or not, the coming weeks are likely to shape the asset‚Äôs market outlook for the remainder of the year.

Analysts, traders, and even market reporters have highlighted its growing presence in discussions around institutional adoption. Its high throughput and fast settlement continue to attract speculation that it could one day sit alongside Ethereum as a backbone for tokenized assets, ETFs, and Wall Street-aligned products. The idea of ‚Äúinstitutional Solana‚Äù has been floated before, but the recent uptick in derivatives activity, chatter in financial media, and expansion of its developer ecosystem give the thesis renewed strength. But while Wall Street‚Äôs attention is notable, the retail side of the equation is unfolding on a different front. Communities are buzzing about alternative opportunities that mirror the spirit of early crypto adoption, projects where high risk pairs with high potential. It‚Äôs here that retail investors, less concerned with regulation and more with asymmetric payoff, are finding their voice. Within this dual narrative of institutional strength and retail speculation, MAGACOIN FINANCE surfaces as a name worth weaving into the broader conversation. Wall Street‚Äôs Growing Fascination with Solana Institutions are not blind to Solana‚Äôs unique structure. Its capacity to process thousands of transactions per second with low fees positions it as an attractive infrastructure layer for tokenization experiments. In recent sessions, derivatives markets tied to Solana have seen significant volume spikes, suggesting growing interest among hedge funds and structured product issuers. Even without confirmed ETF filings, the narrative of Solana as a candidate for Wall Street packaging has grown louder. Reports indicate investment firms are exploring structured notes and certificates linked to Solana exposure, treating it as a candidate for mainstream inclusion. As tokenization continues to make its way into financial discourse, Solana sits in a sweet spot: fast, efficient, and liquid. The psychological impact of this cannot be overstated. If Ethereum represented ‚ÄúWall Street‚Äôs first blockchain experiment,‚Äù Solana is increasingly seen as its potential sequel. Retail Investors Seek the Parallel Play While institutional desks debate whether Solana is ready for prime time, retail traders have taken a different route. They look for projects that carry the same ‚Äúearly cycle‚Äù characteristics Solana once had, community energy, meme-driven momentum, and rapid adoption in informal circles. In Telegram channels, X spaces, and Discord groups, the conversation is less about infrastructure readiness and more about narrative explosiveness. For them, the opportunity is not necessarily to front-run institutional desks, but to spot the altcoins and presales that thrive when community energy and scarcity combine. This divergence in focus has created a two-track market: Wall Street leaning into scalable infrastructure, and retail pouring into speculation that thrives on early entry. This split defines the current crypto environment. Both sides may ultimately converge, but for now, institutions and retail are marching to different drums. MAGACOIN FINANCE as Retail‚Äôs Opportunity Solana‚Äôs rising institutional adoption has sparked speculation that Wall Street might make it a major bet, but retail investors are still looking for hidden gems with stronger upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered that discussion as a project built for speculation yet structured for longevity. Analysts suggest potential 62x multipliers are within range if listing conditions align, far beyond what Solana could realistically offer in a single cycle. The branding has resonated with communities hungry for narrative tokens, while presale mechanics build scarcity at every stage. The comparison is striking: institutions may capture steady Solana growth, while retail could amplify gains with smaller presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. It‚Äôs this divergence, steady Wall Street bets versus retail multipliers, that makes MAGACOIN FINANCE a focal point in current discussions. Institutional Confidence vs. Retail FOMO The current landscape highlights a fascinating divergence: Wall Street seeks regulatory clarity, liquidity, and institutional wrappers, while retail gravitates toward hype cycles, memes, and community-driven narratives. Solana is increasingly painted as a long-term institutional bet, the kind that underpins structured products and ETF discussions. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE embodies the speculative, retail-driven culture, rapid community adoption, grassroots branding, and scarcity-led tokenomics. Both play vital roles in the crypto market‚Äôs evolution. One gives traditional finance a new tool; the other gives retail a chance to replicate early winners. For portfolio builders, the question isn‚Äôt either/or. It‚Äôs whether they want exposure to both worlds: the solidity of infrastructure adoption and the potential lightning strike of speculative presales. Conclusion Crypto markets are rarely singular in their direction. They expand by narratives running in parallel, infrastructure gaining Wall Street adoption, and retail energy chasing the next breakout. Solana may very well become the blockchain Wall Street leans on for tokenized products, ETF structures, and regulated exposure. At the same time, retail investors are not sitting idle; they are already hunting for speculative projects that can replicate early-cycle gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as one of those plays, audited, scarcity-driven, community-powered, and carrying ambitious upside projections. While Solana captures institutional credibility, MAGACOIN represents retail‚Äôs willingness to place bold bets. Both threads matter, and together they define the rhythm of today‚Äôs crypto market.

He noted that his attention remains on Bitcoin for the moment, but emphasized that XRP‚Äôs reaction during this period could determine his next move. In a recent post , he wrote, ‚Äútrying to work out where I‚Äôm going to bid XRP here,‚Äù making clear that timing is central to his strategy. Rather than rushing into a position, the analyst explained he wants to see whether XRP makes a decisive move to take liquidity. According to him, once he gets a clearer picture, he will update followers, showing his intent to wait for stronger confirmation before acting. Waiting for Confirmation The comments highlight a patient approach, as he stated that he will only buy more XRP if conditions become clearer. He acknowledged that he does not plan to force an entry at current levels, but is open to taking action when he sees a viable setup. His measured stance illustrates the caution many traders adopt when markets appear uncertain. Trying to work out where I‚Äôm going to bid $XRP here. I‚Äôm mainly watching this right now for $BTC and I want to see how $XRP reacts during this time / if we get this move to take the liquidity. As and when I get a clearer picture I‚Äôll let you know. If I don‚Äôt get any extra $XRP ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/eJWMq7tpgv ‚Äî Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) September 26, 2025 This perspective also places Bitcoin in an important role. The analyst specified that he is mainly watching Bitcoin at the moment, underlining how movements in the largest cryptocurrency continue to influence his outlook for XRP. While XRP has its own momentum, Bitcoin remains the wider market driver that can sway sentiment and price action. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price Direction Considerations In a follow-up exchange with community members, the analyst addressed possible ranges for XRP before any rebound. One user suggested that the asset may fall toward the $2 to $2.2 region. Cryptoinsightuk responded by acknowledging that he is eyeing $2.35, while also highlighting the risk that XRP could show strength against Bitcoin and mislead traders. This exchange gives more context to his earlier remarks. The $2.35 level appears to serve as a reference point for him, though he remains aware that market behavior does not always follow clean levels. By recognizing both downside possibilities and the chance of sudden relative strength, he shows an openness to different outcomes rather than committing to a single path. Balancing Patience and Readiness The overall message from the analyst‚Äôs posts is one of patience combined with readiness. He made clear that he will not bid for XRP without greater clarity, but left open the possibility of seizing the next available buying opportunity . With Bitcoin liquidity patterns still on his radar, XRP‚Äôs next decisive move may depend heavily on how Bitcoin trades in the near term. Until then, his updates suggest that followers can expect caution until stronger signals emerge. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This caused the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index to plunge by 16 points in a single day, sinking to 28 yesterday, its lowest level since March. At the time of writing, the index has recovered slightly to 33, but it still in the Fear zone. This may unsettle many investors, but history shows that fearful conditions may be blessings in disguise for Bitcoin investors. Related Reading: XRP Eyeing Explosive Move In Next Few Months, Research Shows Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Drops To 28 This week has been tough for many cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. Bitcoin, which started the week above $115,000, entered into an extended decline that saw it break below $110,000, which in turn led to liquidations of over $1 billion worth of positions across the industry. This move also saw Ethereum break below $4,000, alongside altcoins likes XRP, Solana extending to the downside. Taken together, these moves erased the cautious optimism of last week, when the index sat at a neutral level of 48. Instead, Bitcoin‚Äôs Fear and Greed Index fell to as low as 28, which is a dramatic 16 point plunge in a single day. This crash in the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index shows just how fast sentiment can reverse when important price thresholds fail to hold. However, while the fearful mood might appear to be a bearish hint, these conditions could be an opportunity for long-term traders. The Fear and Greed Index has historically been a contrarian indicator, with extreme fear levels typically appearing before significant rebounds. Earlier in March, when the index last reached similar depths, Bitcoin was trading at a relative low around $83,000. Today, even after breaking below 30 on the index again, Bitcoin is about $27,000 higher than it was in March. Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index. Source: Alternative.me Constructive Outlook For The Coming Weeks The broader takeaway from this sentiment shift is that the crypto market may be closer to its next recovery phase than many expect. The index‚Äôs slight rebound to 33 today from yesterday‚Äôs low of 28 shows that some traders are already positioning for a turnaround. For one, Bitcoin‚Äôs current prices could give savvy investors the chance to accumulate Bitcoin at discount prices. Bitcoin rarely sustains rallies in conditions of overwhelming greed. Instead, consolidations and corrections reset sentiment and make room for healthier growth. For instance, crypto analyst Michael Pizzino said in a post on X, that the most recent fear could be the turning point Bitcoin and crypto has been waiting for.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the new kid on the block is taking the top spot. Dubbed ‚ÄúADA 2.0‚Äù by several analysts, Mutuum Finance is capturing attention for its dual-lending architecture, combining Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) systems to maximize capital efficiency and returns. Priced at $0.035 in presale, the project is now at phase 6 which is 50% sold out. At presale, Mutuum Finance already has over $16.4 million. While ADA continues to battle through significant stages of resistance and meets slower momentum in prices, Mutuum‚Äôs value at an early stage and expectations for explosive growth have made it a solid hedge. Cardano is Struggling with Resistance While Investors Await Breakout Signal Cardano (ADA) remains in the conservative phase, trading at the $0.89 level while struggling to break past a significant resistance of $0.93, which must be overcome in order to develop a stronger bullish leg. The recent price action also hints at the chances of a short-term correction, and ADA can even pullback to the $0.80‚Äì$0.85 demand area before making another attempt at surging. These levels are still important for traders as it will take persistently active buying pressure above the resistance levels to set up ADA for a more powerful surge upwards. Until then, investors are observing the setup of ADA carefully for hints at the turn in momentum that will revive its next wave of bulls. Mutuum Finance Blows Up During Presale Mutuum Finance is providing investors an opportunity to be among the first to get into this project and buy tokens at a discount. $0.035 for each MUTM in phase 6 is a bargain. Presale has been a success, with more than $16.4 million raised and more than 16,600 token holders, proof of trust in the project. Mutuum Finance has introduced an official Bug Bounty Program on CertiK with a reward limit of $50,000 USDT. The program invites white-hat hackers, developers, and researchers to try the codebase for bugs. Bounties are paid on bugs of any severity level so that even minor-level bugs are rewarded. Mutuum Finance uses hybrid lending protocol borrowing from Peer-to-Contract (P2C) as well as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models for ultimate flexibility. The P2C model is employed for the acceptance of the contracts in such a manner so that it can monitor the market so that the interest rates can be fixed. It is designed in such a manner so that the investors will receive passive income and the lenders will lend at minimal interest rates and the contracts will automatically conduct the transaction. P2P model allows the lenders and borrowers to communicate directly with one another in real time. The model introduces the potential of lending riskier assets such as meme coins. In the quest for accuracy and up-to-date prices, Mutuum Finance is leveraging Chainlink oracles of top cap token price aggregators USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, combined feeds, and on-chain data feeds are being used in bear market protection. Strong foundation of accurate prices is being leveraged in collateral management, liquidation, and risk calculation for the stability and efficiency of the protocol irrespective of market conditions. Cardano‚Äôs consolidation has investors seeking better-upside options such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). At Phase 6 presale at $0.035, already 50% sold out, MUTM has already raised more than $16.4 million from 16,600+ investors. Its dual-lending P2P and P2C model and early-stage potential have made it the moniker ‚ÄúADA 2.0.‚Äù With solid growth projections, the time to snap up MUTM tokens before the presale ends is now.

Here‚Äôs the most important one so far ‚Äî how does it affect price? Network Activity On Decline As Price Rises In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, crypto pundit CryptoOnchain highlighted a growing negative divergence between Bitcoin‚Äôs price and the number of active addresses within the cryptocurrency‚Äôs network. The analyst‚Äôs report depended on the Bitcoin Active Addresses metric, which, as is apparent, tracks the number of unique wallet addresses participating in transactions on the network within a given period. The value of this metric reflects the amount of user activity or engagement of the crypto network. From the chart shared by CryptoOnchain, there is ‚Äúa clear negative divergence between Bitcoin‚Äôs price and the 14-day moving average of active addresses.‚Äù What this means is that the broader Bitcoin bull rally is happening against a backdrop of reduced network activity and user engagement. The on-chain analyst further explained that such divergence typically functions as an early warning or signal that the bullish momentum might be losing its strength. As the cryptocurrency thus loses its bullish momentum , the risk of the BTC price undergoing correctional activity may simultaneously increase. Aside from the risk of correction, there is also the possibility of the Bitcoin network activity falling even further. When this happens, demand for BTC could further weaken, which could temporarily translate to increased selling pressure. BTC Buyers On Binance Losing Against The Sellers In another post on CryptoQuant, online pundit Arab Chain published data from Binance showing that the net Buy-Side Pressure vs Bitcoin Price remained negative for most of the day. This means that more sell transactions have been executed compared to the buys on Binance over the past 24 hours. The crypto expert also explained that attempts by buyers to push Bitcoin‚Äôs price above $113,000 fell short, as Buy-Side Pressure on the world‚Äôs largest exchange by trading volume continued to lag within the negative territory. On the positive side of the market outlook, Arab Chain noted that ‚Äúa clear and sustained positive turn‚Äù in the Buy-Side Pressure, with a close above $113,000, is critical for the market‚Äôs picture to become a little more optimistic.

The strength in LINKBTC is adding momentum, suggesting further pressure from the bulls. On the intraday chart, the $22 level is emerging as the next key bullish zone, while lower time frames remain the focus for spotting the next scalp opportunity. LINKBTC To Trigger A Reversal For Chainlink In an elaborate analysis, CryptoWzrd confirmed a strong bullish close for both the price of Chainlink and the LINK/BTC pairing. Notably, the LINK/BTC pair printed a powerful bullish daily candle, an event that coincided with a decrease in Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. This simultaneous action suggests that capital is rotating out of Bitcoin and into altcoins like LINK, providing significant underlying strength. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Triangle Setup Points To $100, Says Analyst The analyst believes that a key confirmation of a major reversal is near. Achieving just one more bullish daily close from the LINK/BTC pair would offer further bullish momentum, which would solidify the reversal. Such a development would significantly aid LINK in becoming more bullish from its present price location. Looking at the price structure, the analysis identifies $20 as the primary daily support level for Chainlink. The current setup, driven by the strength in the LINK/BTC pair, suggests that if a second consecutive bullish daily close occurs, it could spur a rapid V-shape recovery. This implies that the recent dip would be quickly and aggressively retraced. Should this V-shape recovery materialize, the immediate outlook points to a rally toward key resistance targets such as $25, followed by the more ambitious target of $30. Holding Key Resistance Zone Could Unlock Fresh Long Opportunities CryptoWzrd highlighted that both volatility and a strong underlying bullish bias characterized the intraday chart. A key takeaway is that a move above the $22 resistance level is an indicator of strength. Based on this impending move, the analyst stated his intention to look for a long position. Related Reading: Chainlink Bulls Eye $30 Target But Must First Overcome Crucial Resistance The analyst also outlined an alternate entry scenario that could present itself sooner. He suggested that if a bearish pullback were to occur from the current price location, followed immediately by a decisive bullish reversal, this reversal pattern could trigger an early long opportunity. Meanwhile, an immediate downside support level to watch is identified at $19.80. For the time being, the analyst is in a waiting period, as the current environment is ambiguous in terms of immediate entry. CryptoWzrd concluded that the next course of action is to wait for the market to further develop and produce chart formation that confirms the direction.

The selloff wiped out a huge chunk of market value in a single day, with the stock plunging roughly 87% on heavy volume. Company Announcement And Missing Details According to the firm‚Äôs press release , the plan was first disclosed in a filing that said the asset pool would emphasize ‚Äústability and transparency‚Äù and concentrate on major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The release also said more specifics ‚Äî including the pool‚Äôs size and allocation ‚Äî would be provided later, subject to regulatory and market conditions.

The initiative aims to‚Ä¶ ‚Äî stock setter (@MarcJacksonLA) September 26, 2025 Market Reaction And Price Moves On the day of the announcement, Smart Digital Group‚Äôs share price fell from levels near the prior close to intraday lows reported at about $1.63 to $1.88. The fall represented an 86‚Äì88% move in some reports, with many outlets using an 87% figure to sum up the drop. The company had been a hot name earlier this year ‚Äî one report shows a market cap around $364 million and a run that included a 123% jump over the prior six months ‚Äî but Friday‚Äôs session erased most of that gain. Trading desk sources and market coverage point to two big drivers: panic selling by retail holders and sharp re-pricing by short sellers. Price swings were extreme. Many investors said they had expected clearer rules about how corporate cash or balance-sheet assets would be used, and they did not get it. Regulatory And Analyst Concerns Based on reports, regulators have been watching trades tied to companies that announce crypto-treasury moves, and in this case the SEC and FINRA interest was mentioned in several stories. Analysts and commentators said the lack of disclosure was a red flag, noting that companies that have publicly moved into crypto in the past sometimes saw gains ‚Äî but only when management spelled out the guardrails and the source of funds. Some market watchers cautioned that the fall may include an element of overshoot. When confidence evaporates fast, prices can move past what fundamentals alone would justify. Other observers said the decision to shift part of a corporate balance sheet into volatile assets raises straightforward risks: accounting complexity, custody questions, and regulatory scrutiny.

Haider Rafique, global managing partner for government and investor relations at crypto exchange OKX, argues that concentrating large amounts of BTC on a government balance sheet could undermine Bitcoin‚Äôs core appeal as neutral, decentralized money. He posed a pointed question: ‚ÄúWhat happens in a few years if a new administration decides this was a bad idea?‚Äù Rafique added, ‚ÄúDespite recent bipartisan support for crypto, it is essential to remember that administrative policies can change quickly. As circumstances change over time, the concentration of large amounts of BTC on a country‚Äôs balance sheet could represent a liquidation risk.‚Äù Government Ownership Could Distort Markets Rafique warns that governments holding significant portions of the BTC supply would be able to manipulate prices by selling large amounts at once. Such a move could shock markets and undercut investor confidence in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs independence from state control. Germany‚Äôs sale of 50,000 BTC in 2024, which helped keep prices below $60,000, serves as an example of how government action can weigh on the market, Rafique said. Impact on the Dollar and Financial Markets Beyond crypto itself, a U.S. Bitcoin reserve could signal weakness in the dollar, which underpins global finance. Rafique warned that establishing a BTC reserve ‚Äúwould be a loss of confidence in the dollar.‚Äù He argued that building a strategic reserve would tell investors the U.S. currency cannot sustain its value solely on economic fundamentals. This could push investors to safe havens like gold or the Swiss franc while sparking sell-offs of riskier assets. Rafique predicted such a chain reaction could trigger cascading liquidations across financial markets, ending in a sharp downturn as participants respond to a seismic shift in global finance. Clashing with Bitcoin‚Äôs Original Ethos Bitcoin advocates have long promoted the idea of nation-state-level treasuries as a path to making the cryptocurrency the global reserve asset. However, critics warn that state-level control conflicts with Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized design. Centralized ownership could weaken its credibility as a currency that transcends politics and national boundaries. Timing and Strategy Questions Remain Some proponents argue a U.S. reserve would strengthen America‚Äôs monetary position and accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption as a unit of account. But others urge caution, citing political risk and the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Without clear rules for accumulation and liquidation, a government reserve could transform from a strategic asset into a destabilizing liability. As debate intensifies, policymakers face the challenge of integrating Bitcoin into national policy without compromising its foundational principles or global market stability.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-28 02:05:55

Since its launch in 2017, the network has expanded at an explosive pace, crossing 334.59 million total accounts and securing a position as one of the most heavily used blockchains in the digital asset space. This milestone doesn‚Äôt just mark growth; it underscores TRON‚Äôs ability to capture adoption at a global scale. Few projects in crypto have managed to sustain this kind of activity, yet TRON continues to prove its relevance as the backbone of a thriving digital economy. Daily USDT Transactions Keep TRON Ahead One of TRON‚Äôs biggest success stories is its role in stablecoin transfers, particularly Tether (USDT). On average, the network processes 2.36 million USDT transactions daily, according to CoinMarketCap data, with an eye-popping $22.55 billion in volume moving across its chain each day. This volume isn‚Äôt just speculative trading. It reflects real-world demand for fast, low-cost settlement. Cross-border payments, peer-to-peer transfers, and decentralized finance (DeFi) all rely on TRON‚Äôs infrastructure. The network has become the default highway for stablecoin activity, leaving competitors struggling to keep up. A recent community update highlighted this trend, showing how TRON dominates the market for stablecoin transfers Since its founding in 2017, #Tron has surpassed 334.59M accounts in just eight years. It currently processes an average of 2.36M $USDT transfers daily, with a daily $USDT transfer volume of $22.55B. https://t.co/m802HEOMBm pic.twitter.com/MU5i22TFoF ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 27, 2025 A Blockchain Built for Scale From the start, TRON positioned itself differently from other blockchains. Instead of chasing hype cycles, it focused on performance and adoption. That strategy is now paying dividends. The network consistently delivers high throughput, low fees, and reliability, three factors that matter most to users moving billions in stablecoins or interacting with decentralized applications (dApps). These advantages have made TRON not just a blockchain, but a backbone for developers and enterprises that require real scalability. Its energy-efficient consensus model and ability to process thousands of transactions per second have made it a preferred choice for projects that demand both speed and cost efficiency. Global Adoption and Real-World Utility TRON‚Äôs influence extends far beyond speculative trading. Today, it plays a critical role in cross-border remittances, digital commerce, and DeFi. With stablecoin transfers surging, TRON has essentially become a settlement layer for the new digital economy. The proof lies in adoption data. The more people and businesses interact with TRON, the more the network cements itself as a global standard. Each account added to the network signals trust in its ability to deliver fast and secure financial infrastructure. This expanding user base shows TRON is not just gaining traction, it has already achieved true global scale, as highlighted by recent metrics In only 8 years since launch, #TRON has grown into a network with over 334.59M total accounts Every single day, it handles around 2.36M USDT transactions, moving an incredible $22.55B in volume That‚Äôs not just adoption ‚Äî that‚Äôs global scale. https://t.co/ph2eLe5YUC ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/SnJpofDBHu ‚Äî H·ªìng Ng·ªçc | Ruby (@hongngo38104169) September 27, 2025 TRON in Numbers Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of TRON‚Äôs current standing: Total accounts: 334.59 million Average daily USDT transactions: 2.36 million Daily stablecoin volume: $22.55 billion Use cases: Cross-border payments, decentralized applications, remittances, DeFi These numbers represent more than growth, they show that TRON is no longer an ‚Äúemerging‚Äù blockchain. It‚Äôs a network that has already secured its place in global finance. Why TRON‚Äôs Growth Matters The blockchain space is crowded, but TRON‚Äôs trajectory sets it apart. Many projects promise scalability and adoption, yet few deliver consistent results. TRON‚Äôs eight-year journey is proof that real adoption comes from solving real problems. Its dominance in stablecoin transfers alone positions it as a central player in the future of digital payments. As businesses and individuals seek faster, cheaper ways to move money, TRON provides a proven infrastructure that can handle global demand. As TRON moves beyond its eighth year, the network is showing no signs of slowing down. With over 334 million accounts already established, TRON‚Äôs next phase will likely focus on deepening its role in DeFi, cross-border settlements, and enterprise adoption. Its continued expansion suggests a future where TRON is not just a blockchain but a core layer of global financial infrastructure. And with daily activity in the billions, that future is already taking shape. In less than a decade, TRON has transformed into one of the largest and most active blockchains in the world. Its record-breaking adoption, massive daily transaction volume, and role in powering stablecoin transfers set it apart as a true industry leader. The message is clear: TRON is not just participating in the blockchain revolution, it is helping to define it. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Zooming out into a larger timeframe shows the price structure on the weekly timeframe is pointing to an explosive breakout is in the making. Technical analysis shows that the meme coin, which has already shown it can deliver extraordinary rallies, is now sitting on a powder keg that will send it to new all-time highs. Particularly, technical projections indicate that if the current trend continues, Dogecoin could surge to $1.30. Related Reading: XRP Eyeing Explosive Move In Next Few Months, Research Shows Pattern Repetition Points To $1.3 Target The first interesting chart observation focuses on how Dogecoin rallies unfold in repeating waves of expansion. This analysis, which was posted on the social media platform X by Kamran Asghar, shows how Dogecoin has been following a repeating structure in the weekly candlestick timeframe chart. In late 2023, the Dogecoin price broke out of consolidation with a 300% surge, followed by another wave in 2024 that delivered a 500% rally from trendline support to resistance. Each cycle began with a bounce from the ascending white trendline shown on the weekly chart below, which has consistently acted as the backbone of Dogecoin‚Äôs long-term uptrend. Now, the pattern is setting up for what could be an 800% rally, highlighted in the green projection box on the chart below. This move, if completed, would see the Dogecoin price rallying past its current all-time high of $0.7316 and finally breaking above the $1 price level. Particularly, the projection puts Dogecoin rallying more than 800% to reach a price target around $1.30. Chart Image From X: Kamran Asghar Dogecoin Bullish Channel Still Intact Since 2021 Another technical analysis looks at a broader view of Dogecoin‚Äôs performance over the last four years. Price action on the weekly timeframe is plotted within a colored channel system, starting from the 2021 breakout, as shown in the chart below. The lower orange line has consistently acted as support, while the green midline has worked as a pivot point. Lastly, the upper blue line is serving as resistance. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.23, and this is just between the green midline and the orange support, meaning the bullish structure is still playing out. According to analyst KrissPax, who posted the technical analysis on the social media platform X, Dogecoin is still on track to keep moving to the upper band of the channel, which is marked in blue. Reaching this upper band would put the meme coin in the $0.70 to $1.00 range and retesting its all-time high in 2021. However, in this case, the first step would be to break above the green midline, which is currently around $0.4.

Why This Fork Matters For Ethereum‚Äôs Long-Term Roadmap Leading smart contract platform, Ethereum, is set for another important milestone this November. Sequence has highlighted on X that the Fusaka upgrade is a foundational hard fork infrastructure designed to strengthen the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) while ensuring seamless compatibility for builders. This upgrade is engineered to abstract the blockchain complexity and deliver smoother authentication and user flows across the blockchain ecosystem. The best part is that Sequence is already ahead of the curve by having the tools and infrastructure that prepare developers for Fusaka‚Äôs impact today. While the Fusaka upgrade aims at strengthening the ETH ecosystem, Wendy J has noted that ETH has seen a notable price dip, as the SentientAGI GRID chat has flagged some activity behind the move. According to the AI platform, several 100,000 ETH transfers were recorded in the past 24 hours. Interestingly, this kind of large-scale transfer suggests that major holders are likely either profit-taking after the run-up or repositioning their capital. Sentient Chat also listed other factors that could have contributed to the market-wide dump. In the meantime, analyst Wendy advised the community to use Sentient Chat for any crypto-related questions. With Sentient Chat, you can instantly generate asset reports fueled by DeFi data, request trading insights tailored to current conditions, or even deploy autonomous agents to handle on-chain tasks in real time to enhance decision-making and yield optimization. Why This Correction Looks Healthy, Not Critical On the daily time frame, the recent correction in Ethereum has pushed the Relative Strength Index (RSI) into a critical oversold zone, a level we have not witnessed since the major accumulation phase back in July. BTCBlueWhale mentioned that there is nothing critical in this current correction. Meanwhile, back in July, ETH showed the same setup, and the price dipped into oversold territory, which retested the previous resistance level, and used that structure as a springboard for a massive rally. Currently, the daily chart is printing a very similar scenario with trading in a comparable accumulation zone and showing a clear resistance-to-support (R/S) flip, which is a classic sign of structure holding the price strong. Layering on top of that, the setup aligns almost perfectly with the PO3 strategy.",Ethereum|BTCBlueWhale|DeFi|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum ecosystem|Ethereum fusaka upgrade|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum Virtual Machine|ethusd|ETHUSDT|EVM|PO3|relative strength index|RSI|SentientAGI GRID|Sequence|Wendy J,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|FORKS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-28 03:00:45
52366422,https://nulltx.com/?p=152216,1759028630,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,World Liberty Executes First $WLFI Token Burn After Community Approval,https://nulltx.com/world-liberty-executes-first-wlfi-token-burn-after-community-approval/,"World Liberty Finance (@worldlibertyfi) has taken a decisive step to strengthen its token economy. Following community approval, the protocol completed its first-ever $WLFI burn. The move combined fee-based burns with open market buybacks, removing millions of tokens from circulation across Ethereum and BSC. Breaking Down the Numbers The process started with 3,109,320 $WLFI burned directly from protocol fees on Ethereum and BSC. That marked the first official burn under the new proposal. The team didn‚Äôt stop there. They also bought 3,814,095 $WLFI from the open market. Purchases were spread across three stablecoins: 401,165.93 $USD1 196,146.40 $USDC 201,026.75 $USDT All of those tokens have now been permanently removed from supply. According to data, $WLFI is trading around $0.2 with a market cap of $5.12B (CoinMarketCap). Daily volume sits near $346M, showing active interest as the burn takes hold. The Capital Pool Before the burn, World Liberty gathered capital through a mix of protocol fees and market operations. The team collected: 4.91M WLFI ($1.01M) $1.06M in fees across Solana, BSC, and Ethereum That combined pool created the base for their buyback campaign. With it, they went into the open market and repurchased 6.04M WLFI ($1.06M). The Final WLFI Burn As the repurchases were complete, the team carried out a sweeping burn. A total of 7.89M WLFI ($1.43M) were permanently destroyed across BSC and Ethereum. That figure includes both the fee-based burn and the tokens acquired on the open market. By eliminating them, World Liberty has directly reduced circulating supply, tightening long-term tokenomics. However, the process is not fully complete. 3.06M WLFI ($638K) remain unburned on Solana. The community is now watching closely to see when those tokens will also be removed. Strategic Impact This dual strategy, combining fee burns with open market buybacks, marks a key shift for World Liberty. Instead of relying on passive deflation through transaction fees, the protocol is actively using collected capital to repurchase and destroy tokens. The impact is twofold: 1. Immediate supply reduction. Tokens are permanently out of circulation, easing downward pressure. 2. Protocol value alignment. Fees collected by the system are redirected into strengthening $WLFI‚Äôs long-term position. This approach mirrors practices seen in traditional finance, where companies repurchase shares to support value for holders. In the crypto space, it reinforces the project‚Äôs commitment to token value capture. Why It Matters for Holders Token burns are often seen as bullish because they lower supply while demand remains constant or increases. In World Liberty‚Äôs case, the first burn shows clear intent: protocol growth should translate into value for $WLFI holders. Community members now anticipate the next phase, what will happen to the 3.06M WLFI sitting on Solana. If those tokens are eventually burned, the overall impact could be even greater. Market watchers are already noting increased activity. $WLFI‚Äôs 24-hour trading volume has held steady near $5.9M, while liquidity on BSC and Ethereum remains strong. Transparency and Key Wallets World Liberty has shared wallet addresses for public tracking: Ethereum: [0x5be9a4959308A0D0c7bC0870E319314d8D957dBB](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5be9a4959308A0D0c7bC0870E319314d8D957dBB) Ethereum: [0x407F66Afb4f9876637AcCC3246099a2f9705c178](https://etherscan.io/address/0x407F66Afb4f9876637AcCC3246099a2f9705c178) Solana: 2x6Uhxmaot1cpiRisNwUcaQFPJCryGE4aTdpTYhYLENS BSC: [0xA713fc94db054AA435AF4d9c66c3433dCA98559F](https://bscscan.com/address/0xA713fc94db054AA435AF4d9c66c3433dCA98559F) This open approach allows the community to independently verify the transactions and track progress. The first burn is more than a symbolic gesture. It sets a precedent for how World Liberty will handle value capture going forward. By tying protocol growth directly to deflationary mechanics, $WLFI has a clearer path to sustainable tokenomics. Still, questions remain. The Solana supply has yet to be addressed, and the market will be watching closely for any updates. If those tokens are burned, the total reduction could surpass 10M WLFI in just one round. For now, the message is clear: World Liberty is serious about strengthening $WLFI. Each burn reduces supply, each buyback shows confidence, and each update brings more eyes to the ecosystem. World Liberty‚Äôs first burn removed nearly 8M WLFI ($1.43M) from circulation across Ethereum and BSC. Backed by protocol fees and market buybacks, the move signals a stronger, more deflationary future for the token. With $WLFI trading near $0.2, a market cap of $5.12B, and liquidity across multiple chains, the protocol‚Äôs strategy may provide long-term benefits for holders. The only question left: when will Solana‚Äôs 3.06M WLFI be burned? Until then, the community will keep watching every wallet, every burn, and every step forward. World Liberty Financial has burned 3,109,320.66 $WLFI from protocol fees on Ethereum & BSC.

The answer may lie in three standout stories dominating headlines right now. First, the BullZilla presale September 2025 has taken the market by storm, racing through its stages every 48 hours or whenever $100,000 is raised. At the same time, Hedera and Stellar continue to push boundaries in blockchain scalability and cross-border payments, proving that big innovations aren‚Äôt limited to meme coins. Adding to the excitement, the global XRP community recently wrapped up XRP Seoul 2025, a landmark event where over 3,000 attendees unveiled groundbreaking advances in staking, tokenization, and real-world asset integration. This wider momentum is fueling renewed confidence across the altcoin sector, setting the stage for new investment opportunities in September 2025. Whether you‚Äôre seeking early-stage potential, long-term stability, or cutting-edge technology, this month presents a unique mix of opportunities. Below, we break down why BullZilla ($BZIL) , Hedera, and Stellar top the list of top crypto coins to invest in September 2025, with BullZilla‚Äôs explosive presale leading the narrative. BullZilla Presale September 2025: Early Entry Still Matters The BullZilla presale September 2025 is drawing investors with its dynamic pricing and rapid growth. The project is currently in Stage 4C, priced at $0.00009907, after raising over $670,000 and selling more than 29 billion tokens. Each new chapter brings a price hike, either every 48 hours or once another $100,000 is raised creating urgency for early participants. Key Bull Zilla metrics as of late September 2025: Current Stage: 4C ‚Äì Red Candle Buffet Current Price: $0.00009907 Presale Tally: Over $670,000 raised Token Holders: 2,000+ Projected Listing Price: $0.00527 These figures reflect a robust mutation mechanism, where scarcity increases over time thanks to the platform‚Äôs ‚ÄúRoar Burn,‚Äù destroying tokens at each milestone. Such mechanics have turned BullZilla new crypto investment opportunities into a focal point for short- and long-term investors alike. How to Join the BullZilla Presale: Visit the official BullZilla website. Connect a compatible crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask). Purchase using ETH, BNB, or USDT. Claim tokens after the presale concludes. Early participation remains critical, as each stage jump pushes the entry price higher, reinforcing BullZilla‚Äôs reputation as one of the top crypto coins to invest in September 2025. Hedera: Expanding Enterprise Adoption While BullZilla grabs presale headlines, Hedera (HBAR) continues to deliver on its enterprise-focused roadmap. Priced around $0.21 with a daily trading volume exceeding $308 million, Hedera is seeing steady adoption among major corporations seeking energy-efficient distributed ledger solutions. September 2025 has been particularly notable for Hedera‚Äôs partnerships in supply-chain tracking and decentralized identity management. These collaborations underscore why bullzilla vs Hedera Stellar analysis is resonating with investors looking to diversify. Hedera‚Äôs unique Hashgraph consensus offers high throughput and low latency, distinguishing it from traditional blockchains. This efficiency makes it a candidate for governments and global enterprises exploring tokenized real-world assets, one of the hottest trends emerging from events like XRP Seoul 2025. Investors evaluating the top crypto coins to invest in September 2025 view Hedera as a stable, long-term technology play, complementing the speculative growth of early-stage projects like BullZilla. Stellar: Cross-Border Payments in Focus Stellar (XLM) remains a pillar of the cross-border payments sector. As of late September 2025, Stellar trades near $0.35 with a 24-hour volume of $279 million, reflecting consistent network activity despite broader market volatility. This month, Stellar announced new integrations with regional banking systems in Southeast Asia, a move expected to expand its global footprint and transaction throughput. These real-world use cases give Stellar a unique advantage among the best cryptos. September 2025 BullZilla investors are also watching. Stellar‚Äôs development team continues to refine its Soroban smart-contract platform, enhancing its appeal to developers and fintech startups. For investors seeking a balance of established infrastructure and future growth, Stellar rounds out the trio of top crypto coins to invest in September 2025. Conclusion: Diversification for September 2025 The BullZilla presale September 2025 is clearly the headline story, offering early investors a chance to secure tokens before subsequent stage hikes. Its combination of scarcity mechanisms and community-driven growth puts it at the forefront of speculative opportunities this month. However, Hedera and Stellar demonstrate why diversification remains a smart strategy. Hedera‚Äôs enterprise-grade DLT and Stellar‚Äôs cross-border payments network provide technological depth and long-term relevance that complement BullZilla‚Äôs explosive presale energy. For investors seeking to capture both immediate and sustained value, a portfolio combining BullZilla‚Äôs early presale join in 2025 with selective positions in Hedera and Stellar stands out as one of the most compelling plays among the top crypto coins to invest in September 2025.

Here‚Äôs What to Expect,https://timestabloid.com/big-liquidation-cluster-for-xrp-at-2-20-2-40-heres-what-to-expect/,"XRP continues to navigate a turbulent trading environment, and the latest liquidity heatmap offers an important signal for market participants. According to Steph Is Crypto, a prominent analyst, there is a big liquidation cluster between $2.2 and $2.4, an area where a large concentration of orders sits. Liquidity maps are used to track concentrations of pending buy and sell orders. Areas where orders accumulate often act as magnets for price, as traders anticipate movement into those zones. When the price approaches these clusters, it can trigger swift reactions , either from liquidations or fresh positioning. Big liquidation cluster for #XRP at $2.20-$2.40 Max pain could hit before new highs! pic.twitter.com/8Z18EsQSEh ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 26, 2025 The Meaning of the Cluster The presence of heavy liquidity between $2.2 and $2.4 signals a potential stress point. If XRP tests that level, it could flush out leveraged positions before stabilizing. The asset is currently struggling, trading at $2.78, after a 0.71% increase from yesterday, but it is still well below $3. Steph Is Crypto added that ‚ÄúMax pain could hit before new highs,‚Äù suggesting that the asset may need to undergo an even sharper correction before attempting another upward run. This view aligns with the principle that markets often seek liquidity before continuing in their prevailing direction. For traders, the highlighted range becomes a critical area to monitor. A move into this zone could confirm whether sellers still hold the upper hand or if strong demand emerges once orders are absorbed. Current Market Behavior The heatmap shows that XRP experienced notable swings in September, with the price fluctuating between $2.7 and $3.2. Despite attempts to establish momentum above $3, repeated rejections have kept the asset consolidating. The lack of follow-through suggests that deeper liquidity pools remain attractive targets for market movement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Should XRP continue to struggle at current levels, traders will pay closer attention to the $2.2 to $2.4 zone. If that range is reached, liquidation activity could intensify, creating sharp movements that influence broader market sentiment. Conversely, a strong defense of that level could present a lucrative buying opportunity and provide a foundation for renewed upward momentum. Outlook for Traders Market participants now face a period of heightened uncertainty. Liquidity heatmaps do not predict direction with certainty, but they identify areas where decisive moves are more likely. With XRP holding above $2.7 but showing signs of weakness, the possibility of a test near $2.2 to $2.4 remains significant. This liquidity cluster will be a key battleground for XRP. However, the potential breakout that comes from it could send the digital asset to new heights. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Its pullback also coincided with the recent crypto market crash that pushed most assets lower last week. Ether was trading at $4,000, down from the year-to-date high $4,920. So, will it rebound this week? Why Ethereum price has crashed ETH price has plunged in the past days as investors started to book profits after the recent surge that pushed it from a low of $1,380 to nearly $5,000. It is common for an asset, especially in the crypto industry, to retreat after going through a strong rally. The other main reason for the plunge is that demand from American investors has waned in the past few days. Data shows that these funds had outflows worth about $248 million on Friday last week. These funds shed a record $795 million in assets last week after they added $556 million in the previous week. BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA is still the biggest Ethereum ETF with over $15 billion in assets, while Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE has $4.26 billion. All Ethereum ETFs now hold about $26 billion in assets, equivalent to 5.37% of its market capitalization. The other main reason why Ethereum price has crashed is that no Ethereum Treasury company has made any major acquisition recently. Data shows that these companies now hold about 3.61 million ETH coins today, a level they have remained at in the past few weeks. Tom Lee‚Äôs BitMine Immersion now holds about 1.713 million coins worth $6.86 billion, with its last purchase being on August 28. SharpLink Gaming holds 797,704 coins worth about $3.19 billion. The other top companies that hold Ethereum are firms like BitDigital, Coinbase, and The Ether Machine. One reason for the sluggish growth is that demand for treasury companies among investors has faded in the past few months. For example, MSTR stock price has tumbled into a bear market while other Bitcoin treasury companies have had a worse performance. Ethereum price has also plunged because of the weakness of its ecosystem. Data shows that the total value locked (TVL) in its ecosystem has dropped by 12% in the last 30 days to $181 billion. The stablecoin supply in the network has dropped by 2.32% in the previous 7 days to $157 billion. ETH price technical analysis Ethereum price chart | Source: TradingView The daily timeframe chart shows that the Ethereum price peaked at a record high of $4,918 in late August and then pulled back to the current $4,000. Ether has moved below the important support level at $4,062, the highest point in December last year. The coin has moved slightly below the 50-day and 25-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). On the positive side, this pullback is part of the handle section of the cup-and-handle pattern that has been forming since November last year. Also, it bottomed at the Major S&R pivot point at $3,750. It is common for an asset to rebound whenever it hits this resistance point. Most importantly, it also formed a Harami candlestick, which happens when a bullish candle is fully enclosed inside a large bearish one. This pattern often leads to a rebound. Therefore, the coin will likely have a bullish reversal, with the next key resistance level to watch being at 4,900.

At the same time, a popular analyst outlined the next key support zone if the one DOGE is fighting for now cracks. A lot can change in the cryptocurrency markets in the span of just a couple of weeks, and this is particularly true for the ever-volatile meme coin niche. The leader spiked to $0.31 on September 14, which became a multi-month peak, and the community was excited about the prospect of another run toward $0.50. However, the tables quickly turned for the worse in the following two weeks, and DOGE plunged to $0.22 during this market-wide crash a few days back. As of press time, DOGE sits at just under $0.23, which is beneath the coveted $0.24 support line. If the asset fails to reclaim the latter, its next crucial support lies at $0.19, which could serve as the last line of defense before another plunge toward $0.15.

These large market participants that can impact the markets in a few different ways with their actions have started to dispose of DOGE tokens. According to Ali Martinez, they have sold off 40 million coins in just a day during the market-wide crash, which is in stark contrast to their buying wave earlier this week. Moreover, their holdings have dropped from over 11 billion tokens in mid-September to 10.75 billion as of now. 40 million Dogecoin $DOGE sold by whales in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/VpKLI2hm87 ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) September 27, 2025 The post DOGE Under Pressure: Whales Offload as Key Support Level Approaches appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|DOGEBTC|DOGEUSD|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-09-28 05:21:07

In contrast, other analysts remain optimistic about its future trajectory, outlining that Q4 and Q1 are just around the corner, periods that have been historically very bullish for ETH and other alts. Another $4K Rejection? Recall that the second-largest cryptocurrency stood tall above $4,700 just a couple of weeks ago. Although it started to slip in the following days, it still maintained the $4,500 level by last Monday when all hell broke loose. In the span of just an hour or so, ETH slumped by over $400 and dumped beneath $4,100. Following an unsuccessful recovery attempt that was quickly halted at $4,200, Ethereum dumped once again. This time, it was even more violent as the asset plummeted to a multi-month low of $3,830 (on Bitstamp). The bulls finally reminded of their presence at this point and didn‚Äôt allow a further breakdown. However, they seem to be lacking a lot of strength, as ETH has been unable to decisively overcome the critical resistance at $4,000. If the asset indeed fails to break past this level in the following few days, the danger of a price drop to $3,500 becomes even more likely, according to Martinez. Ethereum $ETH rejected at $4,000, raising the odds of a move to $3,500. https://t.co/xWK25UhOm2 pic.twitter.com/Jfb02IPZEn ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) September 27, 2025 The analyst also outlined the following support lines if $3,500 falls, which are set at $3,020 and $2,772. Crypto Rover warned that whales have been selling substantial portions of their ETH holdings, which could result in another price slip. Uptober to Save ETH? While the analysts above painted a grim picture for ETH‚Äôs future, Michael van de Poppe stood in the opposite corner. He relied on historical performance to demonstrate that Ethereum tends to rocket at the end of each year and the beginning of the next. The markets always have a correction in September / October. Historically, Q4 and Q1 are a great period for #Altcoins . September is a terrible month, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve seen with $ETH , it‚Äôs down nearly 10%.

The MSTR stock price has plunged to $300, down from the all-time high of $543. This article explores why these stocks have plummeted this year. Bitcoin treasury stocks have plummeted this year MSTR stock has plunged by about 31% from its highest level this year and is hovering at the lowest level since April. In Japan, the Metaplanet stock price has tumbled by over 73% from the highest point this year, erasing billions of dollars in value. Bullish, which launched a successful IPO this year and has 24,000 coins, has tumbled by 45% from the all-time high. Other top Bitcoin treasury stocks that have tumbled this year are companies like Donald Trump‚Äôs Trump Media, GameStop, KindlyMD, Gemini Space Station, and MicroCloud Hologram. These stocks have underperformed the performance of Bitcoin and the broader stock market this year as the top indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices have soared to their highest levels on record. Why BTC treasury companies are struggling The first reason why many Bitcoin treasury companies have tumbled is that BTC is not doing well and has moved into a correction after falling by 12% from its highest level this year. In most cases, these Bitcoin treasury companies do well when BTC price is rising and crash when the coin is falling. However, a closer look at most of these treasury companies shows that their stocks remained on edge even when Bitcoin price rose to a record high in August this year, a sign that there are more reasons why the crash is happening. One of the main reasons is that these companies are not attracting the premium they used to have a few months ago. A good example for this is Strategy, whose mNAV multiple has dropped to 1.2, down from the November high of 3.4. Metaplanet‚Äôs multiple has tumbled from 8 to 1.4 today. Worse, some companies are trading below their NAV multiple. KindlyMD, formerly known as Nakamoto Holdings, has an mNAV multiple of 0.686, while MicroCloud Hologram‚Äôs market cap has moved to 0.27. Investors prefer buying Bitcoin treasury companies when they are trading at a high premium because it magnifies their Bitcoin returns. A company with a higher premium also benefits from the ability to raise capital easily. For example, Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy has long had a policy of not raising capital by selling shares when the mNAV is below 2.5. It changed this policy recently and has continued to use its at-the market (ATM) shares to raise capital, leading to more divergence. Also, investors are getting more careful about valuations and their business models of just buying Bitcoin. For example, MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings are worth about $69 billion and its market capitalization is $90 billion, leaving a big unexplained gap worth about $30 billion. Focus on Bitcoin ETFs Another reason why Bitcoin treasury companies are underperforming the market is that investors are opting to buy ETFs instead. SoSoValue data shows that Bitcoin ETFs have added over $2.5 billion in inflows this month, bringing their total inflows to $56 billion and their assets at $143 billion. Additionally, the ongoing performance of Bitcoin treasury companies is because of the weak sentiment among investors. It is common for stocks in a single sector to either drop or rise concurrently.

However, the asset managed to remain above a key support level, which could send it flying toward its all-time high of over $124,000. Crash Won‚Äôt Stop BTC (For Now) When we zoom out for just a few more days, bitcoin‚Äôs price calamity becomes even more evident. The cryptocurrency challenged $118,000 on September 18, just after the US Federal Reserve cut the interest rates for the first time this year. However, it failed to reclaim that level and head toward $120,000. Just the opposite, it started to lose value gradually and retraced to $115,500 during the weekend. The actual pain, though, came at the start of the business week when the bears took complete control of the market and drove BTC south to $112,000 at first and then to its lowest price position since early September of under $109,000. Bitcoin tested that support on a couple of occasions, which managed to hold for now. According to Ali Martinez, the actual make-or-break level is at $107,200. If BTC remains above it, the chances for a solid rebound to $115,000 and even $123,000 are pretty high, he said.

He made these comments in a video shared on X by Jungle Inc (@jungleincxrp), who highlighted Schwartz‚Äôs focus on ‚ÄúSmart Escrows, light programmability: built natively into the XRP Ledger,‚Äù describing it as the next big thing. David breaks down why Smart Escrows, light programmability: built natively into the XRP Ledger, could be the next big thing. pic.twitter.com/yAscg5lStW ‚Äî Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) September 25, 2025 Expanding Core Financial Use Cases Schwartz explained that the XRPL was designed to handle specific financial applications through native features, such as decentralized exchanges, issued assets, and escrows. He believes these tools already cover the majority of needs in the financial sector, stating that developers can ‚Äúonly target something like the most valuable, most important sort of 80% of those use cases, which is great.‚Äù By leveraging these existing features, Schwartz noted that native transactors could implement much of the functionality required for applications like loans. This focus on practical solutions means the XRPL can succeed without overcomplicating its design. The Role of Smart Transactors While current tools address a large portion of financial activity, Schwartz emphasized the potential of smart transactors to extend the ledger‚Äôs capabilities. He suggested that programmability on the ledger could bridge the gap for use cases that require slightly more flexibility, while still avoiding the pitfalls of fully Turing-complete smart contracts. Schwartz described this approach as a way to capture additional value . He pointed out that ‚Äúsome very specific use cases‚Ä¶can probably only be done through a little bit of a smart contract,‚Äù making limited programmability a logical step forward. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Trustless Bridging as a Key Example A primary area Schwartz highlighted is interoperability, pointing to bridging as one of the most important examples where additional flexibility is needed. He explained that current smart transactors, lacking programmability, cannot fully support the requirements of bridging solutions, making light programmability a key step toward enabling trust-minimized interoperability. By integrating programmability, XRP could support trust-minimized bridging while maintaining its reputation for speed, security, and low fees. For Schwartz, this balance ensures the network can continue serving critical financial needs without replicating the design of other platforms. Maintaining Efficiency and Reliability David Schwartz emphasized that the XRP Ledger will not become ‚Äúanother Turing-complete Ethereum clone,‚Äù but instead evolve through enhancements that preserve its speed, security, and low costs. He argued that limited programmability delivers ‚Äúa lot of bang for the buck,‚Äù expanding the ledger‚Äôs flexibility without undermining its predictability. With smart escrows and programmability, Schwartz sees the network broadening its utility while maintaining efficiency, a vision that could enhance XRP‚Äôs role in institutional Decentralized Finance (DeFi) .

In a blog post , Watkins highlighted recent analysis pointing out that digital asset treasuries (DATs) collectively hold around $105 billion in assets. This includes Bitcoin, Ether, and other significant cryptocurrencies. Notably, DAT companies are publicly traded firms that raise funds to purchase and manage cryptocurrencies on their balance sheet. Concerning DAT‚Äôs recent asset holdings, Watkins asserted that most investors in the crypto market have not yet recognized this scaling. He, therefore, urged individuals to stay updated as he speculated that a few of these companies might turn into reliable operators who can support funding, govern, and develop within the networks of the tokens they possess. Watkins envisions crypto treasury firms becoming game changers in the blockchain ecosystem Earlier, Watkins analyzed the crypto market and discovered that most investors had mainly concentrated on short-term trading trends such as premiums over net asset value, updates on fundraising, and asked questions like ‚Äúwhat is the next token?‚Äù. According to him, this focus was all an overlook of a bigger picture. He emphasized, ‚ÄúWe envision certain DATs becoming for-profit public firms similar to crypto foundations but with broader objectives to invest capital, manage businesses, and participate in governance.‚Äù In the meantime, reliable sources revealed that some DATs already possess considerable portions of the token supply. This has enabled those firms to turn their treasuries into something more than just a storage, establishing them as tools for policy formulation and product development within the industry. Watkins expanded on the recent crypto analysis by emphasizing how scale plays a critical role in the industry. He cited Solana as an example, noting that RPC service providers and market makers who stake more SOL can enhance transaction throughput and profit from price discrepancies. Similarly, in the case of Hyperliquid, he explained that interfaces staking larger amounts of HYPE could lower user fees or boost earnings without incurring additional costs. Based on his argument, possessing significant, stable pools of native assets is important as it can help these businesses expand and thrive. To demonstrate their unique features, Watkins compared these approaches to Strategy‚Äôs emphasis on BTC, which is centered on managing capital for a non-programmable asset. Unlike this game plan, he explained that tokens on smart contract platforms such as HYPE, SOL, and ETH are programmable and can be utilized directly on the blockchain. Watkins compared successful DATs to the growth mindset adopted in Berkshire Hathaway Watkins also discovered that DATs holding HYPE, SOL, and ETH can earn fees by staking them, offering liquidity, lending them out, participating in governance, and gaining important ecosystem elements, such as validators, RPC nodes, or indexers. This is a game-changer for the companies as it turns their treasuries into sources of income. To further point out a crucial aspect of this strategy, Watkins structurally compared successful DATs to a collection of popular models. These factors integrate the permanent capital present in closed-end funds and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), the focus on balance sheets that is common among banks, and the growth mindset adopted in Berkshire Hathaway. According to him, what distinguishes them is that returns are generated from crypto per share, not management fees. This makes these investments more similar to direct bets on the underlying networks instead of adhering to the usual approach of asset managers. Get seen where it counts.

Ripple announced their collaboration on X: ‚ÄúRipple‚Äôs partnership with Ondo Finance to offer tokenized U.S. Treasuries on XRPL highlights blockchain‚Äôs role in bridging traditional finance with new technologies.‚Äù Infager says the initiative enhances liquidity and transaction speed In their press release, Ondo also claimed that the rollout puts OUSG on XRPL, giving institutional users access to a compliant, composable asset designed for finance. According to the company, the initiative creates new opportunities for institutional DeFi and better cash management, thus strengthening the bridge between TradFi and blockchain. Additionally, Ian De Bode, Chief Strategy Officer at Ondo Finance, commented on the initiative: ‚ÄúBringing OUSG to XRPL with RLUSD as a settlement option broadens access to high-quality, onchain financial instruments. This integration strengthens our commitment to providing reliable and institutional-grade assets at the intersection of traditional finance and DeFi.‚Äù Senior Vice President at RippleX, Markus Infanger, also explained that OUSG‚Äôs launch on XRPL demonstrates the growing maturity of tokenized finance and offers institutions a compliant way to hold Treasuries on-chain, improving liquidity and speed. So far, with over $1.3B in total value locked, Ondo Finance continues to set the pace in RWA tokenization. OUSG has even surpassed $690M in TVL , making it one of the biggest tokenized Treasury products on the market, ranking alongside similar products from BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Ripple hopes to make XRPL the main settlement network for tokenized assets Ripple wants XRPL to become the go-to settlement network for tokenized products. Its upgrades to liquidity, stablecoin systems, and programmability are meant to enhance institutional confidence and streamline asset management. Bringing tokenized U.S. Treasuries to XRPL showcases the firm‚Äôs commitment to its long-term strategy. Merging TradFi with blockchain also creates a secure, institution-ready ecosystem and positions XRPL as a cornerstone for institutional DeFi. With Ondo, Ripple is working to turn XRPL into a true powerhouse for real-world asset tokenization, giving institutions faster, safer transactions and smarter liquidity tools. This execution level reflects what Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov noted earlier this year, Ondo operates at a standard on par with the world‚Äôs top financial firms. Not to mention Ondo Finance is still offering over 100 U.S. stocks and ETFs with 24/7 onchain access on its Global Markets Platform. CEO Nathan Allman has consistently described Ondo Global Markets as a ‚Äúbreakthrough in financial access,‚Äù calling on investors to engage with the available stocks. As recently reported by Cryptopolitan , Ondo also intends to extend its tokenization efforts to additional blockchains such as BNB Chain, Solana, and Ondo Chain. Major crypto wallets, including OKX Wallet, Trust Wallet, MEXC, Bitget Wallet, Morpho, and Ledger support the initiative. In addition, the firm plans to bring more than 1,000 U.S.-listed securities on-chain, ranging from individual equities to fixed-income ETFs. According to Ondo, these tokenized assets will mirror the liquidity of their underlying securities, enabling instant, low-slippage trading. The firm is also partnering with the startup Block Street to enhance its offerings for tokenized real-world assets, bringing borrowing, shorting, and hedging at scale to DeFi.

Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the price of POL to surge toward $1.57. By 2031, we expect the POL price to record a maximum price of $13.01. Polygon, an Ethereum side chain and layer two scaling solution, has experienced substantial uptake by enterprises and industries in the last year. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, POL. This raises the question: Can POL‚Äôs price reach $10? This forecast for Polygon‚Äôs price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the POL price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polygon Ticker Symbol POL Rank 43 Current Price $0.224 Price change 24H -0.4% Market cap $2.15 Billion Circulating supply 10.44 Billion POL Trading volume 24h $101.67 Million (+9.5%) All-time high $1.29, March 14, 2024 All-time low $0.1533, April 7, 2025 POL price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.224 Price Prediction $‚ÄØ0.291471 (+6.49%) Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 6.22% Green Days 18/30 (60%) 50-Day SMA $‚ÄØ0.237588 200-Day SMA $‚ÄØ0.227463 14-Day RSI 63.64 Polygon technical analysis: POL price faces bearish pressure toward $0.224 POL price analysis shows a bearish pressure toward $0.224 Resistance for POL is present at $0.2299 Support for POL/USD is present at $0.2094 The POL price analysis for 28 September confirms that POL faces increasing volatility as it declines toward $0.224. Currently, the bulls are aiming for a recovery. POL price analysis 1-day chart: Polygon faces selling pressure toward $0.224 POL price is facing a decline as sellers push the price toward $0.224. POL price is aiming for a hold below the immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume declined toward $5.4 million, showing decreased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.224, declining over 0.4% in the last 24 hours. POLUSDT chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level but currently hovers around 35, showing that bears are aiming to control price momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. POL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA trend lines The 4-hour POL price chart suggests POL continues to experience bullish activity around EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart. As the price continues to face resistance near the Fib level, bears prepare for a domination by holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. POLUSDT chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.56, hinting that buyers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost an upward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening bullish positions.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the POL price from an immediate surge. However, if POL‚Äôs price successfully breaks above $0.2299, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.2535. POLUSDT chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, POL‚Äôs price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2094, resulting in a correction to $0.1904. Is POL a good investment? POL token can be a good investment option in the long run as the project develops a roadmap for its Polygon 2.0 version. Polygon collaborates with diverse industries to enhance adoption, focusing on NFT solutions and Ethereum scalability. Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is the POL price down today? Following overall buying demand in the market, POL price faced increased bullish pressure around the $0.25 level. However, lack of buying demand around higher levels resulted in a bearish pressure. What is the POL price prediction for 2025? The Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the POL price to record a maximum level of $1.57. Will POL price touch $1? Yes, POL price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2025. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will POL Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and POL gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is POL a good long-term investment? As Polygon continues to expand its offerings, it gains a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, POL can be a good long-term investment option. Recent news/ Opinions on POL The U.S. Department of Commerce published revised July 2025 GDP data, showing 3.3% annual growth, directly onto the Polygon PoS blockchain alongside eight other networks. This marks the first time federal economic statistics have been secured on-chain, highlighting Polygon‚Äôs role in the government‚Äôs landmark blockchain transparency initiative. POL price prediction September 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in September month. We expect POL to record a minimum price of $0.22 and a maximum price of $0.35, with an average of $0.27 in September. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction September 2025 $0.22 $0.27 $0.35 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That‚Äôs why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon‚Äôs Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.15. It‚Äôs anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

XRP Army Responds,https://timestabloid.com/top-trader-xrp-will-never-trade-below-2-5-again-xrp-army-responds/,"XRP has long been one of the most closely watched digital assets due to its unique position as a cryptocurrency focused on payment. Recent optimism in the market has led to renewed speculation about whether the token can sustain higher price levels as new developments shape its outlook. Crypto expert and enthusiast Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) recently responded to a bullish claim that Bitcoin would never trade below $100,000 again with a price statement of his own, writing, ‚ÄúXRP will never trade below $2.50 again.‚Äù The post quickly garnered engagement as users debated whether such a threshold was realistic given XRP‚Äôs historical price swings. XRP will never trade below $2.50 again. https://t.co/2g6DoD9lFd ‚Äî Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) September 26, 2025 XRP Army Debates Price Floor Many community members voiced their thoughts on Cobb‚Äôs $2.5 XRP price floor. Many commenters agreed with the assertion, as one user welcomed the possibility of such a floor, saying he expects it to happen. Some expressed skepticism, predicting that the price might fall to $2 instead. Some commenters took a cautious stance, with one expressing curiosity to see how market makers and large banks might react, and another remarking that $2.4 seemed like a more plausible floor. XRP‚Äôs price has struggled recently, going as low as $2.71 in early September . Despite this, many commenters still shared bullish expectations, as one user stated that the asset will only continue to rise. Reasons for Optimism Surrounding XRP XRP‚Äôs history has been marked by significant challenges that have limited its price potential in past years. The legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was a primary factor suppressing the asset‚Äôs price and investor confidence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For years, the legal battle dispute defined XRP‚Äôs market trajectory. Investors hesitated to commit to long-term positions due to regulatory concerns. The lack of clarity on its legal status prevented it from fully benefiting from the institutional interest that other major cryptocurrencies experienced during the same period. However, now that the lawsuit is over , institutions have increased their engagement with the asset, and the shift has renewed optimism among supporters. Market watchers now point to the prospect of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a sign of the asset‚Äôs maturing market presence. Such products could make it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly holding the cryptocurrency, and increase its prominence. XRP is currently trading at $2.78, and Cobb‚Äôs prediction reflects the optimism among many community members who believe the token‚Äôs days of trading below $2.50 are behind it.

If regulation shifts even a few degrees, the ripple effects could send some coins flying and others crashing. Here are 5 picks that stand out as promising in this volatile, policy-fueled moment. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) ‚Äì The Top Coin for Explosive Growth At the front of the pack is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a fresh meme coin that has quickly captured market attention. Unlike other chains, it is designed in a way that prevents sniper bots from working, giving early buyers a genuine advantage. This distinctive feature makes Little Pepe (LILPEPE) unique among the growing meme token market. Its presale has been a huge success, now in the thirteenth stage with tokens priced at $0.0022. The twelfth stage sold out earlier than planned, showing how demand is far outpacing expectations. Over $25.97 million has already been raised, and momentum is building daily. Experts who have guided some of the biggest meme projects in history are backing Little Pepe (LILPEPE), and its CoinMarketCap listing has only accelerated visibility. Analysts forecast that it could soar once new regulations are confirmed, especially as Trump's UK visit highlights the importance of transparency and innovation in crypto markets. Buying at presale prices gives investors the chance to get in early before potential listings on major exchanges send prices higher. To add to the excitement, the LILPEPE team has launched a mega giveaway for buyers between stages 12 and 17. The top buyer will win 5 ETH, the second 3 ETH, the third 2 ETH, and 15 random buyers will receive 0.5 ETH each. Its roadmap shows bold plans ahead, setting it up as one of the standout coins to buy during this period of regulatory focus. Ripple (XRP) ‚Äì Riding Institutional Momentum Ripple (XRP) is another strong contender, at $3.09 after surging more than 300% year-to-date. Regulatory clarity in the US and UK could directly benefit XRP thanks to its established role in cross-border payments. Market optimism surged again this week as Trump‚Äôs meetings sparked ETF speculation and boosted institutional inflows. With a 4.15% daily climb earlier this week, XRP shows how regulatory signals can move prices quickly. Solana (SOL) ‚Äì Strong Utility and Strategic Recognition Solana (SOL) is at about $247; it has jumped nearly 5% in the past 24 hours and over 10% in the past week, supported by almost $10 billion in trading volume. Its recognition by the US earlier this year as part of a ‚Äústrategic crypto reserve‚Äù positions SOL for potential policy advantages. As Trump‚Äôs discussions in the UK cover interoperability, Solana‚Äôs speed and scalability put it in a prime spot to benefit. Cardano (ADA) ‚Äì A Technical and Institutional Favorite Cardano (ADA) has been showing steady technical strength, currently trading near $0.93. It surged almost 7% in the last 24 hours, with volume surpassing $2.3 billion. Regulatory conversations have highlighted interoperability, and ADA‚Äôs inclusion in Grayscale‚Äôs Digital Large Cap Fund has opened more institutional doors. Its growing futures market interest shows traders are preparing for bigger moves ahead, making ADA a coin to watch as Trump‚Äôs visit brings rules back into the spotlight. TRON (TRX) ‚Äì Consistent Growth and High Liquidity TRON (TRX) remains a steady performer, with its price hovering around $0.3464 and daily trading volume close to $892 million. Recent adoption by the U.S. Department of Commerce and Justin Sun‚Äôs $200 million WLFI infusion in September have driven a 16% monthly surge. Combined with Trump‚Äôs advocacy for cross-border crypto cooperation, TRX is well-positioned to continue building momentum. Conclusion Trump‚Äôs UK visit is a catalyst for new conversations that could reshape global crypto regulations. While established coins like XRP, SOL, ADA, and TRX are positioned to benefit from regulatory clarity, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the standout star. Its presale strength, unique bot-resistant design, strong expert backing, and mega giveaway make it the most promising token right now.

These events bring critical discussions that could lead to regulatory adjustments, affecting cryptocurrencies differently. Stablecoin regulations might see new caps, prompting shifts in investment strategies, particularly for new and emerging coins. The Emerging Star: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) One coin that has been making waves is Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a new entrant in the meme coin space that has shown resilience against automated trading bots. This unique attribute has helped it in its presale success, already advancing to its thirteenth stage and raising significant funds. With each stage, like the recent twelfth, selling out swiftly, the market's enthusiasm is palpable. Industry experts back LILPEPE, predicting a price surge post-regulation. The presale offers a competitive edge, with lower entry prices before it hits major exchanges. Notably, a mega giveaway is attracting more attention, with prizes including Ethereum rewards for top buyers.

Solana (SOL) continues to draw attention with its significant trading volume and accolades such as being recognized by the US as part of a strategic crypto reserve. This could bolster its position with potential new policies. Cardano (ADA) has been a favorite due to its technical robustness and institutional interest, trading around $0.93 and expecting further movements driven by regulatory discussions. TRON (TRX) stays robust in the market, with a consistent price and high liquidity, further supported by recent large investments and endorsements. Conclusion The outcome of Trump's UK visit could be pivotal for the crypto market, particularly for the coins discussed. While established coins might benefit from clearer regulations, emerging tokens like Little Pepe (LILPEPE) present exciting opportunities for early investors.

President Peter Pellegrini gave the message during talks with the U.S. president in New York on September 23. Trump has been pressing the two remaining European Union holdouts, Hungary and Slovakia, to end imports of Russian crude. He argues this would cut Moscow‚Äôs war money and push Vladimir Putin to the table. Slovakia, a landlocked Eastern European country bordering Ukraine, resisted and cited limits on new routes and technical hurdles. Pellegrini said in a statement sent by his office on Saturday that Slovakia cannot replace Russian energy overnight. ‚ÄúIf change is to come in the coming years, it‚Äôs called diversification,‚Äù he told Trump during the meeting. He added, ‚ÄúSlovakia needs three, four, five different sources of gas and energy. We cannot replace dependence on Russia with dependence on the United States.‚Äù According to the same statement, Slovakia needs technical and logistical help before any major shift. Pellegrini described the meeting as constructive and said Trump ‚Äúhad a smile on his face, but he told me directly: do something about it.‚Äù Trump presses EU holdouts to end Russian oil imports While Pellegrini was delivering his position, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban also pushed back on Trump this week. Orban said giving up Russian oil and gas would ruin Hungary‚Äôs economy. Trump has not only pressed Hungary and Slovakia but also Turkey and India to stop buying oil from Russia. According to EU estimates in May, purchases from Russia now make up only 3% of EU crude oil imports compared with 27% before Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. Trump wants those last flows cut. The European Union is considering new trade measures aimed at the remaining Russian oil imports, Bloomberg reported on September 20. Bloomberg said the bloc‚Äôs executive arm is reviewing continued imports via the Druzhba pipeline, which feeds Hungary and Slovakia. If adopted, the measures would mostly hit those supplies unless they are phased out. Budapest and Bratislava have blocked earlier attempts, saying the moves threaten their energy security. EU weighs trade measures and new sanctions package The trade measures under review are separate from a new sanctions package the EU presented on Friday. That package includes a ban on Russian liquefied gas, starting with short-term contracts six months after entry into force and then extending to long-term deals from January 1, 2027. As part of the same plan, the EU proposed sanctions on more than 100 oil tankers in Moscow‚Äôs ‚Äúshadow fleet‚Äù and other actions targeting entities that enable the energy trade, including in third countries. EU ambassadors were briefed on the proposals on Friday, but no details on timing or scope were given. Unlike sanctions, which need unanimous backing of member states, trade measures like tariffs require only a majority of capitals. These measures would help the EU meet a key demand made by Trump as a condition for U.S. alignment on Russia sanctions. Trump has said the EU should stop all Russian oil and gas purchases. Nearly all member states have halted pipeline and seaborne imports, but Hungary and Slovakia are still taking supplies. Most other EU nations have committed to phase out Russian fossil fuels by the end of 2027. Trade measures could be used if Budapest and Bratislava do not present exit plans, people familiar with the matter said. The U.S. has also pressured its Group of Seven allies to impose tariffs as high as 100% on China and India for their Russian oil purchases to push Putin into talks with Ukraine. That request is expected to face resistance in EU capitals. G‚Äë7 officials are working on a new sanctions package and want to finalize the text later this month, Bloomberg has reported. Other planned EU measures would target major Russian oil firms and the networks and ships that move crude and generate profit for Moscow.

While big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to anchor portfolios, several other projects are positioning themselves as the proper growth plays. Among them is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , the so-called Shiba Inu killer, alongside strong contenders like Solana (SOL), Near Protocol (NEAR), Story (IP), and Fasttoken (FTN). Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Shiba Inu Killer With 100x Meme Potential Among the fresh entrants, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is stealing the spotlight as the popularly-proclaimed ‚ÄúShiba Inu Killer.‚Äù Unlike SHIB, which relies heavily on community buzz, Little Pepe is built on its own EVM-compatible Layer 2 blockchain. This means ultra-low fees, lightning-fast settlement, and built-in resistance to sniper bots, giving it both meme power and serious utility. Moreover, Little Pepe introduced the zero buy/sell taxes model, a launch hub called Pepe‚Äôs Pump Pad, ensuring a cheap and scalable hub for upcoming meme projects. This also makes it a sustainable project, unlike hype-only meme coins. The presale has already raised over $26 million, and with Stage 13 live at just $0.0022 per token, the math is staggering. Analysts project that an $870 allocation today could become $87,000+ if Little Pepe climbs to $0.22 in the supercycle. Add the Certik audit, strict vesting schedule, massive giveaway and community incentives, and confirmed exchange listings, and Little Pepe looks primed to lead the 2025‚Äì26 meme coin wave. Solana (SOL): ETF Momentum and Institutional Accumulation Solana continues to prove itself as one of the most scalable and reliable blockchain platforms in the cryptocurrency space. Despite heavy profit-taking near $250, SOL‚Äôs corporate treasury adoption (15M tokens held) and looming ETF approval have positioned it for another leg up. Solana Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Its blooming meme coin market further adds to its appeal. Projects like PUMP, USELESS, and Fartcoin have dominated recent market gains. Analysts project a potential rally toward $500 if the $260 resistance level is broken. Near Protocol (NEAR): AI Economy Trailblazer With AI taking over narratives across industries, Near Protocol (NEAR) is carving out a niche as the ‚Äúblockchain of AI.‚Äù Its Shade Agents allow autonomous bots to interact with blockchains securely, a use case traditional finance simply can‚Äôt accommodate. Near Protocol Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Currently trading above $3.10, NEAR‚Äôs bullish setup is supported by a sustained MACD buy signal and a potential Golden Cross on its moving averages. With AI adoption expanding rapidly, NEAR could easily test $3.80‚Äì$4.00 in the short term, with long-term upside far greater. Story (IP): Tokenizing the $70 Trillion Intellectual Property Market Story (IP) targets one of the largest markets: intellectual property. The project envisions tokenizing rights, royalties, and licensing on-chain, giving creators direct monetization channels. Story Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Recent momentum has come from an $82 million buyback program and the first public company adoption of IP tokens for treasury reserves. The token recently reached $11.66, with analysts targeting $20 by year-end, despite ongoing community debate over founder exits and revenue sustainability. If Story can prove utility beyond speculation, its upside could be enormous. Fasttoken (FTN): Real-World Payments and Utility Growth Fasttoken (FTN) powers Bahamut, an EVM-compatible chain with a unique Proof of Stake and Activity (PoSA) model. This incentivizes developers to stake and deploy contracts that see real-world usage, aligning rewards with actual adoption. Fasttoken Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Trading at $4.49 with a $1.94 billion market cap, FTN recently partnered with AEON , unlocking merchant access across 20 million locations worldwide. Combined with staking programs, NFT marketplaces, and seamless payment tools, Fasttoken is quietly building one of the most integrated ecosystems in the cryptocurrency space. Positioning into the Next Market Movers Just Bitcoin and Ethereum won‚Äôt lead the next bull run. Little Pepe , Solana, Near Protocol, Story, and Fasttoken each bring a unique narrative, from meme dominance to AI, IP, and real-world adoption. However, Little Pepe is the most explosive high-risk, high-reward play. If the meme currency supercycle happens, presale momentum, Layer 2 scalability, and meme culture might catapult small wagers into life-changing gains.

In particular, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , dubbed the 'Shiba Inu Killer', is making headlines for its distinctive features and substantial growth prospects. The Emergence of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Little Pepe stands out with its proprietary Layer 2 blockchain, promising ultra-low fees and rapid transactions. This platform is not only resistant to common exploits but also boasts no buy/sell taxes, a strategic move to attract long-term investors. The ongoing presale has already secured over $26 million, suggesting a robust market confidence. Notably, investing $870 now could potentially yield over $87,000 if Little Pepe achieves its target price of $0.22 per token. Solana (SOL): A Beacon for ETFs and Institutional Investors Solana's ecosystem continues to expand, backed by technological robustness and increasing corporate interest. A significant adoption of Solana's tokens by corporate treasuries and the anticipation of an ETF approval suggest strong future potential. Current price dynamics and market adoption could see Solana breaking past the critical $260 mark, aiming for a $500 valuation. Near Protocol (NEAR): Pioneering the AI Blockchain Interface Near Protocol has smartly positioned itself at the intersection of blockchain technology and the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. Its unique offering includes Shade Agents, which facilitate secure interactions between AI and blockchain networks. Story (IP): Revolutionizing Intellectual Property Management Story aims to disrupt the traditional IP market by enabling on-chain management of rights and royalties. Recent initiatives, including a substantial buyback program, underscore its potential to reimagine IP management. Fasttoken (FTN): Enabling Real-World Blockchain Applications Fasttoken is enhancing its appeal by focusing on real-world applications. A partnership with AEON, which opens up transactions across millions of locations, together with its innovative PoSA model, places it in a prime position for growth.

52376112,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84524,1759046408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"If You Invested $1000 in BONK in 2023, Here is How Much You Would Have Gained",https://timestabloid.com/if-you-invested-1000-in-bonk-in-2023-here-is-how-much-you-would/,"BONK has once again become the focus of conversation across crypto communities. The Solana-based meme coin, once dismissed as a short-lived novelty, has transformed into one of the most remarkable comeback stories in recent cycles. On September 30, 2023 , BONK traded at just $0.000000197 . Fast forward to September 26, 2025 , and the price reached $0.00001905 . That move represents an increase of nearly 96√ó in under two years, a return so outsized that it instantly reignited debate about meme coins and their ability to rival infrastructure projects in wealth creation. To put it into perspective: a simple $1000 allocation at the end of September 2023 would today be valued at around $96,700 . For everyday retail investors, that kind of transformation is almost impossible to imagine, yet BONK proved it could happen. Its rise is more than a price chart; it is a lesson in culture, conviction, and timing. Meme coins succeed not because of whitepapers or tech superiority, but because they capture imagination and loyalty. As retail now looks ahead to the next BONK-style breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE has begun to emerge as a contender worth watching. BONK as the Meme Coin Blueprint The foundation of BONK‚Äôs success lies in its cultural resonance. It launched at a time when markets were fatigued from endless infrastructure talk, and retail investors wanted energy, fun, and a sense of rebellion. BONK‚Äôs playful branding filled that void. Within weeks, it wasn‚Äôt just a token, it was a community symbol. Social feeds, NFT spaces, and Telegram groups erupted with BONK memes, giving it momentum beyond speculation. That cultural stickiness meant BONK lasted longer than a typical pump-and-dump. It embedded itself in Solana‚Äôs ecosystem, ensuring liquidity and attention. BONK taught the market that meme culture could become just as powerful a driver of adoption as technology. The Math Behind the $1,000 Bet Numbers rarely lie. Buying BONK at $0.000000197 with $1000 on September 30, 2023, would have secured over 5.07 billion tokens . Holding until September 26, 2025, at $0.00001905, those tokens would now be worth roughly $96,700 . That‚Äôs nearly a 100√ó return achieved not by fundamentals, but by narrative, community, and viral energy. This kind of outcome highlights why meme coins continue to attract retail. The asymmetry is striking: you risk small amounts, but the upside, if successful, is transformative. Few other sectors of crypto offer this level of potential payoff, which is why BONK has become a reference point whenever investors talk about ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next.‚Äù The BONK phenomenon showed how even tiny allocations could balloon into life-changing gains in just months. Analysts now use that example to highlight the role of presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. While BONK rode viral momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE adds structured scarcity and narrative depth, giving it a different foundation. Return models suggest 1,500%‚Äì2,200% ROI potential if listings mirror its presale trajectory. The PATRIOT50X bonus code has boosted participation, ensuring early entrants maximize position value. For those who watched BONK‚Äôs meteoric rise but missed it, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being touted as a second chance to capture outsized upside. The key difference is that while BONK relied on spontaneity, MAGACOIN FINANCE is blending hype with deliberate mechanics, setting the stage for what could be a more sustainable breakout. Retail Psychology and the Hunt for Multiples The BONK story reminds us that numbers alone aren‚Äôt enough. Retail psychology plays an equal role. Communities flock to tokens that feel accessible, relatable, and fun. BONK succeeded because it built identity, not just market cap. MAGACOIN FINANCE taps into that same psychology, positioning itself as a cultural movement that investors can rally around. Retail wants to feel part of something early. When meme coins generate buzz, it‚Äôs less about technical charts and more about belonging. That belonging, paired with scarcity, creates loops of attention and capital. MAGACOIN‚Äôs design ensures those loops remain strong, reinforcing the retail psychology that drove BONK‚Äôs 96√ó rise. BONK‚Äôs Legacy and MAGACOIN‚Äôs Future The legacy of BONK is already set: it turned a $1,000 investment into nearly $100,000 in under two years. That will be studied as one of the defining examples of meme-coin wealth creation. The question for retail now is not whether BONK was real, it‚Äôs whether something similar can happen again. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be one of the most likely candidates to carry that mantle. Audited, scarcity-driven, and powered by a viral grassroots community, it offers retail a shot at capturing the next meme-cycle wave. If BONK symbolized the unpredictability of 2023, MAGACOIN could define the opportunity of 2025. Conclusion If you invested $1000 in BONK back in September 2023, you would now be looking at around $96,700 . That remarkable gain proves meme culture can generate returns rivaling or even surpassing traditional crypto infrastructure plays. It also shows how critical timing and conviction are when navigating speculative markets. For investors today, the spotlight is shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE . With dual audits, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and a community expanding rapidly, it mirrors the traits that made BONK legendary. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate institutional conversations, MAGACOIN speaks directly to retail‚Äôs desire for asymmetric bets. If BONK defined yesterday‚Äôs surprise, MAGACOIN may well define tomorrow‚Äôs.

52376113,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84664,1759046415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Crypto News: Pepe Coin, Shiba Inu & Remittix Tipped As The Best Crypto To Buy Now For The Highest ROI",https://timestabloid.com/crypto-news-pepe-coin-shiba-inu-remittix-tipped-as-the-best/,"The meme coin market is once again heating up. Pepe is holding its ground and looking for new community activity, while Shiba Inu is regaining momentum with major ecosystem updates. At the same time, a new project called Remittix is drawing attention as a potential bridge between crypto and real-world payments. Many analysts are comparing Pepe‚Äôs current position to the early growth phases of XRP, Shiba Inu and many of today‚Äôs successful Ethereum‚Äôs layer-2 launches. Let us see the latest news surrounding these 3 top altcoins today. Pepecoin Under Pressure To Perform As Q4 2025 Nears Pepe (PEPE) is under pressure this week, slipping about 5-6 % as broader market weakness spills into meme token territory. According to CoinDesk, PEPE dropped to $0.0000107 in a 24-hour pullback with its price still currently languishing at $0.0000093. On the 7-day view, it‚Äôs underperforming the overall crypto market, and trading volume is down sharply, signaling fading enthusiasm from casual traders. On-chain data shows a million-level whale sale of 500 billion PEPE ($4.8 million) recently, testing its support near $0.00001. Analyst Ali Martinez sees a large triangle pattern forming, estimating a possible 78 % swing if volatility breaks at the right moment. Many now see PEPE more as a momentum play than a long-term altcoin base. In short, while it could catch a sharp rebound if whales reenter, PEPE‚Äôs risk remains elevated; it might be one of the wildest ‚Äúbest altcoins to buy‚Äù picks, but only for investors willing to bet on hype and momentum over fundamentals. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Return: Glory Or Bust? Shiba Inu has staged a comeback thanks to a roadmap update featuring a new staking protocol and a game-focused launch. The price of SHIB rose over the past month supported by wallet addresses shifting to alternative Ethereum networks with cheaper gas fees, but this growth was swiftly cut short by BTC going under $110,000. With its Shibarium upgrade designed to cut transaction costs, making it attractive to developers and retail users alike, analysts project SHIB could reach $0.00005 by the end of the year if adoption continues. Remittix: A New Kind of Payment Token Proving To Be The Best Crypto To Buy Now While Pepe and Shiba Inu thrive on community hype, Remittix is making headlines for practical use cases. Unlike many speculative projects, Remittix (RTX) is built for payments, offering cross-chain services that connect crypto with traditional finance. Its Web3 wallet, set to launch in the third quarter, will include direct bank integration across more than 30 countries. The Defi project has already undergone a full audit by CertiK, where it ranked first among pre-launch tokens. This boosted investor confidence and helped the presale raise more than $26.7 million in mere weeks. With over 40,000 holders and strong community activity, whales are already positioning ahead of listings on BitMart and LBank. Why Remittix Stands Out Global reach with transfers to bank accounts in 30+ countries Fully audited and ranked number one by CertiK Mobile-first wallet with real-time FX conversion coming Q3 Over $26.7 million raised in one of the fastest presales of 2025 Built for seamless transfers across Ethereum and Solana The Road Ahead Remittix is also running a $250,000 giveaway and referral program, rewarding users with instant USDT payouts. With beta testing live and major exchange listings confirmed, RTX is shaping up to be one of the fastest-growing projects of 2025. For investors, it offers both real-world utility and early-stage growth potential and it‚Äôs why analysts think you shouldn‚Äôt miss out.

52378737,591132,1759046458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52378737.jpeg,Indian Stock Exchange Rejects Crypto Treasury Company Listing ‚Äì Details,https://bitcoinist.com/indian-exchange-rejects-crypto-treasury-listing/,"The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in India has reportedly rejected the public listing of Jetking Infotrain, an IT training company, on the grounds of intended capital use for crypto investment. This decision comes amid a flurry of digital asset treasury companies worldwide. Related Reading: Celebrity Downfall: South Korean Actress Sentenced For $3-M Crypto Scam Crypto Investments Not Suitable For Publicly Raised Capital: BSE In a report by local Indian media, Economic Times, the BSE barred Jetking Infotrain from publicly listing its shares, citing the exchange‚Äôs investment policy around cryptocurrency. On May 9, 2025, Jetking received an in-principle approval from the BSE to raise funds via a share issue. 14 days later, the company‚Äôs board approved the issuance of 396,000+ shares, raising over ‚Çπ6 crore, i.e $720,000. In its application with the BSE, Jetking stated the new capital would be targeted towards general corporate uses, education and skill development, and investments in virtual digital assets (VDAs). However, a significant ‚Çπ3.96 crore ($475,000), i.e, 60% of the raised funds, was targeted at crypto investments. It is worth noting that Jeking currently has some digital assets on its balance sheets, as Indian companies are allowed to invest in cryptocurrencies similar to mutual funds, securities, etc. However, the BSE has strongly opted against raising public capital for this purpose, as indicated by its rejection of Jetking‚Äôs listing. A statement from a BSE spokesperson read: We had processed the application in the normal course as per extant norms. Final approval was kept on hold to take up the issue of fund raise for investment in VDA at the policy level with the Regulator. Subsequently, as per the revised norms, a decision was taken to reject the application. The BSE is considered the oldest Asian exchange and the second largest in India by trading volume after the National Stock Exchange of India. Notably, the recent BSE‚Äôs decision in rejecting Jetking‚Äôs public listing is likely to threaten the rise of crypto treasury companies in India. By virtue of their operations, crypto treasury firms such as Strategy in the US, Next Technology Holding in China, leverage their status as publicly listed companies to access capital markets, raising funds through equity or debt offerings that are subsequently deployed into digital assets.

Following this development, Jetking Co-Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer Siddharth Bharwani has stated the company is considering all appropriate responses to the BSE‚Äôs decision, including a potential appeal at the Securities Appellate Tribunal. Notably, cryptocurrencies are not illegal investments in India but are considered intangible assets in that they are not securities or legal tender.

52379837,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/4-coins-that-could-turn-500-into-50000-like-solana-and-dogecoin-did-for-early-buyers,1759046499,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/52379837.jpeg,"4 Coins That Could Turn $500 Into $50,000 Like Solana and Dogecoin Did for Early Buyers",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/4-coins-that-could-turn-500-into-50000-like-solana-and-dogecoin-did-for-early-buyers,"Every bull market has its breakout stories. Solana (SOL) went from a little project to worth more than $200, making a lot of money for people who bought it for just $1. A few years ago, Dogecoin (DOGE), which was founded as a joke, went from being worth less than a penny to more than $0.70, making a lot of money. These instances show that with crypto, even modest amounts of money may turn into life-changing amounts of money if you invest in the proper assets. As the bull run intensifies, traders are searching for the next set of tokens that can follow in Solana and Dogecoin footsteps. Among the most promising are Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Sui (SUI), Sei (SEI), and Ripple (XRP). Each has unique fundamentals and momentum that make them strong candidates for explosive gains in this cycle. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Gains Strength as Ethereum‚Äôs Meme Infrastructure Token The most discussed meme coin of 2025 is Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Unlike DOGE or SHIB, which relied purely on community hype, LILPEPE is building real infrastructure. The project is developing an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain tailored to meme coins, designed to be fast, cheap, and sniper-bot resistant. This move positions LILPEPE as more than a meme; it‚Äôs a platform for future meme projects to launch fairly. The presale numbers highlight its momentum. Now in Stage 13 for $0.0022 per token, LILPEPE has raised over $26 million and sold over 16 billion tokens. CertiK has audited it and is already listed on CoinMarketCap, adding trust and visibility rarely seen in a presale project. Thanks to viral campaigns, community growth is also surging, including a $777,000 giveaway where ten winners will each take home $77,000, and a special promotion for buyers between Stage 12 and Stage 17. Analysts predict LILPEPE could hit $0.10 shortly after listings, a 45x gain from presale, with long term forecasts stretching between $1 and $3 by 2026. For investors chasing Dogecoin-like returns, LILPEPE is the standout contender. Sui (SUI) Shows Solana-Like Momentum Sui (SUI) has emerged as one of the strongest Layer-1 competitors, frequently compared to Solana for its parallel transaction execution and scalability. With a current price near $3.90 and a market cap of around $13.4 billion, SUI is still undervalued relative to Solana, which commands more than $90 billion. Analysts believe that as more developers deploy DeFi, gaming, and NFT applications on the Sui network, its value could climb toward $50 by 2026, representing an impressive 10x upside. With Ethereum facing scalability challenges and Solana‚Äôs ecosystem maturing, Sui is carving out a clear role as the next big Layer-1 growth story. Sei (SEI): The Fastest Blockchain with Explosive Potential Sei (SEI), trading at $0.33 with a market capitalization of $1.9 billion, is a Layer 1 blockchain optimized for trading and financial transactions. Its 17% recovery from a recent dip and a bullish RSI signal suggest a breakout. Experts predict a 1,664% surge to $3 by September, driven by the adoption of decentralized finance and trading platforms. SEI‚Äôs speed and developer activity make it a favorite among investors seeking high-upside altcoins this summer. Ripple (XRP) Poised for Renewed Momentum Post-Regulation Finally, Ripple (XRP) remains one of the most important large-cap tokens, especially now that its long battle with the SEC has been resolved. With legal clarity restored, XRP is again relisted on U.S. exchanges, and institutional adoption of RippleNet is back in focus. Priced near $3 with a market cap above $170 billion, XRP may not offer meme-like multiples, but it does carry the stability of a blue-chip crypto. Analysts expect XRP to climb to $8 this cycle, delivering over 10x growth from its lows. For low risks investors seeking exposure to both utility and speculative upside, XRP remains a reliable addition. Conclusion The 2025 bull run will deliver another round of unforgettable success stories. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) leads the charge with its explosive presale, viral community, and bold plan to create a dedicated meme coin Layer-2. Sui (SUI) is emerging as a next-generation blockchain rival to Solana, while Sei (SEI) defines itself as the trader‚Äôs blockchain. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) continues to prove its staying power as one of the industry‚Äôs most recognized names. For investors with an eye for asymmetric opportunities, these four tokens are among the best positioned to replicate the life-changing gains Solana and Dogecoin delivered for early buyers. Under the right conditions, a small stake of $500 in any of them could grow into $50,000 before this bull run is over.

The spectacular ascents of Solana and Dogecoin are such stories, capturing the imagination of investors seeking the next big opportunity. This article explores four cryptocurrencies that show potential for high returns: Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Sui (SUI), Sei (SEI), and Ripple (XRP). Rising Star: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Among the fresh entrants, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is making waves as a pivotal meme coin within the Ethereum ecosystem. Designed as a Layer-2 solution, LILPEPE aims to provide an optimized platform for future meme-based projects, ensuring speed, cost-efficiency, and resistance to common exploitations like sniper bots. This approach not only adds fundamental value but also sets it apart from predecessors like DOGE, which soared mainly on community hype. Already making significant strides in its presale, which has now reached Stage 13 priced at $0.0022 per token, LILPEPE has amassed over $26 million in funding and sold more than 16 billion tokens. With CertiK's audit and a listing on CoinMarketCap, LILPEPE enjoys a level of credibility rare for new tokens. The current promotional campaigns and community growth efforts, including a notable $777,000 giveaway, forecast a bright future for this token. Sui (SUI): A Contender for Scaling Solutions With its eyes set on becoming a leading Layer-1 blockchain, Sui (SUI) exhibits potential reminiscent of Solana's early days. It stands out for its ability to process transactions in parallel, a feature that greatly enhances scalability‚Äîa crucial attribute as the blockchain space grows. Currently valued near $3.90 with a market cap of approximately $13.4 billion, analysts see Sui reaching up to $50 by 2026, a growth trajectory that could offer substantial returns to early investors. Sei (SEI): Optimized for Speed and Financial Transactions Sei (SEI) is currently trading at $0.33, with a market cap around $1.9 billion. It distinguishes itself by being the fastest blockchain available, specifically tailored for trading and financial applications. A recent recovery of 17% from a market dip and a bullish trend in RSI metrics underscore its potential for a significant price surge, possibly reaching $3 by September. This makes SEI an attractive option for those looking for rapid growth. Ripple's (XRP) Recovery and Institutional Interest As one of the stalwarts in the cryptocurrency world, Ripple (XRP) is poised for a resurgence, especially after settling its long-standing regulatory battles in the U.S. Now trading near $3 with a market cap of over $170 billion, XRP offers investors a blend of stability and growth potential, with projections of reaching up to $8 in the current cycle. Conclusion The 2025 bull market could be a defining moment for these four cryptocurrencies. Investors looking for opportunities similar to those presented by Solana and Dogecoin in their prime might consider staking their bets on these promising assets. Each of these coins holds the potential to transform a modest $500 investment into $50,000 under the right market conditions. As always, thorough research and careful consideration of market trends should guide investment decisions.

His remarks came during an on-stage discussion alongside representatives from BlackRock, showing the interest of traditional financial institutions in crypto-related solutions. A clip of the exchange was posted on X by crypto commentator Subjective Views (@subjectiveviews), allowing a wider audience to hear Gallagher‚Äôs take on what could be a significant transitional movement for the crypto sector. Robinhood's Chief Legal Officer shouting out $XRP while sitting next to BlackRock pic.twitter.com/3cVMx91WB7 ‚Äî Subjective Views (@subjectiveviews) September 26, 2025 The Evolution Toward Unified Asset Platforms Gallagher began by noting the current focus for many investors, particularly in Europe, remains on basic access to U.S. equities, suggesting that immediate concerns remain grounded in availability and reach. Yet he stressed that this stage is only temporary. According to Gallagher, the market is heading toward a state where equities will become fully tokenized and available around the clock across borders, a prediction that highlights the scale of changes he believes are on the horizon. Gallagher argued that a key shift will occur as investors come to expect all their holdings, from traditional securities to cryptocurrencies, to coexist on a single platform. He described a future where assets such as Bitcoin and XRP can be stored, leveraged, and traded in the same place as equities. XRP‚Äôs Role in Accelerating Tokenized Equities While Gallagher mentioned XRP in his comments, the digital asset can serve as more than an example in this proposed system. XRP is often viewed as a strong candidate to support the shift toward tokenized equities due to its speed, cost efficiency, and established presence in real-world tokenization initiatives. Its network is designed to handle high transaction volumes with minimal fees, making it suitable for cross-border equity trades that require quick settlement. XRP already powers several tokenization projects , where its infrastructure has demonstrated reliability in moving value seamlessly between parties. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As traditional and digital assets converge, XRP‚Äôs proven track record in facilitating token transfers positions it as a practical choice for platforms aiming to offer investors fast, efficient, and scalable access to tokenized securities. Bridging Traditional and Digital Assets Gallagher highlighted that enabling EU access to U.S. equities reflects wider challenges in tokenizing global markets. He predicted evolving systems would reduce barriers across regions and assets. Bridging gaps between traditional equities and crypto tokens requires collaboration among regulators, technology providers, institutions, and XRP‚Äôs speed and efficiency could help drive this shift, supporting seamless real-world asset tokenization .

According to CoinGlass, over $850 million in leveraged positions were liquidated in 24 hours on September 26, showing just how fragile the sentiment is. The sell-off is due to macro headwinds and technical weakness. The Fed‚Äôs hawkish guidance in mid-September spooked investors when inflation numbers came in hotter than expected and the US dollar hit multi-month highs. This combination crushed risk assets including stocks and digital currencies. On September 25, Reuters reported that upbeat U.S. growth data fueled fresh doubts over whether the Fed would deliver swift rate cuts. Global equities logged their steepest decline in more than three weeks, adding another layer of pressure on crypto markets. Market Cap: $2.18 trillion 24h Volume: $24.6 billion BTC Dominance: 50%+ share of total crypto market cap Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Trendlines Define Risk From a charting perspective, Bitcoin price prediction remains under pressure following a breakdown from its rising channel. A descending trendline now caps rallies, with strong resistance near $112,000. Both the 50- and 100-period simple moving averages slope downward, forming a bearish crossover that reinforces selling pressure. Bitcoin Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview Candlestick behavior reflects market indecision. Multiple small-bodied candles clustered near $109,000, which suggests hesitation among market participants. While prior long upper wicks show sellers fading attempts to climb higher. The RSI sits at 36, barely above oversold territory, hinting at possible relief bounces but no sustained bullish reversal yet. Key technical levels remain well-defined: Support: $107,282, $105,201, $102,867 Resistance: $112,357, $113,274, $114,000 Trade Setup and ‚ÄòUptober‚Äô Rally Scenario For short-term traders, the setup leans bearish unless Bitcoin can reclaim $114,000. A rejection near $112,000 could provide a short entry, targeting $107,300 initially and extending toward $105,200 if weakness persists, with stops above $113,500. However, should Bitcoin secure a daily close above $114,000, the bearish structure would be invalidated, paving the way for a potential rally toward $117,997. Historically, October has delivered strong crypto performance, dubbed ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù by traders, which may add psychological support to bullish scenarios. In plain terms, Bitcoin sits at a crossroads. Either the descending trendline holds, sending price toward lower supports, or $109k proves to be the launchpad for an October rebound. With derivative markets reset and macro uncertainty still weighing, the next decisive move could define the quarter for digital assets. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC‚Äôs unmatched security with Solana‚Äôs high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $18.6 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today‚Äôs stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012985‚Äîbut that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

The Chinese electric vehicle maker responded on Weibo, where public relations executive Li Yunfei wrote : ‚ÄúIn August 2022, Berkshire began gradually reducing its holdings of company shares purchased in 2008, and by last June, its stake had fallen below 5% ‚Ä¶ Investing in stocks involves both buying and selling, which is completely normal ‚Ä¶ We are grateful for Charlie Munger‚Äôs and Warren Buffett‚Äôs recognition of BYD, as well as for the investment, support, and companionship over the past 17 years ‚Ä¶ Praise to all long-term believers!‚Äù The statement confirmed what we first reported last week and framed the exit as routine trading rather than a negative judgment. Executive Vice President Stella Li, speaking during an interview on CNBC Europe‚Äôs Access Middle East , echoed that position. She said Warren and Charlie ‚Äúloved BYD and its management, but they are investors, so naturally buying and selling is their business, so it‚Äôs not because they don‚Äôt like us.‚Äù The company avoided defensive language, instead emphasizing that the relationship was rooted in long-term confidence, even if the investment cycle had run its course. BYD stock drops after confirmation and growth outlook weakens Despite the calm front from BYD, investors reacted quickly in Hong Kong. Shares of the automaker slid more than 6% this week after the confirmation of Berkshire‚Äôs full exit. Even with the drop, the stock remains up just under 20% since January, showing the market still values its growth. Special adviser Alfredo Altavilla added context in remarks reported by Reuters, stating that Buffett ‚Äúmade a profit of 20 times the capital he invested. He did very well to do what he did.‚Äù Altavilla also explained that: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been extremely glad to have had Buffett as an investor, but the fact that he monetized his position is exactly what Berkshire Hathaway does for a living: buying, earning and selling.‚Äù The reaction comes at a moment when BYD is already cutting back. The company reduced its 2025 sales target by 16%, announced price reductions through the end of the year, and slowed production lines. Last month, it also reported its first quarterly profit decline in more than three years, pointing to a clear cooling in its rapid expansion. These developments show the company under pressure at the same time Berkshire closed its position, which magnified market concerns even though management brushed it off. Berkshire lifts its Japanese stakes while closing out BYD While one door closed in China, Berkshire opened another in Japan. Mitsui said this week in a statement that it had been informed Berkshire now holds 10% or more of the voting rights in the trading house after further acquisitions. In March, Berkshire disclosed a 9.8% stake, equal to 285,401,400 Mitsui shares, valued at about $7.3 billion at that day‚Äôs close. By late last month, a Mitsui official told Reuters Berkshire had raised its stake again but did not provide a figure. Around the same time, Mitsubishi announced in a regulatory filing that Berkshire‚Äôs stake had increased to 10.2% from 9.7%. Other holdings in Itochu, Marubeni, and Sumitomo were not updated, but analysts note it would not be surprising if those stakes also crossed the 10% mark.

Analysts Eye LINK, XYZ & CRO Amid Altcoin Rotation",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/uptober-or-letdown-analysts-eye-link-xyz-cro-amid-altcoin-rotation,"Market shifts often bring surprises, and digital coins are once again under the spotlight. Investors are now looking closely at LINK, XYZ, and CRO as money moves between different altcoins. As this trend unfolds, experts share new insights and questions. Will these coins surge, or is disappointment ahead? The answers may shape the next few weeks in digital trading. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token‚Äîit‚Äôs a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. What sets $XYZ apart? It‚Äôs not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.0055 Next Stage: $0.0056 Listing Price: $0.1 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10.

So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Chainlink: The Digital Bridge Coin Catching Fresh Interest Blockchains are like islands; they can‚Äôt see the outside world. Chainlink, powered by the LINK coin, builds the bridge. Many small helpers, called nodes, pull prices, weather, sports scores, and more from the web. Each helper has a public score, so only the most trusted get picked. Results from many helpers are blended, then sent to a smart contract in one clear answer. Part of this work happens on-chain for safety, the rest off-chain for speed. LINK pays and rewards everyone who keeps the bridge open. This simple idea unlocks big uses. Loans that update with live rates, games that pay out on real goals, and farms that react to weather all lean on Chainlink. As new chains launch, they often plug into it instead of making their own data bridge, much like websites all rely on the same cloud servers. While coins tied only to hype fade, LINK gains steady demand from fees, staking, and rising data calls. In the current market, investors hunt coins with clear jobs and cash flow; that makes LINK look brighter than many rivals. Cronos Coin: Powering Easy Pay and Big Plans Ahead Cronos (CRO) is the house coin of Crypto.com. It lives on Cronos Chain, an open-source network built for speed and low cost. The coin flows through the Crypto.com Pay app, turning phones into quick cash registers. Each tap sends money in seconds and keeps user data safe. No bank gatekeepers, no long forms. This mix of fast tech and strong privacy has helped CRO build a lively fan base around the world. The team wants more. They aim to let CRO fuel trading, cards, and even new games. Costs stay tiny, so small buys make sense, unlike on crowded chains like Ethereum. Supply limits and steady burns may add extra push over time. Many investors now hunt for coins with real use, not just hype. Mobile pay is booming, and CRO already owns that lane. If the next market wave favors working products and big brands, CRO could shine brighter than many rivals. Conclusion LINK looks good with steady climb; CRO picks up speed; XYZVerse, the first sports memecoin blending fan passion and GameFi, targets outsized gains amid the 2025 bull run.

52377738,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=821626,1759048828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52377738.jpeg,Trump shares AI image of himself firing Fed Chair Powell,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-ai-made-image-of-him-firing-powell/,"President Donald Trump on Saturday posted on Truth Social a cartoon-style image that appeared to show him firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The picture showed Trump pointing his finger and shouting ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE FIRED!‚Äù while Powell stood holding a cardboard box filled with his belongings. The backdrop included the seal of the Federal Reserve. ChatGPT‚Äôs visual analysis described the picture as ‚ÄúAI-generated or digitally illustrated.‚Äù Source: Donald Trump. The post followed months of Trump attacking Powell‚Äôs record. He has repeatedly called the Fed chair ‚ÄúToo Late Powell‚Äù and blamed him for holding back the economy by refusing to slash interest rates quickly. Earlier in September, the central bank cut interest rates for the first time this year, but Trump still argued it was not enough. Powell‚Äôs current term is set to run until May 2026. Trump challenges Fed leadership despite legal rulings The idea of removing a Fed chair is unprecedented. No president has ever tried to dismiss the head of the central bank. A recent Supreme Court decision ruled that the president does not have the authority to remove Federal Reserve officials at will. Powell himself has said many times that his firing is ‚Äúnot permitted under the law.‚Äù The Trump White House has also criticized Powell for the ongoing renovations of the Fed‚Äôs Washington headquarters, fueling speculation that Trump might seek to remove Powell for cause. In recent weeks, Trump has softened his remarks about the building but has continued to argue that Powell is keeping borrowing costs too high. This push comes after Trump moved against other officials. In August, he attempted to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, accusing her of mortgage fraud. That case is now under review at the Supreme Court. On Friday, the Department of Justice filed a brief at the Court saying that removing Lisa for alleged misconduct would not destabilize financial markets. Lisa‚Äôs attorneys countered in their filing that her removal could threaten the independence of the Federal Reserve. So far, financial markets have not reacted strongly to these attempts. Economists and investors, however, warn that if Powell were removed before his term ends, long-term interest rates could rise. They argue that markets might assume the central bank was acting in Trump‚Äôs political interest instead of following its congressional mandate of ensuring stable inflation and low unemployment. Trump policies weigh on dollar and Fed projections Uncertainty around Trump‚Äôs economic policies dominated a conference held last week at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The combination of his tariff agenda and moves to reshape the Fed‚Äôs board brought more attention to the stability of the U.S. dollar as the world‚Äôs main reserve currency. The New York Fed plays a central role in implementing monetary policy set in Washington. It serves over 200 account holders, including foreign central banks. It also operates as custodian of gold reserves for the U.S. government and foreign clients. Deep under the Fed‚Äôs Manhattan headquarters, about 25 meters below street level, sits a vault holding roughly 507,000 gold bars, with a combined weight of 6,331 tonnes as of 2024. The dollar remains critical to global investment decisions. But a string of Trump‚Äôs moves this year have weakened the greenback. The ICE dollar index, which measures the currency against six major peers, has dropped more than 9 percent. Analysts point to the president‚Äôs tariff measures and his attempts to influence the Fed‚Äôs leadership. These actions include placing Stephen Miran, a close economic ally, on the Fed board and attempting to remove another governor over fraud claims. Even with these steps, the Fed has not met Trump‚Äôs demand for aggressive rate cuts. The Fed‚Äôs most recent projections showed another 50 basis points in cuts expected by the end of 2025, following a 25 basis point reduction earlier this month. That would place the effective federal funds rate at about 3.6 percent. Trump has been pushing for a 3 percent reduction. Among Fed leaders, only Stephen Miran has backed the call for such deep cuts. Meanwhile, a top executive at PGIM Fixed Income warned that pressure from President Donald Trump could push the Federal Reserve into cutting rates too aggressively, posing a short-term risk to the U.S. dollar. The currency has already slipped about 9.5% this year against a group of major peers. Daleep Singh, vice chair and chief global economist at the New Jersey firm that manages close to $900 billion, said at a Federal Reserve Bank of New York conference, ‚ÄúWe do worry quite a bit about an abruptly dovish shift in the Fed‚Äôs reaction function going into next year.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a very decent chance that the FOMC looks and acts quite differently.‚Äù If you're reading this, you‚Äôre already ahead.

Q2 2025 results showed strong revenue and volume growth, but reported losses were due to one-off IPO-related stock compensation expenses. CRCL's business model benefits from stablecoin adoption, earning interest on reserves, but faces headwinds from declining short-term interest rates. Despite Fed rate cuts, CRCL's expanding partnerships and blockchain initiatives support long-term growth, but valuation isn't so low to be discounted. Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) is still a relatively new stock, after its IPO this spring. In that time, we've seen plenty of volatility as the market makes up its mind on fair value. CRCL Price History (Seeking Alpha) After going public in May at $30, the stock climbed to $263 in June. In more recent days, it's settled near $130, making its market cap approximately $29B. After making initial coverage in July, the price is down significantly, and I've had more to learn and consider about the stablecoin opportunity. I've raised my valuation, but I maintain my Hold rating. Summary of First Thesis My initial thesis was largely a validation of the business model and the value-add of their stablecoin product. By tokenizing fiat currency, they effectively reduce the cost of transaction services (typically something like 2%) to zero, with speed both domestically and across borders. Revenue and Volume (Screenshot of previous thesis) This is because they make revenue from short-term interest rates on the cash they hold while giving out their tokenized equivalents. As more people use stablecoins, the more cash they would have to earn interest, relatively free of risk. The main downside was the potential for this yield to decrease with Federal Reserve rate cuts, limiting their ability to benefit from volume growth and potentially making them cyclical with little upside left on the table. With the range of possibilities, I felt that a market cap closer to $20B ($43B at the time) would be a better entry, which came to $95. I rated it a Hold accordingly. Subsequent Updates Since I covered CRCL, Q2 2025 results have come out. The period showed strong, sequential growth. Q2 2025 Earnings Release Total revenue and reserve income reached $658M, up 13.6% from Q1. This largely resulted from growth in volume. Q2 2025 Company Presentation In spite of the growth, however, Circle did not record a profit for this quarter. Income Statement (Q2 2025 Form 10Q) Compensation expenses were unusually high in this quarter, at $503M. According to the latest Form 10Q , this was primarily due to a one-time instance of stock-based compensation expense that was realized in relation to the IPO. That impact to expenses was $423.8M. ""Other (expense)"" points to a $160M item as well. Cash Flow Statement (Q2 2025 Form 10Q) The cash flow statement indicates that most of this was due to a change in the fair value of other forms of the fully diluted equity, whose value would have been unlocked by the IPO and materialized as an expense. Without these items, Q2's net income was around breakeven. Cash Flow Statement (Q2 2025 Form 10Q) The year-to-date cash flow situation shows that it is overwhelmingly positive. If we count M&A, software development costs, and purchases of long-lived assets as capex for this type of software company, it's free cash flow of about $263M. Q2 2025 Company Presentation On the qualitative side, Circle expanded its operations a bit by introducing Arc, its own blockchain network. USCoin USD ( USDC-USD ) is the native gas token, effectively making the dollar the gas. This allows Circle's USDC token to compete with other USD stablecoins by having some extra utility. Q2 2025 Company Presentation Circle also began expanding its partnerships across distributors and merchants. Binance is a key relationship, as they are the largest crypto exchange. Coinbase ( COIN ), which I discussed last time as an important ally for Circle, is a big exchange in their own right, but Binance has almost eight times the volume of Coinbase. Outlook and Valuation Circle isn't a terribly complicated business. It mints stablecoin and earns interest on the real cash it receives for it. They would have to introduce entirely new products with the same ambition as their stablecoin for the earnings outlook to evolve radically. It's really a matter of scale. As stablecoin's share of M2 grows, companies like Circle will do more business. Last time, I discussed research by Citigroup ( C ), supposing that the stablecoin market could grow to $500B to $3.7T by 2030. I opined the following: Q1 2025 showed net income of about $64.8M, for about $78.7M in earnings if we add back depreciation and amortization. Annualized, that's about $314.8M in earnings. If the Stablecoin market reaches $1T, ceteris paribus, Circle should be earning $1.26B on the 4X alone. Let's assume operating leverage gives them better margins at scale, for about $1.5B. Making a similar adjustment for the six months ended June, as well as the one-off expenses from the IPO that I mentioned, these adjusted earnings are $240.7M, which annualize to $481.5M. This is quite a bit higher, demonstrating the clear operating leverage of the business. 4X the volume from the secular movement of stablecoin could easily grow earnings much more than 4X. It's easier to see a range of $2B to $3B in 2030 earnings with constant interest rates. Quarterly Interest Rates (Q2 2025 Form 10Q) For many quarters now, the short-term rates that their dollar reserves earn have been in decline. The Federal Reserve also finally issued a cut this September, so this is likely to continue. Lacking another way to make revenue, this will simply reduce earnings. Even if short-term rates don't return to zero, something like 2% could bring the range down between $1B and $1.5B. That could lower the valuation over time as well. As the market cap is currently about $29B, that isn't an awful price. It's a lot better than what we got at the beginning of July, and with my revised outlook on potential earnings growth, I think an entry price below $95 is no longer necessary. An entry below $120 seems adequate going forward, slightly less than the current price. Conclusion While the Fed's first rate cut in 2025 might not be particularly welcome for this stock, the growth of stablecoins and Circle's key role in it will largely outweigh cuts in the meantime. I feel more confident about what could be considered a good entry price for this business, and that's why I've bumped it up. As the stock still trades above that, I maintain my Hold rating for now.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-28 08:54:36

Growing demand for on-chain versions of traditional instruments has lifted the entire RWA segment, and these five projects now stand at the front of that trend thanks to fresh product launches, major partnerships and expanding user bases. The shortlist reflects a broader shift toward practical uses of blockchain that extend beyond payments and speculative trading. Chainlink‚Äôs data feeds secure trillions in value, Quant‚Äôs interoperability layer is gaining traction with banks, Ondo‚Äôs tokenized treasuries have crossed the billion-dollar mark, Pendle‚Äôs yield trading volumes keep setting records, and Zexpire‚Äôs upcoming compliance suite has drawn early institutional attention. With policy clarity improving in key regions, observers are positioning these tokens as potential bellwethers for the next growth phase of the RWA market. $ZX Early Access: First Token for Profiting from Volatility Zexpire is turning heads as its $ZX token launches at just $0.003, giving early investors a ground-floor entry before the listing price of $0.025 ‚Äî nearly 800% upside. Crypto analysts are watching closely ‚Äî options trading is one of DeFi‚Äôs fastest-growing segments, with $3B in daily volume and rising. Zexpire is a 0DTE DeFi protocol, making options as simple as a one-click daily prediction game. It is also the first platform that lets traders earn directly from crypto volatility. Instead of betting on direction, users face a simple daily choice: will Bitcoin stay within range, or break out? Losses are capped, no margin calls, no liquidations ‚Äî just a one-click, fixed-risk way to turn volatility into profit. And every play requires $ZX, so the demand for the token is built in from day one. Early buyers get the best price and unlock: APR staking rewards before TGE Cashback on gameplay Loyalty bonuses Exclusive airdrops and beta access To keep long-term value climbing, Zexpire has built in a deflationary model: 20% of fees are burned, buybacks support price, and multi-chain availability (Base, Solana, TON, Tron) makes adoption seamless. Each funding stage increases the price ‚Äî the earliest buyers capture the steepest discount. $ZX at $0.003 won‚Äôt last. Buy $ZX Now for the Steepest Discount ONDO‚Äôs Rise, Pause, and the Long View Ahead Ondo Finance positions itself as a bridge between traditional investing and the crypto frontier, offering a token that tracks familiar instruments such as government bonds while keeping everything on-chain. Founded by Nathan Allman, the project stresses openness and real-world backing rather than pure speculation, aiming to make Wall Street‚Äìgrade products available to anyone with a digital wallet. That focus on clarity and oversight has set ONDO apart from countless ‚Äúwild west‚Äù coins that promise much yet deliver little. Market action has already shown how quickly sentiment can flip. After launching on January 18, 2024, ONDO sprinted upward until early spring, hit a short-lived peak in June, and then slipped through late summer. Attention returned when the wider market rediscovered real-world-asset tokens, driving ONDO to a record high on December 16. By January 20, 2025, it traded near $1.45, putting it among the better performers in a year when many digital assets stagnated. That steady footing has sparked comparisons with projects like Chainlink and Maker, which also gained credibility by linking crypto to outside value. Chainlink: The Data Bridge Fueling Crypto‚Äôs Next Growth Spurt Chainlink runs a global web of independent data providers that feed trustworthy information into blockchain programs, allowing those programs to react to everyday events such as price moves or weather reports. Because thousands of separate providers share the workload, the system keeps running even if a few go offline, making it a robust source of facts for digital transactions. The LINK token keeps this machine humming‚Äîprogram creators pay in LINK for fresh data, and data providers lock up LINK as a show of good faith. After peaking near $53 in 2021, LINK has hovered mainly between $10 and $25 while the overall crypto market value more than doubled. That sideways stretch stands in contrast to coins like Bitcoin, which already reclaimed prior highs, and suggests untapped room if fresh demand appears. Growing enthusiasm for exchange-traded funds tied to major coins, along with a 67 percent jump in the value of data-hungry decentralized apps, hints that the need for reliable information feeds is expanding fast. PENDLE: Turning Time Into Tokens in Crypto‚Äôs New Yield Wave In the earliest days of digital money, owning a coin meant waiting for its price to climb. Now a fresh idea is gaining steam: turning the future income a coin can earn into something that can be traded today. PENDLE sits at the center of this shift. By separating a token‚Äôs future earnings from its core value, the project lets holders lock in cash-like returns or sell them to others who prefer steady income over price swings. The result is a livelier market where time itself becomes a currency. PENDLE‚Äôs design feels almost tailor-made for a world chasing predictable rewards. Its system offers clear terms, fixed timelines, and an easy path for builders to plug in new sources of income‚Äîwhether those come from lending, staking, or fresh ideas still on the drawing board. Because each slice of future earnings is placed in a simple, stand-alone package, traders gain flexibility that once belonged only to large institutions. This blend of transparency and creativity has turned PENDLE into a bridge between fast-moving crypto markets and familiarity of traditional finance. Quant‚Äôs Overledger: The Digital Glue Connecting Blockchains Worldwide Since debuting in 2018, Quant has focused on one clear mission: letting separate blockchains talk to one another as smoothly as phones on the same call. Its secret sauce is Overledger, the first operating system built for blockchains, designed to link networks without slowing them down. By placing this ‚Äúdigital bridge‚Äù at the center of its design, Quant sets out to solve a problem that has held the entire sector back‚Äîlack of easy, reliable communication among rival chains. The promise is practical as well as bold. Overledger lets creators craft multi-chain apps, called MApps, that can roam freely between networks; think of a single program that taps into Bitcoin for security, Ethereum for complex contracts, and a private chain for customer records. Access to this new playground requires holding Quant‚Äôs native token, QNT, making the coin an entry pass and potential store of value. As more developers chase users across several chains at once, demand for that pass could grow, turning QNT into the fuel of a wider digital economy. Top RWA Tokens to Watch in Q4 2025 Token Core Focus Recent Highlights Why It Matters Zexpire ($ZX) 0DTE DeFi options on volatility Launching at $0.003 before $0.025 listing; staking rewards, cashback, burns, buybacks First platform to let traders profit directly from volatility with capped risk; token tied to adoption Chainlink (LINK) Decentralized data feeds Secures trillions in on-chain value; demand rising with dApp growth Provides reliable real-world data, the backbone of many blockchain applications Quant (QNT) Blockchain interoperability Overledger adoption with banks and enterprises Enables seamless multi-chain apps, critical for mainstream adoption Ondo (ONDO) Tokenized Treasuries & RWAs Crossed $1B in tokenized treasuries; strong market performance since launch Bridges traditional finance (bonds) with crypto, appealing to institutions Pendle (PENDLE) Yield trading & tokenized income Record trading volumes; expanding integrations Turns future yield into tradable assets, creating flexible income markets Conclusion ONDO, LINK, PENDLE, and QNT keep drawing fresh capital as builders push new use cases for real-world assets. Each token now sits on growing networks, deeper liquidity, and rising partner lists, giving them momentum heading into the final stretch of 2025. Zexpire breaks from that group by turning crypto‚Äôs biggest headache‚Äîprice swings‚Äîinto a clear bet. All activity moves through $ZX, which fuels fees, discounts, and buybacks. Early access to $ZX offers entry to a token backed by constant demand, marking Zexpire as a promising opportunity too. Learn how to join Zexpire early at https://zexpire.com/ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 1. What are Real-World Asset (RWA) tokens?RWA tokens represent traditional financial instruments ‚Äî like bonds, treasuries, or data services ‚Äî on the blockchain. They bring real-world utility into crypto, making digital assets more practical and attractive to both retail and institutional investors. 2. Why are Chainlink, Quant, Ondo, Pendle, and Zexpire considered top RWA tokens?Analysts have highlighted these five projects because they solve critical problems in blockchain adoption: reliable data (Chainlink), cross-chain communication (Quant), tokenized treasuries (Ondo), yield tokenization (Pendle), and volatility trading (Zexpire). Each addresses a unique market gap. 3. How is Zexpire different from the others?While most RWA tokens focus on connecting crypto to existing financial instruments, Zexpire introduces a new model: letting traders profit directly from crypto‚Äôs volatility. Its $ZX token is required for every trade, creating built-in demand as the platform grows. 4. What makes $ZX attractive for early investors?$ZX is launching at just $0.003 in early access, with a planned listing price of $0.025. Beyond price appreciation, holders enjoy staking rewards, fee discounts, cashback on gameplay, loyalty bonuses, and exclusive airdrops. A deflationary model ‚Äî including fee burns and buybacks ‚Äî supports long-term value. 5. How risky is investing in $ZX compared to other tokens?Like any crypto investment, $ZX carries risk. However, its capped-loss trading model reduces exposure compared to leveraged trading, and the token‚Äôs multiple utilities (staking, cashback, governance) help reinforce value beyond speculation. 6. Where can I buy $ZX?$ZX is available now in its early funding round. Early buyers get the lowest entry price and extra perks such as staking APR, cashback, and beta access. Each stage increases the price, so the steepest discount is only available to first movers. Investor Note Crypto markets move fast, and early positioning often makes the biggest difference. Zexpire‚Äôs $ZX token is still available at its early access price. Every stage of funding raises the entry price, while adoption of the platform directly fuels $ZX demand. With built-in token burns and buybacks, the upside potential is amplified for early participants. Early entry means maximum discount ‚Äî once $ZX lists, that window closes.

The outcome of that meeting was the creation of the UK‚ÄìUS Transatlantic Taskforce for Markets of the Future, a new initiative designed to strengthen cooperation in financial innovation. XRP proponent Amelie highlighted comments from Ripple‚Äôs Managing Director, Cassie Craddock, who confirmed that the Taskforce will focus on digital asset regulation, tokenization , and cross-border market access. BREAKING NEWS: Ripple‚Äòs Managing Director Cassie Craddok says: The UK-US Transatlantic ‚ÄûTaskforce will lead to closer cooperation between the US & UK on digital assets, creating an opportunity to align on stablecoins, tokenization, and cross-border market access!‚Äú ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/2WQKBGFiKe ‚Äî ùìêùì∂ùìÆùìµùì≤ùìÆ (@_Crypto_Barbie) September 26, 2025 Priorities outlined by the Taskforce The stated goal of the initiative is to align the two countries on the regulatory and operational treatment of stablecoins, tokenized assets, and international market connectivity. Craddock emphasized that this cooperation is intended not only to harmonize policy approaches but also to build a foundation for international standards that can guide the wider financial industry. She noted that Ripple , as a US-headquartered company with a significant presence in the UK, is well-positioned to contribute to this process by leveraging its cross-border payments expertise and established relationships in both jurisdictions. Reactions from the crypto community Commentary shared on X says that the Taskforce should be seen as more than a cooperative dialogue. One user described it as the formalization of a new financial architecture, suggesting that the effort represents the beginning of compliant, institution-grade infrastructure for digital assets. This perspective highlights the view that the initiative is not limited to standard-setting, but instead focuses on building the systems that will define how tokenized value is exchanged globally under regulatory oversight. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Relevance to XRP and Ripple‚Äôs positioning The discussion has drawn attention to XRP and its potential role within this framework. Observers have noted that as stablecoin regulation and tokenization gain traction, a fast and cost-effective settlement layer becomes a critical requirement. Ripple‚Äôs technology, underpinned by the XRP Ledger, was developed specifically to address cross-border market access, which has been identified as a central theme of the Taskforce. Some community members argue that XRP is moving from being viewed primarily as a speculative asset to becoming directly integrated into the structural framework being built by major economies. The Taskforce is expected to deliver recommendations on regulatory alignment, technical standards, and cross-border integration in the coming months. For companies active in digital asset settlement and tokenization, this presents a direct opportunity to shape the rules and infrastructure of future markets.

Peterson said in his assessment that high interest rates have been suppressing economic activity for a long time, but recent developments have begun to give markets a breather. Peterson noted that high interest rates have effectively locked down the housing market, noting that the decline in mortgage rates has triggered refinancing activity. He argued that this development provides cash flow to households and stimulates consumption, creating a multiplier effect on the economy. Related News: US President Donald Trump Shares an Interesting ‚ÄúYou're Fired‚Äù Post About Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Peterson also noted that interest rates have begun to decline in the high-yield bond market, indicating a growing investor appetite for risk. He said, ‚ÄúBitcoin, which sits at the top of the risk ladder, is trending upward as investors shift towards riskier assets.‚Äù Peterson concluded his remarks by stating that these positive signals in macro data could mean a strong uptrend for Bitcoin in the next nine months: ‚ÄúWith interest rates falling, investor confidence is rising.

But in such a competitive and heavily regulated environment, building visibility and credibility requires more than just marketing ‚Äî it calls for specialized public relations (PR). Crypto PR in North America comes with unique challenges: fragmented regulations (SEC, CFTC, CSA), intense media scrutiny, and a diverse audience that spans Wall Street institutions to grassroots communities on Reddit and Twitter/X. To succeed, projects need PR partners who understand both the regulatory sensitivities and the fast-moving culture of crypto media.

Investor-Heavy Audience: North America‚Äôs crypto ecosystem is dominated by institutional investors, requiring trust-driven and ROI-focused messaging.

52379150,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=821620,1759051241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52379150.jpeg,"US threatens complaints, seeks talks on EU digital rules",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-warns-eu-to-revise-digital-rules/,"The United States has warned the European Union that its digital rule book could damage trans-Atlantic relations unless overhauled. Washington contends that the laws unfairly saddle American tech companies with liability and would limit free speech on the internet. The alert is being issued even as Europe cracks down on the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA). These laws, which are aimed at controlling powerful platforms and online content, are already facing stiff pushback from US companies operating in Russia, including Apple and Meta‚Äôs Facebook and Google. US demands changes to EU laws Andrew Puzder, Donald Trump‚Äôs ambassador to the European Union, has ramped up Washington‚Äôs assault on Europe‚Äôs digital rulebook. Puzder, speaking in Brussels, said the US will send formal submissions to the European Commission outlining its concerns next week. The idea, he said, is to initiate direct discussions with EU officials on how those regulations are shaped and how they impact American companies. Central to the dispute are two flagship bills: a Digital Markets Act (DMA) that seeks to curb the power that ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta exercise over smaller companies; and a Digital Services Act (DSA) intended to make platforms police illegal or harmful content. These laws are among the most ambitious tech regulations globally, and they are rewriting how online companies can act in Europe. Puzder argued that although the legislation was written to appear neutral, it placed heavier restrictions on American companies than European ones. He said Europeans considered the rules more lenient than the US believed, and stressed that both sides needed to review the acts carefully. He claimed that no American president, whether Republican or Democrat, could remain passive if restrictions were imposed on US businesses or citizens‚Äô basic rights. He added that if the legislation tended to impose economic pain on competitors outside Europe to benefit European industry, the United States would strongly oppose it. President Trump has echoed these fears and threatened that his administration will retaliate if some American businesses are treated unjustly. He had threatened retaliatory tariffs and other trade measures against countries that ‚Äúdiscriminate‚Äù against American tech companies. Earlier this year, Trump suggested that allies could see higher duties imposed on cars and other products if they did not address digital rules the US views as detrimental to its interests. The tough talk serves as one illustration of how seriously Washington is taking Europe‚Äôs digital agenda. Though the US and EU recently secured a trade deal that held off an escalation of tariffs, the friction over tech regulation runs the risk of resurrecting tensions just as both sides had embraced improved relations. EU defends its digital sovereignty The European Commission has denied that the move is discriminatory. Officials have said the rules are impartial and apply to any company, regardless of where it is based. They contend that the laws are necessary to ensure fairer competition and safer online environments. France and Germany have backed Brussels out in the open. Both governments said Europe has the authority to regulate its digital market without being forced by Washington. Margrethe Vestager, the EU‚Äôs competition chief, said the DMA was necessary to prevent powerful platforms from running unrestrained. She said the bloc will not relax or cancel its standards under pressure from the US. Meanwhile, the Commission has initiated a public consultation on potential simplification of the digital rules. Critics worry the process could water down protections, while industry lobbyists seek weaker rules. The consultation is open for responses until October 14. The fight over digital regulation risks overshadowing recent improvements in US-EU ties. Both parties agreed to a broad trade deal that staved off a transatlantic trade war in July. But the digital standoff may strain that goodwill. Threats from the US to retaliate on one side and pledges of EU sovereignty on the other set the stage for a tough negotiation in the months ahead.

Starting November 29, roughly $11.9 billion worth of HYPE tokens will be distributed over the next 24 months. As Hyperliquid braces for its $500M monthly unlocks, the market is closely watching how supply pressures will affect HYPE‚Äôs trajectory. Traders and investors track liquidity, inflows, and resistance levels to anticipate outcomes. In a similar way, Outset PR monitors performance metrics of media outlets and delivers analytic reports to craft campaigns that fit market conditions with precision. This combination of data and timing offers a lens to understand how both markets and communications succeed under pressure. A $500M Monthly Wall of Supply Token unlocks are always closely watched events, but HYPE‚Äôs scale sets it apart. According to the vesting schedule , monthly releases will continue uninterrupted for two years, steadily feeding hundreds of millions of dollars‚Äô worth of tokens into the market. Currently, Hyperliquid‚Äôs buyback program absorbs only about 17% of that monthly supply, or roughly $90 million worth of tokens. This leaves an estimated $410 million in net new tokens hitting the market every month‚Äîpotentially creating sustained downward pressure unless offset by rising demand. In other words, the sell-side overhang could test even the most optimistic of long-term holders. How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map ‚Äîa proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fond√© explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers ‚Äì something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR‚Äôs dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. üëâ Reach out to Outset PR HYPE Could Come Under Bearish Pressure Source: tradingview Beyond fundamentals, the technical picture for HYPE also reflects a market at a crossroads. The token is currently trading below the 7-day ($46.8) and 30-day ($49.54) SMAs, signaling short-term weakness. However, it still holds comfortably above the 200-day SMA ($33.7), showing that long-term bullish structure remains intact. The RSI-14 at 42.64 suggests neutral-to-weak conditions‚Äîneither oversold nor overbought. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram at -1.71 signals a bearish momentum bias. A modest 24-hour bounce coincides with Fibonacci support, but so far lacks the volume and conviction to confirm a bullish reversal. Taken together, the chart setup implies that short-term downside risks persist, especially with unlock-driven supply looming. Conclusion HYPE faces a defining moment as its unlock schedule begins, with both fundamentals and technicals suggesting a cautious road ahead. Market resilience will hinge on demand outpacing the constant wave of new supply. Outset PR approaches communications with the same discipline traders apply to price action, analyzing performance, anticipating shifts, and executing strategies that deliver verifiable results.

Traders track inflows, resistance levels, and adoption curves to anticipate where momentum will build next. Similarly, Outset PR monitors media outlet performance with precision, publishing regular analytical reports that make PR campaigns as market-fit as possible. In a landscape where both capital and narratives drive outcomes, Ethena‚Äôs $20M backing from M2 Capital underscores the rising interplay between finance and storytelling. M2 Capital‚Äôs Strategic Entry M2 Holdings is a diversified conglomerate with exposure to digital custody, investment, and wealth management services. Its decision to back Ethena via M2 Capital signals strong conviction in the protocol‚Äôs synthetic dollar model, which aims to combine blockchain-native infrastructure with stable asset functionality. In a statement , the company confirmed that Ethena‚Äôs offerings will be integrated into client portfolios through its affiliate, M2 Global Wealth Limited. This move underscores how traditional wealth management channels are increasingly blending with innovative decentralized finance products. What is Ethena? Ethena has positioned itself as a next-generation platform in the digital dollar space. Unlike centralized stablecoins, its protocol leverages on-chain mechanisms and Ethereum‚Äôs infrastructure to create a synthetic dollar that is both scalable and transparent. By anchoring governance through its ENA token, Ethena enables community participation while aligning long-term incentives for growth and stability.

Traders are closely monitoring support, momentum, and market sentiment to determine ETH‚Äôs next move. In the same way, Outset PR keeps a constant pulse on media performance, publishing analytical reports that make PR campaigns as efficient and market-fit as possible. Just as resistance levels shape price action, data-driven insights shape how stories gain visibility and traction. Ethereum Price Outlook: Bullish Trends and Growth Potential Source: tradingview ETH has broken below both its 7-day SMA ($4,194) and 30-day EMA ($4,322), confirming short-term bearish momentum. The RSI-14 sits at 38.76, pointing to weakening buying pressure but not yet reaching oversold territory. The MACD histogram at -71.85 further underscores strong downside momentum, suggesting that sellers remain firmly in control of the near-term trend. Since mid-August, ETH has been forming a descending triangle, a bearish continuation pattern that typically resolves lower. If the critical $4,000 support level breaks, the structure projects downside targets in the $3,745‚Äì$3,800 range. This makes $4,000 the immediate line in the sand for traders and investors.

(CryptoQuant),https://cryptopotato.com/how-are-shares-of-bitcoin-treasury-companies-performing-amid-private-fundraises-cryptoquant/,"As Bitcoin adoption grows, more companies seek additional methods of raising funds to acquire the leading digital asset. Most have turned to Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) programs; however, these moves have backfired on their shares. A report from the market analysis platform CryptoQuant revealed that the shares of most Bitcoin treasury entities that raised capital through PIPE programs have plummeted significantly. Worse still, others face the risk of further decline. BTC Firms Turn to Private Fundraises In PIPE offerings, publicly traded companies sell newly issued shares to a group of institutional or accredited investors. These programs are separate from their public offerings. They are characterized by features such as faster financing for the company and shares at a lower-than-market price for investors. PIPE investors also have the option to sell their shares after filing a resale registration. Companies often offer PIPEs to quickly raise capital for buying BTC during bullish market conditions. Unlike public offerings and traditional financing methods, PIPEs are flexible and usually signal strategic intent to investors. ‚ÄúSeveral Bitcoin Treasury Companies have opted to fund their Bitcoin purchases using a PIPE. Bitcoin Treasury Companies often need large blocks of capital quickly to front-run expected BTC rallies, announce large BTC purchases to rebrand their equity narrative or start their treasury strategy, and to continue to expand their total Bitcoin holdings,‚Äù CryptoQuant stated. Although one of the few viable options for Bitcoin treasury firms, PIPEs can negatively impact a company‚Äôs stock performance. The offerings usually increase the number of shares in circulation, thereby diluting existing shareholders. In situations like these, selling pressure from PIPE investors creates a supply overhang that pulls down the stock price. PIPE Shares Fall 97% The share prices of most Bitcoin treasury companies that raised capital through PIPE have fallen toward their PIPE issuance levels. The declines range from 42% to 97%. Stocks still trading above their PIPE offering prices face declines of up to 50%. Companies like Kindly MD (NAKA) have watched their stock plummet by 97% after their PIPE raise. NAKA declined over 50% in a single day after PIPE shares were unlocked for trading. Others, such as Empery Digital (EMPD) and Sequans Communications (SQNS), are already trading below their PIPE issuance price. Additionally, entities like Strive (ASST) and Cantor Equity Partners (CEP) face downside risk, with their shares trading above their PIPE prices. They could still fall at least 50% before hitting the PIPE issuance levels. CryptoQuant says only a sustained BTC rally will prevent the continuation of this trend.

CRCL benefits from a scalable, asset-light, and predictable business model, primarily earning interest on cash and treasuries backing USDC tokens. The company enjoys regulatory advantages and a growing network effect, with USDC widely accepted and Circle holding key licenses in major jurisdictions. Despite these strengths, execution risks‚Äîespecially high distribution costs from the Coinbase deal‚Äîlead to a pass on CRCL for now. My thesis on the Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) is a pass on execution risks and major bottlenecks, like the higher distribution costs due to a lopsided Coinbase deal. If not for these execution risks, I may have considered ignoring macro pressures like a falling interest rate regime and even any elevated valuation concerns to go long on the secular tailwinds of growing stablecoin adoption. Why CRCL Could Have Been a Buy Revenue Growth Trajectory: Revenue growth has been impressive , with Q2 2025 revenues showing a ~53% YoY increase. This is not a flash in the pan. Topline growth was explosive in Q1 as well, with ~58% growth recorded compared to $365m in top line in March 2024. Analyst estimates point to continued high growth pushing the topline close to $7b annually by 2028, from a TTM revenue of ~$2.1b today. That is continued growth at a CAGR of ~40%, driven by an expanding USDC adoption expectation. Data by YCharts Scalable, Predictable Business Model: Since the primary revenue source is interest earned on cash and treasuries backing USDC tokens issued, the business model looks simple and has predictable cash flow and unit economics. As long as stablecoin usage expands, the business will be extremely scalable. The only cyclical element that is introduced in the business model is the interest rate dependency, but the unit economics are easy to track and predict, making investment decisions easier. Asset-Light Model: The business model revolves around managing digital dollar reserves instead of physical asset management. This means Circle has lower working capital and capex needs than traditional banks. The model is asset-light. Moat Like Position: Circle has several barriers to entry that can qualify as reasonable moats. In an environment of a better regulatory framework for stablecoins, Circle already has required regulatory approvals in the early phase of an evolving regulatory landscape. It has applied to the OCC, which will allow the company to operate as a federally regulated trust bank. Circle also has several licenses already in place to transact in Europe and Singapore. Even if the regulatory landscape eases out in the future, which may very well happen, early approvals and licenses will definitely help create a moderately durable regulatory lead for Circle. Enough lead to penetrate the markets and create a reasonable network effect. Signs of a robust networking effect are already in place with USDC's acceptance across a vast majority of major exchanges and a 500m+ user ecosystem . Early access to users and distribution channels are also going to take significant time for any new entrant to replicate. Market Position and Scale: The stablecoins market is dominated by Tether USDT, which now accounts for ~59% of the volumes. The USDC volume share was ~26% in April 2025 . The expanding TAM for stablecoins is looking like a very likely scenario with supportive regulatory regimes and maturing interest in alternative assets in the upcoming years. I am bullish on an explosive TAM expansion that could even accommodate some competition and a fall in market share for Circle. As of now, Circle is still a growing ""number two"" in stablecoins, behind Tether, and an expanding TAM is likely to keep the growth alive, even if market share gains are challenged through competition. Competition from PayPal, Ripple, and Robinhood launching stablecoins, or even new entrants in the future, could only be a real threat if the stablecoin TAM expansion thesis is threatened. In August 2025, for example, World Liberty Financial's USD1 showed an improved market share (still around 1% of the total ~$278b market size). While competition is hot and growing - USD1 had double-digit growth in August alone - the stablecoin market has also been growing at a healthy pace. In September, stablecoins completed 24 months of continued growth at a pace of ~3.5% per month. I expect the rate of adoption to only get even better. But even if the average monthly adoption growth happens at around the 3.5% mark (i.e., a 50% annual growth), USDC market share will need to drop from 26% to 17-18% to start clocking topline stagnation. In summary, Circle's growing profile, current market position, and a growing TAM leave enough room for competition effects to unfold. A ~58% topline growth is currently higher than the stablecoin market growth levels, showing that Circle is potentially making further inroads into the market. Those levels could still be impacted by competition, though, and that could have a say in valuation erosion, but current revenue levels have good support from the expanding TAM to prevent huge downsides even in the worst-case scenarios. Secular Tailwinds: Continuing on the TAM expansion bit, Circle's business will be well supported by secular tailwinds due to increased adoption of stablecoin in digital payments. Then there is scope for improving regulatory transparency, as discussed earlier, and even technology improvements (higher precision Blockchain networks, instant settlements, and integration with major payment platforms). What Concerns Me Interest Rate Cyclicality: Interest rate cuts will have a linear impact on topline and margins as we are entering a regime of lower rates. The specifics of how high for how long will be important to note. So will be how the secular stablecoin TAM growth offsets this drag. The estimated impact of the 25 bps rate cut is a ~$160m revenue loss for USDC annually, i.e., ~6% impact on the current run rate of ~$2.6b revenues. This impact will add up for every further rate cut. That is a lot to digest for the topline, even as it works through the growing secular adoption tailwinds. Distribution Costs: The revenue-sharing arrangement with Coinbase hurts Circle's margins by spiking up distribution costs. Coinbase was paid 56% of total revenues as distribution costs in 2024. This was because the contract demands a 100% interest income on USDC held in Coinbase and 50% on holdings elsewhere. This is obviously an initial arrangement helping USDC gain traction. The deal gets renewed in 2026, and whether Circle gets some leverage back at that point is dependent on several factors - some like how the negotiations will go, are hard to predict. As USDC adoption grows, one can expect Circle to hold some leverage in those negotiations, but whether that growth will be telling before the deal is renewed in 2026 is uncertain. The last numbers I see indicate around ~22% of USDC held in Coinbase. Over the next few quarters, either an absolute continued uptick in volume or a drop in that percentage held in Coinbase will help not only the margins directly but also negotiations when the deal is renewed. As an interested investor, I will watch out for progress in Circle's attempt to diversify distribution through banks, exchanges, and payment companies. However, the Coinbase relationship will remain critical for the foreseeable future, and the uncertainty there will be a drag on investor sentiment. Why I Can't Enter Circle When I started out on the thesis, I did find the distribution setup concerning, and after looking at the detailed pros and cons, I still see distribution costs as the obvious culprit and the primary factor that prohibits fresh entries at this stage. The interest rate pressures are real and concerning too, but they are more measurable and can be analyzed against valuation discounts in adverse rate environments for Circle. The competitive vulnerabilities are not huge, but all the negatives there can also be accounted for. The uncertainties of the distribution costs, on the other hand, are prohibitive for me, as I am unable to model my margin expectations without any long-term clarity there. In short, I can digest negatives, but not uncertainties. Not of the magnitude that critically affects margins and shows low wriggle room for Circle. Without indulging in long-term expectations, I am comfortable with valuations of ~10x revenues, allowing for a premium on the secular stablecoin growth story. I expect the current growth rate to be upheld for that to be justified. That is, the current revenue run rate of ~$2.6b reaches ~$4b over the next one year. With ~231m shares outstanding, that translates to a share price of ~$170 at a valuation of ~10x on revenues. Hence, valuations are not concerning, particularly after the recent drop in share prices. Even after accounting for lower interest rates, I see scope for $150 levels as well supported. Provided several execution milestones are met consistently, such as market share gains and consistent topline growth. Overall, I rate Circle as a Hold because its valuations may still be conducive now, but the distribution arrangements are critically uncertain. Till I get more clarity and confidence around that, I will remain on the sidelines. Otherwise, current valuations do account for a large part of the execution and rate risks for long-term investors. The margin expansion uncertainty needs to be addressed for Circle to become a Buy. This is because the premium 10x valuations cannot be held for long with no visible path for margin growth. Even continued topline growth for the next several quarters could be insufficient to support informed fresh Buys today.",CRCL,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|MARKET|USDC|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-28 09:34:17

Most larger-cap alts have produced little to no volatility since yesterday, but some of the smaller caps have gone on a tear. BTC Calms at $109.5K It was just over a week ago when the primary digital asset challenged the $118,000 resistance, only to fail and begin a more profound and violent correction. At first, the asset was driven south to $115,500 during the previous weekend before the bears took complete control of the market on Monday. The first leg down pushed bitcoin to a 10-day low of $112,000 in what appeared to be a flash crash. It quickly bounced off to $114,000, but the bears didn‚Äôt let go and kept the pressure on. As a result, BTC slumped to a three-week low of under $109,000 as the week progressed. After losing over $6,000 from Monday to Thursday, bitcoin finally calmed. It even jumped past $110,000 briefly on Friday, but to no avail, and was pushed south to $109,500, where it has been positioned for most of the weekend. Its market cap continues to struggle at $2.180 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is up to 56.5% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView MYX on a Roll Most larger-cap alts have produced minor moves over the past day, but are deep in the red weekly. For instance, ETH has slumped by double digits and struggles at $4,000, which is a crucial support level that could determine the asset‚Äôs next move. Further notable losses come from the likes of SOL, DOGE, ADA, HYPE, LINK, and AVAX, all of which have dumped by double digits. On a daily scale, HASH and MYX stand in a league of their own, with gains of 24% and 11%, respectively.

The analyst suggests that the next time XRP forms a bullish engulfing candle on the weekly chart, the token could surge to new all-time highs, potentially reaching around $7.30. Such a move would represent one of XRP‚Äôs most significant price rallies in years, fueled by technical strength and renewed investor optimism. A bullish engulfing candle is a well-known pattern in technical analysis, signaling strong momentum when buyers fully eclipse prior selling pressure. For XRP, which has long traded in a range amid regulatory battles and market uncertainty, the confirmation of this signal on a weekly timeframe could mark the start of a major breakout. If realized, the $7.30 level would surpass XRP‚Äôs historical peak of around $3.65, cementing a new milestone for the digital asset. However, EGRAG CRYPTO also cautions that risks remain if Bitcoin, the broader market‚Äôs anchor, experiences further downside pressure. Should BTC decline significantly, XRP may fail to sustain bullish momentum, with critical support levels at $2.60 and, in a deeper correction, $2.37. These zones, according to the analyst, represent essential lines of defense for XRP holders and could determine whether the asset consolidates before another attempt at upward movement or slips into a prolonged retracement. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.79, according to CoinGecko data . October Showdown: Seven XRP Spot ETF Filings Poised to Reshape Crypto Investing According to crypto pundit John Squire, October could mark a watershed moment for XRP and the broader digital asset market as multiple financial heavyweights line up their XRP Spot ETF filings. If approved, these products would open the door for mainstream investors to gain direct exposure to XRP through traditional stock exchanges, potentially ushering in new levels of liquidity and legitimacy. October‚Äôs XRP ETF calendar is stacked as Grayscale kicks off on the 18th, followed by 21Shares (19th), Bitwise (20th), Canary Capital (23rd), WisdomTree (24th), and dual filings from Franklin Templeton and CoinShares on the 25th, according to Squire. This tight clustering underscores surging institutional confidence in XRP and intensifying competition to seize first-mover advantage. Unlike futures-based products, spot ETFs hold XRP directly rather than derivatives, offering investors lower costs, tighter price tracking, and stronger integration with traditional finance. For XRP, multiple ETF approvals could unlock significant new demand, drawing in institutions and retail investors who prefer regulated, accessible investment vehicles. As a result, Squire stresses that October won‚Äôt hinge on just one approval, it could be the month that cements XRP as a mainstream asset. Conclusion With October approaching,even one ETF approval could ignite momentum, but multiple greenlights may solidify XRP as a core asset in traditional portfolios. XRP‚Äôs next move depends on technical signals and Bitcoin‚Äôs market sway. A confirmed bullish engulfing candle could propel prices to $7.30, a historic breakout.

The main intention of the regulation will be to tackle scams carried out with the machines. This way, residents and users of the ATMs would have an extra layer of protection when carrying out their transactions. The scam in question involves the use of crypto kiosks, which allow users to convert cash into Bitcoin and other digital assets. They are often located in some businesses or shopping malls. The scammers just have to use various con methods, including pretending to be a government official, a romantic partner, or gaining trust through deception, before asking them to deposit a large amount of money into one of these crypto ATMs. Regulations to crack down on crypto ATM scams in Arizona Arizona has experienced a huge rise in the number of its residents getting scammed through cryptocurrency ATMs over the past year. The number was so high that Attorney General Kris Mayes issued a letter of support to the Yavapai County Sheriff‚Äôs Office last November, noting that efforts are being taken to combat the crimes. The AG mentioned that programs such as posting signs on the machines to warn residents that they may be victims of a scam . AG Mayes, in the letter, urged all business owners in the county to support the Sheriff‚Äôs Office in its efforts to stop the loss of thousands of dollars. The AG added that Arizonans have lost millions of dollars in the past year to various scams, with the criminals using the machines as an outlet to receive cash. She mentioned that the criminals prey on elderly folks, noting that ‚ÄúIt is truly heartbreaking to hear the stories of individuals who have lost part or all of their life savings to fraudsters.‚Äù In the recent press release about the new law, Mayes celebrated its ‚Äúcommonsense protections‚Äù but warned that crypto scams are still something that needs to be urgently addressed. ‚ÄúLast year, Arizonans lost an astounding $177 million in their hard-earned savings to cryptocurrency scammers. This is a good first step, but we need to do even more to protect Arizona seniors from these persistent criminals,‚Äù Mayes said. New regulation will reduce the daily transaction limit The new Cryptocurrency Kiosk License Fraud Prevention law reduces the daily transaction maximum, increases warnings on the machines, and requires transaction receipts. It also mandates operators of the machines to issue a refund to victims of fraud. The law was sponsored by Rep. David Marshall, R-Snowflake, who told the Senate Judiciary and Elections Committee earlier this year that his constituents would drive to Phoenix to deposit their money in these ATMs only to find their money gone when they got home. According to the new law, daily transactions will be limited to $2,000 for new users and $10,500 for existing users. Any new user who reports to an ATM operator that they have been a victim of fraud within 30 days of their transaction will receive a full refund. During their crackdown activities last year, YCSO and the AG instructed business owners to put warnings on their machines. The warnings were similar to those displayed around gift cards at stores due to the rise in that kind of scam, where victims are urged to buy gift cards and send them to scammers. In 2023, Americans lost $5.6 billion to crypto scams, with the majority of victims being the elderly. Crypto thefts have become a worrying concern in the crypto industry.

Yet, amid the decline, certain altcoins show promise for future gains. With altseason anticipation building, there are specific digital assets poised for growth. This article reveals the top altcoins to consider now, positioning for a potential rebound when the market sentiment shifts. Ethena (ENA) Shows Potential Despite Recent Drop Source: tradingview Ethena (ENA) is trading between sixty and seventy-three cents right now. It has met resistance around eighty-two cents but finds support at fifty-five cents. Even with a twelve percent dip over the past week, ENA has grown almost fifty-eight percent in the last six months, showing strong potential. If ENA breaks the current resistance level, it could climb to ninety-five cents, offering an increase of over thirty percent from its current upper range. Indicators like moving averages suggest stability, and a healthy RSI signals room for growth. Despite the ups and downs, ENA looks promising for future gains. Pi Network Shows Signs of Stability Amid Market Challenges Source: tradingview Pi Network's price hovers between 34 and 36 cents, showing slight stability despite a turbulent market. The coin recently faced a dip, experiencing over a 24% drop in the last week and over a 65% decrease in six months. However, its Relative Strength Index suggests it's not oversold. If the price pushes past the near resistance at 37 cents, it could aim for 39 cents, marking an increase of about 8%. Nevertheless, the coin finds immediate support at 33 cents. It trades above its simple moving averages, indicating potential support for gradual growth if market sentiment improves. The Pi Network community remains hopeful that stability will usher in an upward trend. Uniswap (UNI) Eyes Rebound Despite Recent Dip Source: tradingview Uniswap (UNI) has recently been trading between $8.82 and $9.52. The coin has faced some challenges, with its price dropping about 18% over the last week and nearly 24% in the past month. However, it still shows a positive trend over the last six months with an increase of 28%. Currently, the nearest resistance level is just shy of $10, while support holds around $8.57. If momentum gathers, UNI might aim for the second resistance level at $10.68, marking a potential growth of around 15% from its current highs. Investors are watching closely, as this could set the stage for a significant rally if the market sentiment improves. Conclusion The market shows signs of a downward trend, but opportunities remain. ENA, PI, and UNI are strong candidates for investment. These altcoins offer potential for growth as market conditions improve. Investing in them now could be beneficial when the market rebounds.

Despite the dip, certain cryptocurrencies are poised for significant growth this year. Discover which coins are set to rise and could potentially deliver big gains amidst the volatility. This article will uncover the digital assets to watch closely. Sui (SUI) Shows Signs of Growth Potential After Recent Dip Source: tradingview Sui's price currently hovers between three dollars and nearly four dollars. Despite a recent one-week dip of almost twelve percent, the coin shows potential for growth. Sui has surged over thirty-six percent in the past six months. The nearest resistance level is four dollars and twenty cents, a level it could test soon. If momentum builds, it might reach the second resistance level of four dollars and seventy-one cents, indicating possible gains of over twenty percent from current levels. With its Relative Strength Index slightly above fifty, Sui seems balanced, suggesting steady investor interest. As Sui navigates these levels, it could offer intriguing growth in the coming weeks. Hedera (HBAR) Shows Resilience Amid Market Swings Source: tradingview Hedera's price hovers between 23-25 cents, teasing an upward shift. It's close to breaking a resistance barrier at 26 cents. If it breaches this level, it could touch 28 cents, marking a possible surge of over 10%. The currency shows strength, standing above key support at 22 cents despite recent dips. Over the past six months, its value boosted by over 27%, indicating solid ground for potential growth. However, in the last week, it's down by nearly 11%. The ten-day moving average sits at 21 cents, backing its steady path. Hedera's current resilience in volatile times suggests a promising outlook if it continues to push past resistance levels. FET Holding Steady with Eyes on a Breakout Source: tradingview The cryptocurrency Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is currently priced between 61 and 67 cents. Despite a dip over the past week, FET has shown promising growth over the last six months, increasing by over 23%. The coin is sitting near its 10-day and 100-day averages, suggesting stability. For growth potential, FET could climb past the nearby resistance of 71 cents and potentially reach up to 76 cents, marking a potential rise of around 13% from its current range. With indicators like the RSI and stochastic near a neutral mark of 52, FET is holding steady, hinting at a possible upward trend if demand picks up. POL (ex-MATIC) Finds Stability with Hope for Growth Source: tradingview POL's price currently dances between $0.23 and $0.27. It's holding ground above a solid support level at $0.21, with a chance to climb toward the nearest resistance at $0.29. Over the past six months, POL has seen over 9% growth, hinting at potential upward movement. If momentum builds, POL could target the second resistance at $0.33, marking a potential gain of more than 20% from current levels. The RSI is healthy at around 58, suggesting POL isn't overbought, while the moving averages show a stable trend. Traders are watching for signs of strength, eyeing gains in the coming weeks if the bulls take charge. Conclusion SUI, HBAR, FET, and POL stand out as coins with strong potential for gains this year. Investors should carefully monitor these assets. They have unique features and promising developments that could drive their value up. Keeping a close watch on their performance and updates could prove beneficial. Even as the market experiences declines, these coins are positioned to offer significant opportunities for growth.

Key Takeaways: Deutsche Bank says Bitcoin could sit alongside gold on central bank balance sheets by 2030. Trump‚Äôs strategic Bitcoin reserve plan is fueling renewed debate around institutional adoption. Bitcoin‚Äôs low correlation to traditional assets strengthens its case as a long-term store of value. The prediction comes amid a sharp uptick in geopolitical and monetary shifts, with Bitcoin and gold both seeing renewed demand. Deutsche Bank: Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve Plan Rekindles Central Bank Adoption Debate Marion Laboure, research analyst at Deutsche Bank‚Äôs Research Institute, said the Trump administration‚Äôs decision to create a US strategic Bitcoin reserve earlier this year ‚Äúreignites the argument for central banks to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset.‚Äù In a note seen by CNBC , she added: ‚ÄúWe conclude there is room for both gold and Bitcoin to coexist on central bank balance sheets by 2030.‚Äù The price of Bitcoin surged to over $124,000 last month before retreating, as traders digest U.S. monetary policy moves and brace for further volatility ahead of the 2026 election cycle. Meanwhile, gold has surged to a record high above $3,700 per ounce, pushing its market cap past $25 trillion. Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization currently stands above $2.3 trillion. The Trump administration‚Äôs March executive order calling for the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve marked a major policy shift. While details remain limited, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the government is committed to ‚Äúbudget-neutral pathways‚Äù to build the reserve. ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin that has been finally forfeited to the federal government is the foundation of the strategic Bitcoin reserve,‚Äù Bessent said. TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT SAYS THE U.S. WILL **NOT** BE BUYING ANY BITCOIN THEY WILL HOLD THE $15-$20 BILLION IN BITCOIN THEY ALREADY HAVE AND CONFISCATE MORE WEIRD, BECAUSE I WAS PROMISED A STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE MAKES SENSE WHY BO HINES RESIGNED NOW, EH? pic.twitter.com/MGu90xOBqZ ‚Äî Walker (@WalkerAmerica) August 14, 2025 The idea of adding Bitcoin to central bank reserves mirrors past strategies involving gold. A recent Federal Reserve research note highlighted that revaluing US gold holdings could increase their book value from $11 billion to $750 billion, a precedent that could be extended to crypto. Laboure noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs low correlation with traditional assets gives it similar store-of-value characteristics as gold, making it appealing to institutions. ‚ÄúBitcoin also has the potential to provide both an investment and a consumer-good value,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúThis explains why when equities rally strongly, their correlation to Bitcoin can rise.‚Äù Hex Trust CEO: US Banks Will Soon Offer Bitcoin Services Hex Trust CEO Alessio Quaglini believes US banks are on the verge of mainstreaming Bitcoin , pending regulatory clarity. He predicts that within months, most American banks will offer custody, trading, and deposit services for Bitcoin, calling U.S. regulation the ‚Äúglobal benchmark‚Äù for institutional adoption. Founded in 2018, Hex Trust provides crypto custody, trading, lending, and staking services to institutions across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. With over 200 employees and a million end users via B2B deals, the firm is targeting $20 million in revenue by 2025 and considering a future IPO. Quaglini also sees stablecoins as a disruptive force, potentially replacing the SWIFT system for cross-border payments. Unlike US-listed crypto companies that rely on retail trading, Hex Trust‚Äôs strategy focuses on providing infrastructure for institutions and avoiding direct exposure to crypto market volatility.

Yet even amid short-term volatility, a different conversation is gaining strength: which altcoins could realistically deliver exponential returns in the next few years. Analysts are increasingly pointing to a shortlist of names that combine strong ecosystems, active communities, and transformative narratives. These coins are not all the same, some are infrastructure giants gaining institutional traction, while others are speculative, meme-driven projects where retail enthusiasm has the power to ignite extraordinary multiples. What unites them is potential. In a market where Bitcoin captures headlines, altcoins often provide the asymmetric upside that smaller investors crave. Spotting the next 50x winner requires blending technical conviction with cultural awareness, and it requires entering early, before mainstream attention cements valuations. With that in mind, here are six altcoins drawing the most attention, and why MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a contender in this high-risk, high-reward category. Ethereum: The Institutional Backbone Ethereum continues to stand as the most credible infrastructure altcoin, now powering tokenization pilots, DeFi platforms, and institutional settlement trials. Its developer base remains the largest in the industry, and its narrative as the ‚Äúbackbone of Web3‚Äù is strengthening as Wall Street experiments with blockchain-based assets. For investors seeking 50x, Ethereum might not deliver such multiples alone, but projects building on it or connected to its ecosystem could. As the institutional layer, ETH provides the foundation on which smaller tokens can soar. Solana: High-Speed Growth Solana has captured headlines for its speed, scalability, and thriving developer culture. In the last day, trading desks have reported sharp increases in derivatives interest, highlighting its volatility and attraction as a high-beta play. Solana‚Äôs network hosts NFTs, DeFi, and meme tokens alike, giving it cultural and technical reach. If institutional adoption leans toward scalable alternatives, Solana could be the beneficiary, setting the stage for multiples that few other large-caps can offer. XRP: The Payments Edge XRP continues to carve its niche around cross-border settlement. With increasing clarity on its legal status and growing integrations with financial institutions, XRP has found stability amid uncertainty. For long-term investors, its positioning in the payments sector makes it one of the few altcoins with real-world utility already in motion. If adoption accelerates, the combination of liquidity and legitimacy could fuel returns well beyond current expectations. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Retail Wildcard Lists of potential 50x altcoins often include mid-caps like ADA or AVAX, but analysts increasingly add presales when discussing high-risk, high-reward bets. MAGACOIN FINANCE has appeared in multiple conversations as one of the few early-stage tokens where structure meets narrative. Projections highlight possible 1,700%‚Äì2,300% ROI if momentum scales through listings. Its presale design and cultural resonance set it apart from generic meme launches. Smart investors note that MAGACOIN FINANCE is echoing conditions that surrounded early DOGE and SHIB surges, albeit with a clearer framework. While it carries all the risks of speculative plays, its positioning in analyst shortlists underscores that even among dozens of presales, few stand out, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has. For those chasing the next 50x, it‚Äôs becoming a serious contender. Avalanche: The Scaling Contender Avalanche has maintained a steady presence as one of the most efficient Layer 1s. Its subnet model allows tailored blockchain ecosystems, appealing to enterprises and developers alike. Community trackers have noted a spike in user activity across DeFi applications built on Avalanche, suggesting steady adoption. For those hunting 50x opportunities, Avalanche represents a balance of infrastructure credibility with growth potential. Polygon: The Web3 Gateway Polygon continues to position itself as the go-to scaling solution for Ethereum. With partnerships spanning major brands and Web2 companies experimenting with Web3 integration, its adoption pipeline remains strong. Analysts suggest that while it may not explode overnight, its role as a bridge between traditional companies and blockchain ecosystems ensures steady, compounding relevance. Retail often underestimates Polygon‚Äôs ability to become the hidden beneficiary of mainstream onboarding. Retail vs. Institutional Strategies These six altcoins highlight the two sides of crypto investing. On one side, institutional money gravitates toward scalable, regulated infrastructure: Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Avalanche, and Polygon. On the other, retail communities chase meme culture and scarcity dynamics, gravitating toward tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Both paths can deliver outsized gains, but the multiples often belong to the speculative side. Investors who balance exposure across both categories maximize resilience while keeping optionality open. That balance reflects how smart money approaches portfolios: anchors in infrastructure, complemented by high-risk, high-reward bets. Conclusion The hunt for 50x returns defines every crypto cycle. While Bitcoin provides stability, it‚Äôs the altcoins that offer the explosive upside retail investors crave. Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Avalanche, and Polygon each provide strong narratives tied to adoption and institutional flows. Yet the most dramatic multiples may come from projects outside the mainstream spotlight. MAGACOIN FINANCE embodies that speculative edge, audited, scarcity-driven, and powered by viral growth. For retail investors searching for the next exponential story, it represents the bold complement to infrastructure anchors. The next few years may not just be about institutions; they may be defined by how retail continues to push culture into capital.

Since then, the altcoin has maintained a steady price consolidation around the $2.78-$2.79 region, without retesting the newly formed resistance level. Meanwhile, recent on-chain data has provided some cautionary market insights, highlighting a key support zone. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers Nearly $1 Billion In Liquidations As Bitcoin Extends Decline XRP Bulls Must Avoid Crash Below $2.73 ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why In an X post on September 27, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed the existence of a price gap sitting between the $2.73 and $2.51 price levels. Central to Martinez‚Äôs revelation is the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric, which specifies how much XRP was last transacted at different price levels, but in relation to its all-time high. As an extension of its primary function, the indicator quantifies trading activity across different price levels, therefore highlighting potential support and resistance zones. According to the chart shared by Martinez, there is considerable trading activity across several XRP‚Äôs price zones. However, there is a price range closest to its current value at $2.78, within which there has been very little trading activity. This price range, set between $2.51 and $2.73, comprises relatively less market activity, creating what Martinez describes as a price gap, where little support or resistance exists. The higher boundary of the price gap is at the $2.73 level, where about 1.60 billion XRP were transacted. A fall below this price floor would likely result in a straight decline towards $2.51, as any little support lies between both price regions. Notably, XRP last touched $2.51 in July.

XRP Price Outlook As of this writing, XRP is valued at about $2.78 despite a modest 0.78% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, the altcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume is down by 58.95% and valued at $3.02 billion. According to CoinCodex, XRP is currently facing bearish sentiment, with traders showing caution amid subdued market conditions. Meanwhile, the Fear and Greed Index sits at 33, signaling fear and a lack of strong buying momentum. Over the past 30 trading sessions, XRP has recorded 13 red days, underscoring the weakness in recent performance Despite this, price predictions suggest little volatility ahead, with no significant change expected in the next five days or over the coming month. This indicates that XRP may remain range-bound as investors await clearer market signals or catalysts. With sentiment leaning negative, short-term traders may exercise caution, while long-term holders continue to monitor for potential shifts in broader crypto market dynamics.

52379800,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84560,1759053655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Retail Chatter Explodes Around the Next Big Crypto to Hit $1 Before DOGE and SHIB, Is MUTM the Name?",https://timestabloid.com/retail-chatter-explodes-around-the-next-big-crypto-to-hit-1/,"The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with activity, leaving many investors wondering what is going on with crypto today. Amid this backdrop, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a standout opportunity, offering a unique dual-lending model that combines P2C pools for stablecoins and major tokens with P2P markets for niche assets. The platform is designed to appeal to both retail participants and larger institutional actors, but its user-centric features, including a fully interactive dashboard and the Top-50 leaderboard, are set to drive a wave of retail adoption unlike anything seen in recent cycles. The dashboard allows users to track ROI, view holdings, and calculate yields, while the leaderboard rewards the largest depositors with bonus MUTM tokens, creating an engaging, gamified experience that encourages competition and inflows. Retail-Focused Mechanics Driving MUTM Adoption One of the key features attracting retail interest is Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) for stablecoin pairs. This mechanism allows everyday users to borrow more effectively within safe corridors, unlocking higher yields without increasing systemic risk. By enabling small and medium users to leverage their collateral efficiently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ensures that retail participants can generate meaningful returns on their deposits, creating a feedback loop where borrowing and lending activity supports token demand. Another major retail driver is the buy-and-distribute mechanism. Protocol revenue will be allocated to purchase MUTM on open markets and distribute rewards to mtToken stakers. Retail investors will observe this cycle as tangible proof of the platform‚Äôs commitment to supporting token value, reinforcing confidence in MUTM. As fees flow into buybacks and staking rewards, demand for MUTM will grow naturally, translating protocol activity into measurable token appreciation for everyday users. Layer-2 integration will further accelerate adoption by keeping transaction costs low and throughput high. The beta launch will provide retail users with near-feeless transactions, encouraging hands-on testing of the platform‚Äôs functionality. Early adopters will be able to experience yield generation and staking rewards firsthand, creating social proof that spreads rapidly across crypto communities. Finally, the platform‚Äôs liquidation mechanics are designed to protect small users. Clear loan-to-value ratios, transparent triggers, and treasury-backed insurance reserves reduce the risk of cascade liquidations, giving retail investors confidence that they can safely participate without fear of sudden losses. These risk management features combine with the user-friendly interface to make MUTM particularly appealing for first-time participants in crypto investing. Presale Momentum and Path to $1 Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is currently priced at $0.035, with approximately $16.4 million raised and 16,600+ holders participating. Half of the 170 million token allocation for this phase has already been claimed. The project is backed by a CertiK audit, with TokenScan scoring 90 and Skynet 79. Additional incentives include a $50,000 bug bounty and a $100,000 giveaway distributed to ten winners. Phase 7 will step the price up to $0.040, a 15% increase, highlighting the urgency for retail participants to secure entry at discounted pricing. The $1 target represents a 29X multiple from the current $0.035 price. The path to this milestone is structured and retail-driven. First, the beta launch at listing will allow early users to test the platform and verify yields, creating word-of-mouth momentum across social channels. Layer-2 efficiency will ensure low transaction costs, allowing thousands of small deposits to accumulate into a substantial total value locked, which in turn supports fee generation and buyback budgets. For example, a $1,000 allocation at Phase 6 will generate 28,600 MUTM tokens, which would be worth $28,600 once the token reaches $1. This demonstrates the tangible upside for retail investors who engage early and participate actively in platform mechanisms. The timeline for retail adoption is clear: beta launch creates hands-on experience, social channels amplify awareness, expected Tier-1 listings provide liquidity and accessibility, and the convergence of these factors drives the token toward the $1 target over the next 12 months. Phase 6 is already half sold, and the jump to $0.040 in Phase 7 underscores the need for immediate action. For retail investors looking to capitalize on crypto predictions and participate in a gamified, yield-driven ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a compelling opportunity to engage in crypto investing before DOGE and SHIB capture broader market attention. Early entry ensures participation in the buyback and staking cycles, creating consistent demand and positioning MUTM for a rapid ascent to $1.

John‚Äôs update , accompanied by fresh statistics, reveals just how concentrated XRP ownership is and how modest holdings compare against the wider base of accounts. Distribution of XRP Holdings According to the data shared, the top 0.01% of accounts hold at least 5.7 million XRP. To enter the top 0.1%, an account must have 369,080 XRP, while the 0.2% threshold is set at 200,099 XRP. The concentration becomes clearer when examining 0.5%, which is holding 100,000 XRP or more. Squire pointed out that entering the top 1% requires holding 50,637 XRP, a number far lower than many casual observers might expect. Moving to broader participation, the top 2% of accounts hold 25,639 XRP or more, while just 2,486 XRP is needed to be counted within the top 10%. This illustrates that even a relatively modest holding places investors well ahead of the majority of accounts in the ecosystem . Fresh $XRP Rich List Update Holding just 2,500 #XRP puts you in the TOP 10%. Stack 50,650 XRP and you‚Äôre in the elite 1%. Still think you‚Äôre ‚Äúfar from the goal‚Äù? Maybe you‚Äôre already miles ahead of 99%. pic.twitter.com/ticXio13SP ‚Äî John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 27, 2025 Commentary from the Community The update has generated strong interest among XRP supporters. One user, Contrarian DNA, emphasized that the significance of these figures is not in being classified as a large holder but in recognizing the broader financial implications of holding XRP. According to his perspective, a few thousand tokens represent a strategic position in what he described as foundational infrastructure designed to handle global settlement flows. He emphasized that the focus should not be on being in the top 1% of holders but rather on owning part of the top 1% of financial infrastructure. Another community member, JO, added that many people underestimate how little it actually takes to rank among the upper levels of XRP holders. He noted that even moderate holdings can place investors far ahead of most participants, suggesting that the perception of holding hundreds of thousands of tokens for significance is misplaced. XRP Accessibility and Market Positioning Squire‚Äôs data reinforces the concentration of XRP ownership and highlights the opportunity available to smaller retail investors. Being in the top 10% requires far less than many anticipate, and entering the top 1% requires holdings that are attainable for a segment of the community. This distribution indicates the asymmetric potential of XRP, as even relatively small allocations can carry substantial weight when compared to the majority of accounts. For those tracking XRP‚Äôs role in global settlement and cross-border transactions, these figures provide context for its adoption curve. The numbers suggest that early positioning does not necessarily demand outsized investment, making it accessible for participants who view XRP as a long-term part of the financial system.

Key Takeaways: Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a record $795.6 million in outflows last week, led by heavy redemptions from Fidelity‚Äôs FETH. ETH briefly dipped below $4,000, triggering the worst two-day outflow stretch since mid-August. Bitcoin ETFs also logged $902.5 million in weekly outflows, though BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT continued to hold the largest market share. According to data from SoSoValue , spot Ethereum ETFs posted $795.6 million in net outflows for the week ending September 26, narrowly surpassing the previous record of $787.7 million set earlier this month. The sell-off came amid elevated trading volumes, which topped $10 billion across the funds. Fidelity‚Äôs FETH Leads $800M Ethereum ETF Exodus The heaviest withdrawals hit BlackRock‚Äôs flagship ETHA fund and Fidelity‚Äôs FETH. ETHA, the largest Ethereum ETF by assets under management, lost over $200 million but still retains more than $15.2 billion in total assets. Meanwhile, FETH saw more than $362 million in outflows, leading the weekly slide. ETH prices briefly fell below $4,000 on Thursday and Friday, sparking two consecutive days of $250 million in redemptions from Ethereum funds, the worst 48-hour span since mid-August. Analysts attributed the sharp drop to a mix of technical pressure, broader economic uncertainty, and leveraged positions being liquidated. Ethereum has since recovered slightly and was trading near $4,020 as of Saturday. During the trading week of September 22 to 26 (ET), Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net outflows of $903 million, ending a four-week streak of inflows. Ethereum spot ETFs recorded net outflows of $796 million, with all nine funds posting redemptions. https://t.co/YcNXWVZGwE pic.twitter.com/Mgwh2QKKtr ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 28, 2025 Bitcoin ETFs also posted major outflows for the same week, with a total of $902.5 million leaving the funds. Friday alone saw $418.3 million in withdrawals, the highest single-day number in more than a month. As with Ethereum, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT fund weathered the storm better than rivals. IBIT lost just $37.3 million on Friday, while Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC saw over $300 million pulled in a single day. Despite the recent volatility, BlackRock‚Äôs bitcoin product continues to grow its dominance. Data indicates that IBIT has held as much as 80% of the market share among spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, unlike several competitors, BlackRock has yet to file for a spot Solana ETF. Solana ETF Filings Signal Institutional Momentum Several top asset managers, including Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Bitwise, have submitted updated S-1 filings for spot Solana ETFs, some with staking features. ETF analyst Nate Geraci expects the US SEC could approve them by mid-October , calling it a pivotal month for digital asset products. The filings follow the recent launch of the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange, which drew $12 million in first-day inflows. Analysts say Solana is quickly becoming the next altcoin favored by institutions, with strong inflows also reported in Europe-based Solana ETPs. Geraci and others believe the inclusion of staking language in these filings could pave the way for long-awaited spot Ethereum ETFs with staking capabilities. Meanwhile, Bitcoin exchange-traded products now hold over 1.47 million BTC , representing around 7% of the total supply, with U.S.-based ETFs dominating the landscape. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT leads with 746,810 BTC, followed by Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC at nearly 199,500 BTC, according to data from HODL15Capital.

Will there be another volatile week on the horizon? Can XRP recover some of the losses, or will it continue its downfall? Here‚Äôs what three of the most popular AI chatbots had to say. The Week Ahead for XRP September is almost over, and although it started on a positive note, it has been mostly downhill for most of the cryptocurrency market in the past ten days or so. XRP, for example, stood close to $3.20 during its monthly peak after the US Fed reduced the key interest rates for the first time in 2025. However, it failed there and quickly retested the $3 support, which actually didn‚Äôt put up much of a fight. The bears kept the pressure on, and once it cracked, XRP experienced another leg down that drove it to $2.70. This level holds significant importance in determining the asset‚Äôs future price trajectory, as many analysts believe XRP can quickly rebound as long as it remains above it. When we asked the 3 AIs (ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini) about their take on what the next week holds for XRP, OpenAI‚Äôs solution answered in a somewhat worrisome manner. It noted that the asset is a ‚Äústrong sell‚Äù on multiple websites, such as investing.com, due to the current technical setup. Grok agreed with the analysts cited above that as long as XRP holds above $2.70, the bulls might remain calm. However, it also noted that the asset needs to quickly reclaim the $2.83 resistance if it wants to challenge $3 next. Gemini said the current trading volume doesn‚Äôt support a big move upward, and it warned that a break above the coveted $3 line seems unlikely at the moment. Something for the Bulls? All three AIs agreed that after such a volatile and violent trading week, a period of consolidation is to be expected. As such, they noted that Ripple‚Äôs token is likely to remain sideways at around $2.7-$2.9 for the next week (maybe even a bit longer). However, they also admitted that one major announcement, such as a positive macro event or an approval of spot XRP ETFs in the US, could send the underlying asset flying. Recall that there are over a dozen Ripple ETF filings sitting on the SEC‚Äôs desk and most of their deadlines are set for October.

52379990,https://cryptonews.com/?p=429526,1759053939,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52379990.jpeg,"Jump‚Äôs Firedancer Proposes Removing Solana‚Äôs Fixed Block Limits, Scaling with Validator Power",https://cryptonews.com/news/jumps-firedancer-proposes-removing-solanas-fixed-block-limits-scaling-with-validator-power/,"Jump Trading‚Äôs Firedancer team has proposed eliminating Solana‚Äôs fixed compute unit block limits, allowing validators to dynamically scale transaction capacity based on their hardware performance rather than arbitrary protocol restrictions. The SIMD-0370 proposal would create market-driven incentives where block producers continuously upgrade equipment to pack more transactions and earn higher revenues. Jump‚Äôs Firedancer team proposed SIMD-0370 to remove Solana‚Äôs fixed compute unit block limit after Alpenglow. Instead of a static cap (60M CUs, rising to 100M in SIMD-0286), block producers pack max transactions, and slower validators skip blocks. This drives a cycle: producers‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 28, 2025 The proposal follows Solana‚Äôs overwhelmingly approved Alpenglow consensus upgrade , which received 99.60% validator support with 149.3 million SOL voting in favor. Alpenglow introduces skip-vote mechanisms that make fixed block limits redundant by automatically bypassing blocks that take too long to execute. Under the current system, network capacity is artificially constrained by compute unit limits rather than actual validator capabilities. Firedancer argues that this creates perverse incentives, where superior hardware provides no competitive advantage, thereby stifling innovation and network growth. However, despite its innovative sound, the proposal has sparked some community debate, with critics warning about potential centralization. They argued that validators with expensive hardware could dominate, while smaller operators struggle to keep pace. Others question compatibility with future multiple concurrent proposer designs that may require synchronized execution limits. Hardware Arms Race Could Transform Network Economics The proposal would create a competitive flywheel, where block producers must continuously improve their performance to maximize transaction fees and maintain their market share. Validators running slower client software would face reduced profitability, incentivizing rapid adoption of performance improvements across the ecosystem. Firedancer developers argue that superior validator clients would capture larger market shares as operators seek higher rewards. Source: GitHub This competition would drive faster innovation cycles compared to manual limit increases that require community consensus and lengthy implementation periods. The system relies on Stackelberg competition dynamics where block producers signal network capacity through slightly larger blocks, coordinating upgrades without explicit communication. Validators unable to process these larger blocks would skip them, creating natural feedback loops that prevent excessive block sizes from forming. Critics raise concerns about centralization pressures as geographic proximity to block producers provides execution advantages. Additionally, validators requiring expensive hardware upgrades to remain competitive could exclude smaller operators from the network entirely. Community members questioned whether new validators could sync from snapshots if block complexity increases rapidly. The proposal acknowledges these risks but argues that replay performance typically exceeds block production speed, maintaining reasonable barriers for network participation. Source: GitHub Technical Hurdles Challenge Implementation Timeline Being a new proposal, developer discussions have also revealed significant concerns about compatibility with future protocol upgrades, particularly multiple concurrent proposer architectures that may require block limits for asynchronous execution. The Firedancer team argues these features remain uncertain and should not constrain current improvements. Community feedback also highlighted potential failure modes during rapid capacity scaling, including scenarios where advancing execution speeds could push networks below critical vote thresholds. Some developers suggested epoch shortening as mitigation, though this approach carries additional complexity. The proposal requires careful coordination of timeout mechanisms across different validator implementations, as execution abortion methods vary significantly between clients. Current designs must ensure proper block dissemination through networking stacks without creating bottlenecks or propagation failures. Several validators expressed support for removing artificial constraints while demanding comprehensive testing frameworks before implementation. The timing coincides with pending Solana ETF approvals , as seven major asset managers filed updated S-1 forms with regulators in late September. Several Solana ETF proposals, some including staking, could receive approval from US regulators by mid-October. #Solana #ETFs https://t.co/EgFOZctq0x ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 27, 2025 ETF analyst Nate Geraci suggested approvals could arrive by mid-October, potentially driving institutional demand for SOL tokens. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF already launched with $33 million in trading volume and $12 million in first-day inflows, demonstrating growing institutional interest. Looking forward, the removal of compute limits will be a fundamental shift toward market-based capacity scaling, which contrasts with Ethereum‚Äôs fee auction model and Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed block sizes . Although new, a successful implementation could enhance Solana‚Äôs speed and make it retain its status as a high-performance blockchain, which Ethereum and BNB Chain have been threatening lately. However, implementation risks require careful management to preserve network stability, which is not yet guaranteed, based on the current state of the community discussion.

Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency. We think it‚Äôs going to be the biggest one by far. By far,‚Äù she said. According to the conversation, Cathie separated what she called ‚Äúcryptocurrencies‚Äù from ‚Äúcrypto assets,‚Äù and placed Bitcoin at the very center of her outlook. She described Bitcoin as a monetary system built on rules, where the supply is capped at 21 million units, with about 20 million already in circulation today. She then compared Bitcoin to stablecoins, calling them cryptocurrencies but explaining that they are tied to the U.S. dollar through collateral, mostly made up of Treasury securities. Cathie said stablecoins have found their place in DeFi because they can be used to earn income. Cathie outlines stablecoin adoption and peer-to-peer finance When asked why people in cities like London or New York would even need stablecoins when they can already move dollars or pounds easily, Cathie responded that there are two dominant players in the market. ‚ÄúTether is primarily outside the United States and outside Europe now after Mika‚Äîor do you call it Micah or Mika, I don‚Äôt know. The two have 90% of the market. Circle is quote unquote more regulatory compliant certainly in the United States. And there is a Euro version of USDC in Europe which has not taken off,‚Äù she said . Cathie admitted that stablecoins had taken some of the demand away from Bitcoin , something her earlier analysis did not expect. She went further to say the real change brought by crypto is the removal of middlemen in finance. She described traditional banking as full of ‚Äútoll takers‚Äù who charge high fees. ‚ÄúFor credit cards, it‚Äôs automatic 2.5% tax on each transaction,‚Äù she said, stressing that blockchain makes those fees fall. In her view, transaction costs could eventually go down to 1% or less, compared with as high as 25% for remittances in countries like Nigeria. Cathie added that those lending out stablecoins can earn higher returns than banks would ever allow, while borrowers too small for the traditional system are finally able to access loans. She also pointed out that DeFi‚Äôs transparency makes it safer in some cases. ‚ÄúAnyone who was on-chain, their collateral was wiped out right away, meaning the financial institutions got their money back. If you were in the opaque and very centralized FTX ecosystem, you lost all your money. So it actually was safer to be on chain than to be at FTX, which of course was a fraudulent company,‚Äù said Cathie. Cathie rejects Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin and lists her holdings When Wilfred Frost brought up Tom Lee‚Äôs belief that Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin, Cathie disagreed. ‚ÄúBitcoin serves three roles. It is the global monetary system rules-based quantity rule to be sure. It is also a technology‚Äîlayer one blockchain technology never been hacked. And it is the first of its kind in a new asset class. We wrote our first white paper on that in 2016,‚Äù she explained. Cathie did acknowledge Ethereum‚Äôs importance in DeFi. She described Ether as ‚Äúthe native currency in the DeFi ecosystem‚Äù and mentioned how fees are flowing to layer twos such as Coinbase‚Äôs Base and Robinhood‚Äôs planned system. She questioned whether the growing number of layer twos would end up competing and giving more power back to the base chain. She named her firm‚Äôs main holdings, which she said are public. ‚ÄúOf course we‚Äôve got Bitcoin now in our public funds. These trades are public. So I can tell you our exposures are Bitcoin, Ether. We‚Äôre finally able to get an acceptable from a regulator‚Äôs point of view way to play Ether and we chose BitMine immersion. And then Solana is the third one,‚Äù she said. Cathie explained that Solana exposure came through Breera Sports, linked to a Solana treasury supported by the UAE and the Middle East, where her mentor Arthur Laffer sits on the board. She called Hyperliquid the ‚Äúnew kid on the block‚Äù and compared it to Solana‚Äôs early stage, while also pointing to protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and Jito.
