Synthetix Coin price analysis shows an upward trend regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has increased to $1.14 in the last 24 hours. If the bullish momentum continues, the SNX price might retest resistance at the $1.27 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan‚Äôs SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $5.24 by 2030. Why is SNX up? The cryptocurrency market is in a bullish mode, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting positive sentiment as the SNX price increased to $1.14, gaining a massive 25.72% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.21 for the current year, which is still quite higher than the current Synthetix price. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2031. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level after 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts‚Äô price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don‚Äôt expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $5.24, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $5.24 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Source: Coinmarketcap Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3, as per historical SNX market data. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token‚Äôs price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and in July, the token peaked at $0.781. In August, SNX‚Äôs average price remained around $0.65, and at the start of September, it is trending near $0.67 as the current sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,SNX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-27 20:30:00

One expert noted that XRP has just printed a rare and bullish setup, with multiple chart indicators aligning in support of upward momentum. XRP Price Forms Rare Multi-Layered Bullish Setup According to crypto market expert Bobby A, XRP is in a rare market position, consolidating above key historical levels while preparing for a move that could lead to new all-time highs. He noted that different indicators are aligning in support of a possible uptrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Again? $10 Million Stock Buyback Sparks Fresh Price Hopes In a chart shared on X social media, Bobby explained that XRP‚Äôs market capitalization has been holding above its 2018 peak for more than 300 days, an uncommon show of strength amid the recent downturn. This long consolidation above a major resistance-turned support level suggests a massive build-up of energy before the next leg higher. He argues that this base formation signals a potentially explosive move to the upside, with the next market cap targets identified at $173 billion and a peak around $727 billion. On the price front, Bobby reveals that XRP has been forming a multi-month bullish flag pattern on its charts. He labels the critical support zones as ‚ÄúBase Camp 1‚Äù around $1.9 and ‚ÄúBase Camp 2‚Äù at $2.89‚Äîboth of which have been successfully defended. He further highlighted that the monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also positioning itself for one final push toward overbought territory, often a precursor to a sharp upward move. Based on his projections, XRP‚Äôs take profit zones sit between $5 and $13, levels that would mark fresh all-time highs. Bobby‚Äôs analysis highlights that XRP‚Äôs indicators are ‚Äúfiring on all cylinders,‚Äù with momentum across higher timeframes aligning for a potentially powerful surge. He further pointed out that Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), currently at 58.7%, is set to retrace toward the mid-to-low 40% zone soon. Such a move would enable altcoins like XRP to capture a larger market share, thereby reinforcing the likelihood of a bullish breakout. The analyst described this rare alignment as a generational setup that occurs only a few times in a decade. Bearish Divergence Sparks Short-Term XRP Sell-Off While XRP appears to be resisting the present market downturn, not all analysts share an immediate bullish sentiment. Crypto expert JD has warned about a Bearish Divergence forming on XRP‚Äôs weekly chart‚Äîa signal that has now played out as expected. As shown in the chart, while XRP‚Äôs price made higher highs, the RSI indicator printed lower highs, creating a textbook Bearish Divergence pattern. This divergence has already led to a sharp 27% correction from the $3.37 take profit level that JD had previously identified. According to him, many market participants are now questioning why XRP has been under pressure despite broader optimism. Related Reading: Hyperliquid‚Äôs Days Numbered? Expert Forecasts ‚ÄòPainful Death‚Äô JD argues that the Bearish Divergence was the clearest warning signal, and those who ignored it are now witnessing its full effect. He cautions that while XRP may still avoid a deeper breakdown into the ‚Äúgrey box‚Äù supply zone, the short-term trajectory remains bearish until momentum resets.

This week, a significant trend has emerged: a growing number of Solana (SOL) holders are diversifying into a new AI project, Ruvi AI (RUVI). This migration is putting a major spotlight on the newcomer, whose fast-paced presale, lucrative early bonuses, and explosive demand are creating a powerful wave of market-wide FOMO. This surge in attention is fueled by a presale that is performing at a truly historic level. Ruvi AI has officially stormed past the $4 million fundraising milestone, selling over 285 million tokens in a remarkably short period. Analysts are highlighting that this sales velocity is exceptionally rare, a feat typically seen only in projects that go on to become industry titans. The demand is so intense that after a rapid sell-out of Phase 2, Ruvi AI saw 20% of its Phase 3 supply claimed in just days , growing its global community to over 3,900 holders. Why Solana Holders Are Making the Move Solana investors are known for backing projects with strong technology and high growth potential. Their move into Ruvi AI signals a belief that it possesses these same qualities, but with the added advantage of a ground-floor entry point. While SOL has already delivered massive returns, its large market cap limits its potential for another 100x run. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, offers the perfect combination of a low-cap opportunity, the powerful AI narrative, and a clear mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . The project‚Äôs credibility has been a key factor in attracting this wave of savvy investors. A successful smart contract audit by CyberScope has verified its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap provides the transparency that today‚Äôs market demands. This combination of a powerful vision, verifiable security, and overwhelming demand is why Ruvi AI is capturing the attention of some of crypto‚Äôs most successful communities. The Super App Fueling the FOMO The engine driving Ruvi AI‚Äôs explosive growth is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is engineered to become an indispensable tool for content creators, which will in turn generate powerful, organic demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving users a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency and output. Urgent: A Guaranteed 40% Price Increase Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . With 20% of this stage already sold out at record speed, this ground-floor opportunity is rapidly closing. According to the project‚Äôs official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. The project‚Äôs VIP bonus structure is designed to maximize returns from this anticipated rally: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures deep liquidity upon launch, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway further rewards early supporters, strengthening its unstoppable momentum. The Next Big Opportunity Is Here The movement of Solana holders into Ruvi AI is a major vote of confidence. It shows that smart money is identifying this project as the next big opportunity. With its record-breaking presale, powerful utility, and incredible early bonuses, Ruvi AI is on a path to becoming one of this cycle‚Äôs biggest success stories. The time to join this movement is now.

Currently, the XRP and Solana ETFs appear to be next in line to hit the market, pending the approval of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On Thursday, September 25, Bitcoinist reported that the final spot XRP and Solana amendments are expected before the end of this week. As expected, many potential issuers have updated their applications to launch the Solana exchange-traded fund in the United States. Is SEC Approval For SOL ETF Inevitable? On Friday, September 26, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart shared on the social media platform X a bunch of updated applications for the spot Solana ETF prospectuses. According to the expert, this wave of amendments shows signs of movement between the issuers and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. These latest updates to the applications mean that the launch of a spot Solana ETF is closer than ever. As indicated by Bloomberg expert Eric Balchunas in response to Seyffart‚Äôs post on X, investors can begin the final countdown to the approval of these crypto-linked investment products. As earlier reported by Bitcoinist , ETF Store president Nate Geraci had already predicted that the final batch of amendments to the Solana ETF applications would come in before the close of this week. Geraci arrived at this conclusion after the SEC‚Äôs new generic listing standards resulted in the approval of the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF. These ‚Äúgeneric listing standards‚Äù opened a door for firms to be able to issue spot exchange-traded products besides Bitcoin and Ether. According to the SEC, exchanges will now be able to list qualifying crypto-linked ETFs without first submitting a proposed rule change (19b-4). Spot Solana ETF To Include Staking: Expert In a Friday post on X , Geraci also acknowledged the flurry of S-1 amendments for the spot Solana ETF applications. Some of the potential issuers with new updates to their filings include: Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, CoinShares, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, and Canary, according to the ETF Store.

Digital asset treasury (DAT) firms are publicly traded companies that raise capital to acquire and manage crypto on their balance sheets. In a Sept. 23 blog post and an accompanying thread on X, Watkins said DATs already hold roughly $105 billion in assets across bitcoin, ether and other majors, a scale that few market participants have fully considered. His core claim: a small number of these firms may mature into durable operators that help finance, govern and build within the networks whose tokens they hold. Beyond speculation Watkins said most attention has fixated on near-term trading dynamics ‚Äî premiums to net asset value, fundraising announcements and ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the next token‚Äù‚Äîwhich misses the larger arc. ‚ÄúWe imagine select DATs becoming for-profit, publicly traded counterparts to crypto foundations, but with broader mandates to deploy capital, operate businesses, and participate in governance,‚Äù he wrote. Because some DATs already control meaningful slices of token supply, their treasuries can be more than vaults; they can be policy and product levers inside ecosystems. He pointed to crypto-native examples where scale matters: on Solana, RPC providers and proprietary market makers that stake more SOL can improve transaction landing and spread capture; on Hyperliquid, front ends that stake more HYPE can lower user fees or increase take rates without raising costs. Access to large, permanent pools of native assets can help such businesses bootstrap and scale, he said. Programmable money, productive balance sheets Watkins contrasted these plays with MicroStrategy‚Äôs bitcoin-only strategy, which is largely about capital structure around a non-programmable asset. He went on to say that by comparison, tokens on smart contract platforms ‚Äî ETH, SOL, HYPE ‚Äî are programmable and can be put to work on-chain. DATs holding them can stake for fees, supply liquidity, lend, participate in governance and acquire ‚Äúecosystem primitives‚Äù such as validators, RPC nodes or indexers, turning treasuries into yield-generating balance sheets. Structurally, he likened winning DATs to a hybrid of familiar models: the permanent capital of closed-end funds and REITs, the balance-sheet orientation of banks, and the compounding ethos of Berkshire Hathaway. What makes them distinct, he said, is that returns accrue in crypto per share rather than via management fees, making the vehicles closer to pure plays on underlying networks than to traditional asset managers. He argued that tools like common equity, convertibles and preferreds give DATs flexible funding to expand balance sheets, while on-chain yields can help manage that funding over time. Winners‚Äîand risks Watkins cautioned that ‚Äúnot all DATs will make it.‚Äù He expects many first-generation vehicles‚Äîthose heavy on financial engineering and light on operating substance ‚Äî to fade as conditions normalize. As competition intensifies, he anticipates consolidation, experiments with more exotic financing and, at times, reckless balance-sheet moves if premiums flip to discounts and pressure builds. In his view, the survivors will be those that pair disciplined capital allocation with operating chops, recycling cash flows into token accumulation, product building and ecosystem expansion. ‚ÄúOver time, the best managed ones could evolve into the Berkshire Hathaways of their blockchains,‚Äù he wrote.",Markets|Digital Asset Treasury|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-27 21:22:48

After a 9% decline over the past week, the token trades at $0.00001176 , with its market capitalization holding steady at $6.93 billion. This figure aligns with both its fully diluted valuation and unlocked market cap, showing that nearly all tokens are circulating. Despite this, trading activity has slowed significantly, with 24-hour volume falling 42.47% to $110.6 million. The volume-to-market-cap ratio now stands at 1.68%, signaling subdued investor participation. Symmetrical Triangle Consolidation Since May, SHIB has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, a pattern often signaling an imminent breakout. At present, the token is testing a pivotal support level near $0.000011, which coincides with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement. This support has historically acted as a key pivot for price movements, making it a decisive point for the token‚Äôs next directional push. SHIB/USD daily price chart, Source: TradingView Failure to maintain this support could shift market sentiment toward bearish territory. A breakdown below $0.000011 may intensify selling pressure, with the next downside target around $0.000010. This level aligns with the broader ascending support trendline, suggesting buyers could lose control if the token dips further. Conversely, holding this support could pave the way for a rebound toward $0.000013, near the 50% Fibonacci retracement, representing potential upside of roughly 14% from current levels. Technical Indicators Show Mixed Signals SHIB/USD daily price chart, Source: TradingView The MACD line remains below its signal line, while the histogram sits in negative territory, indicating ongoing bearish momentum. Traders may interpret this as a sign of continued selling unless buyers step in to reverse the trend. Meanwhile, the RSI sits at 46.64, reflecting a near-neutral market. This level indicates neither extreme buying nor selling pressure, leaving room for movement in either direction. Liquidation Levels Highlight Balanced Pressure Source: Coinglass Analysis of SHIB‚Äôs liquidation heatmap reveals significant clusters around $0.000012 and $0.0000111. These green-yellow zones indicate concentrated leveraged positions, meaning that aggressive price movements could trigger cascading liquidations. Since liquidity pools are balanced on both sides, the token may continue range-bound trading until either buyers push above $0.000012 or sellers break below $0.0000111. SHIB Futures and Open Interest Source: Coinglass Shiba Inu futures open interest has eased after previous surges, dropping from highs of over $500 million to approximately $177 million. This decline signals lower speculative activity, reduced momentum, and a market in consolidation. Typically, contraction in open interest precedes sideways trading, as participants wait for stronger signals before initiating new positions. ETF Absence Highlights SHIB‚Äôs Limited Institutional Appeal Another factor affecting SHIB‚Äôs momentum is its absence from U.S. spot ETF filings. While rivals like Dogecoin and other meme coins have received multiple ETF proposals, SHIB has largely been ignored by prospective issuers. This indicates a diminishing perception of SHIB‚Äôs relevance among institutional investors, which could weigh on market sentiment.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-27 21:35:03

Regulators believe some investors may have profited from having prior, non-public knowledge of these crypto-treasury announcements, potentially violating fair disclosure rules. Possible Breach of Fair Disclosure Rules The investigation focuses on publicly traded digital asset treasury (DAT) firms, which are companies that declare plans to acquire capital and buy cryptocurrencies. More than 200 DATs went public this year, and some of them are currently in contact with regulators. Regulators identified ‚Äúsuspicious trading patterns‚Äù, including high trading volume spikes and sudden price rises in the days or hours before firms announced their crypto-buying plans. The actions suggest that at least some investors might have been profiting by trading on inside information. SEC officials have already cautioned several companies over potential Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) breaches, a provision requiring material, nonpublic information to be broadly disclosed rather than selectively. The financial watchdog is concerned that some were tipped about impending crypto buys and profited by selling the companies‚Äô stock ahead of the news release. Experts agree that these breaches put market value at risk and expose businesses to legal repercussions and reputational consequences. Even in the larger non-crypto financial market, the agency has never had such reservations about Reg FD violations. Therefore, this level of scrutiny raises the likelihood that crypto-treasury firms will face tighter restrictions in the near future. Corporate Crypto Boom Under the Microscope The investigation occurs against a backdrop of more businesses moving to adopt cryptocurrency. Early movers have already helped digital asset treasuries attract over $20 billion in venture capital this year, with more than $100 billion committed to crypto buying plans. Public firms now hold over 1 million BTC, valued at $113 billion, and 5.26 million ETH, worth $20.6 billion. Monthly DAT raises peaked at $6.2 billion in July, representing the highest single-month total ever recorded. Regulators now face the challenge of ensuring this growing trend does not open new avenues for insider trading and selective disclosure. Advocates argue that investment by corporate treasuries signals confidence in the long-term value of cryptocurrencies. However, there remain concerns over the pace at which companies disclose market information and raise funds, which could encourage selective disclosure, leaks, and manipulative trading. The SEC and FINRA have said that the crypto treasury boom must operate within existing securities laws and are moving proactively against suspicious patterns. If misconduct is uncovered, enforcement action could follow, setting a precedent for future regulation of corporate digital asset adoption.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin‚Äôs price is decreasing after a continued bearish wave observed over the current trading session. If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI‚Äôs price might plunge below the $7 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $36.22 level by 2027 and above $74.36 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a bearish phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are shedding value, and so is UNI. As sellers gained ground around $7.65, negative sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $17.16, while the average price is expected to be around $14.30. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $9 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $10 and $10.7; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2026. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it‚Äôs worth waiting, as the coin‚Äôs value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI‚Äôs price to reach $74.36 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

It quickly rose to $7.00 before reaching an all-time low of $1.03 (CoinGecko) or $0.4190 (CoinMarketCap) on the same day. UNI ended the year at $5.00 after a gradual recovery during the 2020 bull run. In 2021, UNI surged 400% in January to $20. By March, it hit $28; on May 3, it reached an all-time high (ATH) of $44.93. It ended the year near $18 after a significant decline. Throughout 2022, UNI continued to decline, dropping to around $5.5 by June as the bearish trend persisted. The crypto market rebounded in 2023, and UNI saw bullish momentum, peaking at $7.77 on December 28. UNI began 2024 on a downtrend, briefly recovering to $15 by March 6. After mid-May, it faced selling pressure, falling to $0.14 by July 31. It stabilized in August at around $5 and traded above $6 at the start of September. In October, UNI reached a peak of $8, and November saw a peak price of $13.58. In December, UNI soared to $18.60.

However, some bullish price action was observed in May, when UNI jumped to $7.5, and finally peaked at $11.74 in July. In August, UNI/USD reached a yearly high price of $12.31, while at the start of September, it is now trading near the $9.40 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Uniswap,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|UNI|TRADING|ETH|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|ARB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-27 22:00:00

Mutuum Finance is currently at presale phase 6 for $0.035 and is 50% sold out. The protocol has garnered over $16.4 million from over 16,600 holders already. Mutuum Finance will increase more than 7,250% because of its new double-lending model that unifies Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) models. This new system is about to unleash more efficient liquidity, grow yields, and invite retail and institutional investors, advantages which SHIB, despite all its goliath base, still lacks. As sentiment turns away from meme tokens to utility-based protocols, Mutuum Finance is at the forefront for investors on the prowl for horrifically high returns in the coming bull cycle. Shiba Inu Targets 250% Growth Shiba Inu (SHIB) is back in the center of the market with technical charts pointing towards a probable 250% surge, with key resistance levels nearing the $0.00003400 and $0.00006700 levels, as shown in the chart above. Price activity is showing a strong accumulation base near the $0.00001010 support level, and if SHIB manages to maintain this critical level, there are possibilities of bullish momentum building up. With capital still pouring in towards utility-based protocols over meme coins, Mutuum Finance is a high-upside bet in the ensuing market cycle. MUTM Presale Dominance Mutuum Finance has launched presale stage Six with the tokens valued at $0.035 after a 16.17% increase from the previous round. The demand is strong, with more than 16,600 investors and more than $16.4 million in total capital. As part of promoting security to be included in the platform, Mutuum Finance is announcing a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The bugs have been divided into four divisions to ensure that they are discovered and fixed to their full potential, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The system is based on disciplined collateral management of funds to safeguard the system and counterparties. It is managed through some collateral ratios, credit thresholds, and deposit ceilings. Building An Efficient Platform Efficiency is achieved through reducing Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, especially for overcollateralized credit. Reserve requirements are also a shock-absorber in the market, and excess reserves can be drawn upon for use in risk-absorbing activities for risky assets. The global vision of Mutuum Finance is to reboot the DeFi model on foundations of long-term sustainability, dependability, and usability. The project does not just provide a safe borrowing and lending facility but is also adding into the mix a new generation for decentralized finance to be made available to retail as well as institutional investors. In a bid to encourage early adoption as well as development of community, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway , contest where 10 winners will each get $10,000 in MUTM tokens. This is centered around the project‚Äôs dedication to empowering its supporters while raising funds and giving back in the market. Forget 250%, Mutuum Finance Could Surge 7,250% Shiba Inu‚Äôs possible 250% increase is impressive, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting itself up for something much more impactful. Already in Stage 6 of presale and 50% sold out at a mere $0.035, the project has raised over $16.4 million from over 16,600 investors. Its hybrid lending model of P2P and P2C models and its strong security architecture will provide long-term adoption, high returns, and scalable liquidity. With projections showing a probable 7,250% growth, MUTM is quickly becoming the investor favorite of the day for earning out-of-proportion gains beyond meme coin manias. Those who wish to be prepared for the next DeFi boom need to take action on their MUTM tokens now before the presale vanishes and the price soars.

That search is now leading them to Ruvi AI (RUVI), a newcomer whose record-breaking presale performance is drawing direct comparisons to Tron‚Äôs formative days. As its presale races ahead, experts are confidently predicting that Ruvi AI has the potential to create a new wave of crypto millionaires. This incredible forecast is backed by a presale that is performing at a truly historic level. Ruvi AI has officially soared past the $4 million fundraising milestone, with over 285 million tokens sold at a velocity that has left the market in awe. Analysts are highlighting that such rapid sales are exceptionally rare and are often the hallmark of projects that go on to become industry titans. The demand is undeniable; after a rapid sell-out of Phase 2, Ruvi AI saw 20% of its Phase 3 supply get claimed in just days , growing its global community to over 3,900 holders. Mirroring Tron‚Äôs Path to Success The comparison to Tron‚Äôs early success is not made lightly. Like TRX in its initial stages, Ruvi AI is capturing the market‚Äôs imagination with a powerful vision and overwhelming demand. However, Ruvi AI adds another potent ingredient to the mix: the red-hot AI narrative. Its mission is to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy , a tangible goal that provides a solid foundation for growth. This blend of historic demand, a low entry point, and a powerful, real-world use case is the formula that experts believe could make it a millionaire-maker project. The project‚Äôs credibility has been a key factor in attracting this unprecedented level of investment. A successful smart contract audit by CyberScope has verified its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap provides the transparency and legitimacy that serious investors demand. This combination of powerful fundamentals and verifiable security is what sets Ruvi AI apart as a top-tier opportunity. The Super App Fueling the Millionaire Forecast The engine driving Ruvi AI‚Äôs potential to create new millionaires is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is engineered to become an indispensable tool for content creators, which will in turn generate powerful, organic demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving users a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency and output. Urgent: A Guaranteed 40% Price Increase Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . With 20% of this stage already claimed at a record-breaking pace, this ground-floor opportunity is rapidly disappearing. According to the project‚Äôs official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. The project‚Äôs VIP bonus structure is designed to turn this opportunity into life-changing wealth: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000 , achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway further rewards early supporters, strengthening its unstoppable momentum. The Birth of a New Giant? As the presale continues its historic run, the market is witnessing something special. Ruvi AI is not just another altcoin; it is a project that is mirroring the early success of an industry giant and is on a trajectory to create significant wealth for its early supporters. The opportunity to be part of this journey is here, but it won‚Äôt last long.

52356127,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84520,1759010456,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top 3 ‚ÄúBuy the Dip‚Äù Strategies You Should Know,https://timestabloid.com/top-3-buy-the-dip-strategies-you-should-know/,"A sudden market pullback can feel chaotic: order books shift, sentiment sours, large liquidations cascade. But for those with a plan, dips aren‚Äôt disasters, they are windows for strategic entry. Over the last 12 hours, crypto markets faced another wave of selling pressure, triggering over $1 billion in liquidations as derivative positions unraveled and stop-losses cascaded across exchanges. This kind of volatility is the stage upon which ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù becomes more art than blind optimism. In this environment, having a disciplined approach is nonnegotiable. Not all dips are created equal. Whether you prefer precision entries with confirmation, smoother accumulation via layering, or aggressive bounce snipes in fast markets, each method has its place. And amid all that, there‚Äôs room for speculative optionality, which is where MAGACOIN FINANCE quietly enters your radar. Reversion entry after confirmation The safest dips to buy are those that flirt with established supports and then show signs of exhaustion. You wait for the price to approach a technical zone, whether trendline support, a long timeframe moving average, or historical demand region, and only enter after you see a reversal signal. That could be a strong wick rejection, a bullish engulfing candle, or divergence in RSI or MACD. High conviction comes when that turnaround is supported by rising volume: it suggests smart money is stepping in, not just noise. Because you‚Äôre letting the market reveal its bottom tendencies, you avoid ‚Äúcatching the falling knife.‚Äù The trade is backed by evidence. But it won‚Äôt always trigger: sometimes price breaks through, and your setup fails. In such cases, respect your stop just outside the support zone, and move on On-chain & market context signals Even the best dip strategy underperforms without contextual confirmation. As you scan opportunities, monitor key flows: exchange outflows (accumulation signals), whale transfers, and derivatives liquidation clusters. Recently, heavy liquidations revealed where weak hands were flushed and where resilient players might be stepping in. Combine that with sentiment indicators (fear extremes, social volume) and macro cues from equities and policy shifts. When technical setups and context align, your edge is stronger. It‚Äôs this alignment that separates a lucky entry from a repeatable method. Traders who only focus on charts often miss the behavioral layer: who is buying, who is selling, and whether the overall market environment supports risk-taking. Pairing charts with on-chain data and funding trends creates the discipline needed to avoid gambling in uncertainty. Where MAGACOIN FINANCE fits in Buy-the-dip strategies are everywhere right now, but the biggest question remains: which tokens can actually multiply? While most focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been positioned as a high-beta candidate with outsized upside. Analysts suggest presales like this often deliver dramatic moves when broader markets rebound, with projections floating around 48x multipliers under favorable conditions. The key is its scarcity model: each stage increases in price, forcing urgency among participants. Social engagement shows buyers treating it as a dip entry within the presale cycle itself. Instead of waiting for majors to recover, many are considering MAGACOIN FINANCE as the speculative dip play that could mirror the strategy, but with exponentially higher payoff potential. Layered accumulation strategy When volatility is prolonged, a layered approach becomes your shield. Divide your capital into several tranches and spread entries across dips that meet your criteria, bounce attempts around support, oversold signals, or structural consolidation zones. You‚Äôre not trying to pick a single bottom; you‚Äôre gradually building exposure across multiple points. This method buffers your average entry and guards against committing too early. If the downtrend continues, you still have ammo to deploy. If the bounce begins early, you‚Äôve already locked in part of your position. The key discipline is to never overextend: always leave reserve capital for deeper dips and stick to predetermined sizes per tranche. Many long-term investors, particularly those focused on Bitcoin or Ethereum, swear by this method. It avoids emotional overreactions and turns volatility into an ally. By spreading exposure, you trade stress for structure, and that structure compounds over cycles. Flash dip snipes in fast moves For more aggressive traders, the flash dip snipe is where speed and conviction collide. You scan markets for sharp intraday or intra-block dives, say, sudden 5‚Äì10% moves, and jolt in when reversal cues flash: a rapid wick, order book imbalance flip, or a strong counter volume bar. Your entry is triggered once price moves above the short-term high of that dip. These are adrenaline trades. You‚Äôre not aiming to ride the full rebound, just to catch the bounce. Because the environment is fast, you need tight stop rules and small exposure. Many of these trades reverse quickly; your win target should be modest, your risk control strict. Traders who succeed in this arena rely on preparation: alerts set, capital reserved, and execution automatic. Conclusion ‚ÄúBuy the dip‚Äù isn‚Äôt a single strategy, it‚Äôs a mindset that adapts to conditions. Confirmation entries offer safety and patience. Layering provides balance and risk control. Flash snipes deliver aggression and speed. Each method has a place, and combining them helps investors turn volatility into opportunity. And in this ecosystem of dip strategies, speculative presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE deserve a mention. Its scarcity-driven model, rapid community growth, and audit-backed credibility make it a presale that traders are treating as a dip opportunity in its own right. For investors balancing majors with speculative exposure, it represents the torque side of the portfolio, the piece designed to deliver multiples when markets recover.

The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $110,369 on Friday but failed to retain momentum, ultimately settling at $109,697. Bitcoin traders had reduced bullish positions, indicating mixed market signals ahead of Friday‚Äôs $22 billion monthly Bitcoin options expiry. BlackRock Files For New ETF BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, has registered a Delaware trust company for its new Bitcoin Premium Income ETF. The yield-generating product will use covered call options on BTC futures to collect premiums for regular distributions, trading potential upside for steady income. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called the new ETF a sequel to the $87 billion IBIT, noting that covered call options would provide a BTC yield through options premiums. ‚ÄúBlackRock registered the name iShares Bitcoin Premium ETF, filing coming soon. This is a covered call Bitcoin strategy to give BTC some yield. This will be a '33 Act spot product, sequel to the $87b.‚Äù Delaware trust registrations typically follow S-1 or 19b-4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to begin formal approval processes. The SEC has become increasingly open to crypto investment products under the Trump administration. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT ETF was launched in January 2024 and has registered over $60 billion in inflows. BlackRock Raises Bitcoin Exposure BlackRock‚Äôs global Allocation Fund increased its holdings in IBIT by over 38% during the second quarter, a September 26 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revealed. The fund held 1,000,808 IBIT shares valued at $66.4 million as of July 31. This represents a substantial increase from the 723,332 shares it held as of April 30. Year-over-year growth shows rising Bitcoin adoption within BlackRock‚Äôs portfolio management. IBIT currently represents 0.4% of the Global Allocation Fund‚Äôs $17.1 billion assets under management. This is a 62% increase from the 0.25% allocation during the first quarter. BlackRock has recommended a 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation as a ‚Äúreasonable range‚Äù in its model portfolio on February 28. The fund‚Äôs recent increases in allocations suggest it is moving towards the recommended exposure level through gradual accumulation. BlackRock‚Äôs Global Allocation Fund invests across US and international equities, debt securities, money market investments, and other short-term assets. Next Fed Chair Pick Could Be The Biggest Bull Catalyst Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz believes Bitcoin (BTC) could see a sharp rally if the next Federal Reserve Chair is exceptionally dovish. Speaking during an interview with Kyle Chasse, Novogratz stated, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the potential biggest bull catalyst for Bitcoin and the rest of crypto. Fed‚Äôs cutting when they shouldn‚Äôt be, and you put in a massive dove. Can Bitcoin get to $200K? Of course, it could because it becomes a whole new conversation if that happens.‚Äù However, Novogratz stated that while aggressive rate cuts will be bullish for crypto, they would come at a very steep cost, adding that he hoped they would not happen. ‚ÄúDo I want it to happen? No. Why? Because I kind of love America. It would be really shitty for America. He also stated that there was a real chance the Federal Reserve could lose its independence. Daleep Singh, vice chair and chief global economist at PGIM Fixed Income, echoes Novogratz‚Äôs views, stating, ‚ÄúThere's a very decent chance that the FOMC looks and acts quite differently after Powell‚Äôs term expires in May 2026. On a cyclical basis, I think the risks to the dollar are skewed to the downside.‚Äù Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) hopes for a recovery over the weekend faded as it lost momentum after briefly crossing $110,000 on Friday. The flagship cryptocurrency has endured a brutal week, struggling to recover after two separate crashes over the week took prices below key levels. BTC showed signs of a recovery on Wednesday but suffered a dramatic crash on Thursday, dropping nearly 4% to $109,035. It recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% to $109,697. However, BTC is back in the red, marginally down during the ongoing session. BTC‚Äôs drop to $109,000 on Thursday was its lowest level in three weeks and triggered over $275 million in liquidations, mostly of leveraged bullish positions. Friday‚Äôs options expiry has also failed to breathe life into price action so far, although that could change on Monday. Meanwhile, traders have been reducing their long positions, driving the long-to-short ratio to 1.7x, the lowest in over 30 days. However, BTC‚Äôs drop below $112,000 saw traders reverse course and add upward exposure, with the indicator slowly climbing towards 1.9x in favor of longs. Analysts fear bears could drag prices even lower, with the rebound quickly losing momentum. 10x Research head Markus Thielen stated, ‚ÄúThe bounce back from that dip quickly lost momentum, and with prices now hovering close to this level again, another wave of stop-loss selling could emerge. This comes at a time when many are positioned for a Q4 rally ‚Äî making the bigger surprise not a surge higher, but a correction instead.‚Äù BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.56% and settling at $115,314. The price faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $115,381. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rose 1.26% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,832. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $114,724. It recovered from this level to settle at $116,484, ultimately dropping 0.30% BTC reached an intraday high of $117,998 on Thursday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $117,117. The price lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.22% to $115,690. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend, with BTC registering a marginal increase on Saturday. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, dropping 0.41% to $115,282. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to an intraday low of $111,761 on Monday as bearish sentiment intensified. It recovered from this level to reclaim $112,000 and settle at $112,736. Buyers attempted a recovery on Tuesday as BTC reached an intraday high of $113,357. However, it failed to stay at this level and settled at $112,017, ultimately dropping 0.64%. The price fell to an intraday low of $111,066 on Wednesday as selling pressure intensified. Despite the bearish sentiment, it recovered to register a 1.19% increase and settle at $113,348. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, reaching an intraday high of $110,369 before settling at $109,697. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers struggle to keep it above the $109,000 mark.

The raise comes amid growing rumors that the exchange is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO). The funding round involved participation from several firms and investors, and did not have a lead investor. Kraken Raised $500M Ahead Of Potential IPO Kraken has raised $500 million at a $15 billion valuation as speculation about an initial public offering grows. The funding significantly strengthens the exchange‚Äôs financial position, and was first reported by a report in Fortune, which cited a source close to the negotiations. The report also stated that the funding round had no lead investor and was closed on Kraken‚Äôs terms. Participants in the funding round included venture capital firms, investment managers, and Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi, who invested through his Tribe Capital Fund. Sethi joined Kraken as co-CEO after co-founder Jesse Powell stepped down in 2022, following a federal investigation into his role at a Sacramento-based nonprofit. Powell had named Dave Ripley as his successor after stepping down. However, the exchange announced Sethi‚Äôs appointment as co-CEO last year. Sethi is responsible for Kraken‚Äôs growth over the past year. Paperwork Still Pending Kraken is yet to file any official paperwork for a public listing. However, several of the exchange‚Äôs actions are consistent with companies preparing for an IPO. However, it has yet to submit an S-1 registration statement to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The S-1 registration statement is a necessary step before any public offering in the US. Kraken is one of the oldest exchanges in the cryptocurrency market and was launched in 2013. The exchange ranks among the top 15 global cryptocurrency exchanges and processed around $1.9 billion in trading volume, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Crypto‚Äôs IPO Obsession Kraken‚Äôs public offering comes amid a surge of crypto firms becoming public. Gemini, the Winklevoss brothers-founded exchange, recently went public, and was 20 times oversubscribed during its Nasdaq debut. The exchange raised $425 million on its Nasdaq debut, and its market capitalization has ballooned to $2.8 billion since going public. Meanwhile, USDC issuer Circle completed a billion-dollar IPO in June, with its shares surging 167% on opening day. Blockchain-based lender Figure Technology Solutions also registered an impressive debut, with its market capitalization rising above $8 billion since going public. Crypto custodian BitGo has filed S-1 registration documents with the SEC. The company plans to list its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.

According to multiple reports , the firm is exploring a $15 billion to $20 billion equity raise that could value the company at about $500 billion if the deal is priced at the levels under discussion. Funding Targets And Valuation Based on reports, Tether is looking to sell roughly a 3% stake in the deal, which is how the $500 billion figure is being calculated. The plan, as reported, would involve new shares rather than existing owners selling down their holdings. The raise size under discussion ‚Äî $15‚Äì$20 billion ‚Äî would make this one of the largest private placements seen in the crypto sector. Tether‚Äôs Major Funding Round May Include SoftBank Group and Ark Investment Management According to @Bloomberg , @SoftBank_Group and Ark Investment Management are in talks to participate in a funding round of @Tether_to Holdings SA. The round could value Tether at as much as $500‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/gSmzdf2RJ0 ‚Äî ME (@MetaEraHK) September 26, 2025 Tether‚Äôs USDT token currently has a market cap roughly in the $170 billion to $175 billion range, highlighting why investors are watching the talks closely. The company has expanded its activities beyond issuing stablecoins and is said to be moving into areas such as cloud services, telecom and real estate investments. Potential Backers Join Talks Reports have disclosed that Ark Investment Management, led by Cathie Wood, and SoftBank are among the parties exploring a stake in the round. Cantor Fitzgerald is named as an adviser on the process. None of the interested firms, including Tether, has confirmed a final agreement publicly, and those discussions are described as early-stage. Why would big investors consider this? For one, Tether generates revenue from interest on its reserves, largely held in US Treasuries. One report said Tether made about $13.4 billion in profit last year from such returns. The company also serves roughly 500 million users worldwide, and USDT remains a major on-ramp between fiat currency and crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ether. Regulatory And Profit Details Past scrutiny over reserve disclosures and other controversies means any major investment will draw extra attention from regulators. Observers note that a lofty private valuation could amplify those concerns, especially as Tether moves toward broader business lines and prepares a US-focused stablecoin product reportedly called USAT. Cantor Fitzgerald‚Äôs role and the involvement of big-name investors would likely intensify the public and regulatory spotlight. Talks could still fall apart or change shape. Based on reports, the numbers are ambitious and represent the top end of what Tether is said to be seeking. Investors and regulators are watching closely as details emerge.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth¬†with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana‚Äôs (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.

His remarks come amid growing speculation about possible government involvement with Ripple and increased attention on upcoming regulatory decisions. Community Split on U.S. Government Role Earlier this week, Cryptoinsightuk launched a poll asking whether the U.S. government could eventually acquire a stake in Ripple or take control of part of the XRP escrow. The survey drew thousands of responses, revealing a divided community. Roughly 29.6% of participants believe such a move could occur before 2026, while 27.3% think it might happen during 2026. Another 12.2% expect it later, but the largest share, 30.9%, dismissed the possibility altogether. Analyst Points to October as a Key Month In a follow-up post, the analyst indicated that he sees October as potentially decisive for XRP . He outlined several developments that could take shape in the coming weeks, including the possible approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States and movement on the Clarity Act, a legislative effort aimed at establishing clearer rules for digital assets. I personally feel we are very close to some big news for $XRP . I think ETF in October, then clarity act and with that something big. Whether it‚Äôs the below or something else idk. Charts are kind of lining up for this too. I do think we see something like the below, but when‚Ä¶ https://t.co/loAhHMmOmX ‚Äî Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) September 26, 2025 He also noted the chance of government involvement with Ripple, highlighting past remarks from President Donald Trump, who in March stated that XRP would be among the digital assets held by the government. Some XRP supporters have since speculated that Ripple‚Äôs escrowed XRP could play a role in this plan, though discussion around the topic has lessened in recent weeks. The speculation coincides with the final stage of the XRP ETF approval process . Several issuers, including Grayscale , Bitwise, Canary, and Franklin, submitted their last amendments to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week. Bloomberg analysts currently estimate a 95% probability of approval before the end of the year. Final deadlines for these applications fall between October 10 and October 25. If approved, trading in spot XRP ETFs could begin within days, mirroring the rollout seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Interest Already Growing Even before spot products are introduced, institutional demand for XRP is increasing. The newly launched REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) recorded $37.7 million in natural volume on its first trading day, marking the strongest debut for any U.S. ETF in 2025. Additionally, CME Group‚Äôs XRP futures have crossed $1 billion in open interest, while futures-based XRP ETFs collectively manage more than $800 million in assets. Analysts suggest inflows could exceed $5 billion within weeks if spot ETFs begin trading. Industry figures such as Oliver Michel , CEO of Tokentus Investment AG, believe that altcoins, including XRP, may present the most significant growth potential following ETF approvals, projecting possible gains of up to fourfold. With XRP currently consolidating around the $3 mark, upcoming regulatory decisions and potential Ripple-related announcements may support the ‚Äúmajor news‚Äù that Cryptoinsightuk anticipates. While no official confirmation has been provided, the convergence of regulatory deadlines, institutional momentum, and persistent community speculation makes October an important month for XRP. Whether these expectations result in transformative news or not, the coming weeks are likely to shape the asset‚Äôs market outlook for the remainder of the year.

Analysts, traders, and even market reporters have highlighted its growing presence in discussions around institutional adoption. Its high throughput and fast settlement continue to attract speculation that it could one day sit alongside Ethereum as a backbone for tokenized assets, ETFs, and Wall Street-aligned products. The idea of ‚Äúinstitutional Solana‚Äù has been floated before, but the recent uptick in derivatives activity, chatter in financial media, and expansion of its developer ecosystem give the thesis renewed strength. But while Wall Street‚Äôs attention is notable, the retail side of the equation is unfolding on a different front. Communities are buzzing about alternative opportunities that mirror the spirit of early crypto adoption, projects where high risk pairs with high potential. It‚Äôs here that retail investors, less concerned with regulation and more with asymmetric payoff, are finding their voice. Within this dual narrative of institutional strength and retail speculation, MAGACOIN FINANCE surfaces as a name worth weaving into the broader conversation. Wall Street‚Äôs Growing Fascination with Solana Institutions are not blind to Solana‚Äôs unique structure. Its capacity to process thousands of transactions per second with low fees positions it as an attractive infrastructure layer for tokenization experiments. In recent sessions, derivatives markets tied to Solana have seen significant volume spikes, suggesting growing interest among hedge funds and structured product issuers. Even without confirmed ETF filings, the narrative of Solana as a candidate for Wall Street packaging has grown louder. Reports indicate investment firms are exploring structured notes and certificates linked to Solana exposure, treating it as a candidate for mainstream inclusion. As tokenization continues to make its way into financial discourse, Solana sits in a sweet spot: fast, efficient, and liquid. The psychological impact of this cannot be overstated. If Ethereum represented ‚ÄúWall Street‚Äôs first blockchain experiment,‚Äù Solana is increasingly seen as its potential sequel. Retail Investors Seek the Parallel Play While institutional desks debate whether Solana is ready for prime time, retail traders have taken a different route. They look for projects that carry the same ‚Äúearly cycle‚Äù characteristics Solana once had, community energy, meme-driven momentum, and rapid adoption in informal circles. In Telegram channels, X spaces, and Discord groups, the conversation is less about infrastructure readiness and more about narrative explosiveness. For them, the opportunity is not necessarily to front-run institutional desks, but to spot the altcoins and presales that thrive when community energy and scarcity combine. This divergence in focus has created a two-track market: Wall Street leaning into scalable infrastructure, and retail pouring into speculation that thrives on early entry. This split defines the current crypto environment. Both sides may ultimately converge, but for now, institutions and retail are marching to different drums. MAGACOIN FINANCE as Retail‚Äôs Opportunity Solana‚Äôs rising institutional adoption has sparked speculation that Wall Street might make it a major bet, but retail investors are still looking for hidden gems with stronger upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered that discussion as a project built for speculation yet structured for longevity. Analysts suggest potential 62x multipliers are within range if listing conditions align, far beyond what Solana could realistically offer in a single cycle. The branding has resonated with communities hungry for narrative tokens, while presale mechanics build scarcity at every stage. The comparison is striking: institutions may capture steady Solana growth, while retail could amplify gains with smaller presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. It‚Äôs this divergence, steady Wall Street bets versus retail multipliers, that makes MAGACOIN FINANCE a focal point in current discussions. Institutional Confidence vs. Retail FOMO The current landscape highlights a fascinating divergence: Wall Street seeks regulatory clarity, liquidity, and institutional wrappers, while retail gravitates toward hype cycles, memes, and community-driven narratives. Solana is increasingly painted as a long-term institutional bet, the kind that underpins structured products and ETF discussions. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE embodies the speculative, retail-driven culture, rapid community adoption, grassroots branding, and scarcity-led tokenomics. Both play vital roles in the crypto market‚Äôs evolution. One gives traditional finance a new tool; the other gives retail a chance to replicate early winners. For portfolio builders, the question isn‚Äôt either/or. It‚Äôs whether they want exposure to both worlds: the solidity of infrastructure adoption and the potential lightning strike of speculative presales. Conclusion Crypto markets are rarely singular in their direction. They expand by narratives running in parallel, infrastructure gaining Wall Street adoption, and retail energy chasing the next breakout. Solana may very well become the blockchain Wall Street leans on for tokenized products, ETF structures, and regulated exposure. At the same time, retail investors are not sitting idle; they are already hunting for speculative projects that can replicate early-cycle gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as one of those plays, audited, scarcity-driven, community-powered, and carrying ambitious upside projections. While Solana captures institutional credibility, MAGACOIN represents retail‚Äôs willingness to place bold bets. Both threads matter, and together they define the rhythm of today‚Äôs crypto market.

He noted that his attention remains on Bitcoin for the moment, but emphasized that XRP‚Äôs reaction during this period could determine his next move. In a recent post , he wrote, ‚Äútrying to work out where I‚Äôm going to bid XRP here,‚Äù making clear that timing is central to his strategy. Rather than rushing into a position, the analyst explained he wants to see whether XRP makes a decisive move to take liquidity. According to him, once he gets a clearer picture, he will update followers, showing his intent to wait for stronger confirmation before acting. Waiting for Confirmation The comments highlight a patient approach, as he stated that he will only buy more XRP if conditions become clearer. He acknowledged that he does not plan to force an entry at current levels, but is open to taking action when he sees a viable setup. His measured stance illustrates the caution many traders adopt when markets appear uncertain. Trying to work out where I‚Äôm going to bid $XRP here. I‚Äôm mainly watching this right now for $BTC and I want to see how $XRP reacts during this time / if we get this move to take the liquidity. As and when I get a clearer picture I‚Äôll let you know. If I don‚Äôt get any extra $XRP ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/eJWMq7tpgv ‚Äî Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) September 26, 2025 This perspective also places Bitcoin in an important role. The analyst specified that he is mainly watching Bitcoin at the moment, underlining how movements in the largest cryptocurrency continue to influence his outlook for XRP. While XRP has its own momentum, Bitcoin remains the wider market driver that can sway sentiment and price action. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price Direction Considerations In a follow-up exchange with community members, the analyst addressed possible ranges for XRP before any rebound. One user suggested that the asset may fall toward the $2 to $2.2 region. Cryptoinsightuk responded by acknowledging that he is eyeing $2.35, while also highlighting the risk that XRP could show strength against Bitcoin and mislead traders. This exchange gives more context to his earlier remarks. The $2.35 level appears to serve as a reference point for him, though he remains aware that market behavior does not always follow clean levels. By recognizing both downside possibilities and the chance of sudden relative strength, he shows an openness to different outcomes rather than committing to a single path. Balancing Patience and Readiness The overall message from the analyst‚Äôs posts is one of patience combined with readiness. He made clear that he will not bid for XRP without greater clarity, but left open the possibility of seizing the next available buying opportunity . With Bitcoin liquidity patterns still on his radar, XRP‚Äôs next decisive move may depend heavily on how Bitcoin trades in the near term. Until then, his updates suggest that followers can expect caution until stronger signals emerge. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This caused the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index to plunge by 16 points in a single day, sinking to 28 yesterday, its lowest level since March. At the time of writing, the index has recovered slightly to 33, but it still in the Fear zone. This may unsettle many investors, but history shows that fearful conditions may be blessings in disguise for Bitcoin investors. Related Reading: XRP Eyeing Explosive Move In Next Few Months, Research Shows Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Drops To 28 This week has been tough for many cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. Bitcoin, which started the week above $115,000, entered into an extended decline that saw it break below $110,000, which in turn led to liquidations of over $1 billion worth of positions across the industry. This move also saw Ethereum break below $4,000, alongside altcoins likes XRP, Solana extending to the downside. Taken together, these moves erased the cautious optimism of last week, when the index sat at a neutral level of 48. Instead, Bitcoin‚Äôs Fear and Greed Index fell to as low as 28, which is a dramatic 16 point plunge in a single day. This crash in the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index shows just how fast sentiment can reverse when important price thresholds fail to hold. However, while the fearful mood might appear to be a bearish hint, these conditions could be an opportunity for long-term traders. The Fear and Greed Index has historically been a contrarian indicator, with extreme fear levels typically appearing before significant rebounds. Earlier in March, when the index last reached similar depths, Bitcoin was trading at a relative low around $83,000. Today, even after breaking below 30 on the index again, Bitcoin is about $27,000 higher than it was in March. Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index. Source: Alternative.me Constructive Outlook For The Coming Weeks The broader takeaway from this sentiment shift is that the crypto market may be closer to its next recovery phase than many expect. The index‚Äôs slight rebound to 33 today from yesterday‚Äôs low of 28 shows that some traders are already positioning for a turnaround. For one, Bitcoin‚Äôs current prices could give savvy investors the chance to accumulate Bitcoin at discount prices. Bitcoin rarely sustains rallies in conditions of overwhelming greed. Instead, consolidations and corrections reset sentiment and make room for healthier growth. For instance, crypto analyst Michael Pizzino said in a post on X, that the most recent fear could be the turning point Bitcoin and crypto has been waiting for.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the new kid on the block is taking the top spot. Dubbed ‚ÄúADA 2.0‚Äù by several analysts, Mutuum Finance is capturing attention for its dual-lending architecture, combining Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) systems to maximize capital efficiency and returns. Priced at $0.035 in presale, the project is now at phase 6 which is 50% sold out. At presale, Mutuum Finance already has over $16.4 million. While ADA continues to battle through significant stages of resistance and meets slower momentum in prices, Mutuum‚Äôs value at an early stage and expectations for explosive growth have made it a solid hedge. Cardano is Struggling with Resistance While Investors Await Breakout Signal Cardano (ADA) remains in the conservative phase, trading at the $0.89 level while struggling to break past a significant resistance of $0.93, which must be overcome in order to develop a stronger bullish leg. The recent price action also hints at the chances of a short-term correction, and ADA can even pullback to the $0.80‚Äì$0.85 demand area before making another attempt at surging. These levels are still important for traders as it will take persistently active buying pressure above the resistance levels to set up ADA for a more powerful surge upwards. Until then, investors are observing the setup of ADA carefully for hints at the turn in momentum that will revive its next wave of bulls. Mutuum Finance Blows Up During Presale Mutuum Finance is providing investors an opportunity to be among the first to get into this project and buy tokens at a discount. $0.035 for each MUTM in phase 6 is a bargain. Presale has been a success, with more than $16.4 million raised and more than 16,600 token holders, proof of trust in the project. Mutuum Finance has introduced an official Bug Bounty Program on CertiK with a reward limit of $50,000 USDT. The program invites white-hat hackers, developers, and researchers to try the codebase for bugs. Bounties are paid on bugs of any severity level so that even minor-level bugs are rewarded. Mutuum Finance uses hybrid lending protocol borrowing from Peer-to-Contract (P2C) as well as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models for ultimate flexibility. The P2C model is employed for the acceptance of the contracts in such a manner so that it can monitor the market so that the interest rates can be fixed. It is designed in such a manner so that the investors will receive passive income and the lenders will lend at minimal interest rates and the contracts will automatically conduct the transaction. P2P model allows the lenders and borrowers to communicate directly with one another in real time. The model introduces the potential of lending riskier assets such as meme coins. In the quest for accuracy and up-to-date prices, Mutuum Finance is leveraging Chainlink oracles of top cap token price aggregators USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, combined feeds, and on-chain data feeds are being used in bear market protection. Strong foundation of accurate prices is being leveraged in collateral management, liquidation, and risk calculation for the stability and efficiency of the protocol irrespective of market conditions. Cardano‚Äôs consolidation has investors seeking better-upside options such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). At Phase 6 presale at $0.035, already 50% sold out, MUTM has already raised more than $16.4 million from 16,600+ investors. Its dual-lending P2P and P2C model and early-stage potential have made it the moniker ‚ÄúADA 2.0.‚Äù With solid growth projections, the time to snap up MUTM tokens before the presale ends is now.

Here‚Äôs the most important one so far ‚Äî how does it affect price? Network Activity On Decline As Price Rises In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, crypto pundit CryptoOnchain highlighted a growing negative divergence between Bitcoin‚Äôs price and the number of active addresses within the cryptocurrency‚Äôs network. The analyst‚Äôs report depended on the Bitcoin Active Addresses metric, which, as is apparent, tracks the number of unique wallet addresses participating in transactions on the network within a given period. The value of this metric reflects the amount of user activity or engagement of the crypto network. From the chart shared by CryptoOnchain, there is ‚Äúa clear negative divergence between Bitcoin‚Äôs price and the 14-day moving average of active addresses.‚Äù What this means is that the broader Bitcoin bull rally is happening against a backdrop of reduced network activity and user engagement. The on-chain analyst further explained that such divergence typically functions as an early warning or signal that the bullish momentum might be losing its strength. As the cryptocurrency thus loses its bullish momentum , the risk of the BTC price undergoing correctional activity may simultaneously increase. Aside from the risk of correction, there is also the possibility of the Bitcoin network activity falling even further. When this happens, demand for BTC could further weaken, which could temporarily translate to increased selling pressure. BTC Buyers On Binance Losing Against The Sellers In another post on CryptoQuant, online pundit Arab Chain published data from Binance showing that the net Buy-Side Pressure vs Bitcoin Price remained negative for most of the day. This means that more sell transactions have been executed compared to the buys on Binance over the past 24 hours. The crypto expert also explained that attempts by buyers to push Bitcoin‚Äôs price above $113,000 fell short, as Buy-Side Pressure on the world‚Äôs largest exchange by trading volume continued to lag within the negative territory.

The strength in LINKBTC is adding momentum, suggesting further pressure from the bulls. On the intraday chart, the $22 level is emerging as the next key bullish zone, while lower time frames remain the focus for spotting the next scalp opportunity. LINKBTC To Trigger A Reversal For Chainlink In an elaborate analysis, CryptoWzrd confirmed a strong bullish close for both the price of Chainlink and the LINK/BTC pairing. Notably, the LINK/BTC pair printed a powerful bullish daily candle, an event that coincided with a decrease in Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. This simultaneous action suggests that capital is rotating out of Bitcoin and into altcoins like LINK, providing significant underlying strength. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Triangle Setup Points To $100, Says Analyst The analyst believes that a key confirmation of a major reversal is near. Achieving just one more bullish daily close from the LINK/BTC pair would offer further bullish momentum, which would solidify the reversal. Such a development would significantly aid LINK in becoming more bullish from its present price location. Looking at the price structure, the analysis identifies $20 as the primary daily support level for Chainlink. The current setup, driven by the strength in the LINK/BTC pair, suggests that if a second consecutive bullish daily close occurs, it could spur a rapid V-shape recovery. This implies that the recent dip would be quickly and aggressively retraced. Should this V-shape recovery materialize, the immediate outlook points to a rally toward key resistance targets such as $25, followed by the more ambitious target of $30. Holding Key Resistance Zone Could Unlock Fresh Long Opportunities CryptoWzrd highlighted that both volatility and a strong underlying bullish bias characterized the intraday chart. A key takeaway is that a move above the $22 resistance level is an indicator of strength. Based on this impending move, the analyst stated his intention to look for a long position. Related Reading: Chainlink Bulls Eye $30 Target But Must First Overcome Crucial Resistance The analyst also outlined an alternate entry scenario that could present itself sooner. He suggested that if a bearish pullback were to occur from the current price location, followed immediately by a decisive bullish reversal, this reversal pattern could trigger an early long opportunity. Meanwhile, an immediate downside support level to watch is identified at $19.80. For the time being, the analyst is in a waiting period, as the current environment is ambiguous in terms of immediate entry. CryptoWzrd concluded that the next course of action is to wait for the market to further develop and produce chart formation that confirms the direction.

The selloff wiped out a huge chunk of market value in a single day, with the stock plunging roughly 87% on heavy volume. Company Announcement And Missing Details According to the firm‚Äôs press release , the plan was first disclosed in a filing that said the asset pool would emphasize ‚Äústability and transparency‚Äù and concentrate on major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The release also said more specifics ‚Äî including the pool‚Äôs size and allocation ‚Äî would be provided later, subject to regulatory and market conditions.

The initiative aims to‚Ä¶ ‚Äî stock setter (@MarcJacksonLA) September 26, 2025 Market Reaction And Price Moves On the day of the announcement, Smart Digital Group‚Äôs share price fell from levels near the prior close to intraday lows reported at about $1.63 to $1.88. The fall represented an 86‚Äì88% move in some reports, with many outlets using an 87% figure to sum up the drop. The company had been a hot name earlier this year ‚Äî one report shows a market cap around $364 million and a run that included a 123% jump over the prior six months ‚Äî but Friday‚Äôs session erased most of that gain. Trading desk sources and market coverage point to two big drivers: panic selling by retail holders and sharp re-pricing by short sellers. Price swings were extreme. Many investors said they had expected clearer rules about how corporate cash or balance-sheet assets would be used, and they did not get it. Regulatory And Analyst Concerns Based on reports, regulators have been watching trades tied to companies that announce crypto-treasury moves, and in this case the SEC and FINRA interest was mentioned in several stories. Analysts and commentators said the lack of disclosure was a red flag, noting that companies that have publicly moved into crypto in the past sometimes saw gains ‚Äî but only when management spelled out the guardrails and the source of funds. Some market watchers cautioned that the fall may include an element of overshoot. When confidence evaporates fast, prices can move past what fundamentals alone would justify. Other observers said the decision to shift part of a corporate balance sheet into volatile assets raises straightforward risks: accounting complexity, custody questions, and regulatory scrutiny.

Haider Rafique, global managing partner for government and investor relations at crypto exchange OKX, argues that concentrating large amounts of BTC on a government balance sheet could undermine Bitcoin‚Äôs core appeal as neutral, decentralized money. He posed a pointed question: ‚ÄúWhat happens in a few years if a new administration decides this was a bad idea?‚Äù Rafique added, ‚ÄúDespite recent bipartisan support for crypto, it is essential to remember that administrative policies can change quickly. As circumstances change over time, the concentration of large amounts of BTC on a country‚Äôs balance sheet could represent a liquidation risk.‚Äù Government Ownership Could Distort Markets Rafique warns that governments holding significant portions of the BTC supply would be able to manipulate prices by selling large amounts at once. Such a move could shock markets and undercut investor confidence in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs independence from state control. Germany‚Äôs sale of 50,000 BTC in 2024, which helped keep prices below $60,000, serves as an example of how government action can weigh on the market, Rafique said. Impact on the Dollar and Financial Markets Beyond crypto itself, a U.S. Bitcoin reserve could signal weakness in the dollar, which underpins global finance. Rafique warned that establishing a BTC reserve ‚Äúwould be a loss of confidence in the dollar.‚Äù He argued that building a strategic reserve would tell investors the U.S. currency cannot sustain its value solely on economic fundamentals. This could push investors to safe havens like gold or the Swiss franc while sparking sell-offs of riskier assets. Rafique predicted such a chain reaction could trigger cascading liquidations across financial markets, ending in a sharp downturn as participants respond to a seismic shift in global finance. Clashing with Bitcoin‚Äôs Original Ethos Bitcoin advocates have long promoted the idea of nation-state-level treasuries as a path to making the cryptocurrency the global reserve asset. However, critics warn that state-level control conflicts with Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized design. Centralized ownership could weaken its credibility as a currency that transcends politics and national boundaries. Timing and Strategy Questions Remain Some proponents argue a U.S. reserve would strengthen America‚Äôs monetary position and accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption as a unit of account. But others urge caution, citing political risk and the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Without clear rules for accumulation and liquidation, a government reserve could transform from a strategic asset into a destabilizing liability. As debate intensifies, policymakers face the challenge of integrating Bitcoin into national policy without compromising its foundational principles or global market stability.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-28 02:05:55

Since its launch in 2017, the network has expanded at an explosive pace, crossing 334.59 million total accounts and securing a position as one of the most heavily used blockchains in the digital asset space. This milestone doesn‚Äôt just mark growth; it underscores TRON‚Äôs ability to capture adoption at a global scale. Few projects in crypto have managed to sustain this kind of activity, yet TRON continues to prove its relevance as the backbone of a thriving digital economy. Daily USDT Transactions Keep TRON Ahead One of TRON‚Äôs biggest success stories is its role in stablecoin transfers, particularly Tether (USDT). On average, the network processes 2.36 million USDT transactions daily, according to CoinMarketCap data, with an eye-popping $22.55 billion in volume moving across its chain each day. This volume isn‚Äôt just speculative trading. It reflects real-world demand for fast, low-cost settlement. Cross-border payments, peer-to-peer transfers, and decentralized finance (DeFi) all rely on TRON‚Äôs infrastructure. The network has become the default highway for stablecoin activity, leaving competitors struggling to keep up. A recent community update highlighted this trend, showing how TRON dominates the market for stablecoin transfers Since its founding in 2017, #Tron has surpassed 334.59M accounts in just eight years. It currently processes an average of 2.36M $USDT transfers daily, with a daily $USDT transfer volume of $22.55B. https://t.co/m802HEOMBm pic.twitter.com/MU5i22TFoF ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 27, 2025 A Blockchain Built for Scale From the start, TRON positioned itself differently from other blockchains. Instead of chasing hype cycles, it focused on performance and adoption. That strategy is now paying dividends. The network consistently delivers high throughput, low fees, and reliability, three factors that matter most to users moving billions in stablecoins or interacting with decentralized applications (dApps). These advantages have made TRON not just a blockchain, but a backbone for developers and enterprises that require real scalability. Its energy-efficient consensus model and ability to process thousands of transactions per second have made it a preferred choice for projects that demand both speed and cost efficiency. Global Adoption and Real-World Utility TRON‚Äôs influence extends far beyond speculative trading. Today, it plays a critical role in cross-border remittances, digital commerce, and DeFi. With stablecoin transfers surging, TRON has essentially become a settlement layer for the new digital economy. The proof lies in adoption data. The more people and businesses interact with TRON, the more the network cements itself as a global standard. Each account added to the network signals trust in its ability to deliver fast and secure financial infrastructure. This expanding user base shows TRON is not just gaining traction, it has already achieved true global scale, as highlighted by recent metrics In only 8 years since launch, #TRON has grown into a network with over 334.59M total accounts Every single day, it handles around 2.36M USDT transactions, moving an incredible $22.55B in volume That‚Äôs not just adoption ‚Äî that‚Äôs global scale. https://t.co/ph2eLe5YUC ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/SnJpofDBHu ‚Äî H·ªìng Ng·ªçc | Ruby (@hongngo38104169) September 27, 2025 TRON in Numbers Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of TRON‚Äôs current standing: Total accounts: 334.59 million Average daily USDT transactions: 2.36 million Daily stablecoin volume: $22.55 billion Use cases: Cross-border payments, decentralized applications, remittances, DeFi These numbers represent more than growth, they show that TRON is no longer an ‚Äúemerging‚Äù blockchain. It‚Äôs a network that has already secured its place in global finance. Why TRON‚Äôs Growth Matters The blockchain space is crowded, but TRON‚Äôs trajectory sets it apart. Many projects promise scalability and adoption, yet few deliver consistent results. TRON‚Äôs eight-year journey is proof that real adoption comes from solving real problems. Its dominance in stablecoin transfers alone positions it as a central player in the future of digital payments. As businesses and individuals seek faster, cheaper ways to move money, TRON provides a proven infrastructure that can handle global demand. As TRON moves beyond its eighth year, the network is showing no signs of slowing down. With over 334 million accounts already established, TRON‚Äôs next phase will likely focus on deepening its role in DeFi, cross-border settlements, and enterprise adoption. Its continued expansion suggests a future where TRON is not just a blockchain but a core layer of global financial infrastructure. And with daily activity in the billions, that future is already taking shape. In less than a decade, TRON has transformed into one of the largest and most active blockchains in the world. Its record-breaking adoption, massive daily transaction volume, and role in powering stablecoin transfers set it apart as a true industry leader. The message is clear: TRON is not just participating in the blockchain revolution, it is helping to define it. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Zooming out into a larger timeframe shows the price structure on the weekly timeframe is pointing to an explosive breakout is in the making. Technical analysis shows that the meme coin, which has already shown it can deliver extraordinary rallies, is now sitting on a powder keg that will send it to new all-time highs. Particularly, technical projections indicate that if the current trend continues, Dogecoin could surge to $1.30. Related Reading: XRP Eyeing Explosive Move In Next Few Months, Research Shows Pattern Repetition Points To $1.3 Target The first interesting chart observation focuses on how Dogecoin rallies unfold in repeating waves of expansion. This analysis, which was posted on the social media platform X by Kamran Asghar, shows how Dogecoin has been following a repeating structure in the weekly candlestick timeframe chart. In late 2023, the Dogecoin price broke out of consolidation with a 300% surge, followed by another wave in 2024 that delivered a 500% rally from trendline support to resistance. Each cycle began with a bounce from the ascending white trendline shown on the weekly chart below, which has consistently acted as the backbone of Dogecoin‚Äôs long-term uptrend. Now, the pattern is setting up for what could be an 800% rally, highlighted in the green projection box on the chart below. This move, if completed, would see the Dogecoin price rallying past its current all-time high of $0.7316 and finally breaking above the $1 price level. Particularly, the projection puts Dogecoin rallying more than 800% to reach a price target around $1.30. Chart Image From X: Kamran Asghar Dogecoin Bullish Channel Still Intact Since 2021 Another technical analysis looks at a broader view of Dogecoin‚Äôs performance over the last four years. Price action on the weekly timeframe is plotted within a colored channel system, starting from the 2021 breakout, as shown in the chart below. The lower orange line has consistently acted as support, while the green midline has worked as a pivot point. Lastly, the upper blue line is serving as resistance. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.23, and this is just between the green midline and the orange support, meaning the bullish structure is still playing out. According to analyst KrissPax, who posted the technical analysis on the social media platform X, Dogecoin is still on track to keep moving to the upper band of the channel, which is marked in blue. Reaching this upper band would put the meme coin in the $0.70 to $1.00 range and retesting its all-time high in 2021. However, in this case, the first step would be to break above the green midline, which is currently around $0.4.

With scalability long viewed as ETH‚Äôs biggest hurdle, this fork represents a critical step toward unlocking its full potential as the world‚Äôs leading smart contract platform. Why This Fork Matters For Ethereum‚Äôs Long-Term Roadmap Leading smart contract platform, Ethereum, is set for another important milestone this November. Sequence has highlighted on X that the Fusaka upgrade is a foundational hard fork infrastructure designed to strengthen the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) while ensuring seamless compatibility for builders. This upgrade is engineered to abstract the blockchain complexity and deliver smoother authentication and user flows across the blockchain ecosystem. The best part is that Sequence is already ahead of the curve by having the tools and infrastructure that prepare developers for Fusaka‚Äôs impact today. While the Fusaka upgrade aims at strengthening the ETH ecosystem, Wendy J has noted that ETH has seen a notable price dip, as the SentientAGI GRID chat has flagged some activity behind the move. According to the AI platform, several 100,000 ETH transfers were recorded in the past 24 hours. Interestingly, this kind of large-scale transfer suggests that major holders are likely either profit-taking after the run-up or repositioning their capital.

Why This Correction Looks Healthy, Not Critical On the daily time frame, the recent correction in Ethereum has pushed the Relative Strength Index (RSI) into a critical oversold zone, a level we have not witnessed since the major accumulation phase back in July. BTCBlueWhale mentioned that there is nothing critical in this current correction. Meanwhile, back in July, ETH showed the same setup, and the price dipped into oversold territory, which retested the previous resistance level, and used that structure as a springboard for a massive rally. Currently, the daily chart is printing a very similar scenario with trading in a comparable accumulation zone and showing a clear resistance-to-support (R/S) flip, which is a classic sign of structure holding the price strong. Layering on top of that, the setup aligns almost perfectly with the PO3 strategy.",Ethereum|BTCBlueWhale|DeFi|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum ecosystem|Ethereum fusaka upgrade|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum Virtual Machine|ethusd|ETHUSDT|EVM|PO3|relative strength index|RSI|SentientAGI GRID|Sequence|Wendy J,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|FORKS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-28 03:00:45
52366422,https://nulltx.com/?p=152216,1759028630,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,World Liberty Executes First $WLFI Token Burn After Community Approval,https://nulltx.com/world-liberty-executes-first-wlfi-token-burn-after-community-approval/,"World Liberty Finance (@worldlibertyfi) has taken a decisive step to strengthen its token economy. Following community approval, the protocol completed its first-ever $WLFI burn. The move combined fee-based burns with open market buybacks, removing millions of tokens from circulation across Ethereum and BSC. Breaking Down the Numbers The process started with 3,109,320 $WLFI burned directly from protocol fees on Ethereum and BSC. That marked the first official burn under the new proposal. The team didn‚Äôt stop there. They also bought 3,814,095 $WLFI from the open market. Purchases were spread across three stablecoins: 401,165.93 $USD1 196,146.40 $USDC 201,026.75 $USDT All of those tokens have now been permanently removed from supply. According to data, $WLFI is trading around $0.2 with a market cap of $5.12B (CoinMarketCap). Daily volume sits near $346M, showing active interest as the burn takes hold. The Capital Pool Before the burn, World Liberty gathered capital through a mix of protocol fees and market operations. The team collected: 4.91M WLFI ($1.01M) $1.06M in fees across Solana, BSC, and Ethereum That combined pool created the base for their buyback campaign. With it, they went into the open market and repurchased 6.04M WLFI ($1.06M). The Final WLFI Burn As the repurchases were complete, the team carried out a sweeping burn. A total of 7.89M WLFI ($1.43M) were permanently destroyed across BSC and Ethereum. That figure includes both the fee-based burn and the tokens acquired on the open market. By eliminating them, World Liberty has directly reduced circulating supply, tightening long-term tokenomics. However, the process is not fully complete. 3.06M WLFI ($638K) remain unburned on Solana. The community is now watching closely to see when those tokens will also be removed. Strategic Impact This dual strategy, combining fee burns with open market buybacks, marks a key shift for World Liberty. Instead of relying on passive deflation through transaction fees, the protocol is actively using collected capital to repurchase and destroy tokens. The impact is twofold: 1. Immediate supply reduction. Tokens are permanently out of circulation, easing downward pressure. 2. Protocol value alignment. Fees collected by the system are redirected into strengthening $WLFI‚Äôs long-term position. This approach mirrors practices seen in traditional finance, where companies repurchase shares to support value for holders. In the crypto space, it reinforces the project‚Äôs commitment to token value capture. Why It Matters for Holders Token burns are often seen as bullish because they lower supply while demand remains constant or increases. In World Liberty‚Äôs case, the first burn shows clear intent: protocol growth should translate into value for $WLFI holders. Community members now anticipate the next phase, what will happen to the 3.06M WLFI sitting on Solana. If those tokens are eventually burned, the overall impact could be even greater. Market watchers are already noting increased activity. $WLFI‚Äôs 24-hour trading volume has held steady near $5.9M, while liquidity on BSC and Ethereum remains strong. Transparency and Key Wallets World Liberty has shared wallet addresses for public tracking: Ethereum: [0x5be9a4959308A0D0c7bC0870E319314d8D957dBB](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5be9a4959308A0D0c7bC0870E319314d8D957dBB) Ethereum: [0x407F66Afb4f9876637AcCC3246099a2f9705c178](https://etherscan.io/address/0x407F66Afb4f9876637AcCC3246099a2f9705c178) Solana: 2x6Uhxmaot1cpiRisNwUcaQFPJCryGE4aTdpTYhYLENS BSC: [0xA713fc94db054AA435AF4d9c66c3433dCA98559F](https://bscscan.com/address/0xA713fc94db054AA435AF4d9c66c3433dCA98559F) This open approach allows the community to independently verify the transactions and track progress. The first burn is more than a symbolic gesture. It sets a precedent for how World Liberty will handle value capture going forward. By tying protocol growth directly to deflationary mechanics, $WLFI has a clearer path to sustainable tokenomics. Still, questions remain. The Solana supply has yet to be addressed, and the market will be watching closely for any updates. If those tokens are burned, the total reduction could surpass 10M WLFI in just one round. For now, the message is clear: World Liberty is serious about strengthening $WLFI. Each burn reduces supply, each buyback shows confidence, and each update brings more eyes to the ecosystem. World Liberty‚Äôs first burn removed nearly 8M WLFI ($1.43M) from circulation across Ethereum and BSC. Backed by protocol fees and market buybacks, the move signals a stronger, more deflationary future for the token. With $WLFI trading near $0.2, a market cap of $5.12B, and liquidity across multiple chains, the protocol‚Äôs strategy may provide long-term benefits for holders. The only question left: when will Solana‚Äôs 3.06M WLFI be burned? Until then, the community will keep watching every wallet, every burn, and every step forward. World Liberty Financial has burned 3,109,320.66 $WLFI from protocol fees on Ethereum & BSC.

The answer may lie in three standout stories dominating headlines right now. First, the BullZilla presale September 2025 has taken the market by storm, racing through its stages every 48 hours or whenever $100,000 is raised. At the same time, Hedera and Stellar continue to push boundaries in blockchain scalability and cross-border payments, proving that big innovations aren‚Äôt limited to meme coins. Adding to the excitement, the global XRP community recently wrapped up XRP Seoul 2025, a landmark event where over 3,000 attendees unveiled groundbreaking advances in staking, tokenization, and real-world asset integration. This wider momentum is fueling renewed confidence across the altcoin sector, setting the stage for new investment opportunities in September 2025. Whether you‚Äôre seeking early-stage potential, long-term stability, or cutting-edge technology, this month presents a unique mix of opportunities. Below, we break down why BullZilla ($BZIL) , Hedera, and Stellar top the list of top crypto coins to invest in September 2025, with BullZilla‚Äôs explosive presale leading the narrative. BullZilla Presale September 2025: Early Entry Still Matters The BullZilla presale September 2025 is drawing investors with its dynamic pricing and rapid growth. The project is currently in Stage 4C, priced at $0.00009907, after raising over $670,000 and selling more than 29 billion tokens. Each new chapter brings a price hike, either every 48 hours or once another $100,000 is raised creating urgency for early participants. Key Bull Zilla metrics as of late September 2025: Current Stage: 4C ‚Äì Red Candle Buffet Current Price: $0.00009907 Presale Tally: Over $670,000 raised Token Holders: 2,000+ Projected Listing Price: $0.00527 These figures reflect a robust mutation mechanism, where scarcity increases over time thanks to the platform‚Äôs ‚ÄúRoar Burn,‚Äù destroying tokens at each milestone. Such mechanics have turned BullZilla new crypto investment opportunities into a focal point for short- and long-term investors alike. How to Join the BullZilla Presale: Visit the official BullZilla website. Connect a compatible crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask). Purchase using ETH, BNB, or USDT. Claim tokens after the presale concludes. Early participation remains critical, as each stage jump pushes the entry price higher, reinforcing BullZilla‚Äôs reputation as one of the top crypto coins to invest in September 2025. Hedera: Expanding Enterprise Adoption While BullZilla grabs presale headlines, Hedera (HBAR) continues to deliver on its enterprise-focused roadmap. Priced around $0.21 with a daily trading volume exceeding $308 million, Hedera is seeing steady adoption among major corporations seeking energy-efficient distributed ledger solutions. September 2025 has been particularly notable for Hedera‚Äôs partnerships in supply-chain tracking and decentralized identity management. These collaborations underscore why bullzilla vs Hedera Stellar analysis is resonating with investors looking to diversify. Hedera‚Äôs unique Hashgraph consensus offers high throughput and low latency, distinguishing it from traditional blockchains. This efficiency makes it a candidate for governments and global enterprises exploring tokenized real-world assets, one of the hottest trends emerging from events like XRP Seoul 2025. Investors evaluating the top crypto coins to invest in September 2025 view Hedera as a stable, long-term technology play, complementing the speculative growth of early-stage projects like BullZilla. Stellar: Cross-Border Payments in Focus Stellar (XLM) remains a pillar of the cross-border payments sector. As of late September 2025, Stellar trades near $0.35 with a 24-hour volume of $279 million, reflecting consistent network activity despite broader market volatility. This month, Stellar announced new integrations with regional banking systems in Southeast Asia, a move expected to expand its global footprint and transaction throughput. These real-world use cases give Stellar a unique advantage among the best cryptos. September 2025 BullZilla investors are also watching. Stellar‚Äôs development team continues to refine its Soroban smart-contract platform, enhancing its appeal to developers and fintech startups. For investors seeking a balance of established infrastructure and future growth, Stellar rounds out the trio of top crypto coins to invest in September 2025. Conclusion: Diversification for September 2025 The BullZilla presale September 2025 is clearly the headline story, offering early investors a chance to secure tokens before subsequent stage hikes. Its combination of scarcity mechanisms and community-driven growth puts it at the forefront of speculative opportunities this month. However, Hedera and Stellar demonstrate why diversification remains a smart strategy. Hedera‚Äôs enterprise-grade DLT and Stellar‚Äôs cross-border payments network provide technological depth and long-term relevance that complement BullZilla‚Äôs explosive presale energy. For investors seeking to capture both immediate and sustained value, a portfolio combining BullZilla‚Äôs early presale join in 2025 with selective positions in Hedera and Stellar stands out as one of the most compelling plays among the top crypto coins to invest in September 2025.

Here‚Äôs What to Expect,https://timestabloid.com/big-liquidation-cluster-for-xrp-at-2-20-2-40-heres-what-to-expect/,"XRP continues to navigate a turbulent trading environment, and the latest liquidity heatmap offers an important signal for market participants. According to Steph Is Crypto, a prominent analyst, there is a big liquidation cluster between $2.2 and $2.4, an area where a large concentration of orders sits. Liquidity maps are used to track concentrations of pending buy and sell orders. Areas where orders accumulate often act as magnets for price, as traders anticipate movement into those zones. When the price approaches these clusters, it can trigger swift reactions , either from liquidations or fresh positioning. Big liquidation cluster for #XRP at $2.20-$2.40 Max pain could hit before new highs! pic.twitter.com/8Z18EsQSEh ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 26, 2025 The Meaning of the Cluster The presence of heavy liquidity between $2.2 and $2.4 signals a potential stress point. If XRP tests that level, it could flush out leveraged positions before stabilizing. The asset is currently struggling, trading at $2.78, after a 0.71% increase from yesterday, but it is still well below $3. Steph Is Crypto added that ‚ÄúMax pain could hit before new highs,‚Äù suggesting that the asset may need to undergo an even sharper correction before attempting another upward run. This view aligns with the principle that markets often seek liquidity before continuing in their prevailing direction. For traders, the highlighted range becomes a critical area to monitor. A move into this zone could confirm whether sellers still hold the upper hand or if strong demand emerges once orders are absorbed. Current Market Behavior The heatmap shows that XRP experienced notable swings in September, with the price fluctuating between $2.7 and $3.2. Despite attempts to establish momentum above $3, repeated rejections have kept the asset consolidating. The lack of follow-through suggests that deeper liquidity pools remain attractive targets for market movement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Should XRP continue to struggle at current levels, traders will pay closer attention to the $2.2 to $2.4 zone. If that range is reached, liquidation activity could intensify, creating sharp movements that influence broader market sentiment. Conversely, a strong defense of that level could present a lucrative buying opportunity and provide a foundation for renewed upward momentum. Outlook for Traders Market participants now face a period of heightened uncertainty. Liquidity heatmaps do not predict direction with certainty, but they identify areas where decisive moves are more likely. With XRP holding above $2.7 but showing signs of weakness, the possibility of a test near $2.2 to $2.4 remains significant. This liquidity cluster will be a key battleground for XRP. However, the potential breakout that comes from it could send the digital asset to new heights. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Its pullback also coincided with the recent crypto market crash that pushed most assets lower last week. Ether was trading at $4,000, down from the year-to-date high $4,920. So, will it rebound this week? Why Ethereum price has crashed ETH price has plunged in the past days as investors started to book profits after the recent surge that pushed it from a low of $1,380 to nearly $5,000. It is common for an asset, especially in the crypto industry, to retreat after going through a strong rally. The other main reason for the plunge is that demand from American investors has waned in the past few days. Data shows that these funds had outflows worth about $248 million on Friday last week. These funds shed a record $795 million in assets last week after they added $556 million in the previous week. BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA is still the biggest Ethereum ETF with over $15 billion in assets, while Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE has $4.26 billion. All Ethereum ETFs now hold about $26 billion in assets, equivalent to 5.37% of its market capitalization. The other main reason why Ethereum price has crashed is that no Ethereum Treasury company has made any major acquisition recently. Data shows that these companies now hold about 3.61 million ETH coins today, a level they have remained at in the past few weeks. Tom Lee‚Äôs BitMine Immersion now holds about 1.713 million coins worth $6.86 billion, with its last purchase being on August 28. SharpLink Gaming holds 797,704 coins worth about $3.19 billion. The other top companies that hold Ethereum are firms like BitDigital, Coinbase, and The Ether Machine. One reason for the sluggish growth is that demand for treasury companies among investors has faded in the past few months. For example, MSTR stock price has tumbled into a bear market while other Bitcoin treasury companies have had a worse performance. Ethereum price has also plunged because of the weakness of its ecosystem. Data shows that the total value locked (TVL) in its ecosystem has dropped by 12% in the last 30 days to $181 billion. The stablecoin supply in the network has dropped by 2.32% in the previous 7 days to $157 billion. ETH price technical analysis Ethereum price chart | Source: TradingView The daily timeframe chart shows that the Ethereum price peaked at a record high of $4,918 in late August and then pulled back to the current $4,000. Ether has moved below the important support level at $4,062, the highest point in December last year. The coin has moved slightly below the 50-day and 25-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). On the positive side, this pullback is part of the handle section of the cup-and-handle pattern that has been forming since November last year. Also, it bottomed at the Major S&R pivot point at $3,750. It is common for an asset to rebound whenever it hits this resistance point. Most importantly, it also formed a Harami candlestick, which happens when a bullish candle is fully enclosed inside a large bearish one. This pattern often leads to a rebound. Therefore, the coin will likely have a bullish reversal, with the next key resistance level to watch being at 4,900.

At the same time, a popular analyst outlined the next key support zone if the one DOGE is fighting for now cracks. A lot can change in the cryptocurrency markets in the span of just a couple of weeks, and this is particularly true for the ever-volatile meme coin niche. The leader spiked to $0.31 on September 14, which became a multi-month peak, and the community was excited about the prospect of another run toward $0.50. However, the tables quickly turned for the worse in the following two weeks, and DOGE plunged to $0.22 during this market-wide crash a few days back. As of press time, DOGE sits at just under $0.23, which is beneath the coveted $0.24 support line. If the asset fails to reclaim the latter, its next crucial support lies at $0.19, which could serve as the last line of defense before another plunge toward $0.15.

These large market participants that can impact the markets in a few different ways with their actions have started to dispose of DOGE tokens. According to Ali Martinez, they have sold off 40 million coins in just a day during the market-wide crash, which is in stark contrast to their buying wave earlier this week. Moreover, their holdings have dropped from over 11 billion tokens in mid-September to 10.75 billion as of now. 40 million Dogecoin $DOGE sold by whales in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/VpKLI2hm87 ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) September 27, 2025 The post DOGE Under Pressure: Whales Offload as Key Support Level Approaches appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|DOGEBTC|DOGEUSD|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-09-28 05:21:07

In contrast, other analysts remain optimistic about its future trajectory, outlining that Q4 and Q1 are just around the corner, periods that have been historically very bullish for ETH and other alts. Another $4K Rejection? Recall that the second-largest cryptocurrency stood tall above $4,700 just a couple of weeks ago. Although it started to slip in the following days, it still maintained the $4,500 level by last Monday when all hell broke loose. In the span of just an hour or so, ETH slumped by over $400 and dumped beneath $4,100. Following an unsuccessful recovery attempt that was quickly halted at $4,200, Ethereum dumped once again. This time, it was even more violent as the asset plummeted to a multi-month low of $3,830 (on Bitstamp). The bulls finally reminded of their presence at this point and didn‚Äôt allow a further breakdown. However, they seem to be lacking a lot of strength, as ETH has been unable to decisively overcome the critical resistance at $4,000. If the asset indeed fails to break past this level in the following few days, the danger of a price drop to $3,500 becomes even more likely, according to Martinez. Ethereum $ETH rejected at $4,000, raising the odds of a move to $3,500. https://t.co/xWK25UhOm2 pic.twitter.com/Jfb02IPZEn ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) September 27, 2025 The analyst also outlined the following support lines if $3,500 falls, which are set at $3,020 and $2,772. Crypto Rover warned that whales have been selling substantial portions of their ETH holdings, which could result in another price slip. Uptober to Save ETH? While the analysts above painted a grim picture for ETH‚Äôs future, Michael van de Poppe stood in the opposite corner. He relied on historical performance to demonstrate that Ethereum tends to rocket at the end of each year and the beginning of the next. The markets always have a correction in September / October. Historically, Q4 and Q1 are a great period for #Altcoins . September is a terrible month, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve seen with $ETH , it‚Äôs down nearly 10%.

The MSTR stock price has plunged to $300, down from the all-time high of $543. This article explores why these stocks have plummeted this year. Bitcoin treasury stocks have plummeted this year MSTR stock has plunged by about 31% from its highest level this year and is hovering at the lowest level since April. In Japan, the Metaplanet stock price has tumbled by over 73% from the highest point this year, erasing billions of dollars in value. Bullish, which launched a successful IPO this year and has 24,000 coins, has tumbled by 45% from the all-time high. Other top Bitcoin treasury stocks that have tumbled this year are companies like Donald Trump‚Äôs Trump Media, GameStop, KindlyMD, Gemini Space Station, and MicroCloud Hologram. These stocks have underperformed the performance of Bitcoin and the broader stock market this year as the top indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices have soared to their highest levels on record. Why BTC treasury companies are struggling The first reason why many Bitcoin treasury companies have tumbled is that BTC is not doing well and has moved into a correction after falling by 12% from its highest level this year. In most cases, these Bitcoin treasury companies do well when BTC price is rising and crash when the coin is falling. However, a closer look at most of these treasury companies shows that their stocks remained on edge even when Bitcoin price rose to a record high in August this year, a sign that there are more reasons why the crash is happening. One of the main reasons is that these companies are not attracting the premium they used to have a few months ago. A good example for this is Strategy, whose mNAV multiple has dropped to 1.2, down from the November high of 3.4. Metaplanet‚Äôs multiple has tumbled from 8 to 1.4 today. Worse, some companies are trading below their NAV multiple. KindlyMD, formerly known as Nakamoto Holdings, has an mNAV multiple of 0.686, while MicroCloud Hologram‚Äôs market cap has moved to 0.27. Investors prefer buying Bitcoin treasury companies when they are trading at a high premium because it magnifies their Bitcoin returns. A company with a higher premium also benefits from the ability to raise capital easily. For example, Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy has long had a policy of not raising capital by selling shares when the mNAV is below 2.5. It changed this policy recently and has continued to use its at-the market (ATM) shares to raise capital, leading to more divergence. Also, investors are getting more careful about valuations and their business models of just buying Bitcoin. For example, MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings are worth about $69 billion and its market capitalization is $90 billion, leaving a big unexplained gap worth about $30 billion. Focus on Bitcoin ETFs Another reason why Bitcoin treasury companies are underperforming the market is that investors are opting to buy ETFs instead. SoSoValue data shows that Bitcoin ETFs have added over $2.5 billion in inflows this month, bringing their total inflows to $56 billion and their assets at $143 billion. Additionally, the ongoing performance of Bitcoin treasury companies is because of the weak sentiment among investors. It is common for stocks in a single sector to either drop or rise concurrently.

However, the asset managed to remain above a key support level, which could send it flying toward its all-time high of over $124,000. Crash Won‚Äôt Stop BTC (For Now) When we zoom out for just a few more days, bitcoin‚Äôs price calamity becomes even more evident. The cryptocurrency challenged $118,000 on September 18, just after the US Federal Reserve cut the interest rates for the first time this year. However, it failed to reclaim that level and head toward $120,000. Just the opposite, it started to lose value gradually and retraced to $115,500 during the weekend. The actual pain, though, came at the start of the business week when the bears took complete control of the market and drove BTC south to $112,000 at first and then to its lowest price position since early September of under $109,000. Bitcoin tested that support on a couple of occasions, which managed to hold for now. According to Ali Martinez, the actual make-or-break level is at $107,200. If BTC remains above it, the chances for a solid rebound to $115,000 and even $123,000 are pretty high, he said.

He made these comments in a video shared on X by Jungle Inc (@jungleincxrp), who highlighted Schwartz‚Äôs focus on ‚ÄúSmart Escrows, light programmability: built natively into the XRP Ledger,‚Äù describing it as the next big thing. David breaks down why Smart Escrows, light programmability: built natively into the XRP Ledger, could be the next big thing. pic.twitter.com/yAscg5lStW ‚Äî Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) September 25, 2025 Expanding Core Financial Use Cases Schwartz explained that the XRPL was designed to handle specific financial applications through native features, such as decentralized exchanges, issued assets, and escrows. He believes these tools already cover the majority of needs in the financial sector, stating that developers can ‚Äúonly target something like the most valuable, most important sort of 80% of those use cases, which is great.‚Äù By leveraging these existing features, Schwartz noted that native transactors could implement much of the functionality required for applications like loans. This focus on practical solutions means the XRPL can succeed without overcomplicating its design. The Role of Smart Transactors While current tools address a large portion of financial activity, Schwartz emphasized the potential of smart transactors to extend the ledger‚Äôs capabilities. He suggested that programmability on the ledger could bridge the gap for use cases that require slightly more flexibility, while still avoiding the pitfalls of fully Turing-complete smart contracts. Schwartz described this approach as a way to capture additional value . He pointed out that ‚Äúsome very specific use cases‚Ä¶can probably only be done through a little bit of a smart contract,‚Äù making limited programmability a logical step forward. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Trustless Bridging as a Key Example A primary area Schwartz highlighted is interoperability, pointing to bridging as one of the most important examples where additional flexibility is needed. He explained that current smart transactors, lacking programmability, cannot fully support the requirements of bridging solutions, making light programmability a key step toward enabling trust-minimized interoperability. By integrating programmability, XRP could support trust-minimized bridging while maintaining its reputation for speed, security, and low fees. For Schwartz, this balance ensures the network can continue serving critical financial needs without replicating the design of other platforms. Maintaining Efficiency and Reliability David Schwartz emphasized that the XRP Ledger will not become ‚Äúanother Turing-complete Ethereum clone,‚Äù but instead evolve through enhancements that preserve its speed, security, and low costs. He argued that limited programmability delivers ‚Äúa lot of bang for the buck,‚Äù expanding the ledger‚Äôs flexibility without undermining its predictability. With smart escrows and programmability, Schwartz sees the network broadening its utility while maintaining efficiency, a vision that could enhance XRP‚Äôs role in institutional Decentralized Finance (DeFi) .

In a blog post , Watkins highlighted recent analysis pointing out that digital asset treasuries (DATs) collectively hold around $105 billion in assets. This includes Bitcoin, Ether, and other significant cryptocurrencies. Notably, DAT companies are publicly traded firms that raise funds to purchase and manage cryptocurrencies on their balance sheet. Concerning DAT‚Äôs recent asset holdings, Watkins asserted that most investors in the crypto market have not yet recognized this scaling. He, therefore, urged individuals to stay updated as he speculated that a few of these companies might turn into reliable operators who can support funding, govern, and develop within the networks of the tokens they possess. Watkins envisions crypto treasury firms becoming game changers in the blockchain ecosystem Earlier, Watkins analyzed the crypto market and discovered that most investors had mainly concentrated on short-term trading trends such as premiums over net asset value, updates on fundraising, and asked questions like ‚Äúwhat is the next token?‚Äù. According to him, this focus was all an overlook of a bigger picture. He emphasized, ‚ÄúWe envision certain DATs becoming for-profit public firms similar to crypto foundations but with broader objectives to invest capital, manage businesses, and participate in governance.‚Äù In the meantime, reliable sources revealed that some DATs already possess considerable portions of the token supply. This has enabled those firms to turn their treasuries into something more than just a storage, establishing them as tools for policy formulation and product development within the industry. Watkins expanded on the recent crypto analysis by emphasizing how scale plays a critical role in the industry. He cited Solana as an example, noting that RPC service providers and market makers who stake more SOL can enhance transaction throughput and profit from price discrepancies. Similarly, in the case of Hyperliquid, he explained that interfaces staking larger amounts of HYPE could lower user fees or boost earnings without incurring additional costs. Based on his argument, possessing significant, stable pools of native assets is important as it can help these businesses expand and thrive. To demonstrate their unique features, Watkins compared these approaches to Strategy‚Äôs emphasis on BTC, which is centered on managing capital for a non-programmable asset. Unlike this game plan, he explained that tokens on smart contract platforms such as HYPE, SOL, and ETH are programmable and can be utilized directly on the blockchain. Watkins compared successful DATs to the growth mindset adopted in Berkshire Hathaway Watkins also discovered that DATs holding HYPE, SOL, and ETH can earn fees by staking them, offering liquidity, lending them out, participating in governance, and gaining important ecosystem elements, such as validators, RPC nodes, or indexers. This is a game-changer for the companies as it turns their treasuries into sources of income. To further point out a crucial aspect of this strategy, Watkins structurally compared successful DATs to a collection of popular models. These factors integrate the permanent capital present in closed-end funds and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), the focus on balance sheets that is common among banks, and the growth mindset adopted in Berkshire Hathaway. According to him, what distinguishes them is that returns are generated from crypto per share, not management fees. This makes these investments more similar to direct bets on the underlying networks instead of adhering to the usual approach of asset managers. Get seen where it counts.

Ripple announced their collaboration on X: ‚ÄúRipple‚Äôs partnership with Ondo Finance to offer tokenized U.S. Treasuries on XRPL highlights blockchain‚Äôs role in bridging traditional finance with new technologies.‚Äù Infager says the initiative enhances liquidity and transaction speed In their press release, Ondo also claimed that the rollout puts OUSG on XRPL, giving institutional users access to a compliant, composable asset designed for finance. According to the company, the initiative creates new opportunities for institutional DeFi and better cash management, thus strengthening the bridge between TradFi and blockchain. Additionally, Ian De Bode, Chief Strategy Officer at Ondo Finance, commented on the initiative: ‚ÄúBringing OUSG to XRPL with RLUSD as a settlement option broadens access to high-quality, onchain financial instruments. This integration strengthens our commitment to providing reliable and institutional-grade assets at the intersection of traditional finance and DeFi.‚Äù Senior Vice President at RippleX, Markus Infanger, also explained that OUSG‚Äôs launch on XRPL demonstrates the growing maturity of tokenized finance and offers institutions a compliant way to hold Treasuries on-chain, improving liquidity and speed. So far, with over $1.3B in total value locked, Ondo Finance continues to set the pace in RWA tokenization. OUSG has even surpassed $690M in TVL , making it one of the biggest tokenized Treasury products on the market, ranking alongside similar products from BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Ripple hopes to make XRPL the main settlement network for tokenized assets Ripple wants XRPL to become the go-to settlement network for tokenized products. Its upgrades to liquidity, stablecoin systems, and programmability are meant to enhance institutional confidence and streamline asset management. Bringing tokenized U.S. Treasuries to XRPL showcases the firm‚Äôs commitment to its long-term strategy. Merging TradFi with blockchain also creates a secure, institution-ready ecosystem and positions XRPL as a cornerstone for institutional DeFi. With Ondo, Ripple is working to turn XRPL into a true powerhouse for real-world asset tokenization, giving institutions faster, safer transactions and smarter liquidity tools. This execution level reflects what Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov noted earlier this year, Ondo operates at a standard on par with the world‚Äôs top financial firms. Not to mention Ondo Finance is still offering over 100 U.S. stocks and ETFs with 24/7 onchain access on its Global Markets Platform. CEO Nathan Allman has consistently described Ondo Global Markets as a ‚Äúbreakthrough in financial access,‚Äù calling on investors to engage with the available stocks. As recently reported by Cryptopolitan , Ondo also intends to extend its tokenization efforts to additional blockchains such as BNB Chain, Solana, and Ondo Chain. Major crypto wallets, including OKX Wallet, Trust Wallet, MEXC, Bitget Wallet, Morpho, and Ledger support the initiative. In addition, the firm plans to bring more than 1,000 U.S.-listed securities on-chain, ranging from individual equities to fixed-income ETFs. According to Ondo, these tokenized assets will mirror the liquidity of their underlying securities, enabling instant, low-slippage trading. The firm is also partnering with the startup Block Street to enhance its offerings for tokenized real-world assets, bringing borrowing, shorting, and hedging at scale to DeFi.

Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the price of POL to surge toward $1.57. By 2031, we expect the POL price to record a maximum price of $13.01. Polygon, an Ethereum side chain and layer two scaling solution, has experienced substantial uptake by enterprises and industries in the last year. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, POL. This raises the question: Can POL‚Äôs price reach $10? This forecast for Polygon‚Äôs price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the POL price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polygon Ticker Symbol POL Rank 43 Current Price $0.224 Price change 24H -0.4% Market cap $2.15 Billion Circulating supply 10.44 Billion POL Trading volume 24h $101.67 Million (+9.5%) All-time high $1.29, March 14, 2024 All-time low $0.1533, April 7, 2025 POL price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.224 Price Prediction $‚ÄØ0.291471 (+6.49%) Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 6.22% Green Days 18/30 (60%) 50-Day SMA $‚ÄØ0.237588 200-Day SMA $‚ÄØ0.227463 14-Day RSI 63.64 Polygon technical analysis: POL price faces bearish pressure toward $0.224 POL price analysis shows a bearish pressure toward $0.224 Resistance for POL is present at $0.2299 Support for POL/USD is present at $0.2094 The POL price analysis for 28 September confirms that POL faces increasing volatility as it declines toward $0.224. Currently, the bulls are aiming for a recovery. POL price analysis 1-day chart: Polygon faces selling pressure toward $0.224 POL price is facing a decline as sellers push the price toward $0.224. POL price is aiming for a hold below the immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume declined toward $5.4 million, showing decreased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.224, declining over 0.4% in the last 24 hours. POLUSDT chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level but currently hovers around 35, showing that bears are aiming to control price momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. POL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA trend lines The 4-hour POL price chart suggests POL continues to experience bullish activity around EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart. As the price continues to face resistance near the Fib level, bears prepare for a domination by holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. POLUSDT chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.56, hinting that buyers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost an upward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening bullish positions.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the POL price from an immediate surge. However, if POL‚Äôs price successfully breaks above $0.2299, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.2535. POLUSDT chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, POL‚Äôs price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2094, resulting in a correction to $0.1904. Is POL a good investment? POL token can be a good investment option in the long run as the project develops a roadmap for its Polygon 2.0 version. Polygon collaborates with diverse industries to enhance adoption, focusing on NFT solutions and Ethereum scalability. Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is the POL price down today? Following overall buying demand in the market, POL price faced increased bullish pressure around the $0.25 level. However, lack of buying demand around higher levels resulted in a bearish pressure. What is the POL price prediction for 2025? The Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the POL price to record a maximum level of $1.57. Will POL price touch $1? Yes, POL price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2025. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will POL Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and POL gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is POL a good long-term investment? As Polygon continues to expand its offerings, it gains a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, POL can be a good long-term investment option. Recent news/ Opinions on POL The U.S. Department of Commerce published revised July 2025 GDP data, showing 3.3% annual growth, directly onto the Polygon PoS blockchain alongside eight other networks. This marks the first time federal economic statistics have been secured on-chain, highlighting Polygon‚Äôs role in the government‚Äôs landmark blockchain transparency initiative. POL price prediction September 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in September month. We expect POL to record a minimum price of $0.22 and a maximum price of $0.35, with an average of $0.27 in September. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction September 2025 $0.22 $0.27 $0.35 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That‚Äôs why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon‚Äôs Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.15. It‚Äôs anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

XRP Army Responds,https://timestabloid.com/top-trader-xrp-will-never-trade-below-2-5-again-xrp-army-responds/,"XRP has long been one of the most closely watched digital assets due to its unique position as a cryptocurrency focused on payment. Recent optimism in the market has led to renewed speculation about whether the token can sustain higher price levels as new developments shape its outlook. Crypto expert and enthusiast Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) recently responded to a bullish claim that Bitcoin would never trade below $100,000 again with a price statement of his own, writing, ‚ÄúXRP will never trade below $2.50 again.‚Äù The post quickly garnered engagement as users debated whether such a threshold was realistic given XRP‚Äôs historical price swings. XRP will never trade below $2.50 again. https://t.co/2g6DoD9lFd ‚Äî Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) September 26, 2025 XRP Army Debates Price Floor Many community members voiced their thoughts on Cobb‚Äôs $2.5 XRP price floor. Many commenters agreed with the assertion, as one user welcomed the possibility of such a floor, saying he expects it to happen. Some expressed skepticism, predicting that the price might fall to $2 instead. Some commenters took a cautious stance, with one expressing curiosity to see how market makers and large banks might react, and another remarking that $2.4 seemed like a more plausible floor. XRP‚Äôs price has struggled recently, going as low as $2.71 in early September . Despite this, many commenters still shared bullish expectations, as one user stated that the asset will only continue to rise. Reasons for Optimism Surrounding XRP XRP‚Äôs history has been marked by significant challenges that have limited its price potential in past years. The legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was a primary factor suppressing the asset‚Äôs price and investor confidence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For years, the legal battle dispute defined XRP‚Äôs market trajectory. Investors hesitated to commit to long-term positions due to regulatory concerns. The lack of clarity on its legal status prevented it from fully benefiting from the institutional interest that other major cryptocurrencies experienced during the same period. However, now that the lawsuit is over , institutions have increased their engagement with the asset, and the shift has renewed optimism among supporters. Market watchers now point to the prospect of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a sign of the asset‚Äôs maturing market presence. Such products could make it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly holding the cryptocurrency, and increase its prominence. XRP is currently trading at $2.78, and Cobb‚Äôs prediction reflects the optimism among many community members who believe the token‚Äôs days of trading below $2.50 are behind it.

If regulation shifts even a few degrees, the ripple effects could send some coins flying and others crashing. Here are 5 picks that stand out as promising in this volatile, policy-fueled moment. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) ‚Äì The Top Coin for Explosive Growth At the front of the pack is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a fresh meme coin that has quickly captured market attention. Unlike other chains, it is designed in a way that prevents sniper bots from working, giving early buyers a genuine advantage. This distinctive feature makes Little Pepe (LILPEPE) unique among the growing meme token market. Its presale has been a huge success, now in the thirteenth stage with tokens priced at $0.0022. The twelfth stage sold out earlier than planned, showing how demand is far outpacing expectations. Over $25.97 million has already been raised, and momentum is building daily. Experts who have guided some of the biggest meme projects in history are backing Little Pepe (LILPEPE), and its CoinMarketCap listing has only accelerated visibility. Analysts forecast that it could soar once new regulations are confirmed, especially as Trump's UK visit highlights the importance of transparency and innovation in crypto markets. Buying at presale prices gives investors the chance to get in early before potential listings on major exchanges send prices higher. To add to the excitement, the LILPEPE team has launched a mega giveaway for buyers between stages 12 and 17. The top buyer will win 5 ETH, the second 3 ETH, the third 2 ETH, and 15 random buyers will receive 0.5 ETH each. Its roadmap shows bold plans ahead, setting it up as one of the standout coins to buy during this period of regulatory focus. Ripple (XRP) ‚Äì Riding Institutional Momentum Ripple (XRP) is another strong contender, at $3.09 after surging more than 300% year-to-date. Regulatory clarity in the US and UK could directly benefit XRP thanks to its established role in cross-border payments. Market optimism surged again this week as Trump‚Äôs meetings sparked ETF speculation and boosted institutional inflows. With a 4.15% daily climb earlier this week, XRP shows how regulatory signals can move prices quickly. Solana (SOL) ‚Äì Strong Utility and Strategic Recognition Solana (SOL) is at about $247; it has jumped nearly 5% in the past 24 hours and over 10% in the past week, supported by almost $10 billion in trading volume. Its recognition by the US earlier this year as part of a ‚Äústrategic crypto reserve‚Äù positions SOL for potential policy advantages. As Trump‚Äôs discussions in the UK cover interoperability, Solana‚Äôs speed and scalability put it in a prime spot to benefit. Cardano (ADA) ‚Äì A Technical and Institutional Favorite Cardano (ADA) has been showing steady technical strength, currently trading near $0.93. It surged almost 7% in the last 24 hours, with volume surpassing $2.3 billion. Regulatory conversations have highlighted interoperability, and ADA‚Äôs inclusion in Grayscale‚Äôs Digital Large Cap Fund has opened more institutional doors. Its growing futures market interest shows traders are preparing for bigger moves ahead, making ADA a coin to watch as Trump‚Äôs visit brings rules back into the spotlight. TRON (TRX) ‚Äì Consistent Growth and High Liquidity TRON (TRX) remains a steady performer, with its price hovering around $0.3464 and daily trading volume close to $892 million. Recent adoption by the U.S. Department of Commerce and Justin Sun‚Äôs $200 million WLFI infusion in September have driven a 16% monthly surge. Combined with Trump‚Äôs advocacy for cross-border crypto cooperation, TRX is well-positioned to continue building momentum. Conclusion Trump‚Äôs UK visit is a catalyst for new conversations that could reshape global crypto regulations. While established coins like XRP, SOL, ADA, and TRX are positioned to benefit from regulatory clarity, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the standout star. Its presale strength, unique bot-resistant design, strong expert backing, and mega giveaway make it the most promising token right now.

These events bring critical discussions that could lead to regulatory adjustments, affecting cryptocurrencies differently. Stablecoin regulations might see new caps, prompting shifts in investment strategies, particularly for new and emerging coins. The Emerging Star: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) One coin that has been making waves is Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a new entrant in the meme coin space that has shown resilience against automated trading bots. This unique attribute has helped it in its presale success, already advancing to its thirteenth stage and raising significant funds. With each stage, like the recent twelfth, selling out swiftly, the market's enthusiasm is palpable. Industry experts back LILPEPE, predicting a price surge post-regulation. The presale offers a competitive edge, with lower entry prices before it hits major exchanges. Notably, a mega giveaway is attracting more attention, with prizes including Ethereum rewards for top buyers.

Solana (SOL) continues to draw attention with its significant trading volume and accolades such as being recognized by the US as part of a strategic crypto reserve. This could bolster its position with potential new policies. Cardano (ADA) has been a favorite due to its technical robustness and institutional interest, trading around $0.93 and expecting further movements driven by regulatory discussions. TRON (TRX) stays robust in the market, with a consistent price and high liquidity, further supported by recent large investments and endorsements. Conclusion The outcome of Trump's UK visit could be pivotal for the crypto market, particularly for the coins discussed. While established coins might benefit from clearer regulations, emerging tokens like Little Pepe (LILPEPE) present exciting opportunities for early investors.

President Peter Pellegrini gave the message during talks with the U.S. president in New York on September 23. Trump has been pressing the two remaining European Union holdouts, Hungary and Slovakia, to end imports of Russian crude. He argues this would cut Moscow‚Äôs war money and push Vladimir Putin to the table. Slovakia, a landlocked Eastern European country bordering Ukraine, resisted and cited limits on new routes and technical hurdles. Pellegrini said in a statement sent by his office on Saturday that Slovakia cannot replace Russian energy overnight. ‚ÄúIf change is to come in the coming years, it‚Äôs called diversification,‚Äù he told Trump during the meeting. He added, ‚ÄúSlovakia needs three, four, five different sources of gas and energy. We cannot replace dependence on Russia with dependence on the United States.‚Äù According to the same statement, Slovakia needs technical and logistical help before any major shift. Pellegrini described the meeting as constructive and said Trump ‚Äúhad a smile on his face, but he told me directly: do something about it.‚Äù Trump presses EU holdouts to end Russian oil imports While Pellegrini was delivering his position, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban also pushed back on Trump this week. Orban said giving up Russian oil and gas would ruin Hungary‚Äôs economy. Trump has not only pressed Hungary and Slovakia but also Turkey and India to stop buying oil from Russia. According to EU estimates in May, purchases from Russia now make up only 3% of EU crude oil imports compared with 27% before Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. Trump wants those last flows cut. The European Union is considering new trade measures aimed at the remaining Russian oil imports, Bloomberg reported on September 20. Bloomberg said the bloc‚Äôs executive arm is reviewing continued imports via the Druzhba pipeline, which feeds Hungary and Slovakia. If adopted, the measures would mostly hit those supplies unless they are phased out. Budapest and Bratislava have blocked earlier attempts, saying the moves threaten their energy security. EU weighs trade measures and new sanctions package The trade measures under review are separate from a new sanctions package the EU presented on Friday. That package includes a ban on Russian liquefied gas, starting with short-term contracts six months after entry into force and then extending to long-term deals from January 1, 2027. As part of the same plan, the EU proposed sanctions on more than 100 oil tankers in Moscow‚Äôs ‚Äúshadow fleet‚Äù and other actions targeting entities that enable the energy trade, including in third countries. EU ambassadors were briefed on the proposals on Friday, but no details on timing or scope were given. Unlike sanctions, which need unanimous backing of member states, trade measures like tariffs require only a majority of capitals. These measures would help the EU meet a key demand made by Trump as a condition for U.S. alignment on Russia sanctions. Trump has said the EU should stop all Russian oil and gas purchases. Nearly all member states have halted pipeline and seaborne imports, but Hungary and Slovakia are still taking supplies. Most other EU nations have committed to phase out Russian fossil fuels by the end of 2027. Trade measures could be used if Budapest and Bratislava do not present exit plans, people familiar with the matter said. The U.S. has also pressured its Group of Seven allies to impose tariffs as high as 100% on China and India for their Russian oil purchases to push Putin into talks with Ukraine. That request is expected to face resistance in EU capitals. G‚Äë7 officials are working on a new sanctions package and want to finalize the text later this month, Bloomberg has reported. Other planned EU measures would target major Russian oil firms and the networks and ships that move crude and generate profit for Moscow.

While big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to anchor portfolios, several other projects are positioning themselves as the proper growth plays. Among them is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , the so-called Shiba Inu killer, alongside strong contenders like Solana (SOL), Near Protocol (NEAR), Story (IP), and Fasttoken (FTN). Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Shiba Inu Killer With 100x Meme Potential Among the fresh entrants, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is stealing the spotlight as the popularly-proclaimed ‚ÄúShiba Inu Killer.‚Äù Unlike SHIB, which relies heavily on community buzz, Little Pepe is built on its own EVM-compatible Layer 2 blockchain. This means ultra-low fees, lightning-fast settlement, and built-in resistance to sniper bots, giving it both meme power and serious utility. Moreover, Little Pepe introduced the zero buy/sell taxes model, a launch hub called Pepe‚Äôs Pump Pad, ensuring a cheap and scalable hub for upcoming meme projects. This also makes it a sustainable project, unlike hype-only meme coins. The presale has already raised over $26 million, and with Stage 13 live at just $0.0022 per token, the math is staggering. Analysts project that an $870 allocation today could become $87,000+ if Little Pepe climbs to $0.22 in the supercycle. Add the Certik audit, strict vesting schedule, massive giveaway and community incentives, and confirmed exchange listings, and Little Pepe looks primed to lead the 2025‚Äì26 meme coin wave. Solana (SOL): ETF Momentum and Institutional Accumulation Solana continues to prove itself as one of the most scalable and reliable blockchain platforms in the cryptocurrency space. Despite heavy profit-taking near $250, SOL‚Äôs corporate treasury adoption (15M tokens held) and looming ETF approval have positioned it for another leg up. Solana Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Its blooming meme coin market further adds to its appeal. Projects like PUMP, USELESS, and Fartcoin have dominated recent market gains. Analysts project a potential rally toward $500 if the $260 resistance level is broken. Near Protocol (NEAR): AI Economy Trailblazer With AI taking over narratives across industries, Near Protocol (NEAR) is carving out a niche as the ‚Äúblockchain of AI.‚Äù Its Shade Agents allow autonomous bots to interact with blockchains securely, a use case traditional finance simply can‚Äôt accommodate. Near Protocol Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Currently trading above $3.10, NEAR‚Äôs bullish setup is supported by a sustained MACD buy signal and a potential Golden Cross on its moving averages. With AI adoption expanding rapidly, NEAR could easily test $3.80‚Äì$4.00 in the short term, with long-term upside far greater. Story (IP): Tokenizing the $70 Trillion Intellectual Property Market Story (IP) targets one of the largest markets: intellectual property. The project envisions tokenizing rights, royalties, and licensing on-chain, giving creators direct monetization channels. Story Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Recent momentum has come from an $82 million buyback program and the first public company adoption of IP tokens for treasury reserves. The token recently reached $11.66, with analysts targeting $20 by year-end, despite ongoing community debate over founder exits and revenue sustainability. If Story can prove utility beyond speculation, its upside could be enormous. Fasttoken (FTN): Real-World Payments and Utility Growth Fasttoken (FTN) powers Bahamut, an EVM-compatible chain with a unique Proof of Stake and Activity (PoSA) model. This incentivizes developers to stake and deploy contracts that see real-world usage, aligning rewards with actual adoption. Fasttoken Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Trading at $4.49 with a $1.94 billion market cap, FTN recently partnered with AEON , unlocking merchant access across 20 million locations worldwide. Combined with staking programs, NFT marketplaces, and seamless payment tools, Fasttoken is quietly building one of the most integrated ecosystems in the cryptocurrency space. Positioning into the Next Market Movers Just Bitcoin and Ethereum won‚Äôt lead the next bull run. Little Pepe , Solana, Near Protocol, Story, and Fasttoken each bring a unique narrative, from meme dominance to AI, IP, and real-world adoption. However, Little Pepe is the most explosive high-risk, high-reward play. If the meme currency supercycle happens, presale momentum, Layer 2 scalability, and meme culture might catapult small wagers into life-changing gains.

In particular, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , dubbed the 'Shiba Inu Killer', is making headlines for its distinctive features and substantial growth prospects. The Emergence of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Little Pepe stands out with its proprietary Layer 2 blockchain, promising ultra-low fees and rapid transactions. This platform is not only resistant to common exploits but also boasts no buy/sell taxes, a strategic move to attract long-term investors. The ongoing presale has already secured over $26 million, suggesting a robust market confidence. Notably, investing $870 now could potentially yield over $87,000 if Little Pepe achieves its target price of $0.22 per token. Solana (SOL): A Beacon for ETFs and Institutional Investors Solana's ecosystem continues to expand, backed by technological robustness and increasing corporate interest. A significant adoption of Solana's tokens by corporate treasuries and the anticipation of an ETF approval suggest strong future potential. Current price dynamics and market adoption could see Solana breaking past the critical $260 mark, aiming for a $500 valuation. Near Protocol (NEAR): Pioneering the AI Blockchain Interface Near Protocol has smartly positioned itself at the intersection of blockchain technology and the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. Its unique offering includes Shade Agents, which facilitate secure interactions between AI and blockchain networks. Story (IP): Revolutionizing Intellectual Property Management Story aims to disrupt the traditional IP market by enabling on-chain management of rights and royalties. Recent initiatives, including a substantial buyback program, underscore its potential to reimagine IP management. Fasttoken (FTN): Enabling Real-World Blockchain Applications Fasttoken is enhancing its appeal by focusing on real-world applications. A partnership with AEON, which opens up transactions across millions of locations, together with its innovative PoSA model, places it in a prime position for growth.

52376112,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84524,1759046408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"If You Invested $1000 in BONK in 2023, Here is How Much You Would Have Gained",https://timestabloid.com/if-you-invested-1000-in-bonk-in-2023-here-is-how-much-you-would/,"BONK has once again become the focus of conversation across crypto communities. The Solana-based meme coin, once dismissed as a short-lived novelty, has transformed into one of the most remarkable comeback stories in recent cycles. On September 30, 2023 , BONK traded at just $0.000000197 . Fast forward to September 26, 2025 , and the price reached $0.00001905 . That move represents an increase of nearly 96√ó in under two years, a return so outsized that it instantly reignited debate about meme coins and their ability to rival infrastructure projects in wealth creation. To put it into perspective: a simple $1000 allocation at the end of September 2023 would today be valued at around $96,700 . For everyday retail investors, that kind of transformation is almost impossible to imagine, yet BONK proved it could happen. Its rise is more than a price chart; it is a lesson in culture, conviction, and timing. Meme coins succeed not because of whitepapers or tech superiority, but because they capture imagination and loyalty. As retail now looks ahead to the next BONK-style breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE has begun to emerge as a contender worth watching. BONK as the Meme Coin Blueprint The foundation of BONK‚Äôs success lies in its cultural resonance. It launched at a time when markets were fatigued from endless infrastructure talk, and retail investors wanted energy, fun, and a sense of rebellion. BONK‚Äôs playful branding filled that void. Within weeks, it wasn‚Äôt just a token, it was a community symbol. Social feeds, NFT spaces, and Telegram groups erupted with BONK memes, giving it momentum beyond speculation. That cultural stickiness meant BONK lasted longer than a typical pump-and-dump. It embedded itself in Solana‚Äôs ecosystem, ensuring liquidity and attention. BONK taught the market that meme culture could become just as powerful a driver of adoption as technology. The Math Behind the $1,000 Bet Numbers rarely lie. Buying BONK at $0.000000197 with $1000 on September 30, 2023, would have secured over 5.07 billion tokens . Holding until September 26, 2025, at $0.00001905, those tokens would now be worth roughly $96,700 . That‚Äôs nearly a 100√ó return achieved not by fundamentals, but by narrative, community, and viral energy. This kind of outcome highlights why meme coins continue to attract retail. The asymmetry is striking: you risk small amounts, but the upside, if successful, is transformative. Few other sectors of crypto offer this level of potential payoff, which is why BONK has become a reference point whenever investors talk about ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next.‚Äù The BONK phenomenon showed how even tiny allocations could balloon into life-changing gains in just months. Analysts now use that example to highlight the role of presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. While BONK rode viral momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE adds structured scarcity and narrative depth, giving it a different foundation. Return models suggest 1,500%‚Äì2,200% ROI potential if listings mirror its presale trajectory. The PATRIOT50X bonus code has boosted participation, ensuring early entrants maximize position value. For those who watched BONK‚Äôs meteoric rise but missed it, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being touted as a second chance to capture outsized upside. The key difference is that while BONK relied on spontaneity, MAGACOIN FINANCE is blending hype with deliberate mechanics, setting the stage for what could be a more sustainable breakout. Retail Psychology and the Hunt for Multiples The BONK story reminds us that numbers alone aren‚Äôt enough. Retail psychology plays an equal role. Communities flock to tokens that feel accessible, relatable, and fun. BONK succeeded because it built identity, not just market cap. MAGACOIN FINANCE taps into that same psychology, positioning itself as a cultural movement that investors can rally around. Retail wants to feel part of something early. When meme coins generate buzz, it‚Äôs less about technical charts and more about belonging. That belonging, paired with scarcity, creates loops of attention and capital. MAGACOIN‚Äôs design ensures those loops remain strong, reinforcing the retail psychology that drove BONK‚Äôs 96√ó rise. BONK‚Äôs Legacy and MAGACOIN‚Äôs Future The legacy of BONK is already set: it turned a $1,000 investment into nearly $100,000 in under two years. That will be studied as one of the defining examples of meme-coin wealth creation. The question for retail now is not whether BONK was real, it‚Äôs whether something similar can happen again. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be one of the most likely candidates to carry that mantle. Audited, scarcity-driven, and powered by a viral grassroots community, it offers retail a shot at capturing the next meme-cycle wave. If BONK symbolized the unpredictability of 2023, MAGACOIN could define the opportunity of 2025. Conclusion If you invested $1000 in BONK back in September 2023, you would now be looking at around $96,700 . That remarkable gain proves meme culture can generate returns rivaling or even surpassing traditional crypto infrastructure plays. It also shows how critical timing and conviction are when navigating speculative markets. For investors today, the spotlight is shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE . With dual audits, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and a community expanding rapidly, it mirrors the traits that made BONK legendary. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate institutional conversations, MAGACOIN speaks directly to retail‚Äôs desire for asymmetric bets. If BONK defined yesterday‚Äôs surprise, MAGACOIN may well define tomorrow‚Äôs.

52376113,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84664,1759046415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Crypto News: Pepe Coin, Shiba Inu & Remittix Tipped As The Best Crypto To Buy Now For The Highest ROI",https://timestabloid.com/crypto-news-pepe-coin-shiba-inu-remittix-tipped-as-the-best/,"The meme coin market is once again heating up. Pepe is holding its ground and looking for new community activity, while Shiba Inu is regaining momentum with major ecosystem updates. At the same time, a new project called Remittix is drawing attention as a potential bridge between crypto and real-world payments. Many analysts are comparing Pepe‚Äôs current position to the early growth phases of XRP, Shiba Inu and many of today‚Äôs successful Ethereum‚Äôs layer-2 launches. Let us see the latest news surrounding these 3 top altcoins today. Pepecoin Under Pressure To Perform As Q4 2025 Nears Pepe (PEPE) is under pressure this week, slipping about 5-6 % as broader market weakness spills into meme token territory. According to CoinDesk, PEPE dropped to $0.0000107 in a 24-hour pullback with its price still currently languishing at $0.0000093. On the 7-day view, it‚Äôs underperforming the overall crypto market, and trading volume is down sharply, signaling fading enthusiasm from casual traders. On-chain data shows a million-level whale sale of 500 billion PEPE ($4.8 million) recently, testing its support near $0.00001. Analyst Ali Martinez sees a large triangle pattern forming, estimating a possible 78 % swing if volatility breaks at the right moment. Many now see PEPE more as a momentum play than a long-term altcoin base. In short, while it could catch a sharp rebound if whales reenter, PEPE‚Äôs risk remains elevated; it might be one of the wildest ‚Äúbest altcoins to buy‚Äù picks, but only for investors willing to bet on hype and momentum over fundamentals. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Return: Glory Or Bust? Shiba Inu has staged a comeback thanks to a roadmap update featuring a new staking protocol and a game-focused launch. The price of SHIB rose over the past month supported by wallet addresses shifting to alternative Ethereum networks with cheaper gas fees, but this growth was swiftly cut short by BTC going under $110,000. With its Shibarium upgrade designed to cut transaction costs, making it attractive to developers and retail users alike, analysts project SHIB could reach $0.00005 by the end of the year if adoption continues. Remittix: A New Kind of Payment Token Proving To Be The Best Crypto To Buy Now While Pepe and Shiba Inu thrive on community hype, Remittix is making headlines for practical use cases. Unlike many speculative projects, Remittix (RTX) is built for payments, offering cross-chain services that connect crypto with traditional finance. Its Web3 wallet, set to launch in the third quarter, will include direct bank integration across more than 30 countries. The Defi project has already undergone a full audit by CertiK, where it ranked first among pre-launch tokens. This boosted investor confidence and helped the presale raise more than $26.7 million in mere weeks. With over 40,000 holders and strong community activity, whales are already positioning ahead of listings on BitMart and LBank. Why Remittix Stands Out Global reach with transfers to bank accounts in 30+ countries Fully audited and ranked number one by CertiK Mobile-first wallet with real-time FX conversion coming Q3 Over $26.7 million raised in one of the fastest presales of 2025 Built for seamless transfers across Ethereum and Solana The Road Ahead Remittix is also running a $250,000 giveaway and referral program, rewarding users with instant USDT payouts. With beta testing live and major exchange listings confirmed, RTX is shaping up to be one of the fastest-growing projects of 2025. For investors, it offers both real-world utility and early-stage growth potential and it‚Äôs why analysts think you shouldn‚Äôt miss out.

52378737,591132,1759046458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52378737.jpeg,Indian Stock Exchange Rejects Crypto Treasury Company Listing ‚Äì Details,https://bitcoinist.com/indian-exchange-rejects-crypto-treasury-listing/,"The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in India has reportedly rejected the public listing of Jetking Infotrain, an IT training company, on the grounds of intended capital use for crypto investment. This decision comes amid a flurry of digital asset treasury companies worldwide. Related Reading: Celebrity Downfall: South Korean Actress Sentenced For $3-M Crypto Scam Crypto Investments Not Suitable For Publicly Raised Capital: BSE In a report by local Indian media, Economic Times, the BSE barred Jetking Infotrain from publicly listing its shares, citing the exchange‚Äôs investment policy around cryptocurrency. On May 9, 2025, Jetking received an in-principle approval from the BSE to raise funds via a share issue. 14 days later, the company‚Äôs board approved the issuance of 396,000+ shares, raising over ‚Çπ6 crore, i.e $720,000. In its application with the BSE, Jetking stated the new capital would be targeted towards general corporate uses, education and skill development, and investments in virtual digital assets (VDAs). However, a significant ‚Çπ3.96 crore ($475,000), i.e, 60% of the raised funds, was targeted at crypto investments. It is worth noting that Jeking currently has some digital assets on its balance sheets, as Indian companies are allowed to invest in cryptocurrencies similar to mutual funds, securities, etc. However, the BSE has strongly opted against raising public capital for this purpose, as indicated by its rejection of Jetking‚Äôs listing. A statement from a BSE spokesperson read: We had processed the application in the normal course as per extant norms. Final approval was kept on hold to take up the issue of fund raise for investment in VDA at the policy level with the Regulator. Subsequently, as per the revised norms, a decision was taken to reject the application. The BSE is considered the oldest Asian exchange and the second largest in India by trading volume after the National Stock Exchange of India. Notably, the recent BSE‚Äôs decision in rejecting Jetking‚Äôs public listing is likely to threaten the rise of crypto treasury companies in India. By virtue of their operations, crypto treasury firms such as Strategy in the US, Next Technology Holding in China, leverage their status as publicly listed companies to access capital markets, raising funds through equity or debt offerings that are subsequently deployed into digital assets.

Following this development, Jetking Co-Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer Siddharth Bharwani has stated the company is considering all appropriate responses to the BSE‚Äôs decision, including a potential appeal at the Securities Appellate Tribunal. Notably, cryptocurrencies are not illegal investments in India but are considered intangible assets in that they are not securities or legal tender.

52379837,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/4-coins-that-could-turn-500-into-50000-like-solana-and-dogecoin-did-for-early-buyers,1759046499,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/52379837.jpeg,"4 Coins That Could Turn $500 Into $50,000 Like Solana and Dogecoin Did for Early Buyers",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/4-coins-that-could-turn-500-into-50000-like-solana-and-dogecoin-did-for-early-buyers,"Every bull market has its breakout stories. Solana (SOL) went from a little project to worth more than $200, making a lot of money for people who bought it for just $1. A few years ago, Dogecoin (DOGE), which was founded as a joke, went from being worth less than a penny to more than $0.70, making a lot of money. These instances show that with crypto, even modest amounts of money may turn into life-changing amounts of money if you invest in the proper assets. As the bull run intensifies, traders are searching for the next set of tokens that can follow in Solana and Dogecoin footsteps. Among the most promising are Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Sui (SUI), Sei (SEI), and Ripple (XRP). Each has unique fundamentals and momentum that make them strong candidates for explosive gains in this cycle. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Gains Strength as Ethereum‚Äôs Meme Infrastructure Token The most discussed meme coin of 2025 is Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Unlike DOGE or SHIB, which relied purely on community hype, LILPEPE is building real infrastructure. The project is developing an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain tailored to meme coins, designed to be fast, cheap, and sniper-bot resistant. This move positions LILPEPE as more than a meme; it‚Äôs a platform for future meme projects to launch fairly. The presale numbers highlight its momentum. Now in Stage 13 for $0.0022 per token, LILPEPE has raised over $26 million and sold over 16 billion tokens. CertiK has audited it and is already listed on CoinMarketCap, adding trust and visibility rarely seen in a presale project. Thanks to viral campaigns, community growth is also surging, including a $777,000 giveaway where ten winners will each take home $77,000, and a special promotion for buyers between Stage 12 and Stage 17. Analysts predict LILPEPE could hit $0.10 shortly after listings, a 45x gain from presale, with long term forecasts stretching between $1 and $3 by 2026. For investors chasing Dogecoin-like returns, LILPEPE is the standout contender. Sui (SUI) Shows Solana-Like Momentum Sui (SUI) has emerged as one of the strongest Layer-1 competitors, frequently compared to Solana for its parallel transaction execution and scalability. With a current price near $3.90 and a market cap of around $13.4 billion, SUI is still undervalued relative to Solana, which commands more than $90 billion. Analysts believe that as more developers deploy DeFi, gaming, and NFT applications on the Sui network, its value could climb toward $50 by 2026, representing an impressive 10x upside. With Ethereum facing scalability challenges and Solana‚Äôs ecosystem maturing, Sui is carving out a clear role as the next big Layer-1 growth story. Sei (SEI): The Fastest Blockchain with Explosive Potential Sei (SEI), trading at $0.33 with a market capitalization of $1.9 billion, is a Layer 1 blockchain optimized for trading and financial transactions. Its 17% recovery from a recent dip and a bullish RSI signal suggest a breakout. Experts predict a 1,664% surge to $3 by September, driven by the adoption of decentralized finance and trading platforms. SEI‚Äôs speed and developer activity make it a favorite among investors seeking high-upside altcoins this summer. Ripple (XRP) Poised for Renewed Momentum Post-Regulation Finally, Ripple (XRP) remains one of the most important large-cap tokens, especially now that its long battle with the SEC has been resolved. With legal clarity restored, XRP is again relisted on U.S. exchanges, and institutional adoption of RippleNet is back in focus. Priced near $3 with a market cap above $170 billion, XRP may not offer meme-like multiples, but it does carry the stability of a blue-chip crypto. Analysts expect XRP to climb to $8 this cycle, delivering over 10x growth from its lows. For low risks investors seeking exposure to both utility and speculative upside, XRP remains a reliable addition. Conclusion The 2025 bull run will deliver another round of unforgettable success stories. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) leads the charge with its explosive presale, viral community, and bold plan to create a dedicated meme coin Layer-2. Sui (SUI) is emerging as a next-generation blockchain rival to Solana, while Sei (SEI) defines itself as the trader‚Äôs blockchain. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) continues to prove its staying power as one of the industry‚Äôs most recognized names. For investors with an eye for asymmetric opportunities, these four tokens are among the best positioned to replicate the life-changing gains Solana and Dogecoin delivered for early buyers. Under the right conditions, a small stake of $500 in any of them could grow into $50,000 before this bull run is over.

The spectacular ascents of Solana and Dogecoin are such stories, capturing the imagination of investors seeking the next big opportunity. This article explores four cryptocurrencies that show potential for high returns: Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Sui (SUI), Sei (SEI), and Ripple (XRP). Rising Star: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Among the fresh entrants, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is making waves as a pivotal meme coin within the Ethereum ecosystem. Designed as a Layer-2 solution, LILPEPE aims to provide an optimized platform for future meme-based projects, ensuring speed, cost-efficiency, and resistance to common exploitations like sniper bots. This approach not only adds fundamental value but also sets it apart from predecessors like DOGE, which soared mainly on community hype. Already making significant strides in its presale, which has now reached Stage 13 priced at $0.0022 per token, LILPEPE has amassed over $26 million in funding and sold more than 16 billion tokens. With CertiK's audit and a listing on CoinMarketCap, LILPEPE enjoys a level of credibility rare for new tokens. The current promotional campaigns and community growth efforts, including a notable $777,000 giveaway, forecast a bright future for this token. Sui (SUI): A Contender for Scaling Solutions With its eyes set on becoming a leading Layer-1 blockchain, Sui (SUI) exhibits potential reminiscent of Solana's early days. It stands out for its ability to process transactions in parallel, a feature that greatly enhances scalability‚Äîa crucial attribute as the blockchain space grows. Currently valued near $3.90 with a market cap of approximately $13.4 billion, analysts see Sui reaching up to $50 by 2026, a growth trajectory that could offer substantial returns to early investors. Sei (SEI): Optimized for Speed and Financial Transactions Sei (SEI) is currently trading at $0.33, with a market cap around $1.9 billion. It distinguishes itself by being the fastest blockchain available, specifically tailored for trading and financial applications. A recent recovery of 17% from a market dip and a bullish trend in RSI metrics underscore its potential for a significant price surge, possibly reaching $3 by September. This makes SEI an attractive option for those looking for rapid growth. Ripple's (XRP) Recovery and Institutional Interest As one of the stalwarts in the cryptocurrency world, Ripple (XRP) is poised for a resurgence, especially after settling its long-standing regulatory battles in the U.S. Now trading near $3 with a market cap of over $170 billion, XRP offers investors a blend of stability and growth potential, with projections of reaching up to $8 in the current cycle. Conclusion The 2025 bull market could be a defining moment for these four cryptocurrencies. Investors looking for opportunities similar to those presented by Solana and Dogecoin in their prime might consider staking their bets on these promising assets. Each of these coins holds the potential to transform a modest $500 investment into $50,000 under the right market conditions. As always, thorough research and careful consideration of market trends should guide investment decisions.

His remarks came during an on-stage discussion alongside representatives from BlackRock, showing the interest of traditional financial institutions in crypto-related solutions. A clip of the exchange was posted on X by crypto commentator Subjective Views (@subjectiveviews), allowing a wider audience to hear Gallagher‚Äôs take on what could be a significant transitional movement for the crypto sector. Robinhood's Chief Legal Officer shouting out $XRP while sitting next to BlackRock pic.twitter.com/3cVMx91WB7 ‚Äî Subjective Views (@subjectiveviews) September 26, 2025 The Evolution Toward Unified Asset Platforms Gallagher began by noting the current focus for many investors, particularly in Europe, remains on basic access to U.S. equities, suggesting that immediate concerns remain grounded in availability and reach. Yet he stressed that this stage is only temporary. According to Gallagher, the market is heading toward a state where equities will become fully tokenized and available around the clock across borders, a prediction that highlights the scale of changes he believes are on the horizon. Gallagher argued that a key shift will occur as investors come to expect all their holdings, from traditional securities to cryptocurrencies, to coexist on a single platform. He described a future where assets such as Bitcoin and XRP can be stored, leveraged, and traded in the same place as equities. XRP‚Äôs Role in Accelerating Tokenized Equities While Gallagher mentioned XRP in his comments, the digital asset can serve as more than an example in this proposed system. XRP is often viewed as a strong candidate to support the shift toward tokenized equities due to its speed, cost efficiency, and established presence in real-world tokenization initiatives. Its network is designed to handle high transaction volumes with minimal fees, making it suitable for cross-border equity trades that require quick settlement. XRP already powers several tokenization projects , where its infrastructure has demonstrated reliability in moving value seamlessly between parties. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As traditional and digital assets converge, XRP‚Äôs proven track record in facilitating token transfers positions it as a practical choice for platforms aiming to offer investors fast, efficient, and scalable access to tokenized securities. Bridging Traditional and Digital Assets Gallagher highlighted that enabling EU access to U.S. equities reflects wider challenges in tokenizing global markets. He predicted evolving systems would reduce barriers across regions and assets. Bridging gaps between traditional equities and crypto tokens requires collaboration among regulators, technology providers, institutions, and XRP‚Äôs speed and efficiency could help drive this shift, supporting seamless real-world asset tokenization .

According to CoinGlass, over $850 million in leveraged positions were liquidated in 24 hours on September 26, showing just how fragile the sentiment is. The sell-off is due to macro headwinds and technical weakness. The Fed‚Äôs hawkish guidance in mid-September spooked investors when inflation numbers came in hotter than expected and the US dollar hit multi-month highs. This combination crushed risk assets including stocks and digital currencies. On September 25, Reuters reported that upbeat U.S. growth data fueled fresh doubts over whether the Fed would deliver swift rate cuts. Global equities logged their steepest decline in more than three weeks, adding another layer of pressure on crypto markets. Market Cap: $2.18 trillion 24h Volume: $24.6 billion BTC Dominance: 50%+ share of total crypto market cap Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Trendlines Define Risk From a charting perspective, Bitcoin price prediction remains under pressure following a breakdown from its rising channel. A descending trendline now caps rallies, with strong resistance near $112,000. Both the 50- and 100-period simple moving averages slope downward, forming a bearish crossover that reinforces selling pressure. Bitcoin Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview Candlestick behavior reflects market indecision. Multiple small-bodied candles clustered near $109,000, which suggests hesitation among market participants. While prior long upper wicks show sellers fading attempts to climb higher. The RSI sits at 36, barely above oversold territory, hinting at possible relief bounces but no sustained bullish reversal yet. Key technical levels remain well-defined: Support: $107,282, $105,201, $102,867 Resistance: $112,357, $113,274, $114,000 Trade Setup and ‚ÄòUptober‚Äô Rally Scenario For short-term traders, the setup leans bearish unless Bitcoin can reclaim $114,000. A rejection near $112,000 could provide a short entry, targeting $107,300 initially and extending toward $105,200 if weakness persists, with stops above $113,500. However, should Bitcoin secure a daily close above $114,000, the bearish structure would be invalidated, paving the way for a potential rally toward $117,997. Historically, October has delivered strong crypto performance, dubbed ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù by traders, which may add psychological support to bullish scenarios. In plain terms, Bitcoin sits at a crossroads. Either the descending trendline holds, sending price toward lower supports, or $109k proves to be the launchpad for an October rebound. With derivative markets reset and macro uncertainty still weighing, the next decisive move could define the quarter for digital assets. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC‚Äôs unmatched security with Solana‚Äôs high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $18.6 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today‚Äôs stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012985‚Äîbut that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

The Chinese electric vehicle maker responded on Weibo, where public relations executive Li Yunfei wrote : ‚ÄúIn August 2022, Berkshire began gradually reducing its holdings of company shares purchased in 2008, and by last June, its stake had fallen below 5% ‚Ä¶ Investing in stocks involves both buying and selling, which is completely normal ‚Ä¶ We are grateful for Charlie Munger‚Äôs and Warren Buffett‚Äôs recognition of BYD, as well as for the investment, support, and companionship over the past 17 years ‚Ä¶ Praise to all long-term believers!‚Äù The statement confirmed what we first reported last week and framed the exit as routine trading rather than a negative judgment. Executive Vice President Stella Li, speaking during an interview on CNBC Europe‚Äôs Access Middle East , echoed that position. She said Warren and Charlie ‚Äúloved BYD and its management, but they are investors, so naturally buying and selling is their business, so it‚Äôs not because they don‚Äôt like us.‚Äù The company avoided defensive language, instead emphasizing that the relationship was rooted in long-term confidence, even if the investment cycle had run its course. BYD stock drops after confirmation and growth outlook weakens Despite the calm front from BYD, investors reacted quickly in Hong Kong. Shares of the automaker slid more than 6% this week after the confirmation of Berkshire‚Äôs full exit. Even with the drop, the stock remains up just under 20% since January, showing the market still values its growth. Special adviser Alfredo Altavilla added context in remarks reported by Reuters, stating that Buffett ‚Äúmade a profit of 20 times the capital he invested. He did very well to do what he did.‚Äù Altavilla also explained that: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been extremely glad to have had Buffett as an investor, but the fact that he monetized his position is exactly what Berkshire Hathaway does for a living: buying, earning and selling.‚Äù The reaction comes at a moment when BYD is already cutting back. The company reduced its 2025 sales target by 16%, announced price reductions through the end of the year, and slowed production lines. Last month, it also reported its first quarterly profit decline in more than three years, pointing to a clear cooling in its rapid expansion. These developments show the company under pressure at the same time Berkshire closed its position, which magnified market concerns even though management brushed it off. Berkshire lifts its Japanese stakes while closing out BYD While one door closed in China, Berkshire opened another in Japan. Mitsui said this week in a statement that it had been informed Berkshire now holds 10% or more of the voting rights in the trading house after further acquisitions. In March, Berkshire disclosed a 9.8% stake, equal to 285,401,400 Mitsui shares, valued at about $7.3 billion at that day‚Äôs close. By late last month, a Mitsui official told Reuters Berkshire had raised its stake again but did not provide a figure. Around the same time, Mitsubishi announced in a regulatory filing that Berkshire‚Äôs stake had increased to 10.2% from 9.7%. Other holdings in Itochu, Marubeni, and Sumitomo were not updated, but analysts note it would not be surprising if those stakes also crossed the 10% mark.

Analysts Eye LINK, XYZ & CRO Amid Altcoin Rotation",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/uptober-or-letdown-analysts-eye-link-xyz-cro-amid-altcoin-rotation,"Market shifts often bring surprises, and digital coins are once again under the spotlight. Investors are now looking closely at LINK, XYZ, and CRO as money moves between different altcoins. As this trend unfolds, experts share new insights and questions. Will these coins surge, or is disappointment ahead? The answers may shape the next few weeks in digital trading. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token‚Äîit‚Äôs a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. What sets $XYZ apart? It‚Äôs not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.0055 Next Stage: $0.0056 Listing Price: $0.1 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10.

So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Chainlink: The Digital Bridge Coin Catching Fresh Interest Blockchains are like islands; they can‚Äôt see the outside world. Chainlink, powered by the LINK coin, builds the bridge. Many small helpers, called nodes, pull prices, weather, sports scores, and more from the web. Each helper has a public score, so only the most trusted get picked. Results from many helpers are blended, then sent to a smart contract in one clear answer. Part of this work happens on-chain for safety, the rest off-chain for speed. LINK pays and rewards everyone who keeps the bridge open. This simple idea unlocks big uses. Loans that update with live rates, games that pay out on real goals, and farms that react to weather all lean on Chainlink. As new chains launch, they often plug into it instead of making their own data bridge, much like websites all rely on the same cloud servers. While coins tied only to hype fade, LINK gains steady demand from fees, staking, and rising data calls. In the current market, investors hunt coins with clear jobs and cash flow; that makes LINK look brighter than many rivals. Cronos Coin: Powering Easy Pay and Big Plans Ahead Cronos (CRO) is the house coin of Crypto.com. It lives on Cronos Chain, an open-source network built for speed and low cost. The coin flows through the Crypto.com Pay app, turning phones into quick cash registers. Each tap sends money in seconds and keeps user data safe. No bank gatekeepers, no long forms. This mix of fast tech and strong privacy has helped CRO build a lively fan base around the world. The team wants more. They aim to let CRO fuel trading, cards, and even new games. Costs stay tiny, so small buys make sense, unlike on crowded chains like Ethereum. Supply limits and steady burns may add extra push over time. Many investors now hunt for coins with real use, not just hype. Mobile pay is booming, and CRO already owns that lane. If the next market wave favors working products and big brands, CRO could shine brighter than many rivals. Conclusion LINK looks good with steady climb; CRO picks up speed; XYZVerse, the first sports memecoin blending fan passion and GameFi, targets outsized gains amid the 2025 bull run.

52377738,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=821626,1759048828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52377738.jpeg,Trump shares AI image of himself firing Fed Chair Powell,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-ai-made-image-of-him-firing-powell/,"President Donald Trump on Saturday posted on Truth Social a cartoon-style image that appeared to show him firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The picture showed Trump pointing his finger and shouting ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE FIRED!‚Äù while Powell stood holding a cardboard box filled with his belongings. The backdrop included the seal of the Federal Reserve. ChatGPT‚Äôs visual analysis described the picture as ‚ÄúAI-generated or digitally illustrated.‚Äù Source: Donald Trump. The post followed months of Trump attacking Powell‚Äôs record. He has repeatedly called the Fed chair ‚ÄúToo Late Powell‚Äù and blamed him for holding back the economy by refusing to slash interest rates quickly. Earlier in September, the central bank cut interest rates for the first time this year, but Trump still argued it was not enough. Powell‚Äôs current term is set to run until May 2026. Trump challenges Fed leadership despite legal rulings The idea of removing a Fed chair is unprecedented. No president has ever tried to dismiss the head of the central bank. A recent Supreme Court decision ruled that the president does not have the authority to remove Federal Reserve officials at will. Powell himself has said many times that his firing is ‚Äúnot permitted under the law.‚Äù The Trump White House has also criticized Powell for the ongoing renovations of the Fed‚Äôs Washington headquarters, fueling speculation that Trump might seek to remove Powell for cause. In recent weeks, Trump has softened his remarks about the building but has continued to argue that Powell is keeping borrowing costs too high. This push comes after Trump moved against other officials. In August, he attempted to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, accusing her of mortgage fraud. That case is now under review at the Supreme Court. On Friday, the Department of Justice filed a brief at the Court saying that removing Lisa for alleged misconduct would not destabilize financial markets. Lisa‚Äôs attorneys countered in their filing that her removal could threaten the independence of the Federal Reserve. So far, financial markets have not reacted strongly to these attempts. Economists and investors, however, warn that if Powell were removed before his term ends, long-term interest rates could rise. They argue that markets might assume the central bank was acting in Trump‚Äôs political interest instead of following its congressional mandate of ensuring stable inflation and low unemployment. Trump policies weigh on dollar and Fed projections Uncertainty around Trump‚Äôs economic policies dominated a conference held last week at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The combination of his tariff agenda and moves to reshape the Fed‚Äôs board brought more attention to the stability of the U.S. dollar as the world‚Äôs main reserve currency. The New York Fed plays a central role in implementing monetary policy set in Washington. It serves over 200 account holders, including foreign central banks. It also operates as custodian of gold reserves for the U.S. government and foreign clients. Deep under the Fed‚Äôs Manhattan headquarters, about 25 meters below street level, sits a vault holding roughly 507,000 gold bars, with a combined weight of 6,331 tonnes as of 2024. The dollar remains critical to global investment decisions. But a string of Trump‚Äôs moves this year have weakened the greenback. The ICE dollar index, which measures the currency against six major peers, has dropped more than 9 percent. Analysts point to the president‚Äôs tariff measures and his attempts to influence the Fed‚Äôs leadership. These actions include placing Stephen Miran, a close economic ally, on the Fed board and attempting to remove another governor over fraud claims. Even with these steps, the Fed has not met Trump‚Äôs demand for aggressive rate cuts. The Fed‚Äôs most recent projections showed another 50 basis points in cuts expected by the end of 2025, following a 25 basis point reduction earlier this month. That would place the effective federal funds rate at about 3.6 percent. Trump has been pushing for a 3 percent reduction. Among Fed leaders, only Stephen Miran has backed the call for such deep cuts. Meanwhile, a top executive at PGIM Fixed Income warned that pressure from President Donald Trump could push the Federal Reserve into cutting rates too aggressively, posing a short-term risk to the U.S. dollar. The currency has already slipped about 9.5% this year against a group of major peers. Daleep Singh, vice chair and chief global economist at the New Jersey firm that manages close to $900 billion, said at a Federal Reserve Bank of New York conference, ‚ÄúWe do worry quite a bit about an abruptly dovish shift in the Fed‚Äôs reaction function going into next year.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a very decent chance that the FOMC looks and acts quite differently.‚Äù If you're reading this, you‚Äôre already ahead.

Q2 2025 results showed strong revenue and volume growth, but reported losses were due to one-off IPO-related stock compensation expenses. CRCL's business model benefits from stablecoin adoption, earning interest on reserves, but faces headwinds from declining short-term interest rates. Despite Fed rate cuts, CRCL's expanding partnerships and blockchain initiatives support long-term growth, but valuation isn't so low to be discounted. Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) is still a relatively new stock, after its IPO this spring. In that time, we've seen plenty of volatility as the market makes up its mind on fair value. CRCL Price History (Seeking Alpha) After going public in May at $30, the stock climbed to $263 in June. In more recent days, it's settled near $130, making its market cap approximately $29B. After making initial coverage in July, the price is down significantly, and I've had more to learn and consider about the stablecoin opportunity. I've raised my valuation, but I maintain my Hold rating. Summary of First Thesis My initial thesis was largely a validation of the business model and the value-add of their stablecoin product. By tokenizing fiat currency, they effectively reduce the cost of transaction services (typically something like 2%) to zero, with speed both domestically and across borders. Revenue and Volume (Screenshot of previous thesis) This is because they make revenue from short-term interest rates on the cash they hold while giving out their tokenized equivalents. As more people use stablecoins, the more cash they would have to earn interest, relatively free of risk. The main downside was the potential for this yield to decrease with Federal Reserve rate cuts, limiting their ability to benefit from volume growth and potentially making them cyclical with little upside left on the table. With the range of possibilities, I felt that a market cap closer to $20B ($43B at the time) would be a better entry, which came to $95. I rated it a Hold accordingly. Subsequent Updates Since I covered CRCL, Q2 2025 results have come out. The period showed strong, sequential growth. Q2 2025 Earnings Release Total revenue and reserve income reached $658M, up 13.6% from Q1. This largely resulted from growth in volume. Q2 2025 Company Presentation In spite of the growth, however, Circle did not record a profit for this quarter. Income Statement (Q2 2025 Form 10Q) Compensation expenses were unusually high in this quarter, at $503M. According to the latest Form 10Q , this was primarily due to a one-time instance of stock-based compensation expense that was realized in relation to the IPO. That impact to expenses was $423.8M. ""Other (expense)"" points to a $160M item as well. Cash Flow Statement (Q2 2025 Form 10Q) The cash flow statement indicates that most of this was due to a change in the fair value of other forms of the fully diluted equity, whose value would have been unlocked by the IPO and materialized as an expense. Without these items, Q2's net income was around breakeven. Cash Flow Statement (Q2 2025 Form 10Q) The year-to-date cash flow situation shows that it is overwhelmingly positive. If we count M&A, software development costs, and purchases of long-lived assets as capex for this type of software company, it's free cash flow of about $263M. Q2 2025 Company Presentation On the qualitative side, Circle expanded its operations a bit by introducing Arc, its own blockchain network. USCoin USD ( USDC-USD ) is the native gas token, effectively making the dollar the gas. This allows Circle's USDC token to compete with other USD stablecoins by having some extra utility. Q2 2025 Company Presentation Circle also began expanding its partnerships across distributors and merchants. Binance is a key relationship, as they are the largest crypto exchange. Coinbase ( COIN ), which I discussed last time as an important ally for Circle, is a big exchange in their own right, but Binance has almost eight times the volume of Coinbase. Outlook and Valuation Circle isn't a terribly complicated business. It mints stablecoin and earns interest on the real cash it receives for it. They would have to introduce entirely new products with the same ambition as their stablecoin for the earnings outlook to evolve radically. It's really a matter of scale. As stablecoin's share of M2 grows, companies like Circle will do more business. Last time, I discussed research by Citigroup ( C ), supposing that the stablecoin market could grow to $500B to $3.7T by 2030. I opined the following: Q1 2025 showed net income of about $64.8M, for about $78.7M in earnings if we add back depreciation and amortization. Annualized, that's about $314.8M in earnings. If the Stablecoin market reaches $1T, ceteris paribus, Circle should be earning $1.26B on the 4X alone. Let's assume operating leverage gives them better margins at scale, for about $1.5B. Making a similar adjustment for the six months ended June, as well as the one-off expenses from the IPO that I mentioned, these adjusted earnings are $240.7M, which annualize to $481.5M. This is quite a bit higher, demonstrating the clear operating leverage of the business. 4X the volume from the secular movement of stablecoin could easily grow earnings much more than 4X. It's easier to see a range of $2B to $3B in 2030 earnings with constant interest rates. Quarterly Interest Rates (Q2 2025 Form 10Q) For many quarters now, the short-term rates that their dollar reserves earn have been in decline. The Federal Reserve also finally issued a cut this September, so this is likely to continue. Lacking another way to make revenue, this will simply reduce earnings. Even if short-term rates don't return to zero, something like 2% could bring the range down between $1B and $1.5B. That could lower the valuation over time as well. As the market cap is currently about $29B, that isn't an awful price. It's a lot better than what we got at the beginning of July, and with my revised outlook on potential earnings growth, I think an entry price below $95 is no longer necessary. An entry below $120 seems adequate going forward, slightly less than the current price. Conclusion While the Fed's first rate cut in 2025 might not be particularly welcome for this stock, the growth of stablecoins and Circle's key role in it will largely outweigh cuts in the meantime. I feel more confident about what could be considered a good entry price for this business, and that's why I've bumped it up. As the stock still trades above that, I maintain my Hold rating for now.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-28 08:54:36

Growing demand for on-chain versions of traditional instruments has lifted the entire RWA segment, and these five projects now stand at the front of that trend thanks to fresh product launches, major partnerships and expanding user bases. The shortlist reflects a broader shift toward practical uses of blockchain that extend beyond payments and speculative trading. Chainlink‚Äôs data feeds secure trillions in value, Quant‚Äôs interoperability layer is gaining traction with banks, Ondo‚Äôs tokenized treasuries have crossed the billion-dollar mark, Pendle‚Äôs yield trading volumes keep setting records, and Zexpire‚Äôs upcoming compliance suite has drawn early institutional attention. With policy clarity improving in key regions, observers are positioning these tokens as potential bellwethers for the next growth phase of the RWA market. $ZX Early Access: First Token for Profiting from Volatility Zexpire is turning heads as its $ZX token launches at just $0.003, giving early investors a ground-floor entry before the listing price of $0.025 ‚Äî nearly 800% upside. Crypto analysts are watching closely ‚Äî options trading is one of DeFi‚Äôs fastest-growing segments, with $3B in daily volume and rising. Zexpire is a 0DTE DeFi protocol, making options as simple as a one-click daily prediction game. It is also the first platform that lets traders earn directly from crypto volatility. Instead of betting on direction, users face a simple daily choice: will Bitcoin stay within range, or break out? Losses are capped, no margin calls, no liquidations ‚Äî just a one-click, fixed-risk way to turn volatility into profit. And every play requires $ZX, so the demand for the token is built in from day one. Early buyers get the best price and unlock: APR staking rewards before TGE Cashback on gameplay Loyalty bonuses Exclusive airdrops and beta access To keep long-term value climbing, Zexpire has built in a deflationary model: 20% of fees are burned, buybacks support price, and multi-chain availability (Base, Solana, TON, Tron) makes adoption seamless. Each funding stage increases the price ‚Äî the earliest buyers capture the steepest discount. $ZX at $0.003 won‚Äôt last. Buy $ZX Now for the Steepest Discount ONDO‚Äôs Rise, Pause, and the Long View Ahead Ondo Finance positions itself as a bridge between traditional investing and the crypto frontier, offering a token that tracks familiar instruments such as government bonds while keeping everything on-chain. Founded by Nathan Allman, the project stresses openness and real-world backing rather than pure speculation, aiming to make Wall Street‚Äìgrade products available to anyone with a digital wallet. That focus on clarity and oversight has set ONDO apart from countless ‚Äúwild west‚Äù coins that promise much yet deliver little. Market action has already shown how quickly sentiment can flip. After launching on January 18, 2024, ONDO sprinted upward until early spring, hit a short-lived peak in June, and then slipped through late summer. Attention returned when the wider market rediscovered real-world-asset tokens, driving ONDO to a record high on December 16. By January 20, 2025, it traded near $1.45, putting it among the better performers in a year when many digital assets stagnated. That steady footing has sparked comparisons with projects like Chainlink and Maker, which also gained credibility by linking crypto to outside value. Chainlink: The Data Bridge Fueling Crypto‚Äôs Next Growth Spurt Chainlink runs a global web of independent data providers that feed trustworthy information into blockchain programs, allowing those programs to react to everyday events such as price moves or weather reports. Because thousands of separate providers share the workload, the system keeps running even if a few go offline, making it a robust source of facts for digital transactions. The LINK token keeps this machine humming‚Äîprogram creators pay in LINK for fresh data, and data providers lock up LINK as a show of good faith. After peaking near $53 in 2021, LINK has hovered mainly between $10 and $25 while the overall crypto market value more than doubled. That sideways stretch stands in contrast to coins like Bitcoin, which already reclaimed prior highs, and suggests untapped room if fresh demand appears. Growing enthusiasm for exchange-traded funds tied to major coins, along with a 67 percent jump in the value of data-hungry decentralized apps, hints that the need for reliable information feeds is expanding fast. PENDLE: Turning Time Into Tokens in Crypto‚Äôs New Yield Wave In the earliest days of digital money, owning a coin meant waiting for its price to climb. Now a fresh idea is gaining steam: turning the future income a coin can earn into something that can be traded today. PENDLE sits at the center of this shift. By separating a token‚Äôs future earnings from its core value, the project lets holders lock in cash-like returns or sell them to others who prefer steady income over price swings. The result is a livelier market where time itself becomes a currency. PENDLE‚Äôs design feels almost tailor-made for a world chasing predictable rewards. Its system offers clear terms, fixed timelines, and an easy path for builders to plug in new sources of income‚Äîwhether those come from lending, staking, or fresh ideas still on the drawing board. Because each slice of future earnings is placed in a simple, stand-alone package, traders gain flexibility that once belonged only to large institutions. This blend of transparency and creativity has turned PENDLE into a bridge between fast-moving crypto markets and familiarity of traditional finance. Quant‚Äôs Overledger: The Digital Glue Connecting Blockchains Worldwide Since debuting in 2018, Quant has focused on one clear mission: letting separate blockchains talk to one another as smoothly as phones on the same call. Its secret sauce is Overledger, the first operating system built for blockchains, designed to link networks without slowing them down. By placing this ‚Äúdigital bridge‚Äù at the center of its design, Quant sets out to solve a problem that has held the entire sector back‚Äîlack of easy, reliable communication among rival chains. The promise is practical as well as bold. Overledger lets creators craft multi-chain apps, called MApps, that can roam freely between networks; think of a single program that taps into Bitcoin for security, Ethereum for complex contracts, and a private chain for customer records. Access to this new playground requires holding Quant‚Äôs native token, QNT, making the coin an entry pass and potential store of value. As more developers chase users across several chains at once, demand for that pass could grow, turning QNT into the fuel of a wider digital economy. Top RWA Tokens to Watch in Q4 2025 Token Core Focus Recent Highlights Why It Matters Zexpire ($ZX) 0DTE DeFi options on volatility Launching at $0.003 before $0.025 listing; staking rewards, cashback, burns, buybacks First platform to let traders profit directly from volatility with capped risk; token tied to adoption Chainlink (LINK) Decentralized data feeds Secures trillions in on-chain value; demand rising with dApp growth Provides reliable real-world data, the backbone of many blockchain applications Quant (QNT) Blockchain interoperability Overledger adoption with banks and enterprises Enables seamless multi-chain apps, critical for mainstream adoption Ondo (ONDO) Tokenized Treasuries & RWAs Crossed $1B in tokenized treasuries; strong market performance since launch Bridges traditional finance (bonds) with crypto, appealing to institutions Pendle (PENDLE) Yield trading & tokenized income Record trading volumes; expanding integrations Turns future yield into tradable assets, creating flexible income markets Conclusion ONDO, LINK, PENDLE, and QNT keep drawing fresh capital as builders push new use cases for real-world assets. Each token now sits on growing networks, deeper liquidity, and rising partner lists, giving them momentum heading into the final stretch of 2025. Zexpire breaks from that group by turning crypto‚Äôs biggest headache‚Äîprice swings‚Äîinto a clear bet. All activity moves through $ZX, which fuels fees, discounts, and buybacks. Early access to $ZX offers entry to a token backed by constant demand, marking Zexpire as a promising opportunity too. Learn how to join Zexpire early at https://zexpire.com/ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 1. What are Real-World Asset (RWA) tokens?RWA tokens represent traditional financial instruments ‚Äî like bonds, treasuries, or data services ‚Äî on the blockchain. They bring real-world utility into crypto, making digital assets more practical and attractive to both retail and institutional investors. 2. Why are Chainlink, Quant, Ondo, Pendle, and Zexpire considered top RWA tokens?Analysts have highlighted these five projects because they solve critical problems in blockchain adoption: reliable data (Chainlink), cross-chain communication (Quant), tokenized treasuries (Ondo), yield tokenization (Pendle), and volatility trading (Zexpire). Each addresses a unique market gap. 3. How is Zexpire different from the others?While most RWA tokens focus on connecting crypto to existing financial instruments, Zexpire introduces a new model: letting traders profit directly from crypto‚Äôs volatility. Its $ZX token is required for every trade, creating built-in demand as the platform grows. 4. What makes $ZX attractive for early investors?$ZX is launching at just $0.003 in early access, with a planned listing price of $0.025. Beyond price appreciation, holders enjoy staking rewards, fee discounts, cashback on gameplay, loyalty bonuses, and exclusive airdrops. A deflationary model ‚Äî including fee burns and buybacks ‚Äî supports long-term value. 5. How risky is investing in $ZX compared to other tokens?Like any crypto investment, $ZX carries risk. However, its capped-loss trading model reduces exposure compared to leveraged trading, and the token‚Äôs multiple utilities (staking, cashback, governance) help reinforce value beyond speculation. 6. Where can I buy $ZX?$ZX is available now in its early funding round. Early buyers get the lowest entry price and extra perks such as staking APR, cashback, and beta access. Each stage increases the price, so the steepest discount is only available to first movers. Investor Note Crypto markets move fast, and early positioning often makes the biggest difference. Zexpire‚Äôs $ZX token is still available at its early access price. Every stage of funding raises the entry price, while adoption of the platform directly fuels $ZX demand. With built-in token burns and buybacks, the upside potential is amplified for early participants. Early entry means maximum discount ‚Äî once $ZX lists, that window closes.

The outcome of that meeting was the creation of the UK‚ÄìUS Transatlantic Taskforce for Markets of the Future, a new initiative designed to strengthen cooperation in financial innovation. XRP proponent Amelie highlighted comments from Ripple‚Äôs Managing Director, Cassie Craddock, who confirmed that the Taskforce will focus on digital asset regulation, tokenization , and cross-border market access. BREAKING NEWS: Ripple‚Äòs Managing Director Cassie Craddok says: The UK-US Transatlantic ‚ÄûTaskforce will lead to closer cooperation between the US & UK on digital assets, creating an opportunity to align on stablecoins, tokenization, and cross-border market access!‚Äú ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/2WQKBGFiKe ‚Äî ùìêùì∂ùìÆùìµùì≤ùìÆ (@_Crypto_Barbie) September 26, 2025 Priorities outlined by the Taskforce The stated goal of the initiative is to align the two countries on the regulatory and operational treatment of stablecoins, tokenized assets, and international market connectivity. Craddock emphasized that this cooperation is intended not only to harmonize policy approaches but also to build a foundation for international standards that can guide the wider financial industry. She noted that Ripple , as a US-headquartered company with a significant presence in the UK, is well-positioned to contribute to this process by leveraging its cross-border payments expertise and established relationships in both jurisdictions. Reactions from the crypto community Commentary shared on X says that the Taskforce should be seen as more than a cooperative dialogue. One user described it as the formalization of a new financial architecture, suggesting that the effort represents the beginning of compliant, institution-grade infrastructure for digital assets. This perspective highlights the view that the initiative is not limited to standard-setting, but instead focuses on building the systems that will define how tokenized value is exchanged globally under regulatory oversight. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Relevance to XRP and Ripple‚Äôs positioning The discussion has drawn attention to XRP and its potential role within this framework. Observers have noted that as stablecoin regulation and tokenization gain traction, a fast and cost-effective settlement layer becomes a critical requirement. Ripple‚Äôs technology, underpinned by the XRP Ledger, was developed specifically to address cross-border market access, which has been identified as a central theme of the Taskforce. Some community members argue that XRP is moving from being viewed primarily as a speculative asset to becoming directly integrated into the structural framework being built by major economies. The Taskforce is expected to deliver recommendations on regulatory alignment, technical standards, and cross-border integration in the coming months. For companies active in digital asset settlement and tokenization, this presents a direct opportunity to shape the rules and infrastructure of future markets.

Peterson said in his assessment that high interest rates have been suppressing economic activity for a long time, but recent developments have begun to give markets a breather. Peterson noted that high interest rates have effectively locked down the housing market, noting that the decline in mortgage rates has triggered refinancing activity. He argued that this development provides cash flow to households and stimulates consumption, creating a multiplier effect on the economy. Related News: US President Donald Trump Shares an Interesting ‚ÄúYou're Fired‚Äù Post About Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Peterson also noted that interest rates have begun to decline in the high-yield bond market, indicating a growing investor appetite for risk. He said, ‚ÄúBitcoin, which sits at the top of the risk ladder, is trending upward as investors shift towards riskier assets.‚Äù Peterson concluded his remarks by stating that these positive signals in macro data could mean a strong uptrend for Bitcoin in the next nine months: ‚ÄúWith interest rates falling, investor confidence is rising.

But in such a competitive and heavily regulated environment, building visibility and credibility requires more than just marketing ‚Äî it calls for specialized public relations (PR). Crypto PR in North America comes with unique challenges: fragmented regulations (SEC, CFTC, CSA), intense media scrutiny, and a diverse audience that spans Wall Street institutions to grassroots communities on Reddit and Twitter/X. To succeed, projects need PR partners who understand both the regulatory sensitivities and the fast-moving culture of crypto media.

Investor-Heavy Audience: North America‚Äôs crypto ecosystem is dominated by institutional investors, requiring trust-driven and ROI-focused messaging.

52379150,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=821620,1759051241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52379150.jpeg,"US threatens complaints, seeks talks on EU digital rules",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-warns-eu-to-revise-digital-rules/,"The United States has warned the European Union that its digital rule book could damage trans-Atlantic relations unless overhauled. Washington contends that the laws unfairly saddle American tech companies with liability and would limit free speech on the internet. The alert is being issued even as Europe cracks down on the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA). These laws, which are aimed at controlling powerful platforms and online content, are already facing stiff pushback from US companies operating in Russia, including Apple and Meta‚Äôs Facebook and Google. US demands changes to EU laws Andrew Puzder, Donald Trump‚Äôs ambassador to the European Union, has ramped up Washington‚Äôs assault on Europe‚Äôs digital rulebook. Puzder, speaking in Brussels, said the US will send formal submissions to the European Commission outlining its concerns next week. The idea, he said, is to initiate direct discussions with EU officials on how those regulations are shaped and how they impact American companies. Central to the dispute are two flagship bills: a Digital Markets Act (DMA) that seeks to curb the power that ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta exercise over smaller companies; and a Digital Services Act (DSA) intended to make platforms police illegal or harmful content. These laws are among the most ambitious tech regulations globally, and they are rewriting how online companies can act in Europe. Puzder argued that although the legislation was written to appear neutral, it placed heavier restrictions on American companies than European ones. He said Europeans considered the rules more lenient than the US believed, and stressed that both sides needed to review the acts carefully. He claimed that no American president, whether Republican or Democrat, could remain passive if restrictions were imposed on US businesses or citizens‚Äô basic rights. He added that if the legislation tended to impose economic pain on competitors outside Europe to benefit European industry, the United States would strongly oppose it. President Trump has echoed these fears and threatened that his administration will retaliate if some American businesses are treated unjustly. He had threatened retaliatory tariffs and other trade measures against countries that ‚Äúdiscriminate‚Äù against American tech companies. Earlier this year, Trump suggested that allies could see higher duties imposed on cars and other products if they did not address digital rules the US views as detrimental to its interests. The tough talk serves as one illustration of how seriously Washington is taking Europe‚Äôs digital agenda. Though the US and EU recently secured a trade deal that held off an escalation of tariffs, the friction over tech regulation runs the risk of resurrecting tensions just as both sides had embraced improved relations. EU defends its digital sovereignty The European Commission has denied that the move is discriminatory. Officials have said the rules are impartial and apply to any company, regardless of where it is based. They contend that the laws are necessary to ensure fairer competition and safer online environments. France and Germany have backed Brussels out in the open. Both governments said Europe has the authority to regulate its digital market without being forced by Washington. Margrethe Vestager, the EU‚Äôs competition chief, said the DMA was necessary to prevent powerful platforms from running unrestrained. She said the bloc will not relax or cancel its standards under pressure from the US. Meanwhile, the Commission has initiated a public consultation on potential simplification of the digital rules. Critics worry the process could water down protections, while industry lobbyists seek weaker rules. The consultation is open for responses until October 14. The fight over digital regulation risks overshadowing recent improvements in US-EU ties. Both parties agreed to a broad trade deal that staved off a transatlantic trade war in July. But the digital standoff may strain that goodwill. Threats from the US to retaliate on one side and pledges of EU sovereignty on the other set the stage for a tough negotiation in the months ahead.

Starting November 29, roughly $11.9 billion worth of HYPE tokens will be distributed over the next 24 months. As Hyperliquid braces for its $500M monthly unlocks, the market is closely watching how supply pressures will affect HYPE‚Äôs trajectory. Traders and investors track liquidity, inflows, and resistance levels to anticipate outcomes. In a similar way, Outset PR monitors performance metrics of media outlets and delivers analytic reports to craft campaigns that fit market conditions with precision. This combination of data and timing offers a lens to understand how both markets and communications succeed under pressure. A $500M Monthly Wall of Supply Token unlocks are always closely watched events, but HYPE‚Äôs scale sets it apart. According to the vesting schedule , monthly releases will continue uninterrupted for two years, steadily feeding hundreds of millions of dollars‚Äô worth of tokens into the market. Currently, Hyperliquid‚Äôs buyback program absorbs only about 17% of that monthly supply, or roughly $90 million worth of tokens. This leaves an estimated $410 million in net new tokens hitting the market every month‚Äîpotentially creating sustained downward pressure unless offset by rising demand. In other words, the sell-side overhang could test even the most optimistic of long-term holders. How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map ‚Äîa proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fond√© explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers ‚Äì something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR‚Äôs dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. üëâ Reach out to Outset PR HYPE Could Come Under Bearish Pressure Source: tradingview Beyond fundamentals, the technical picture for HYPE also reflects a market at a crossroads. The token is currently trading below the 7-day ($46.8) and 30-day ($49.54) SMAs, signaling short-term weakness. However, it still holds comfortably above the 200-day SMA ($33.7), showing that long-term bullish structure remains intact. The RSI-14 at 42.64 suggests neutral-to-weak conditions‚Äîneither oversold nor overbought. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram at -1.71 signals a bearish momentum bias. A modest 24-hour bounce coincides with Fibonacci support, but so far lacks the volume and conviction to confirm a bullish reversal. Taken together, the chart setup implies that short-term downside risks persist, especially with unlock-driven supply looming. Conclusion HYPE faces a defining moment as its unlock schedule begins, with both fundamentals and technicals suggesting a cautious road ahead. Market resilience will hinge on demand outpacing the constant wave of new supply. Outset PR approaches communications with the same discipline traders apply to price action, analyzing performance, anticipating shifts, and executing strategies that deliver verifiable results.

Traders track inflows, resistance levels, and adoption curves to anticipate where momentum will build next. Similarly, Outset PR monitors media outlet performance with precision, publishing regular analytical reports that make PR campaigns as market-fit as possible. In a landscape where both capital and narratives drive outcomes, Ethena‚Äôs $20M backing from M2 Capital underscores the rising interplay between finance and storytelling. M2 Capital‚Äôs Strategic Entry M2 Holdings is a diversified conglomerate with exposure to digital custody, investment, and wealth management services. Its decision to back Ethena via M2 Capital signals strong conviction in the protocol‚Äôs synthetic dollar model, which aims to combine blockchain-native infrastructure with stable asset functionality. In a statement , the company confirmed that Ethena‚Äôs offerings will be integrated into client portfolios through its affiliate, M2 Global Wealth Limited. This move underscores how traditional wealth management channels are increasingly blending with innovative decentralized finance products. What is Ethena? Ethena has positioned itself as a next-generation platform in the digital dollar space. Unlike centralized stablecoins, its protocol leverages on-chain mechanisms and Ethereum‚Äôs infrastructure to create a synthetic dollar that is both scalable and transparent. By anchoring governance through its ENA token, Ethena enables community participation while aligning long-term incentives for growth and stability.

Traders are closely monitoring support, momentum, and market sentiment to determine ETH‚Äôs next move. In the same way, Outset PR keeps a constant pulse on media performance, publishing analytical reports that make PR campaigns as efficient and market-fit as possible. Just as resistance levels shape price action, data-driven insights shape how stories gain visibility and traction. Ethereum Price Outlook: Bullish Trends and Growth Potential Source: tradingview ETH has broken below both its 7-day SMA ($4,194) and 30-day EMA ($4,322), confirming short-term bearish momentum. The RSI-14 sits at 38.76, pointing to weakening buying pressure but not yet reaching oversold territory. The MACD histogram at -71.85 further underscores strong downside momentum, suggesting that sellers remain firmly in control of the near-term trend. Since mid-August, ETH has been forming a descending triangle, a bearish continuation pattern that typically resolves lower. If the critical $4,000 support level breaks, the structure projects downside targets in the $3,745‚Äì$3,800 range. This makes $4,000 the immediate line in the sand for traders and investors.

(CryptoQuant),https://cryptopotato.com/how-are-shares-of-bitcoin-treasury-companies-performing-amid-private-fundraises-cryptoquant/,"As Bitcoin adoption grows, more companies seek additional methods of raising funds to acquire the leading digital asset. Most have turned to Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) programs; however, these moves have backfired on their shares. A report from the market analysis platform CryptoQuant revealed that the shares of most Bitcoin treasury entities that raised capital through PIPE programs have plummeted significantly. Worse still, others face the risk of further decline. BTC Firms Turn to Private Fundraises In PIPE offerings, publicly traded companies sell newly issued shares to a group of institutional or accredited investors. These programs are separate from their public offerings. They are characterized by features such as faster financing for the company and shares at a lower-than-market price for investors. PIPE investors also have the option to sell their shares after filing a resale registration. Companies often offer PIPEs to quickly raise capital for buying BTC during bullish market conditions. Unlike public offerings and traditional financing methods, PIPEs are flexible and usually signal strategic intent to investors. ‚ÄúSeveral Bitcoin Treasury Companies have opted to fund their Bitcoin purchases using a PIPE. Bitcoin Treasury Companies often need large blocks of capital quickly to front-run expected BTC rallies, announce large BTC purchases to rebrand their equity narrative or start their treasury strategy, and to continue to expand their total Bitcoin holdings,‚Äù CryptoQuant stated. Although one of the few viable options for Bitcoin treasury firms, PIPEs can negatively impact a company‚Äôs stock performance. The offerings usually increase the number of shares in circulation, thereby diluting existing shareholders. In situations like these, selling pressure from PIPE investors creates a supply overhang that pulls down the stock price. PIPE Shares Fall 97% The share prices of most Bitcoin treasury companies that raised capital through PIPE have fallen toward their PIPE issuance levels. The declines range from 42% to 97%. Stocks still trading above their PIPE offering prices face declines of up to 50%. Companies like Kindly MD (NAKA) have watched their stock plummet by 97% after their PIPE raise. NAKA declined over 50% in a single day after PIPE shares were unlocked for trading. Others, such as Empery Digital (EMPD) and Sequans Communications (SQNS), are already trading below their PIPE issuance price. Additionally, entities like Strive (ASST) and Cantor Equity Partners (CEP) face downside risk, with their shares trading above their PIPE prices. They could still fall at least 50% before hitting the PIPE issuance levels. CryptoQuant says only a sustained BTC rally will prevent the continuation of this trend.

CRCL benefits from a scalable, asset-light, and predictable business model, primarily earning interest on cash and treasuries backing USDC tokens. The company enjoys regulatory advantages and a growing network effect, with USDC widely accepted and Circle holding key licenses in major jurisdictions. Despite these strengths, execution risks‚Äîespecially high distribution costs from the Coinbase deal‚Äîlead to a pass on CRCL for now. My thesis on the Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) is a pass on execution risks and major bottlenecks, like the higher distribution costs due to a lopsided Coinbase deal. If not for these execution risks, I may have considered ignoring macro pressures like a falling interest rate regime and even any elevated valuation concerns to go long on the secular tailwinds of growing stablecoin adoption. Why CRCL Could Have Been a Buy Revenue Growth Trajectory: Revenue growth has been impressive , with Q2 2025 revenues showing a ~53% YoY increase. This is not a flash in the pan. Topline growth was explosive in Q1 as well, with ~58% growth recorded compared to $365m in top line in March 2024. Analyst estimates point to continued high growth pushing the topline close to $7b annually by 2028, from a TTM revenue of ~$2.1b today. That is continued growth at a CAGR of ~40%, driven by an expanding USDC adoption expectation. Data by YCharts Scalable, Predictable Business Model: Since the primary revenue source is interest earned on cash and treasuries backing USDC tokens issued, the business model looks simple and has predictable cash flow and unit economics. As long as stablecoin usage expands, the business will be extremely scalable. The only cyclical element that is introduced in the business model is the interest rate dependency, but the unit economics are easy to track and predict, making investment decisions easier. Asset-Light Model: The business model revolves around managing digital dollar reserves instead of physical asset management. This means Circle has lower working capital and capex needs than traditional banks. The model is asset-light. Moat Like Position: Circle has several barriers to entry that can qualify as reasonable moats. In an environment of a better regulatory framework for stablecoins, Circle already has required regulatory approvals in the early phase of an evolving regulatory landscape. It has applied to the OCC, which will allow the company to operate as a federally regulated trust bank. Circle also has several licenses already in place to transact in Europe and Singapore. Even if the regulatory landscape eases out in the future, which may very well happen, early approvals and licenses will definitely help create a moderately durable regulatory lead for Circle. Enough lead to penetrate the markets and create a reasonable network effect. Signs of a robust networking effect are already in place with USDC's acceptance across a vast majority of major exchanges and a 500m+ user ecosystem . Early access to users and distribution channels are also going to take significant time for any new entrant to replicate. Market Position and Scale: The stablecoins market is dominated by Tether USDT, which now accounts for ~59% of the volumes. The USDC volume share was ~26% in April 2025 . The expanding TAM for stablecoins is looking like a very likely scenario with supportive regulatory regimes and maturing interest in alternative assets in the upcoming years. I am bullish on an explosive TAM expansion that could even accommodate some competition and a fall in market share for Circle. As of now, Circle is still a growing ""number two"" in stablecoins, behind Tether, and an expanding TAM is likely to keep the growth alive, even if market share gains are challenged through competition. Competition from PayPal, Ripple, and Robinhood launching stablecoins, or even new entrants in the future, could only be a real threat if the stablecoin TAM expansion thesis is threatened. In August 2025, for example, World Liberty Financial's USD1 showed an improved market share (still around 1% of the total ~$278b market size). While competition is hot and growing - USD1 had double-digit growth in August alone - the stablecoin market has also been growing at a healthy pace. In September, stablecoins completed 24 months of continued growth at a pace of ~3.5% per month. I expect the rate of adoption to only get even better. But even if the average monthly adoption growth happens at around the 3.5% mark (i.e., a 50% annual growth), USDC market share will need to drop from 26% to 17-18% to start clocking topline stagnation. In summary, Circle's growing profile, current market position, and a growing TAM leave enough room for competition effects to unfold. A ~58% topline growth is currently higher than the stablecoin market growth levels, showing that Circle is potentially making further inroads into the market. Those levels could still be impacted by competition, though, and that could have a say in valuation erosion, but current revenue levels have good support from the expanding TAM to prevent huge downsides even in the worst-case scenarios. Secular Tailwinds: Continuing on the TAM expansion bit, Circle's business will be well supported by secular tailwinds due to increased adoption of stablecoin in digital payments. Then there is scope for improving regulatory transparency, as discussed earlier, and even technology improvements (higher precision Blockchain networks, instant settlements, and integration with major payment platforms). What Concerns Me Interest Rate Cyclicality: Interest rate cuts will have a linear impact on topline and margins as we are entering a regime of lower rates. The specifics of how high for how long will be important to note. So will be how the secular stablecoin TAM growth offsets this drag. The estimated impact of the 25 bps rate cut is a ~$160m revenue loss for USDC annually, i.e., ~6% impact on the current run rate of ~$2.6b revenues. This impact will add up for every further rate cut. That is a lot to digest for the topline, even as it works through the growing secular adoption tailwinds. Distribution Costs: The revenue-sharing arrangement with Coinbase hurts Circle's margins by spiking up distribution costs. Coinbase was paid 56% of total revenues as distribution costs in 2024. This was because the contract demands a 100% interest income on USDC held in Coinbase and 50% on holdings elsewhere. This is obviously an initial arrangement helping USDC gain traction. The deal gets renewed in 2026, and whether Circle gets some leverage back at that point is dependent on several factors - some like how the negotiations will go, are hard to predict. As USDC adoption grows, one can expect Circle to hold some leverage in those negotiations, but whether that growth will be telling before the deal is renewed in 2026 is uncertain. The last numbers I see indicate around ~22% of USDC held in Coinbase. Over the next few quarters, either an absolute continued uptick in volume or a drop in that percentage held in Coinbase will help not only the margins directly but also negotiations when the deal is renewed. As an interested investor, I will watch out for progress in Circle's attempt to diversify distribution through banks, exchanges, and payment companies. However, the Coinbase relationship will remain critical for the foreseeable future, and the uncertainty there will be a drag on investor sentiment. Why I Can't Enter Circle When I started out on the thesis, I did find the distribution setup concerning, and after looking at the detailed pros and cons, I still see distribution costs as the obvious culprit and the primary factor that prohibits fresh entries at this stage. The interest rate pressures are real and concerning too, but they are more measurable and can be analyzed against valuation discounts in adverse rate environments for Circle. The competitive vulnerabilities are not huge, but all the negatives there can also be accounted for. The uncertainties of the distribution costs, on the other hand, are prohibitive for me, as I am unable to model my margin expectations without any long-term clarity there. In short, I can digest negatives, but not uncertainties. Not of the magnitude that critically affects margins and shows low wriggle room for Circle. Without indulging in long-term expectations, I am comfortable with valuations of ~10x revenues, allowing for a premium on the secular stablecoin growth story. I expect the current growth rate to be upheld for that to be justified. That is, the current revenue run rate of ~$2.6b reaches ~$4b over the next one year. With ~231m shares outstanding, that translates to a share price of ~$170 at a valuation of ~10x on revenues. Hence, valuations are not concerning, particularly after the recent drop in share prices. Even after accounting for lower interest rates, I see scope for $150 levels as well supported. Provided several execution milestones are met consistently, such as market share gains and consistent topline growth. Overall, I rate Circle as a Hold because its valuations may still be conducive now, but the distribution arrangements are critically uncertain. Till I get more clarity and confidence around that, I will remain on the sidelines. Otherwise, current valuations do account for a large part of the execution and rate risks for long-term investors. The margin expansion uncertainty needs to be addressed for Circle to become a Buy. This is because the premium 10x valuations cannot be held for long with no visible path for margin growth. Even continued topline growth for the next several quarters could be insufficient to support informed fresh Buys today.",CRCL,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|MARKET|USDC|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-28 09:34:17

Most larger-cap alts have produced little to no volatility since yesterday, but some of the smaller caps have gone on a tear. BTC Calms at $109.5K It was just over a week ago when the primary digital asset challenged the $118,000 resistance, only to fail and begin a more profound and violent correction. At first, the asset was driven south to $115,500 during the previous weekend before the bears took complete control of the market on Monday. The first leg down pushed bitcoin to a 10-day low of $112,000 in what appeared to be a flash crash. It quickly bounced off to $114,000, but the bears didn‚Äôt let go and kept the pressure on. As a result, BTC slumped to a three-week low of under $109,000 as the week progressed. After losing over $6,000 from Monday to Thursday, bitcoin finally calmed. It even jumped past $110,000 briefly on Friday, but to no avail, and was pushed south to $109,500, where it has been positioned for most of the weekend. Its market cap continues to struggle at $2.180 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is up to 56.5% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView MYX on a Roll Most larger-cap alts have produced minor moves over the past day, but are deep in the red weekly. For instance, ETH has slumped by double digits and struggles at $4,000, which is a crucial support level that could determine the asset‚Äôs next move. Further notable losses come from the likes of SOL, DOGE, ADA, HYPE, LINK, and AVAX, all of which have dumped by double digits. On a daily scale, HASH and MYX stand in a league of their own, with gains of 24% and 11%, respectively.

The analyst suggests that the next time XRP forms a bullish engulfing candle on the weekly chart, the token could surge to new all-time highs, potentially reaching around $7.30. Such a move would represent one of XRP‚Äôs most significant price rallies in years, fueled by technical strength and renewed investor optimism. A bullish engulfing candle is a well-known pattern in technical analysis, signaling strong momentum when buyers fully eclipse prior selling pressure. For XRP, which has long traded in a range amid regulatory battles and market uncertainty, the confirmation of this signal on a weekly timeframe could mark the start of a major breakout. If realized, the $7.30 level would surpass XRP‚Äôs historical peak of around $3.65, cementing a new milestone for the digital asset. However, EGRAG CRYPTO also cautions that risks remain if Bitcoin, the broader market‚Äôs anchor, experiences further downside pressure. Should BTC decline significantly, XRP may fail to sustain bullish momentum, with critical support levels at $2.60 and, in a deeper correction, $2.37. These zones, according to the analyst, represent essential lines of defense for XRP holders and could determine whether the asset consolidates before another attempt at upward movement or slips into a prolonged retracement. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.79, according to CoinGecko data . October Showdown: Seven XRP Spot ETF Filings Poised to Reshape Crypto Investing According to crypto pundit John Squire, October could mark a watershed moment for XRP and the broader digital asset market as multiple financial heavyweights line up their XRP Spot ETF filings. If approved, these products would open the door for mainstream investors to gain direct exposure to XRP through traditional stock exchanges, potentially ushering in new levels of liquidity and legitimacy. October‚Äôs XRP ETF calendar is stacked as Grayscale kicks off on the 18th, followed by 21Shares (19th), Bitwise (20th), Canary Capital (23rd), WisdomTree (24th), and dual filings from Franklin Templeton and CoinShares on the 25th, according to Squire. This tight clustering underscores surging institutional confidence in XRP and intensifying competition to seize first-mover advantage. Unlike futures-based products, spot ETFs hold XRP directly rather than derivatives, offering investors lower costs, tighter price tracking, and stronger integration with traditional finance. For XRP, multiple ETF approvals could unlock significant new demand, drawing in institutions and retail investors who prefer regulated, accessible investment vehicles. As a result, Squire stresses that October won‚Äôt hinge on just one approval, it could be the month that cements XRP as a mainstream asset. Conclusion With October approaching,even one ETF approval could ignite momentum, but multiple greenlights may solidify XRP as a core asset in traditional portfolios. XRP‚Äôs next move depends on technical signals and Bitcoin‚Äôs market sway. A confirmed bullish engulfing candle could propel prices to $7.30, a historic breakout.

The main intention of the regulation will be to tackle scams carried out with the machines. This way, residents and users of the ATMs would have an extra layer of protection when carrying out their transactions. The scam in question involves the use of crypto kiosks, which allow users to convert cash into Bitcoin and other digital assets. They are often located in some businesses or shopping malls. The scammers just have to use various con methods, including pretending to be a government official, a romantic partner, or gaining trust through deception, before asking them to deposit a large amount of money into one of these crypto ATMs. Regulations to crack down on crypto ATM scams in Arizona Arizona has experienced a huge rise in the number of its residents getting scammed through cryptocurrency ATMs over the past year. The number was so high that Attorney General Kris Mayes issued a letter of support to the Yavapai County Sheriff‚Äôs Office last November, noting that efforts are being taken to combat the crimes. The AG mentioned that programs such as posting signs on the machines to warn residents that they may be victims of a scam . AG Mayes, in the letter, urged all business owners in the county to support the Sheriff‚Äôs Office in its efforts to stop the loss of thousands of dollars. The AG added that Arizonans have lost millions of dollars in the past year to various scams, with the criminals using the machines as an outlet to receive cash. She mentioned that the criminals prey on elderly folks, noting that ‚ÄúIt is truly heartbreaking to hear the stories of individuals who have lost part or all of their life savings to fraudsters.‚Äù In the recent press release about the new law, Mayes celebrated its ‚Äúcommonsense protections‚Äù but warned that crypto scams are still something that needs to be urgently addressed. ‚ÄúLast year, Arizonans lost an astounding $177 million in their hard-earned savings to cryptocurrency scammers. This is a good first step, but we need to do even more to protect Arizona seniors from these persistent criminals,‚Äù Mayes said. New regulation will reduce the daily transaction limit The new Cryptocurrency Kiosk License Fraud Prevention law reduces the daily transaction maximum, increases warnings on the machines, and requires transaction receipts. It also mandates operators of the machines to issue a refund to victims of fraud. The law was sponsored by Rep. David Marshall, R-Snowflake, who told the Senate Judiciary and Elections Committee earlier this year that his constituents would drive to Phoenix to deposit their money in these ATMs only to find their money gone when they got home. According to the new law, daily transactions will be limited to $2,000 for new users and $10,500 for existing users. Any new user who reports to an ATM operator that they have been a victim of fraud within 30 days of their transaction will receive a full refund. During their crackdown activities last year, YCSO and the AG instructed business owners to put warnings on their machines. The warnings were similar to those displayed around gift cards at stores due to the rise in that kind of scam, where victims are urged to buy gift cards and send them to scammers. In 2023, Americans lost $5.6 billion to crypto scams, with the majority of victims being the elderly. Crypto thefts have become a worrying concern in the crypto industry.

Yet, amid the decline, certain altcoins show promise for future gains. With altseason anticipation building, there are specific digital assets poised for growth. This article reveals the top altcoins to consider now, positioning for a potential rebound when the market sentiment shifts. Ethena (ENA) Shows Potential Despite Recent Drop Source: tradingview Ethena (ENA) is trading between sixty and seventy-three cents right now. It has met resistance around eighty-two cents but finds support at fifty-five cents. Even with a twelve percent dip over the past week, ENA has grown almost fifty-eight percent in the last six months, showing strong potential. If ENA breaks the current resistance level, it could climb to ninety-five cents, offering an increase of over thirty percent from its current upper range. Indicators like moving averages suggest stability, and a healthy RSI signals room for growth. Despite the ups and downs, ENA looks promising for future gains. Pi Network Shows Signs of Stability Amid Market Challenges Source: tradingview Pi Network's price hovers between 34 and 36 cents, showing slight stability despite a turbulent market. The coin recently faced a dip, experiencing over a 24% drop in the last week and over a 65% decrease in six months. However, its Relative Strength Index suggests it's not oversold. If the price pushes past the near resistance at 37 cents, it could aim for 39 cents, marking an increase of about 8%. Nevertheless, the coin finds immediate support at 33 cents. It trades above its simple moving averages, indicating potential support for gradual growth if market sentiment improves. The Pi Network community remains hopeful that stability will usher in an upward trend. Uniswap (UNI) Eyes Rebound Despite Recent Dip Source: tradingview Uniswap (UNI) has recently been trading between $8.82 and $9.52. The coin has faced some challenges, with its price dropping about 18% over the last week and nearly 24% in the past month. However, it still shows a positive trend over the last six months with an increase of 28%. Currently, the nearest resistance level is just shy of $10, while support holds around $8.57. If momentum gathers, UNI might aim for the second resistance level at $10.68, marking a potential growth of around 15% from its current highs. Investors are watching closely, as this could set the stage for a significant rally if the market sentiment improves. Conclusion The market shows signs of a downward trend, but opportunities remain. ENA, PI, and UNI are strong candidates for investment. These altcoins offer potential for growth as market conditions improve. Investing in them now could be beneficial when the market rebounds.

Despite the dip, certain cryptocurrencies are poised for significant growth this year. Discover which coins are set to rise and could potentially deliver big gains amidst the volatility. This article will uncover the digital assets to watch closely. Sui (SUI) Shows Signs of Growth Potential After Recent Dip Source: tradingview Sui's price currently hovers between three dollars and nearly four dollars. Despite a recent one-week dip of almost twelve percent, the coin shows potential for growth. Sui has surged over thirty-six percent in the past six months. The nearest resistance level is four dollars and twenty cents, a level it could test soon. If momentum builds, it might reach the second resistance level of four dollars and seventy-one cents, indicating possible gains of over twenty percent from current levels. With its Relative Strength Index slightly above fifty, Sui seems balanced, suggesting steady investor interest. As Sui navigates these levels, it could offer intriguing growth in the coming weeks. Hedera (HBAR) Shows Resilience Amid Market Swings Source: tradingview Hedera's price hovers between 23-25 cents, teasing an upward shift. It's close to breaking a resistance barrier at 26 cents. If it breaches this level, it could touch 28 cents, marking a possible surge of over 10%. The currency shows strength, standing above key support at 22 cents despite recent dips. Over the past six months, its value boosted by over 27%, indicating solid ground for potential growth. However, in the last week, it's down by nearly 11%. The ten-day moving average sits at 21 cents, backing its steady path. Hedera's current resilience in volatile times suggests a promising outlook if it continues to push past resistance levels. FET Holding Steady with Eyes on a Breakout Source: tradingview The cryptocurrency Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is currently priced between 61 and 67 cents. Despite a dip over the past week, FET has shown promising growth over the last six months, increasing by over 23%. The coin is sitting near its 10-day and 100-day averages, suggesting stability. For growth potential, FET could climb past the nearby resistance of 71 cents and potentially reach up to 76 cents, marking a potential rise of around 13% from its current range. With indicators like the RSI and stochastic near a neutral mark of 52, FET is holding steady, hinting at a possible upward trend if demand picks up. POL (ex-MATIC) Finds Stability with Hope for Growth Source: tradingview POL's price currently dances between $0.23 and $0.27. It's holding ground above a solid support level at $0.21, with a chance to climb toward the nearest resistance at $0.29. Over the past six months, POL has seen over 9% growth, hinting at potential upward movement. If momentum builds, POL could target the second resistance at $0.33, marking a potential gain of more than 20% from current levels. The RSI is healthy at around 58, suggesting POL isn't overbought, while the moving averages show a stable trend. Traders are watching for signs of strength, eyeing gains in the coming weeks if the bulls take charge. Conclusion SUI, HBAR, FET, and POL stand out as coins with strong potential for gains this year. Investors should carefully monitor these assets. They have unique features and promising developments that could drive their value up. Keeping a close watch on their performance and updates could prove beneficial. Even as the market experiences declines, these coins are positioned to offer significant opportunities for growth.

Key Takeaways: Deutsche Bank says Bitcoin could sit alongside gold on central bank balance sheets by 2030. Trump‚Äôs strategic Bitcoin reserve plan is fueling renewed debate around institutional adoption. Bitcoin‚Äôs low correlation to traditional assets strengthens its case as a long-term store of value. The prediction comes amid a sharp uptick in geopolitical and monetary shifts, with Bitcoin and gold both seeing renewed demand. Deutsche Bank: Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve Plan Rekindles Central Bank Adoption Debate Marion Laboure, research analyst at Deutsche Bank‚Äôs Research Institute, said the Trump administration‚Äôs decision to create a US strategic Bitcoin reserve earlier this year ‚Äúreignites the argument for central banks to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset.‚Äù In a note seen by CNBC , she added: ‚ÄúWe conclude there is room for both gold and Bitcoin to coexist on central bank balance sheets by 2030.‚Äù The price of Bitcoin surged to over $124,000 last month before retreating, as traders digest U.S. monetary policy moves and brace for further volatility ahead of the 2026 election cycle. Meanwhile, gold has surged to a record high above $3,700 per ounce, pushing its market cap past $25 trillion. Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization currently stands above $2.3 trillion. The Trump administration‚Äôs March executive order calling for the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve marked a major policy shift. While details remain limited, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the government is committed to ‚Äúbudget-neutral pathways‚Äù to build the reserve. ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin that has been finally forfeited to the federal government is the foundation of the strategic Bitcoin reserve,‚Äù Bessent said. TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT SAYS THE U.S. WILL **NOT** BE BUYING ANY BITCOIN THEY WILL HOLD THE $15-$20 BILLION IN BITCOIN THEY ALREADY HAVE AND CONFISCATE MORE WEIRD, BECAUSE I WAS PROMISED A STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE MAKES SENSE WHY BO HINES RESIGNED NOW, EH? pic.twitter.com/MGu90xOBqZ ‚Äî Walker (@WalkerAmerica) August 14, 2025 The idea of adding Bitcoin to central bank reserves mirrors past strategies involving gold. A recent Federal Reserve research note highlighted that revaluing US gold holdings could increase their book value from $11 billion to $750 billion, a precedent that could be extended to crypto. Laboure noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs low correlation with traditional assets gives it similar store-of-value characteristics as gold, making it appealing to institutions. ‚ÄúBitcoin also has the potential to provide both an investment and a consumer-good value,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúThis explains why when equities rally strongly, their correlation to Bitcoin can rise.‚Äù Hex Trust CEO: US Banks Will Soon Offer Bitcoin Services Hex Trust CEO Alessio Quaglini believes US banks are on the verge of mainstreaming Bitcoin , pending regulatory clarity. He predicts that within months, most American banks will offer custody, trading, and deposit services for Bitcoin, calling U.S. regulation the ‚Äúglobal benchmark‚Äù for institutional adoption. Founded in 2018, Hex Trust provides crypto custody, trading, lending, and staking services to institutions across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. With over 200 employees and a million end users via B2B deals, the firm is targeting $20 million in revenue by 2025 and considering a future IPO. Quaglini also sees stablecoins as a disruptive force, potentially replacing the SWIFT system for cross-border payments. Unlike US-listed crypto companies that rely on retail trading, Hex Trust‚Äôs strategy focuses on providing infrastructure for institutions and avoiding direct exposure to crypto market volatility.

52379853,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=178706,1759053626,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/52379853.jpeg,Top 6 Altcoins to Deliver 50x in the Next Few Years,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/top-6-altcoins-to-deliver-50x-in-the-next-few-years/,"The days have been turbulent across crypto markets, with fresh liquidations rattling leverage traders and renewed debate over which assets truly hold long-term potential. Yet even amid short-term volatility, a different conversation is gaining strength: which altcoins could realistically deliver exponential returns in the next few years. Analysts are increasingly pointing to a shortlist of names that combine strong ecosystems, active communities, and transformative narratives. These coins are not all the same, some are infrastructure giants gaining institutional traction, while others are speculative, meme-driven projects where retail enthusiasm has the power to ignite extraordinary multiples. What unites them is potential. In a market where Bitcoin captures headlines, altcoins often provide the asymmetric upside that smaller investors crave. Spotting the next 50x winner requires blending technical conviction with cultural awareness, and it requires entering early, before mainstream attention cements valuations. With that in mind, here are six altcoins drawing the most attention, and why MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a contender in this high-risk, high-reward category. Ethereum: The Institutional Backbone Ethereum continues to stand as the most credible infrastructure altcoin, now powering tokenization pilots, DeFi platforms, and institutional settlement trials. Its developer base remains the largest in the industry, and its narrative as the ‚Äúbackbone of Web3‚Äù is strengthening as Wall Street experiments with blockchain-based assets. For investors seeking 50x, Ethereum might not deliver such multiples alone, but projects building on it or connected to its ecosystem could. As the institutional layer, ETH provides the foundation on which smaller tokens can soar. Solana: High-Speed Growth Solana has captured headlines for its speed, scalability, and thriving developer culture. In the last day, trading desks have reported sharp increases in derivatives interest, highlighting its volatility and attraction as a high-beta play. Solana‚Äôs network hosts NFTs, DeFi, and meme tokens alike, giving it cultural and technical reach. If institutional adoption leans toward scalable alternatives, Solana could be the beneficiary, setting the stage for multiples that few other large-caps can offer. XRP: The Payments Edge XRP continues to carve its niche around cross-border settlement. With increasing clarity on its legal status and growing integrations with financial institutions, XRP has found stability amid uncertainty. For long-term investors, its positioning in the payments sector makes it one of the few altcoins with real-world utility already in motion. If adoption accelerates, the combination of liquidity and legitimacy could fuel returns well beyond current expectations. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Retail Wildcard Lists of potential 50x altcoins often include mid-caps like ADA or AVAX, but analysts increasingly add presales when discussing high-risk, high-reward bets. MAGACOIN FINANCE has appeared in multiple conversations as one of the few early-stage tokens where structure meets narrative. Projections highlight possible 1,700%‚Äì2,300% ROI if momentum scales through listings. Its presale design and cultural resonance set it apart from generic meme launches. Smart investors note that MAGACOIN FINANCE is echoing conditions that surrounded early DOGE and SHIB surges, albeit with a clearer framework. While it carries all the risks of speculative plays, its positioning in analyst shortlists underscores that even among dozens of presales, few stand out, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has. For those chasing the next 50x, it‚Äôs becoming a serious contender. Avalanche: The Scaling Contender Avalanche has maintained a steady presence as one of the most efficient Layer 1s. Its subnet model allows tailored blockchain ecosystems, appealing to enterprises and developers alike. Community trackers have noted a spike in user activity across DeFi applications built on Avalanche, suggesting steady adoption. For those hunting 50x opportunities, Avalanche represents a balance of infrastructure credibility with growth potential. Polygon: The Web3 Gateway Polygon continues to position itself as the go-to scaling solution for Ethereum. With partnerships spanning major brands and Web2 companies experimenting with Web3 integration, its adoption pipeline remains strong. Analysts suggest that while it may not explode overnight, its role as a bridge between traditional companies and blockchain ecosystems ensures steady, compounding relevance. Retail often underestimates Polygon‚Äôs ability to become the hidden beneficiary of mainstream onboarding. Retail vs. Institutional Strategies These six altcoins highlight the two sides of crypto investing. On one side, institutional money gravitates toward scalable, regulated infrastructure: Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Avalanche, and Polygon. On the other, retail communities chase meme culture and scarcity dynamics, gravitating toward tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Both paths can deliver outsized gains, but the multiples often belong to the speculative side. Investors who balance exposure across both categories maximize resilience while keeping optionality open. That balance reflects how smart money approaches portfolios: anchors in infrastructure, complemented by high-risk, high-reward bets. Conclusion The hunt for 50x returns defines every crypto cycle. While Bitcoin provides stability, it‚Äôs the altcoins that offer the explosive upside retail investors crave. Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Avalanche, and Polygon each provide strong narratives tied to adoption and institutional flows. Yet the most dramatic multiples may come from projects outside the mainstream spotlight. MAGACOIN FINANCE embodies that speculative edge, audited, scarcity-driven, and powered by viral growth. For retail investors searching for the next exponential story, it represents the bold complement to infrastructure anchors. The next few years may not just be about institutions; they may be defined by how retail continues to push culture into capital.

Since then, the altcoin has maintained a steady price consolidation around the $2.78-$2.79 region, without retesting the newly formed resistance level. Meanwhile, recent on-chain data has provided some cautionary market insights, highlighting a key support zone. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers Nearly $1 Billion In Liquidations As Bitcoin Extends Decline XRP Bulls Must Avoid Crash Below $2.73 ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why In an X post on September 27, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed the existence of a price gap sitting between the $2.73 and $2.51 price levels. Central to Martinez‚Äôs revelation is the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric, which specifies how much XRP was last transacted at different price levels, but in relation to its all-time high. As an extension of its primary function, the indicator quantifies trading activity across different price levels, therefore highlighting potential support and resistance zones. According to the chart shared by Martinez, there is considerable trading activity across several XRP‚Äôs price zones. However, there is a price range closest to its current value at $2.78, within which there has been very little trading activity. This price range, set between $2.51 and $2.73, comprises relatively less market activity, creating what Martinez describes as a price gap, where little support or resistance exists. The higher boundary of the price gap is at the $2.73 level, where about 1.60 billion XRP were transacted. A fall below this price floor would likely result in a straight decline towards $2.51, as any little support lies between both price regions. Notably, XRP last touched $2.51 in July.

XRP Price Outlook As of this writing, XRP is valued at about $2.78 despite a modest 0.78% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, the altcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume is down by 58.95% and valued at $3.02 billion. According to CoinCodex, XRP is currently facing bearish sentiment, with traders showing caution amid subdued market conditions. Meanwhile, the Fear and Greed Index sits at 33, signaling fear and a lack of strong buying momentum. Over the past 30 trading sessions, XRP has recorded 13 red days, underscoring the weakness in recent performance Despite this, price predictions suggest little volatility ahead, with no significant change expected in the next five days or over the coming month. This indicates that XRP may remain range-bound as investors await clearer market signals or catalysts. With sentiment leaning negative, short-term traders may exercise caution, while long-term holders continue to monitor for potential shifts in broader crypto market dynamics.

52379800,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84560,1759053655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Retail Chatter Explodes Around the Next Big Crypto to Hit $1 Before DOGE and SHIB, Is MUTM the Name?",https://timestabloid.com/retail-chatter-explodes-around-the-next-big-crypto-to-hit-1/,"The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with activity, leaving many investors wondering what is going on with crypto today. Amid this backdrop, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a standout opportunity, offering a unique dual-lending model that combines P2C pools for stablecoins and major tokens with P2P markets for niche assets. The platform is designed to appeal to both retail participants and larger institutional actors, but its user-centric features, including a fully interactive dashboard and the Top-50 leaderboard, are set to drive a wave of retail adoption unlike anything seen in recent cycles. The dashboard allows users to track ROI, view holdings, and calculate yields, while the leaderboard rewards the largest depositors with bonus MUTM tokens, creating an engaging, gamified experience that encourages competition and inflows. Retail-Focused Mechanics Driving MUTM Adoption One of the key features attracting retail interest is Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) for stablecoin pairs. This mechanism allows everyday users to borrow more effectively within safe corridors, unlocking higher yields without increasing systemic risk. By enabling small and medium users to leverage their collateral efficiently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ensures that retail participants can generate meaningful returns on their deposits, creating a feedback loop where borrowing and lending activity supports token demand. Another major retail driver is the buy-and-distribute mechanism. Protocol revenue will be allocated to purchase MUTM on open markets and distribute rewards to mtToken stakers. Retail investors will observe this cycle as tangible proof of the platform‚Äôs commitment to supporting token value, reinforcing confidence in MUTM. As fees flow into buybacks and staking rewards, demand for MUTM will grow naturally, translating protocol activity into measurable token appreciation for everyday users. Layer-2 integration will further accelerate adoption by keeping transaction costs low and throughput high. The beta launch will provide retail users with near-feeless transactions, encouraging hands-on testing of the platform‚Äôs functionality. Early adopters will be able to experience yield generation and staking rewards firsthand, creating social proof that spreads rapidly across crypto communities. Finally, the platform‚Äôs liquidation mechanics are designed to protect small users. Clear loan-to-value ratios, transparent triggers, and treasury-backed insurance reserves reduce the risk of cascade liquidations, giving retail investors confidence that they can safely participate without fear of sudden losses. These risk management features combine with the user-friendly interface to make MUTM particularly appealing for first-time participants in crypto investing. Presale Momentum and Path to $1 Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is currently priced at $0.035, with approximately $16.4 million raised and 16,600+ holders participating. Half of the 170 million token allocation for this phase has already been claimed. The project is backed by a CertiK audit, with TokenScan scoring 90 and Skynet 79. Additional incentives include a $50,000 bug bounty and a $100,000 giveaway distributed to ten winners. Phase 7 will step the price up to $0.040, a 15% increase, highlighting the urgency for retail participants to secure entry at discounted pricing. The $1 target represents a 29X multiple from the current $0.035 price. The path to this milestone is structured and retail-driven. First, the beta launch at listing will allow early users to test the platform and verify yields, creating word-of-mouth momentum across social channels. Layer-2 efficiency will ensure low transaction costs, allowing thousands of small deposits to accumulate into a substantial total value locked, which in turn supports fee generation and buyback budgets. For example, a $1,000 allocation at Phase 6 will generate 28,600 MUTM tokens, which would be worth $28,600 once the token reaches $1. This demonstrates the tangible upside for retail investors who engage early and participate actively in platform mechanisms. The timeline for retail adoption is clear: beta launch creates hands-on experience, social channels amplify awareness, expected Tier-1 listings provide liquidity and accessibility, and the convergence of these factors drives the token toward the $1 target over the next 12 months. Phase 6 is already half sold, and the jump to $0.040 in Phase 7 underscores the need for immediate action. For retail investors looking to capitalize on crypto predictions and participate in a gamified, yield-driven ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a compelling opportunity to engage in crypto investing before DOGE and SHIB capture broader market attention. Early entry ensures participation in the buyback and staking cycles, creating consistent demand and positioning MUTM for a rapid ascent to $1.

John‚Äôs update , accompanied by fresh statistics, reveals just how concentrated XRP ownership is and how modest holdings compare against the wider base of accounts. Distribution of XRP Holdings According to the data shared, the top 0.01% of accounts hold at least 5.7 million XRP. To enter the top 0.1%, an account must have 369,080 XRP, while the 0.2% threshold is set at 200,099 XRP. The concentration becomes clearer when examining 0.5%, which is holding 100,000 XRP or more. Squire pointed out that entering the top 1% requires holding 50,637 XRP, a number far lower than many casual observers might expect. Moving to broader participation, the top 2% of accounts hold 25,639 XRP or more, while just 2,486 XRP is needed to be counted within the top 10%. This illustrates that even a relatively modest holding places investors well ahead of the majority of accounts in the ecosystem . Fresh $XRP Rich List Update Holding just 2,500 #XRP puts you in the TOP 10%. Stack 50,650 XRP and you‚Äôre in the elite 1%. Still think you‚Äôre ‚Äúfar from the goal‚Äù? Maybe you‚Äôre already miles ahead of 99%. pic.twitter.com/ticXio13SP ‚Äî John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 27, 2025 Commentary from the Community The update has generated strong interest among XRP supporters. One user, Contrarian DNA, emphasized that the significance of these figures is not in being classified as a large holder but in recognizing the broader financial implications of holding XRP. According to his perspective, a few thousand tokens represent a strategic position in what he described as foundational infrastructure designed to handle global settlement flows. He emphasized that the focus should not be on being in the top 1% of holders but rather on owning part of the top 1% of financial infrastructure. Another community member, JO, added that many people underestimate how little it actually takes to rank among the upper levels of XRP holders. He noted that even moderate holdings can place investors far ahead of most participants, suggesting that the perception of holding hundreds of thousands of tokens for significance is misplaced. XRP Accessibility and Market Positioning Squire‚Äôs data reinforces the concentration of XRP ownership and highlights the opportunity available to smaller retail investors. Being in the top 10% requires far less than many anticipate, and entering the top 1% requires holdings that are attainable for a segment of the community. This distribution indicates the asymmetric potential of XRP, as even relatively small allocations can carry substantial weight when compared to the majority of accounts. For those tracking XRP‚Äôs role in global settlement and cross-border transactions, these figures provide context for its adoption curve. The numbers suggest that early positioning does not necessarily demand outsized investment, making it accessible for participants who view XRP as a long-term part of the financial system.

Key Takeaways: Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a record $795.6 million in outflows last week, led by heavy redemptions from Fidelity‚Äôs FETH. ETH briefly dipped below $4,000, triggering the worst two-day outflow stretch since mid-August. Bitcoin ETFs also logged $902.5 million in weekly outflows, though BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT continued to hold the largest market share. According to data from SoSoValue , spot Ethereum ETFs posted $795.6 million in net outflows for the week ending September 26, narrowly surpassing the previous record of $787.7 million set earlier this month. The sell-off came amid elevated trading volumes, which topped $10 billion across the funds. Fidelity‚Äôs FETH Leads $800M Ethereum ETF Exodus The heaviest withdrawals hit BlackRock‚Äôs flagship ETHA fund and Fidelity‚Äôs FETH. ETHA, the largest Ethereum ETF by assets under management, lost over $200 million but still retains more than $15.2 billion in total assets. Meanwhile, FETH saw more than $362 million in outflows, leading the weekly slide. ETH prices briefly fell below $4,000 on Thursday and Friday, sparking two consecutive days of $250 million in redemptions from Ethereum funds, the worst 48-hour span since mid-August. Analysts attributed the sharp drop to a mix of technical pressure, broader economic uncertainty, and leveraged positions being liquidated. Ethereum has since recovered slightly and was trading near $4,020 as of Saturday. During the trading week of September 22 to 26 (ET), Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net outflows of $903 million, ending a four-week streak of inflows. Ethereum spot ETFs recorded net outflows of $796 million, with all nine funds posting redemptions. https://t.co/YcNXWVZGwE pic.twitter.com/Mgwh2QKKtr ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 28, 2025 Bitcoin ETFs also posted major outflows for the same week, with a total of $902.5 million leaving the funds. Friday alone saw $418.3 million in withdrawals, the highest single-day number in more than a month. As with Ethereum, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT fund weathered the storm better than rivals. IBIT lost just $37.3 million on Friday, while Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC saw over $300 million pulled in a single day. Despite the recent volatility, BlackRock‚Äôs bitcoin product continues to grow its dominance. Data indicates that IBIT has held as much as 80% of the market share among spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, unlike several competitors, BlackRock has yet to file for a spot Solana ETF. Solana ETF Filings Signal Institutional Momentum Several top asset managers, including Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Bitwise, have submitted updated S-1 filings for spot Solana ETFs, some with staking features. ETF analyst Nate Geraci expects the US SEC could approve them by mid-October , calling it a pivotal month for digital asset products. The filings follow the recent launch of the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange, which drew $12 million in first-day inflows. Analysts say Solana is quickly becoming the next altcoin favored by institutions, with strong inflows also reported in Europe-based Solana ETPs. Geraci and others believe the inclusion of staking language in these filings could pave the way for long-awaited spot Ethereum ETFs with staking capabilities. Meanwhile, Bitcoin exchange-traded products now hold over 1.47 million BTC , representing around 7% of the total supply, with U.S.-based ETFs dominating the landscape. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT leads with 746,810 BTC, followed by Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC at nearly 199,500 BTC, according to data from HODL15Capital.

Will there be another volatile week on the horizon? Can XRP recover some of the losses, or will it continue its downfall? Here‚Äôs what three of the most popular AI chatbots had to say. The Week Ahead for XRP September is almost over, and although it started on a positive note, it has been mostly downhill for most of the cryptocurrency market in the past ten days or so. XRP, for example, stood close to $3.20 during its monthly peak after the US Fed reduced the key interest rates for the first time in 2025. However, it failed there and quickly retested the $3 support, which actually didn‚Äôt put up much of a fight. The bears kept the pressure on, and once it cracked, XRP experienced another leg down that drove it to $2.70. This level holds significant importance in determining the asset‚Äôs future price trajectory, as many analysts believe XRP can quickly rebound as long as it remains above it. When we asked the 3 AIs (ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini) about their take on what the next week holds for XRP, OpenAI‚Äôs solution answered in a somewhat worrisome manner. It noted that the asset is a ‚Äústrong sell‚Äù on multiple websites, such as investing.com, due to the current technical setup. Grok agreed with the analysts cited above that as long as XRP holds above $2.70, the bulls might remain calm. However, it also noted that the asset needs to quickly reclaim the $2.83 resistance if it wants to challenge $3 next. Gemini said the current trading volume doesn‚Äôt support a big move upward, and it warned that a break above the coveted $3 line seems unlikely at the moment. Something for the Bulls? All three AIs agreed that after such a volatile and violent trading week, a period of consolidation is to be expected. As such, they noted that Ripple‚Äôs token is likely to remain sideways at around $2.7-$2.9 for the next week (maybe even a bit longer). However, they also admitted that one major announcement, such as a positive macro event or an approval of spot XRP ETFs in the US, could send the underlying asset flying. Recall that there are over a dozen Ripple ETF filings sitting on the SEC‚Äôs desk and most of their deadlines are set for October.

The SIMD-0370 proposal would create market-driven incentives where block producers continuously upgrade equipment to pack more transactions and earn higher revenues. Jump‚Äôs Firedancer team proposed SIMD-0370 to remove Solana‚Äôs fixed compute unit block limit after Alpenglow. Instead of a static cap (60M CUs, rising to 100M in SIMD-0286), block producers pack max transactions, and slower validators skip blocks. This drives a cycle: producers‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 28, 2025 The proposal follows Solana‚Äôs overwhelmingly approved Alpenglow consensus upgrade , which received 99.60% validator support with 149.3 million SOL voting in favor. Alpenglow introduces skip-vote mechanisms that make fixed block limits redundant by automatically bypassing blocks that take too long to execute. Under the current system, network capacity is artificially constrained by compute unit limits rather than actual validator capabilities. Firedancer argues that this creates perverse incentives, where superior hardware provides no competitive advantage, thereby stifling innovation and network growth. However, despite its innovative sound, the proposal has sparked some community debate, with critics warning about potential centralization. They argued that validators with expensive hardware could dominate, while smaller operators struggle to keep pace. Others question compatibility with future multiple concurrent proposer designs that may require synchronized execution limits. Hardware Arms Race Could Transform Network Economics The proposal would create a competitive flywheel, where block producers must continuously improve their performance to maximize transaction fees and maintain their market share. Validators running slower client software would face reduced profitability, incentivizing rapid adoption of performance improvements across the ecosystem. Firedancer developers argue that superior validator clients would capture larger market shares as operators seek higher rewards. Source: GitHub This competition would drive faster innovation cycles compared to manual limit increases that require community consensus and lengthy implementation periods. The system relies on Stackelberg competition dynamics where block producers signal network capacity through slightly larger blocks, coordinating upgrades without explicit communication. Validators unable to process these larger blocks would skip them, creating natural feedback loops that prevent excessive block sizes from forming. Critics raise concerns about centralization pressures as geographic proximity to block producers provides execution advantages. Additionally, validators requiring expensive hardware upgrades to remain competitive could exclude smaller operators from the network entirely. Community members questioned whether new validators could sync from snapshots if block complexity increases rapidly. The proposal acknowledges these risks but argues that replay performance typically exceeds block production speed, maintaining reasonable barriers for network participation. Source: GitHub Technical Hurdles Challenge Implementation Timeline Being a new proposal, developer discussions have also revealed significant concerns about compatibility with future protocol upgrades, particularly multiple concurrent proposer architectures that may require block limits for asynchronous execution. The Firedancer team argues these features remain uncertain and should not constrain current improvements. Community feedback also highlighted potential failure modes during rapid capacity scaling, including scenarios where advancing execution speeds could push networks below critical vote thresholds. Some developers suggested epoch shortening as mitigation, though this approach carries additional complexity. The proposal requires careful coordination of timeout mechanisms across different validator implementations, as execution abortion methods vary significantly between clients. Current designs must ensure proper block dissemination through networking stacks without creating bottlenecks or propagation failures. Several validators expressed support for removing artificial constraints while demanding comprehensive testing frameworks before implementation. The timing coincides with pending Solana ETF approvals , as seven major asset managers filed updated S-1 forms with regulators in late September. Several Solana ETF proposals, some including staking, could receive approval from US regulators by mid-October. #Solana #ETFs https://t.co/EgFOZctq0x ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 27, 2025 ETF analyst Nate Geraci suggested approvals could arrive by mid-October, potentially driving institutional demand for SOL tokens. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF already launched with $33 million in trading volume and $12 million in first-day inflows, demonstrating growing institutional interest. Looking forward, the removal of compute limits will be a fundamental shift toward market-based capacity scaling, which contrasts with Ethereum‚Äôs fee auction model and Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed block sizes . Although new, a successful implementation could enhance Solana‚Äôs speed and make it retain its status as a high-performance blockchain, which Ethereum and BNB Chain have been threatening lately. However, implementation risks require careful management to preserve network stability, which is not yet guaranteed, based on the current state of the community discussion.

Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency. We think it‚Äôs going to be the biggest one by far. By far,‚Äù she said. According to the conversation, Cathie separated what she called ‚Äúcryptocurrencies‚Äù from ‚Äúcrypto assets,‚Äù and placed Bitcoin at the very center of her outlook. She described Bitcoin as a monetary system built on rules, where the supply is capped at 21 million units, with about 20 million already in circulation today. She then compared Bitcoin to stablecoins, calling them cryptocurrencies but explaining that they are tied to the U.S. dollar through collateral, mostly made up of Treasury securities. Cathie said stablecoins have found their place in DeFi because they can be used to earn income. Cathie outlines stablecoin adoption and peer-to-peer finance When asked why people in cities like London or New York would even need stablecoins when they can already move dollars or pounds easily, Cathie responded that there are two dominant players in the market. ‚ÄúTether is primarily outside the United States and outside Europe now after Mika‚Äîor do you call it Micah or Mika, I don‚Äôt know. The two have 90% of the market. Circle is quote unquote more regulatory compliant certainly in the United States. And there is a Euro version of USDC in Europe which has not taken off,‚Äù she said . Cathie admitted that stablecoins had taken some of the demand away from Bitcoin , something her earlier analysis did not expect. She went further to say the real change brought by crypto is the removal of middlemen in finance. She described traditional banking as full of ‚Äútoll takers‚Äù who charge high fees. ‚ÄúFor credit cards, it‚Äôs automatic 2.5% tax on each transaction,‚Äù she said, stressing that blockchain makes those fees fall. In her view, transaction costs could eventually go down to 1% or less, compared with as high as 25% for remittances in countries like Nigeria. Cathie added that those lending out stablecoins can earn higher returns than banks would ever allow, while borrowers too small for the traditional system are finally able to access loans. She also pointed out that DeFi‚Äôs transparency makes it safer in some cases. ‚ÄúAnyone who was on-chain, their collateral was wiped out right away, meaning the financial institutions got their money back. If you were in the opaque and very centralized FTX ecosystem, you lost all your money. So it actually was safer to be on chain than to be at FTX, which of course was a fraudulent company,‚Äù said Cathie. Cathie rejects Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin and lists her holdings When Wilfred Frost brought up Tom Lee‚Äôs belief that Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin, Cathie disagreed. ‚ÄúBitcoin serves three roles. It is the global monetary system rules-based quantity rule to be sure. It is also a technology‚Äîlayer one blockchain technology never been hacked. And it is the first of its kind in a new asset class. We wrote our first white paper on that in 2016,‚Äù she explained. Cathie did acknowledge Ethereum‚Äôs importance in DeFi. She described Ether as ‚Äúthe native currency in the DeFi ecosystem‚Äù and mentioned how fees are flowing to layer twos such as Coinbase‚Äôs Base and Robinhood‚Äôs planned system. She questioned whether the growing number of layer twos would end up competing and giving more power back to the base chain. She named her firm‚Äôs main holdings, which she said are public. ‚ÄúOf course we‚Äôve got Bitcoin now in our public funds. These trades are public. So I can tell you our exposures are Bitcoin, Ether. We‚Äôre finally able to get an acceptable from a regulator‚Äôs point of view way to play Ether and we chose BitMine immersion. And then Solana is the third one,‚Äù she said. Cathie explained that Solana exposure came through Breera Sports, linked to a Solana treasury supported by the UAE and the Middle East, where her mentor Arthur Laffer sits on the board. She called Hyperliquid the ‚Äúnew kid on the block‚Äù and compared it to Solana‚Äôs early stage, while also pointing to protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and Jito.

Altseasons have delivered sudden riches, while winter periods tested even the strongest projects. Today, as the industry matures, defined upside opportunities are harder to find. XRP Tundra is stepping into that space with a presale that combines dual-token mechanics, yield generation, and liquidity protection. Instead of waiting years for incremental returns, buyers enter at clear valuations and lock in access to staking systems that can pay up to 30% APY. How One Purchase Unlocks Two Tokens The presale delivers value in a way most launches never attempt. Buyers of TUNDRA-S at $0.068 not only secure the Solana-based utility and yield token but also receive free allocations of TUNDRA-X on XRPL, valued at $0.034. On top of that, every purchase carries a 16% bonus. Launch prices are already locked in: $2.50 for TUNDRA-S and $1.25 for TUNDRA-X. For Phase 4 participants, the spread represents steep upside. Early entrants from Phase 1 and Phase 2 are positioned for more than 2,000% gains once the tokens list, underscoring how each presale stage adds value for those who joined earlier. Industry coverage, such as Crypto Nitro‚Äôs review , has pointed out how rare this kind of transparency is in presales, where buyers often wait for exchanges to set valuations. XRP Holders Finally Get Paid to Hold For the XRP community, Tundra‚Äôs biggest innovation is staking. Cryo Vaults let holders lock XRP for periods ranging from a week to three months. Returns scale with duration, reaching 30% APY. Frost Keys, distributed as NFTs, act as boosters, either increasing yields or reducing lock times. This is the first time XRP owners can earn without moving assets off the Ledger or exposing them to unsecured lending platforms. While staking is not yet active, presale participants automatically reserve their place in the system. That early access has become one of the strongest incentives for new buyers. Turning Volatility Into a Source of Yield Presales often stumble at launch, with early dumping erasing momentum. XRP Tundra addresses this through Meteora‚Äôs DAMM V2 liquidity pools. Instead of static fees, DAMM V2 begins with dynamic rates as high as 50%, discouraging bots and opportunistic dumping. Over time, fees taper down to normal trading levels, allowing for organic price discovery. Liquidity positions are tracked as NFTs, improving flexibility and enabling transfers. Permanent lock options prevent sudden withdrawals, reassuring long-term holders. Most importantly, fees collected in these pools are redirected into Cryo Vault staking. Trading activity itself becomes a source of yield, tying short-term speculation to long-term income. Audits and Identity Checks Set a Higher Bar Trust remains central in presales, and XRP Tundra has prioritized it. Smart contract audits are public from Cyberscope , Solidproof , and Freshcoins . Team identity has been confirmed through Vital Block KYC . These steps go well beyond what most presales provide. In an environment where anonymous teams and unverified contracts are common, this level of disclosure gives buyers tangible references before they commit. Why Tundra Stands Out in a Crowded Market Established tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Cardano may deliver steady appreciation, but their growth is measured in percentages, not multiples. XRP Tundra offers a different prospect: $0.068 entries today with launch values set at $2.50 and $1.25. Early participants stand to see over 2,000% gains, while Phase 4 buyers still secure a clear, steep gap to listing. Add in Cryo Vault staking, Frost Keys, and DAMM V2 liquidity protection, and the presale represents more than speculation ‚Äî it‚Äôs an ecosystem built to reward patience and participation. Among the crowded field of ‚Äúbest cryptos to buy now,‚Äù XRP Tundra stands apart by combining upside with verifiable safeguards.

Unemployment rate is still at 4.3% and according to a Bloomberg survey, only about 50,000 job positions were added in September 2025. US lawmakers are still under pressure to pass the spending bill or risk causing a federal shutdown. However, a shutdown could delay Friday‚Äôs report, giving a fresh read on whether demand for workers is holding steady enough to keep unemployment from rising further. Companies have reduced the number of new employees over tariffs. The Fed delivered its first rate cut of 2025 this month to address signs of job market strain. Markets are also expecting another reduction after the October 29 meeting. Lately, companies have been pulling back on hiring to balance out costs such as import duties. Tuesday‚Äôs government figures are expected to confirm that August job vacancies fell close to their lowest since 2021. Traders will also watch for the Institute for Supply Management‚Äôs September readings on factory and services sectors next week. In the meantime, investors are monitoring any last-minute developments before a possible federal shutdown and its potential fallout. North of the border, the Bank of Canada will share a summary of the talks behind its recent rate cut and may signal whether another cut is likely next month. Markets will also track inflation trends in the euro area and Switzerland, several central bank speeches, and India‚Äôs possible policy easing.

Key Takeaways: Samson Mow says countries are shifting from gradual to sudden Bitcoin adoption, with panic-buying likely on the horizon. The US has signed an executive order for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve but hasn‚Äôt started buying yet. Mow believes the current Bitcoin bull cycle is delayed, possibly extending into 2026. Speaking on the What Bitcoin Did podcast , Mow said governments are shifting from slow, cautious steps to more decisive moves. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre on the tail end of gradually, and we‚Äôre at the beginning phases of suddenly,‚Äù Mow told host Danny Knowles. ‚ÄúThese things happen very quickly‚Ä¶ literally gradually then suddenly.‚Äù He believes the world is approaching a point where national governments begin panic-buying Bitcoin to avoid being left behind. Trump Signed the Order, But US Hasn‚Äôt Started Buying Bitcoin Yet Mow pointed to the United States as a key example. While President Donald Trump has already signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the government has not yet begun actively accumulating BTC. However, Mow noted that the US is ‚Äúpushing forward‚Äù with its acquisition strategy and advancing the Bitcoin Act. Galaxy Digital‚Äôs Alex Thorn recently said it‚Äôs likely the U.S. will formalize its Bitcoin reserve by the end of the year. As of now, the U.S. government holds 198,012 BTC, according to Bitbo data. The concept of nation-state Bitcoin adoption has picked up momentum throughout the year. In January, Fidelity Digital Assets predicted more governments and sovereign wealth funds would begin positioning themselves in Bitcoin. Despite this, Bitcoin‚Äôs price action in 2025 hasn‚Äôt matched expectations. ‚ÄúWe should have had a bull run already,‚Äù Mow said. ‚ÄúLike a massive run up.‚Äù He believes the current cycle is delayed and could extend into 2026. Bitcoin is currently trading at $109,400, down nearly 2% over the past month. Analysts continue to debate whether the traditional four-year cycle still applies in a market shaped by ETFs, institutional inflows, and growing state-level interest. Just three months ago, Mow said a $1 million Bitcoin price was ‚Äúa given‚Ä¶ maybe this year, maybe next year.‚Äù That timeline may now be shifting, but the larger trend, he insists, remains intact. $1M Bitcoin in 2026 Would Signal US Economic Crisis As reported, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has pushed back on predictions that Bitcoin could hit $1 million in the near term, warning that such a move would likely reflect a collapse in the US economy rather than a crypto success story. ‚ÄúPeople who cheer for the million-dollar Bitcoin price next year, I was like, guys, it only gets there if we‚Äôre in such a shitty place domestically,‚Äù Novogratz told Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast last week. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have a lower Bitcoin price in a more stable United States than the opposite.‚Äù Novogratz explained that extreme currency devaluations often fuel demand for alternative safe havens, and Bitcoin, often dubbed digital gold, becomes a hedge against economic turmoil. However, he cautioned that such conditions would come at the expense of civil society. Last month, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms.

Here‚Äôs the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/legendary-bitcoin-investor-predicts-xrp-rally-to-25-heres-the-timeline/,"As 2026 approaches, speculation surrounding XRP‚Äôs potential has intensified, with bold forecasts emerging. Among the latest comes from a long-time Bitcoin investor known as Pumpius, who has been active in the industry since 2013. The veteran crypto trader suggested that XRP could climb to $25 before the end of 2025, a target that would place the asset in the same trillion-dollar league as Bitcoin. The comment was made during a community discussion initiated by X user Chain Cartel, who asked his followers to share their predictions for XRP‚Äôs price as the year draws to an end. Pumpius‚Äôs projection would require more than nine times the gains from current levels and stands out as one of the most ambitious forecasts circulating within the community in recent weeks. #XRP to $25 before 2026 https://t.co/7GMFJ9psR9 ‚Äî Pumpius (@pumpius) September 24, 2025 Other prominent voices in the market have put forward similar targets. Analyst Alex Cobb previously indicated that XRP might reach $22 by December , while more cautious commentators have suggested that $10 is a more realistic ceiling. Many of these optimistic views were made earlier in the year when XRP was closer to its highs in January and July. Since then, weaker price action has tempered much of the bullish momentum, though strong expectations remain among certain sections of the community. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP‚Äôs Path Presently, XRP is priced at $2.77, representing a decline of over 8% during the past week. The token has been under pressure since July, and many traders are watching October closely for signs of recovery. A key factor shaping sentiment is the prospect of regulatory approval for XRP ETFs, which some industry leaders argue could attract billions of dollars in inflows. Canary Capital‚Äôs CEO has supported this view , noting that such developments could lend weight to predictions of double-digit valuations in the near term. Despite this, the broader market remains cautious. The Fear & Greed Index is currently at 32, showing prevailing bearish conditions. As the countdown to 2026 continues, the XRP community remains divided between ambitious long-term projections and near-term caution. Pumpius‚Äôs forecast of $25 sets a bold benchmark. While market conditions remain uncertain, it reflects the strong belief among some investors that XRP still has the potential to achieve historic gains.

Data from SoSoValue shows $800m left in Ethereum ETFs in 5 days, the largest weekly outflow on record. The heaviest selling occurred on Thursday to Friday, when ETH dipped below $4,000. Fidelity‚Äôs Ethereum Fund : lost $360m BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA Fund : lost $200m Daily exits : $250m+ on consecutive days Despite institutional selling, Ethereum held up. By Sunday, ETH was back above $4,000. Buyers still see value at these levels. The bounce is not just retail dip buying but long-term investor conviction that Ethereum‚Äôs fundamentals (decentralized finance and enterprise adoption) are still intact. Fear Index Signals Caution but Creates Opportunity While Ethereum fought back from ETF-driven losses, broader sentiment remains fragile. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index currently stands at 34, a reading that is deep in the ‚Äúfear‚Äù zone. Historically, such pessimism can discourage short-term buying, yet it has also marked attractive entry points for contrarian investors. Macroeconomic headwinds add to the uncertainty. A stronger U.S. dollar, hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve, and renewed volatility across equities all weigh on digital assets. Still, Ethereum‚Äôs ability to stay anchored above $4,000 during heightened stress highlights the psychological importance of this line in the sand. BTC & ETH Spot ETFs saw heavy outflows yesterday. BTC ETFs: ~$418.3M net outflows ETH ETFs: ~$248.4M net outflows Institutional money stepping back‚Äîmarkets feeling the heat. pic.twitter.com/72X6abrSUB ‚Äî Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) September 27, 2025 In effect, ETH‚Äôs price action is caught between two forces: Negative drag from institutional outflows and global risk aversion Positive support from retail demand and contrarian sentiment in fearful markets This tug-of-war underscores why $4,000 is seen as a ‚Äúwar zone‚Äù level for Ethereum in the near term. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Price Forecast: Technical Signals From a technical perspective, Ethereum price prediction remains in a cautious stance. The breakdown from a symmetrical triangle in mid-September confirmed weakness, with support levels tested repeatedly. The 50- and 100-period moving averages now slope downward, reinforcing the bearish bias. Candlestick formations add nuance. A sequence of long red candles‚Äîa pattern resembling ‚Äúthree black crows‚Äù‚Äîconfirmed sustained selling. Recent Doji and small-bodied candles near $3,975 reflect indecision, though long lower shadows hint at attempts to stabilize. Ethereum Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview The RSI at 41 has climbed from oversold levels, suggesting room for relief rallies without signaling a decisive reversal. Key levels to watch include: Resistance: $4,167 and $4,290 Support: $3,853, $3,733, and $3,590 For traders, two scenarios stand out. Aggressive buyers could position near $3,850‚Äì$3,900, targeting a bounce toward $4,167 and $4,290 with stops just below $3,730. A safer approach is waiting for a confirmed daily close above $4,290 to re-enter long positions. Conversely, a decisive breakdown under $3,850 would likely accelerate losses toward $3,590. For now, Ethereum‚Äôs ability to defend $4,000 amid heavy selling speaks to its resilience. If sentiment improves and institutional pressure eases, ETH may yet turn this psychological battleground into the foundation for its next rally.

According to the new rules, stablecoin transactions will now be capped for individuals and firms amid the return of UN sanctions. According to the statement, Iran has directed that annual purchases should not exceed $5,000 per person, with total holdings expected to remain at $10,000. According to Asghar Abolhasani, secretary of the High Council, the decision was adopted during the Central Bank‚Äôs High Council session this week, and it will apply to all traders and users on licensed digital platforms . In addition, he mentioned that the implementation period should not be more than the one-month transition period. Iran sets new stablecoin purchase limit Speaking to Iranian state TV, Abolhasani said those already holding stablecoins have been given a brief period to comply with the new directive. ‚ÄúFrom now on, the ceiling for purchasing stablecoins is set at $5,000 per user annually, and holdings cannot exceed $10,000,‚Äù Abolhasani said. ‚ÄúThe important point is that regarding stablecoins currently in possession, a maximum one-month transition period has been set, during which the authorized ceiling for holdings must be observed,‚Äù he added. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to traditional currencies, with the tokens in this case being tokens developed by Tether and pegged to the United States dollar (USDT); others include Circle‚Äôs USDC, with these assets available on different blockchains. In Iran, USDT has become a lifeline for households and traders seeking to protect their savings from inflation or to move money abroad. This method offers them stability of the US dollar without the barriers of the formal banking system. The new restriction comes as the rial has continued to collapse, hitting an all-time low of 1,136,500 against the US dollar on Saturday. The national currency is expected to continue its losing streak amid the looming threat of the renewal of UN sanctions and worsening public confidence in government controls. Stablecoins like Tether have increased in popularity in the country since conflict broke out with the United States and Israel earlier this year. For many people, making these conversions has been the only way to preserve value. Residents blame the government for their woes The new cap restrictions are expected to affect thousands of small traders who have been making a living in crypto, with anticipation growing over the kind of penalties they could face if they can‚Äôt reduce their stablecoin holdings in time. The central bank‚Äôs move mirrors past efforts to reduce demand and dependence on foreign currency during sharp market downturns. In earlier crises, authorities restricted access to dollars and gold in hopes of stabilizing the rial, with the measures having little effect. Iran‚Äôs currency has steadily depreciated over the past decade, battered by sanctions, mismanagement, and inflation. In addition to its currency crisis, residents have also dealt with the energy crisis over the past few months. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, residents blamed the actions of crypto miners and their numerous operations in the country as the main source of the issues. The issue also caused a small number of vocal groups to take to the streets in vocal demonstrations against the government. Residents have also blamed the government, accusing cartels led by the Khamenei regime of trying to make profits with scarce energy resources. The residents claimed that most of these activities are coming at a time when the country is going through several issues, highlighting the war. Meanwhile, Iranian officials have claimed that most of the issues were a result of illegal miners and the country is taking proactive steps to curb their activities.

Specifically, analysis by Ted Pillows indicates that with limited movement, the leading digital currency is showing signs of acting like a stablecoin , which could be the calm before volatility, he said in an X post on September 28. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ted Pillows According to his insights, at the current level, the $107,000 mark stands as immediate support. If that area fails to hold, Pillows noted that Bitcoin could fall toward the $100,000 zone, where stronger demand is expected. On the flip side, reclaiming $113,500 would put bulls back in control, opening the way toward $118,000 and potentially the $124,000 resistance. Bitcoin price remains in the chop zone Meanwhile, analysis by BitBull offered another outlook for Bitcoin amid the current indecision by traders. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView According to the analyst, the $111,972 mark is the key threshold for bulls. A break above would shift momentum back toward the upper channel and potentially confirm a bullish continuation. Below that, Bitcoin remains in the ‚Äúchop zone,‚Äù where sideways consolidation dominates. On the downside, the analyst noted that $105,100 stands as the next major support. A drop to this level would reinforce the bearish channel that has guided price action since mid-August. In general, the Bitcoin setup looks bearish in the short term, though such setups have historically preceded strong rallies. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $109,423, having rallied about 0.01% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeline, BTC has corrected over 5%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Notably, at the current valuation, Bitcoin is positioned below its 50-day Simple Moving Average ( SMA ) of $114,166. This suggests a short-term bearish trend, as the price is underperforming relative to recent average values. The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 37.72, indicating that Bitcoin is approaching oversold territory.

Notably, security experts have speculated that the attacker‚Äôs methodical approach suggests a high level of knowledge of the protocol‚Äôs internal mechanics and smart contract architecture. They noted the stolen funds were quickly moved off-chain through deBridge, a cross-chain protocol that facilitates asset transfers between different blockchain networks. HyperDrive‚Äôs team reached out to the exploiter on-chain, offering a 10% white-hat bounty in exchange for returning the remaining funds. The protocol suspended all market operations and withdrawal functions to prevent additional malicious activity while investigating the full scope of the compromise. The incident prompted broader security reviews across Hyperliquid‚Äôs ecosystem, as multiple projects building on the platform face increased scrutiny following the recent wave of exploits and rug pulls. Hyperliquid Ecosystem Under Siege From Multiple Threats The HyperDrive exploit compounds pressure on Hyperliquid following the devastating HyperVault rug pull just 48 hours earlier , where developers vanished with $3.6 million after depositing stolen ETH into Tornado Cash. The HyperVault scam ignored early community warnings about fabricated audit claims from respected firms. Previous security incidents include the March JELLY token manipulation that cost Hyperliquid‚Äôs vault $13.5 million through artificial price pumping and leveraged position exploitation. The ‚ÄúETH 50x Big Guy‚Äù trader similarly netted $1.8 million profit while causing $4 million in vault losses. These attacks occur as ASTER DEX challenges Hyperliquid‚Äôs market dominance, processing over $13 billion in daily perpetual futures volume compared to Hyperliquid‚Äôs reduced activity. Additionally, ASTER has recently integrated Trust Wallet , providing 100 million users with direct access to perpetual contracts. Arthur Hayes previously exited his entire HYPE position for $823,000 profit, citing massive token unlocks worth $11.9 billion starting November 29. He recently polled his followers about re-entering HYPE after the token dropped 23% in a week to $35.50. Despite security challenges, Hyperliquid launched its native USDH stablecoin on September 24, generating $2.2 million in early trading volume. Native Markets secured the stablecoin issuance mandate after defeating established players, including Paxos and Ethena Labs, through competitive governance voting.

These tokens combine blockchain with practical use cases. Ozak AI ($OZ) is getting traction with its AI-powered ecosystem and active presale. Along with $OZ coins like XLM, DOGE, HBAR, CRO, ENA, and ONDO are being monitored for market relevance and adoption. Ozak AI ($OZ) Ozak AI merges artificial intelligence with decentralized networks to deliver predictive analytics for financial markets. Its core features include the Ozak Stream Network (OSN) for real-time data, DePIN for secure handling, Ozak Data Vaults for storage, and customizable Prediction Agents (PAs) for user-defined insights. The project has confirmed integration with Pyth Network, which supplies real-time financial data from 120+ providers across 100+ blockchains. With 1,600+ feeds and sub-second latency, this enhances the accuracy of Ozak AI‚Äôs forecasts and risk tools. The $OZ presale is live in Phase 6 at $0.012 with 923 million tokens sold and $3.47 million raised. The next phase will price tokens at $0.014 with a $1 target. A minimum $100 contribution is required. Tokenomics allocates 30% to presale, 30% to ecosystem, 20% to reserves, 10% to liquidity, and 10% to the team. OZ powers platform transactions, governance, Prediction Agents, and rewards. Stellar Lumens (XLM) XLM is the native currency of the Stellar network, which is an open-source network that facilitates low-cost and fast cross-border payments. It works with the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which authenticates transactions without mining. XLM wins over accounts using reserve requirements and asset bridging in making financial transfers. Dogecoin (DOGE) DOGE was introduced in 2013 as a token that is inspired by memes but has progressed to become a recognized digital asset. Built on a proof-of-work protocol with Scrypt hashing, it processes decentralized transactions. DOGE is often used for tipping creators, crowdfunding, and payment transfers across merchants and platforms. Hedera (HBAR) HBAR operates on the Hedera network, which uses hashgraph technology instead of blockchain to process activity. It incurs transaction and contract charges and safeguards the system through proof-of-stake consensus. Hedera supports enterprise-grade decentralization applications that need speed, security, and low costs. Cronos (CRO) CRO is the indigenous token of the Cronos blockchain, which Crypto.com created as the DeFi and NFT platform. It is used for staking, transaction fees, and governance. Cronos is compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) applications and interoperable with the Cosmos ecosystem. Ethena (ENA) ENA is the governance and utility token for Ethena, which issues the cryptonative stablecoin USDe. Unlike traditional stablecoins, USDe is backed by crypto collateral and short futures positions. ENA holders guide protocol upgrades, elect committees, and earn rewards by staking into sENA. Ondo Finance (ONDO) ONDO is the utility token of Ondo Finance, a project that tokenizes real-world assets such as U.S. Treasuries. It grants the right of governance in Ondo DAO and creates a connector between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Conclusion The tokens below the $1 market show potential and existing networks with useful applications. The group is led by Ozak AI , which has its AI-powered analytics, presale momentum, and Pyth integration. In addition to the use of $OZ projects like XLM, DOGE, HBAR, CRO, ENA, and ONDO, which remain highly sought after due to their functions in the payments sector, their functions in governance, and decentralized finance.

Mow‚Äôs statement came during an interview with What Bitcoin Did‚Äôs Danny Knowles, where he said that the current cycle is behind schedule and that we should‚Äôve had a bull run by now. He also said that the current bear cycle could expand into 2026, but that, eventually, we‚Äôll get a massive push, driven by institutional FOMO: I believe it‚Äôs simply a matter of time before we see a massive runup and we see a massive nation-state FOMO panic. ‚Äî Samson Mow, What Bitcoin Did interview Mow believes that Bitcoin‚Äôs growth is inevitable and it‚Äôs all due to US‚Äôs pro-crypto legislation, with the GENIUS Act at the core of it. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will also contribute to Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term success. As Bitcoin‚Äôs Layer 2 upgrade, Hyper promises faster and cheaper transactions, making the Bitcoin network more feasible for institutional investors. Bitcoin Flatlines at $109K as Talks of Global Adoption Ramp Up Bitcoin has been flatlined at little over $109K for three days now and it shows no signs of recovery. However, the fact that the downward momentum stopped, following the brutal dip after the last FOMC meeting is already bullish. This hints at a consolidation period, which will likely ramp up during Q4, especially with more nation-states ramping up their hoarding. As Mow was declaring back in March 2023 , every nation state should have at least 200,000 $BTC in their treasuries. The argument was that it‚Äôs unacceptable that Strategy, with its reserve of 132,500 Bitcoins, dwarfs nation-states. The disparity has increased since then, with Strategy now holding 639,835 $BTC , valued at over $73B. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries , this places it first on the list of companies with the largest Bitcoin reserves. By comparison, the US currently holds 198,012 Bitcoins after selling 9,177 of them in December, 2024. Fortunately, things are changing fast. A report by Fidelity Digital Assets titled ‚Äò2025: Look Ahead‚Äô stated that: [‚Ä¶=] It may be too late for the speculators that want another frenzy. However, we believe we are still incredibly early in terms of this new era of sustainable adoption, diffusion, and integration. ‚Äî Fidelity Digital Assets, 2023: Look Ahead With Bitcoin still far from reaching its true potential, we also need to look at Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and how it promises to change the Bitcoin ecosystem. How Bitcoin Hyper Lifts Bitcoin to New Performance Standards Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to solve Bitcoin‚Äôs performance limitation, currently at seven transactions per second (TPS), and remove the fee-based priority system, which sometimes raises confirmation times to hours. In its quest for a faster and cheaper Bitcoin network, Hyper relies on tools like Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and the Canonical Bridge to improve scalability, lower finality times to seconds, and eliminate network congestion. The Canonical Bridge is at the core of it, connecting Hyper to the Bitcoin ecosystem and minting the users‚Äô tokens into Hyper‚Äôs Layer 2. The wrapped Bitcoins are available for use on Layer 2 indefinitely, or until users decide to withdraw them to Bitcoin‚Äôs native layer. Together with the Bitcoin Relay Program, which verifies and confirms incoming transactions near instantly, the Bridge makes the Bitcoin network more responsive and performant for faster and cheaper transactions. This translates to sky-high scalability, which is the real prize. The increased scalability removes the fee-based priority system, which currently prioritizes larger and more fee-heavy transactions, with the smaller and cheaper ones often experiencing confirmation times of hours. Long-term, Hyper plans to make Bitcoin a more feasible option for institutional investors and open the road to mainstream adoption. The presale is growing fast, having raised over $18.6M so far with $HYPER valued at $0.012985. Based on its utility and long-term roadmap, $HYPER could reach $0.32 by the end of the year. Our five-year price prediction for $HYPER is $1.50, given successful implementation and community support. If you want to invest, learn how to buy $HYPER here, then go to the presale page and get your tokens today. Based on the presale numbers, we believe $HYPER to be the best crypto to buy in 2025. This isn‚Äôt financial advice. Do your own research (DYOR) and invest wisely.

Speaking as a panelist, he said the companies are effectively ‚Äúprinting money‚Äù by keeping the yield from the U.S. Treasuries backing their tokens. Tether, for example, reported $4.9 billion in net profit in the second quarter of the year. That has seen the company‚Äôs valuation soar to a reported $500 billion in a new funding round. As interest rates remain elevated, Reecer suggested it‚Äôs only a matter of time before users expect a share of that yield or move their funds elsewhere. Platforms like M^0 and Agora are already responding to that demand, he suggested. These projects allow stablecoin infrastructure to be built in a way that routes yield to applications or directly to end users, instead of the issuer capturing all of it. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm holding USDC, I‚Äôm losing money, losing money that Circle is making,‚Äù Reecer said in the session, referring to the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding token that‚Äôs backed by U.S. Treasuries generating income. Tether and Circle likely do not share the yield generated from their stablecoins directly with users as doing so could draw the ire of regulators. An alternative that‚Äôs steadily growing are money market funds, which allow investors to gain exposure to the yield behind these stablecoins. Circle, it‚Äôs worth noting, acquired Hashnote earlier this year for $1.3 billion, the issuer of the tokenized money market fund USYC. With this acquisition, Circle aims to enable convertibility between cash and yield-bearing collateral on blockchains. These money market funds, however, are still a fraction of the stablecoin market. According to RWA.xyz data, their market capitalization currently stands around $7.3 billion, while the global stablecoin market has topped $290 billion. A Tether spokesperson told CoinDesk that ‚ÄúUSDT‚Äôs role is clear: it is a digital dollar, not an investment product.‚Äù He added that ‚Äúhundreds of millions of people‚Äù rely on USDT, especially in emerging markets, ‚Äúwhere it serves as a lifeline against inflation, banking instability, and capital controls.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhile few percentage points might make the difference for rich Americans or Europeans, the real savings for our USDT user base is the one against dramatic inflation so common in developing countries - often reaching numbers as high as 50% to 90% year-over-year, with declines of local currency values against the US dollar at 70% year-over-year,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPassing along yield would fundamentally change a stablecoin's nature, risk profile, and regulatory treatment,‚Äù the spokesperson added. ‚ÄúCompetitors experimenting with yield-bearing stablecoins are targeting a completely different audience, and they take on additional risks.‚Äù Fireblocks' Stephen Richardson, during the panel, said the broader stablecoin market is meanwhile evolving toward real-world use cases, including cross-border payments and FX services. He pointed out that tokenized money moving instantly could help solve problems that exist today, such as slow corporate payment rails or expensive remittances. Financial innovation, Richardson added, is already being seen in the sector, with an example being tokenized money market funds that are being used as collateral on exchanges.",Finance|Tether|Circle|Stablecoins|Wormhole|Exclusive|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|USDT|MARKET|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-28 12:00:00

Mow spoke on the What Bitcoin Did podcast hosted by Danny Knowles, giving insight into these issues and others connected to the leading digital asset. During the podcast, Mow noted that we are towards the tail end when it comes to BTC adoption among countries. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre on the tail end of gradually, and we‚Äôre at the beginning phases of suddenly,‚Äù Mow said. Discussing the potential for more countries to follow that path, Mow noted that these things happen very quickly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like literally gradually then suddenly,‚Äù he said. He also added, ‚ÄúI think it is simply a matter of time before we see a massive run-up, and we see a massive nation-state FOMO, you know, panic.‚Äù Bitcoin adoption could skyrocket among countries soon In his statement, Mow mentioned that while United States President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to establish the country‚Äôs Strategic BTC Reserves, the US has yet to begin buying the asset. However, he added that the country is moving forward with budget-neutral Bitcoin acquisition and the Bitcoin Act . This means that the country will only acquire Bitcoin using existing assets and forfeited assets. This stance was backed by Alex Thorn, Galaxy Digital‚Äôs head of firmwide research, noting that there is a high likelihood that the United States government will form the highly anticipated Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the end of the year. ‚ÄúI still think there‚Äôs a strong chance the US government will announce this year that it has formed the strategic Bitcoin reserve (SBR) and is formally holding BTC as a strategic asset,‚Äù Thorn said in an X post. While the United States still leads other governments in total BTC holdings, Mow previously mentioned that the country needs to start purchasing new Bitcoin this year. He mentioned that it would be ironic and unfortunate for the United States and the Trump administration, which took bold steps to push this forward, to be front-run by other countries that are inspired by their actions. ‚ÄúThe risk is that the US is front-run by Pakistan,‚Äù he explained. Analysts expect a big Bitcoin push in 2026 Mow also said he anticipates a big BTC push from the Latin American region, noting that it is one of the areas that he is most bullish on. Bitcoin adoption among countries has been one of the most discussed topics since the beginning of the year. In a research paper released by Fidelity Digital Assets in January, it mentioned that more countries, sovereign wealth funds, central banks, and government treasuries will look to establish strategic positions in Bitcoin . Meanwhile, Mow has mentioned that in terms of price, BTC has failed to perform as many experts and analysts predicted that it would in 2025. He added that, going by what they said before the start of the year, we should have already had a bull run, noting that they predicted a massive run-up before the start of the year. ‚ÄúSo I think this cycle, if you want to call it a cycle, is delayed; it might push into next year,‚Äù he said. The same sentiment has been echoed by other analysts and experts over the last few months. In July, Matt Hougan, Bitwise chief investment officer, mentioned that he feels 2026 is a bullish year for BTC. ‚ÄúI broadly think we‚Äôre in for a good few years,‚Äù Hougan said. BTC is trading around $109,300, down by 1.9% over the past month, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

However, the second-largest cryptocurrency has struggled to build on this record-setting momentum in September. With September and the third quarter of 2025 almost done, the Ethereum price appears to be struggling to reclaim the psychological $4,000 support level. Below are the critical support levels to watch for should a deeper correction occur, according to the latest on-chain data. Is $3,500 The Next Stop For ETH Price? In a September 27 post on the X platform, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified three major support levels to watch if the Ethereum price further declines over the next few weeks. This on-chain observation revolves around the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric, which estimates the amount of a specific cryptocurrency acquired at a certain price level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Crashes To Lowest Level Since March ‚Äì Why This Is Good News This indicator looks at a price level‚Äôs capacity to act as an on-chain support or resistance zone, which typically depends on the number of investors with their cost basis at the given level. An investor‚Äôs cost basis refers to the original price at which they bought a crypto asset (Ether, in this scenario). Based on the cost basis theory, major support zones are often around price levels‚Äîwith significant buying activity‚Äîbelow the current spot value. Having purchased their assets at these prices, several investors tend to double down and purchase more assets when the price returns to their cost basis, thereby keeping the prices afloat. According to data highlighted by Martinez, the next major support levels for the Ethereum price lie around $3,515, $3,020, and $2,772. As observed in the chart below, if the price of ETH doesn‚Äôt have a sustained close above $4,000, its next immediate support cushion is around $,3,515, where nearly 1.39 billion coins were purchased. In a case where the ‚Äúking of altcoins‚Äù fails to stop bleeding, the UTXO Realized Price Distribution metric shows that the next major support is at $3,020, where almost 2.65 billion coins were bought. Now, the last significant support for the Ethereum price lies around $2,772, which is the cost basis of more than 2.64 billion Ether tokens. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $3,994, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. While the largest altcoin by market cap seems to be hanging on to the major $4,000 level, its performance over the past week is still quite worrying. According to data from CoinGecko, the Ethereum price is down by more than 10% in the last seven days.

Amid recent losses, which saw the ETH decline by 10.66% over the week, PlanD backs the altcoin market leader to reach a potential $21,000 price target by end of 2025. Ethereum Ready For Surge As Triangle, Head & Shoulder Pattern Combines In an X post on September 27, PlanD provides a long-term price analysis of the Ethereum market, highlighting strong bullish potential. Over the last quarter, ETH has shown a strong price performance, breaking out of a four-year-long symmetrical triangle to establish a new all-time high at $4,953. For context, the symmetrical triangle is a neutral chart pattern that forms when the price consolidates between two converging trendlines. When price breaks above the upper descending trendline, i.e., resistance as seen in the Ethereum market, it is usually interpreted as a bullish signal. In line with the classic technical structure, PlanD further explains that the recent price decline over the past two weeks aligns with an expected retest of ‚Äúthis resistance‚Äù around $3,900. Having successfully bounced off this price zone, which now functions as a price floor, the analyst states that Ethereum has now resumed its uptrend, with the first major target being $5,900, which emerged from an inverse head and shoulders pattern (H&S) The inverse head and shoulders is a bullish reversal chart pattern often seen after a downtrend. It signals that the market may be shifting from bearish to bullish momentum. This is clearly seen in the ETH price behavior so far in 2025. PlanD explains that if Ethereum successfully achieves the $5,900 inverse H&S target, the altcoin is expected to initiate a rally towards the symmetrical triangle formation‚Äôs major target of $21,000 by the end of 2025. Ethereum Market Overview At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,001 with almost no price change in the last day. However, market trading volume has dropped 58.67%, indicating weaker participation and declining short-term momentum. According to blockchain analytics company Sentora , total network fees fell 3.9% week-on-week, suggesting reduced on-chain activity and lower demand for block space.¬†Meanwhile, exchange netflows recorded ‚Äì$3.08 billion week-on-week, meaning more Ethereum was withdrawn from exchanges than deposited, a generally bullish signal as it points to accumulation rather than selling pressure.

A recent post by Algopear co-founder HighVibeAssets highlighted how years of opportunity for retail investors to accumulate cryptocurrencies have now transitioned into a period where large-scale institutional adoption is becoming the dominant force. The emphasis was on the involvement of major names such as Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Citigroup, which signals a significant structural change in the market. This transition could prove highly beneficial for XRP, as institutions are increasingly seeking assets with both compliance readiness and real-world financial utility. YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE TO ACCUMULATE #CRYPTO FOR YEARS, NOW YOU WONT EVEN GET A PORTION MORGAN STANLEY, BLACKROCK, CITI GROUP & MORE, LARGE INSTITUTIONS FULL AHEAD OF STEAM INTO #CRYPTO #XRP HOLDERS HIT THE FINANCIAL JACKPOT! pic.twitter.com/y3tw4Fm3an ‚Äî HighVibeAssets AlgoPearRich (@HighVibeAssets) September 24, 2025 Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Crypto Integration The timing of Morgan Stanley‚Äôs decision to expand crypto services through E-Trade represents a broader evolution of mainstream finance. In a Bloomberg discussion shared alongside the post, commentators explained how Morgan Stanley is not necessarily first but is positioning itself within the current regulatory framework that appears more favorable for banks. The move is described as one of the first notable announcements where a traditional financial institution partners with a crypto trading firm to provide clients with direct access. Developments like this reinforce the idea that institutional adoption will increasingly prioritize cryptocurrencies with established settlement and payment functions, such as XRP. XRP‚Äôs design as a fast, low-cost solution for cross-border transactions positions it well to benefit from the same financial institutions that are now entering the crypto space. By integrating crypto through familiar platforms like E-Trade, Morgan Stanley is not only broadening access but also creating an environment where utility-driven assets such as XRP can gain recognition beyond speculation. Regulatory Climate and Institutional Confidence The commentary from Bloomberg further highlighted that this decision reflects a more supportive regulatory environment. Analysts suggested that the new framework may encourage more banks to partner with crypto firms, providing legitimacy and increased accessibility. The conversation acknowledged the volatility that has historically defined the crypto market, but also emphasized that financial advisors and client education will play a role in helping investors manage risks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This evolving climate could be particularly bullish for XRP as institutions are expected to favor assets that align with regulatory clarity and established use cases in financial infrastructure. As XRP continues to see integration in payment corridors and adoption by financial service providers, it offers the type of utility that banks and wealth managers may prioritize when building diversified client portfolios. In this context, XRP could emerge as one of the primary beneficiaries of institutional entry. A Market Entering a New Phase The message from HighVibeAssets underlines a critical transition point in the digital asset sector. What was once largely an opportunity for independent accumulation has evolved into a market where institutions play an increasingly central role. With Morgan Stanley‚Äôs move into crypto through E-Trade and the broader involvement of firms such as BlackRock and Citigroup, the industry is entering a phase where mainstream adoption is not theoretical but actively unfolding. For XRP, this normalization process presents an opportunity to shift investor perception. As institutions seek assets that can serve as more than speculative instruments, XRP‚Äôs proven efficiency in global payments may attract significant institutional allocation.

Appearing on ‚ÄúThe Master Investor Podcast‚Äù hosted by Wilfred Frost, Wood detailed why she believes Bitcoin will always be the number one cryptocurrency. According to Wood, there won't be many cryptocurrencies on the market, and Bitcoin already owns the ‚Äúpure crypto‚Äù space. The famous investor believes that Bitcoin will always be the biggest by far among all its other competitors. Wood explains the main feature that makes Bitcoin superior as ‚Äúa rules-based monetary system‚Äù: ‚ÄúBitcoin is a monetary system, it's based on rules. The rule is the quantity theory of money: it will stop at 21 million units. We're currently at about 20 million units. That's the quantity theory.‚Äù Countering the predictions of some analysts like Tom Lee that Ethereum (ETH) will surpass Bitcoin's market capitalization, Wood argues that Bitcoin will always be ahead thanks to its three key roles: Global Monetary System: Serving as a rules-based, global monetary system. Layer 1 Blockchain Technology: The most secure blockchain technology, known for never having been hacked. Wood notes that other blockchains cannot make this claim. The First Example of a New Asset Class: Bitcoin is the pioneer of a brand new asset class. Related News: JUST IN: Binance Futures Lists a New Altcoin Wood acknowledges that ETH plays a significant role supporting the DeFi world, adding that Ark Invest has positions in Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana in its public funds. Referring to gold, a traditional store of value, Wood said Ark Invest doesn't include gold in its portfolio because its focus is on technology-backed disruptive innovation. He takes gold's performance seriously, but believes this time around the rise may be related to geopolitical risks rather than inflation. He added that wealthy individuals, especially older generations, may turn to gold instead of digital assets during times of uncertainty. *This is not investment advice.

52384034,591199,1759061378,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52384034.jpeg,Solana Staking ETFs Could Be Approved in 2 Weeks ‚Äì Why $SNORT Could Be the Biggest Beneficiary,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-staking-etfs-approval-in-2-weeks-why-snort-biggest-beneficiary/,"Although Solana is often discussed in the same breath as Bitcoin and Ethereum, it hasn‚Äôt yet reached their level of mainstream investor interest or explosive price action. That said, a recent development could very well put Solana next in line for its institutional moment . ETF analyst Nate Geraci noted that a flurry of applications for Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with staking were filed on Friday . The applications came from some of the biggest names in the industry, including Franklin, CoinShares, Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, Canary, and VanEck. Most interestingly, Geraci pointed out that these ETFs could be approved within the next two weeks. Read on as we unpack Solana‚Äôs brewing ETF momentum, what it could mean for the token and its price, and why buying Snorter Token ($SNORT) could be the best way to ride this rally. ETF Approval: The Missing Catalyst for Solana As mentioned earlier, Solana hasn‚Äôt yet unlocked the level of mainstream success that Bitcoin or Ethereum enjoy, and that could be a gap waiting to be filled. Asset managers at Pantera Capital highlighted that ETF launches accelerated adoption of BTC and ETH, and the same could be the case with Solana. Currently, Bitcoin has 43 ETFs and 165 public companies holding BTC, while Ethereum has 21 ETFs and 16 public companies holding ETH. Compare this to Solana, which is still in its early days ‚Äì there isn‚Äôt a comparable Solana ETF yet, and only 5 public companies currently hold SOL. With institutions under-allocated to SOL relative to BTC and ETH , a Solana ETF approval could be the spark this token needs to realize its full potential. Now here‚Äôs the kicker: investing directly into Solana is undoubtedly the most obvious way to benefit from the crypto‚Äôs bright future. That said, in crypto, the success of these mainstream blockchains often ends up spurring the growth of related tokens. With that in mind, Snorter Token ($SNORT) , which is arguably the best Solana meme coin at the moment, stands to benefit the most from the crypto‚Äôs upcoming rally. Snorter is a trading bot currently in development that aims to give meme coin traders the ultimate tool to go toe-to-toe with the institutional players who currently dominate the space. Snorter Is Changing the Meme Coin Trading Space What is Snorter Token ? $SNORT is the native cryptocurrency of the Snorter Telegram Bot, which stands out thanks to its sub-second swiping and rock-solid security infrastructure. For starters, it lets you place buy and sell, limit, and stop orders well before liquidity kicks in for a new meme coin . And when it finally does, it automatically executes those orders almost instantaneously. This allows you, a retail participant, to finally ride those initial meme coin pumps, which are easily the most profitable. Consider why this is game-changing: up until now, institutional players with advanced tools and algorithms ate up all the liquidity, and therefore all the profits, leaving nothing for the average person. Snorter changes this game and finally brings parity to the meme coin market, which has grown over 25% in just the last year and could arguably be the biggest beneficiary of crypto‚Äôs expanding footprint. This is also why, according to our Snorter Token price prediction , the token could reach $0.94 by the end of 2025. That means if you invest $100 into the token right now ‚Äì while it‚Äôs in presale and available at super low prices ‚Äì you could potentially walk away with $900 in just a few months. Snorter Offers Top-Notch Security & Ease of Use Snorter‚Äôs security is a thing of beauty. It‚Äôs laced with features to protect you against all big and small on-chain threats, from front-running and rug pulls to honeypots and even sophisticated sandwich attacks. On top of that, it‚Äôs also one of the easiest-to-use trading bots available right now. Since it‚Äôs based on Telegram, all you have to do to place your orders is send commands (which are essentially messages) in the familiar Telegram chat interface. It‚Äôs also worth noting that Snorter comes with a handy copy-trading feature. As the name suggests, it lets you connect your wallet to that of seasoned blockchain traders, meaning every trade they take will also be mimicked on your own account, without you having to lift a finger. This allows you to make some decent profits in a hands-off manner. That said, it‚Äôs very important to choose the right expert to copy-trade your account. We also suggest thinking of this feature as a form of guidance ‚Äì something to help you learn ‚Äì before you begin trading independently. Buy $SNORT Now for Maximum Gains Buying Snorter Token would give you front-row seats to the bot‚Äôs growth, which has all the potential to follow an explosive curve, given the growing legitimacy around meme coins and the number of people now viewing them as serious trading instruments. Even better, if you‚Äôre a $SNORT holder, you‚Äôll unlock exclusive benefits while using the trading bot. These include: No daily sniping limits Access to advanced analytics Reduced trading fees of just 0.85% (compared to 1.5% charged to non-holders) Staking rewards currently yielding 114% This new cryptocurrency project is currently in presale, having already raised over $4.1M from early investors. Arguably the best part is that each token is still available for just $0.1063. Interested? Here‚Äôs our detailed guide on how to buy Snorter Token .

52384207,589868,1759061724,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52384207.jpeg,"Gemini AI voorspelt: XRP, Shiba Inu en Solana koers pump in oktober",https://bitcoinist.com/gemini-ai-voorspelt-xrp-shiba-inu-en-solana-koers-pump-in-oktober/,"De invloed van kunstmatige intelligentie op de hele wereld, waaronder ook de financi√´le markten, groeit razendsnel. Ook in de cryptowereld wordt AI steeds vaker ingezet om voorspellingen van koersen te doen of analyses te maken van sentimenten. E√©n van de meest besproken AI modellen van dit moment is Gemini AI, een AI tool ontwikkeld door Google. Volgens nieuwe analyses zou de AI een stijging in de koers van XRP, Shiba Inu en Solana zien in oktober. Maar hoe betrouwbaar zijn deze voorspellingen werkelijk? En waarop worden deze gebaseerd? In dit artikel gaan we dieper in op de prognoses van Gemini AI en plaatsen we het in de context van de hele cryptomarkt om zo te bepalen welke crypto gaat stijgen in 2025. Hoe werkt Gemini AI om koersvoorspellingen te maken? Voordat we gaan kijken naar wat de koersen van deze drie cryptocurrency‚Äôs volgens Gemini AI de komende maand gaan doen, kijken we naar hoe AI zulke voorspellingen kan maken. Het model achter Gemini AI maakt gebruik van historische data, technische indicatoren, sentimentonderzoek en on-chain metrics. Er wordt hierbij bijvoorbeeld gekeken naar prijsgrafieken van een crypto en patronen, zoals steun- en weerstandsniveaus. Ook kijkt de AI naar data uit sociale media en nieuwsartikelen om zo te kijken wat investeerders en beleggers denken over bepaalde projecten. Wel moeten we benadrukken dat AI modellen niet feilloos zijn. Hoewel ze trends en correlaties kunnen herkennen, zijn ze nog niet in staat om een context te begrijpen en onverwachte gebeurtenissen goed in te schatten. Een plotselinge beslissing van het team of toezichthouders, een hack of een economische schok kan de hele voorspelling onderuit halen. Gemini AI voorspelt XRP: Ripple koersverwachting 2025 tot $5 bij positieve doorbraak XRP heeft een turbulente periode achter de rug met het juridische conflict met de Amerikaanse SEC dat de Ripple koersverwachting jarenlang onder druk heeft gezet. Toch weet XRP zich al jaren te handhaven in de top 10 grootste cryptomunten als we kijken naar marktkapitalisatie. Toen we Gemini AI vroegen om een koersverwachting in een bullish, neutraal en bearish sentiment kregen we de volgende data. Volgens Gemini AI zou de Ripple koers kunnen stijgen tot $5, wat een forse sprong is ten opzichte van de huidige koers. Het optimistische scenario houdt onder andere rekening met toenemende institutionele adoptie en een definitieve afsluiting van de SEC zaak. In 2024 piekte XRP tot $3,65, waarmee het record uit 2018 verbroken werd. Met de Relative Strength Index rond 59 lijkt het koopmomentum zich opnieuw op te bouwen, waardoor we de komende maand misschien wel een nieuwe ATH voor XRP zullen zien. Zoals de Gemini AI ook als belangrijke factor aangeeft, blijft RippleNet zich wereldwijd steeds verder uitbreiden, waarbij in 2024 de VN Capital Development Fund XRP aanhaalde als ‚Äòbetaalbaar remittance-instrument voor opkomende markten‚Äô. Mocht XRP het recentelijke momentum vasthouden, dan ziet Gemini AI $5 als een realistisch traject. Hoewel sommige analisten nog veel hogere koersdoelen aangeven, zijn die enorm sterk afhankelijk van een sterke bullmarkt en instroom van kapitaal, wat het lastig te voorspellen maakt. Gemini AI voorspelt Shiba Inu: volatiliteit met Shibarium als katalysator Shiba Inu blijft volgens Gemini AI een munt die wordt gedreven door volatiliteit en activiteit van de community. Voor de 2025 Shiba Inu koers verwacht Gemini AI een prijscorrectie binnen een bandbreedte van $0,00001513 tot $0,00002174, met de mogelijkheid van een korte stijging, mits de activiteit op Shibarium, de layer-2-oplossing van het ecosysteem, aantrekt. Het succes van Shiba Inu hangt af van een aantal factoren. Ten eerste is de adoptie van Shibarium erg belangrijk. Een stijging van transacties en een hogere totale vergrendelde waarde (TVL) zou direct invloed hebben op de vraag en daarmee de koers. Daarnaast spelen de token burns een belangrijke rol in het verkleinen van het aanbod. Tot slot blijft het sentiment bepalend: de aanwezigheid van de community op platforms als X en Reddit kan enorm veel doen voor de koers op korte termijn. Gemini AI voorspelt Solana: naar $350 dankzij Firedancer en groei ecosysteem Volgens Gemini AI blijft de Solana koers in een opwaartse trend bewegen en kan de koers tegen het einde van de volgende maand stijgen tot $250 of zelfs $350. Dat zou een verdubbeling betekenen ten opzichte van de huidige prijs rond $173. Een belangrijke factor in deze stijging is de komst van de Firedancer-client, die het netwerk stabieler en sneller moet maken om zo eerdere problemen te voorkomen. Ook het ecosysteem groeit verder. De totale vergrendelde waarde (TVL) in DeFi-apps ligt inmiddels boven de $4 miljard, terwijl NFT-marktplaatsen op Solana dagelijks tienduizenden transacties verwerken. Als deze groei aanhoudt en institutionele partijen instappen, ziet Gemini een realistische kans dat SOL richting de $350 beweegt. Snorter Bot ‚Äì Telegram trading tool met veel potentie Hoewel Gemini AI positieve koersen geeft voor gevestigde namen als XRP, Shiba Inu en Solana, zijn er ook altijd nieuwe, veelbelovende cryptoprojecten die kunnen stijgen in 2025. Snorter Bot is een trading tool waarmee je vanuit Telegram kunt traden. Met deze bot koop en verkoop je razendsnel crypto zonder allemaal gedoe met externe websites of een lastig dashboard. Daarbij ben je beschermd tegen front-running bots (MEV) en kun je bijvoorbeeld ook traders van andere succesvolle traders kopi√´ren. Op dit moment werkt Snorter Bot enkel nog maar op Solana, maar binnenkort zullen ook Ethereum en BNB Chain volgen. Wie $SNORT-tokens bezit, profiteert van lagere handelskosten: van 1,5% daalt de fee naar slechts 0,85%. Bovendien ontgrendelen de tokens alle premiumfuncties van de bot. Denk aan automatische stop-loss orders, een scamdetector met 85% nauwkeurigheid en inzicht in je volledige portefeuille, allemaal direct in je Telegram-chats. Zo handel je sneller √©n slimmer, met meer controle over je risico. De $SNORT-presale werkt met 60 prijs fases. Dus hoe eerder je instapt, hoe lager de prijs nog is. Vroege investeerders profiteren daarnaast van toekomstige staking rewards. Dankzij de nieuwe MiCA-regelgeving krijgen beleggers in de Europese Unie ook nog eens een 14-daagse refundoptie, wat extra zekerheid geeft bij deelname aan deze presale. Lijkt deze presale jou wat, dan kun je de token nu via de offici√´le website kopen. Wanneer de presale is afgelopen, zal het project ook op verschillende exchanges gelist worden.

This surge in large-scale purchases signals a potential seismic shift in the digital asset‚Äôs market dynamics, drawing attention from both retail investors and institutional players alike. XRP whales, major holders with significant market influence, are accumulating at unprecedented levels, according to Dominus. On-chain data shows long-term holder wallets driving a strategic buying frenzy, setting the stage for potential upward price momentum. Dominus highlights that XRP‚Äôs technical indicators are aligning with these whale-driven dynamics. Metrics such as on-chain volume, transaction velocity, and wallet concentration all suggest that XRP could be entering a new phase of market maturity. The analyst emphasizes that this behavior is a bullish signal, particularly when considered alongside broader crypto market trends and growing institutional interest in digital assets. Therefore, Dominus acknowledges unprecedented whale buying in XRP, signaling a potential major price surge. Both retail and institutional investors are closely tracking these moves for clues on the cryptocurrency‚Äôs next breakthrough. How XRP Ledger Can Benefit from On-Chain RWAs Surpassing $30B The on-chain Real-World Asset (RWA) market has recently surpassed a significant milestone, reaching over $30 billion in tokenized assets. This surge is primarily driven by institutional adoption of private credit, U.S. Treasuries, and commodities, reflecting a broader trend of traditional finance embracing blockchain technology. The XRP Ledger (XRPL), known for its rapid settlement times and low transaction fees, is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this growth. In the first half of 2025 alone, tokenized asset value on XRPL increased by over 2,260%, from approximately $5 million to more than $118 million. This growth was bolstered by significant institutional activities, including Mercado Bitcoin's tokenization of $200 million in RWAs on XRPL. Several factors contribute to XRPL's potential to benefit from the expanding RWA market: Scalability and Efficiency: XRPL's infrastructure supports high throughput and low latency, essential for handling large volumes of tokenized assets efficiently. Institutional Integration: Partnerships with major financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon and ProShares, enhance XRPL's credibility and facilitate seamless integration into traditional financial systems. Regulatory Alignment: XRPL's compliance with evolving regulatory standards positions it as a reliable platform for tokenizing RWAs, attracting institutional investors seeking regulatory certainty. As the RWA market continues to grow, projected to reach up to $30 trillion by 2030, XRPL's role in facilitating the tokenization and settlement of these assets becomes increasingly significant. By leveraging its technological advantages and strategic partnerships, XRPL is well-positioned to play a pivotal role in the future of tokenized finance. Conclusion XRP is at a potential turning point as whales amass record holdings, tightening supply and priming the market for heightened price momentum. With the on-chain RWA market surging past $30 billion, the XRP Ledger is leading the charge. Its speed, low costs, and institutional-ready infrastructure position XRPL as the go-to platform for tokenizing real-world assets, bridging traditional finance and blockchain to redefine global asset management and trading.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|WALLET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-28 12:26:05

Crypto proponent John Squire highlighted the approaching timeline, drawing attention to October as a critical month for XRP‚Äôs potential entry into mainstream financial products. With some of the largest asset managers and crypto firms lined up, expectations are rising over how these decisions could shape the trajectory of XRP in the months ahead.

Grayscale‚Äôs filing is due on October 18, followed by 21Shares on October 19. Bitwise faces its deadline on October 20, while Canary Capital‚Äôs application is set for October 23. WisdomTree, one of the largest asset managers worldwide, has its XRP ETF deadline slated for October 24. Rounding out the month, Franklin Templeton and CoinShares both face October 25 deadlines. Each of these applications represents a significant institutional interest in building regulated investment vehicles on XRP. The combined assets under management (AUM) of the applicants exceed trillions of dollars across traditional and digital markets, indicating that approval of even a single spot ETF could have meaningful implications for investor access and liquidity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Live Futures ETFs Already Active While the focus is on pending spot ETF applications , several futures-based XRP ETFs have already gone live. ProShares, Volatility Shares, Teucrium, REX Shares, and Purpose Investments have all launched futures products tied to XRP. These funds track XRP price movements indirectly through derivatives rather than holding the asset itself. The live futures ETFs mark an important step, but the broader market has its attention fixed on the approval of direct spot ETFs, which would hold XRP directly and potentially attract a wider range of investors. Market Sentiment Ahead of October Reactions from the crypto community reflect contrasting expectations. One X user, CryptOpus, commented that a spot ETF launch would drive demand and set XRP up for a strong rally during the October rollout. Another user, Menefrego, took the opposite position, stating with certainty that XRP‚Äôs price will remain unaffected despite the upcoming deadlines. These divergent views underscore the uncertainty surrounding how ETF approvals could translate into immediate price action. Whether the SEC will allow XRP to join Bitcoin and Ethereum in the spot ETF category remains uncertain, but the approaching deadlines ensure that all eyes will be on these filings in the weeks ahead.

This announcement came after the spokesperson expressed in a press conference that both countries had come to an agreement that Seoul does not qualify the criteria for being labeled as a currency manipulator, a classification the US Treasury Department issues twice a year. South Korean officials concerned about Trump‚Äôs $350 billion upfront demand Earlier in November last year, President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration had listed South Korea among countries on the watch list for currency manipulation because of its large current account surplus and significant trade surplus with the US. Coincidentally, when Donald Trump took office, his administration added South Korea to this list in June. Washington is mandated to take remedial measures against US trading partners who fail to resolve problems related to their currency undervaluation and trade surplus with the US, per the country‚Äôs law from 2015. Concerning the South Korea-US trade deal, South Korean officials clarified that the trade agreement is unrelated to talks about a currency swap connected to the tariff negotiations that Trump imposed on the country‚Äôs products. A South Korean government official who has served as the Minister of Economy and Finance, Koo Yun-cheol, weighed in on the situation. According to the finance minister, President Lee told Scott Bessent, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, that South Korea needed a foreign exchange swap to back the $350 billion investment it promised during tariff negotiations. Regarding the situation, Koo highlighted that Bessent is consulting other US officials and will soon update South Korea on their discussion. On that particular day, Wi Sung-lac, t he Director of the National Security of South Korea, stated that Seoul cannot pay the $350 billion upfront as Trump had recently proposed. This was after President Lee cautioned that if the government met US demands without any safeguards, the country would encounter a significant crisis similar to the one in 1997 earlier this month. Additionally, Koo mentioned that he did not receive any information concerning a Wall Street Journal report suggesting that Howard Lutnick, the United States Secretary of Commerce, discussed increasing the $350 billion investment. US admits no major trading partners manipulate currencies Earlier, the US Treasury Department acknowledged that none of the US major trading partners manipulated their currencies during the four quarters ending in December. This confirmed that South Korea, a major US trading partner, did not manipulate its currencies. However, the department highlighted that it will add nine countries to its monitoring list. This included Germany, China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Ireland and Switzerland , which were recently added. The other seven countries, which were already included, were being watched as Biden‚Äôs administration had instructed in November. This announcement marked the first currency report in six months since Donald Trump resumed office, and the final currency report connected to Joe Biden‚Äôs presidency. For November‚Äôs currency report, it also highlighted that none of the US major trading partners had manipulated their currencies in the 12 months leading up to June 2024. Notably, throughout Biden‚Äôs four-year term, there were no reported claims regarding currency manipulation.

This signals increasing institutional participation and maturity for Bitcoin, as these instruments typically cushion markets from excessive volatility ‚Äì exactly what deep-pocketed investors are after. According to Straten, ‚Äò this is how Bitcoin gets to a $10T+ market cap. ‚Äò Keep reading as we break down why Bitcoin‚Äôs growing maturity is necessary for its growth. We‚Äôll also point you toward the best altcoins to buy if you want to position yourself ahead of this shift. Bitcoin‚Äôs Maturity and the Road to $10T A big driver of Bitcoin‚Äôs maturity is the growth of derivative products like options. By definition, an option is a contract that gives you the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price. Beyond the technicalities, their true role is in bringing stability, hedging strategies, and depth to the market, all of which pave the way for Bitcoin‚Äôs evolution into a full-fledged institutional asset class. Sure, while less dramatic price swings and dampened volatility could be perceived as Bitcoin losing its trademark sheen, it‚Äôs important for us to wrap our heads around their importance. With that in mind, now‚Äôs the perfect time to build yourself a growth-oriented crypto portfolio. Here are our top 3 suggestions. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) ‚Äì New Bitcoin Layer-2 for Solana-Like Speed & Web3 Support Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is arguably the best crypto presale available right now. Retail and crypto whales combined have already poured in over $18.6M into this potentially revolutionary Layer 2 solution for the Bitcoin blockchain. $HYPER aims to finally rid the Bitcoin network of its longstanding issues: sluggish speeds, little to no scalability, and almost no Web3 support. Unlike Bitcoin‚Äôs native layer that processes transactions one by one, $HYPER processes thousands of transactions simultaneously. Then, it sends a summary of all those transactions to Bitcoin‚Äôs mainchain, ensuring the network‚Äôs security remains intact. All of this is made possible via Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, which also allows developers on Bitcoin to finally build smart contracts and decentralized applications. This opens up an entirely new world of Web3 applications on Bitcoin, including DeFi trading apps, NFT marketplaces, gaming dApps, DAOs, lending, staking, and more. To interact with these apps, all you have to do is send your Layer 1 Bitcoin to Hyper‚Äôs Canonical Bridge, which will lock those tokens and provide you with an equivalent amount of Layer 2-compatible wrapped tokens. Currently, you can buy $HYPER for just $0.012985 apiece. And according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the token could hit $0.32 by the end of 2025 ‚Äì a whopping 2,300% ROI. Visit Bitcoin Hyper‚Äôs official website to learn more about this new BTC-centric altcoin. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) ‚Äì Raw Degen Energy Powering the Next Greatest Meme Coin A well-rounded crypto portfolio should also include one or two hype-driven meme coins with the potential to go absolutely bonkers. Enter Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . Think of $MAXI as Dogecoin‚Äôs latest iteration ‚Äì fierce, bulked-up, and determined to churn out 1000x gains for its investors. Maxi‚Äôs mission is to overtake Dogecoin‚Äôs dominance as the best meme coin . Why? Because Dogecoin is his cousin ‚Äì and the very reason behind his loneliness and low self-esteem growing up. And now, $MAXI wants revenge. Naturally, a good old hero-villain story has plenty of takers, which is why the Maxi Doge presale has already pulled in over $2.5M from early investors. Maxi‚Äôs plan involves going viral. It has reserved a massive 40% of its total token supply for marketing, covering PR campaigns, influencer collaborations, and social media blitzes. Even better, if you‚Äôre a $MAXI holder, you‚Äôll also gain access to exclusive weekly trading competitions and leaderboard prizes. $MAXI doesn‚Äôt want to limit itself to just CEX and DEX listings either; it also plans to dominate the futures trading space, giving meme coin enthusiasts a real shot at outsized returns using leverage. Right now, 1 $MAXI is available for just $0.0002595. And as per our Maxi Doge price prediction , a $100 investment today could turn into $920 by year-end. Here‚Äôs how to buy $MAXI . Visit Maxi Doge‚Äôs official website to¬†learn¬†more. 3. Tutorial ($TUT) ‚Äì Utility-Backed Altcoin Ready to Rally Tutorial ($TUT) is a low-cap coin that could become the next big breakout winner, given that it‚Äôs directly tied to crypto‚Äôs growth. It‚Äôs an AI-powered tool designed to educate people about the basics of cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and the BNB Chain ecosystem. Think of it as a smart tutor that guides you through things like setting up a crypto wallet , writing smart contracts, and trading on the best decentralized exchanges . $TUT is up over 10% in the last seven days, having just broken out of a long-drawn consolidation phase that lasted nearly three months. At the time of writing, the price is hugging the 10 EMA ‚Äì a classic technical analysis signal suggesting upcoming¬†bullishness. Interested? Buy $TUT on Binance or any of the other crypto exchanges. Recap : With Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap set to rocket toward $10T on the back of derivatives, now‚Äôs the perfect time to load up on low-priced, high-upside gems like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and Tutorial ($TUT).

The window between October 18 and October 25 could determine whether XRP joins Bitcoin and Ethereum as the third cryptocurrency with U.S.-listed spot ETFs. Applications from Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, CoinShares, and WisdomTree are under review. Analysts argue that approval could unlock new institutional flows, particularly as liquidity rotates from Bitcoin‚Äîalready buoyed by its spot ETF launches ‚Äîinto XRP.

Market is already looking up, XRP hit an intraday high of $2.82 today. Institutional Appetite Expands via Derivatives Beyond ETFs, XRP is gaining momentum in the derivatives market. CME Group data shows open interest in XRP futures has surpassed $1 billion, the fastest growth among crypto derivatives this quarter. CME will also launch XRP and Micro XRP options on October 13, offering regulated exposure to a wider investor base. Ripple‚Äôs bid for a U.S. national bank charter, currently under review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), adds another layer of credibility. If granted, Ripple would gain direct access to the U.S. banking system, a move that could boost confidence among large investors. Key drivers supporting institutional demand include: Surging futures open interest above $1B Pending CME XRP options launch on October 13 Ripple‚Äôs U.S. bank charter application under OCC review SEC rulings on multiple spot ETF applications in October XRP Technical Outlook: Triangle Tightens Technically, the XRP price prediction remains neutral, as XRP has been stuck in a descending triangle since July, characterized by lower highs against a stable floor at $2.70. The 50-day MA at $2.96 is capping the rallies, with long upper shadows showing sellers defending the area. The 100-day MA at $2.61 is the near-term support. Candles are showing hesitation. Past declines formed sequences resembling three black crows, confirming bearish momentum. More recent small-bodied candles with long shadows reveal indecision, with neither side in full control. XRP/USD Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview The RSI at 40 suggests muted momentum, hovering above oversold but lacking bullish divergence. A breakout requires higher lows above $2.70 or a bullish engulfing candle at the support level. Trade Scenarios: Bearish case: Short entries on failed rallies near $2.90, targeting $2.70 and $2.59, with stops above $2.95. Bullish case: Long setups gain traction only on a daily close above $3.00, with upside toward $3.25 and $3.42. In plain terms, XRP sits at a crossroads. Institutional catalysts in October‚ÄîETF approvals, CME options, and Ripple‚Äôs bank charter‚Äîmay provide the spark. However, until the price breaks free from the tightening triangle, rallies risk fading, and shorts hold the upper hand. A breakout above $3.00 could mark the beginning of XRP‚Äôs next major leg higher. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC‚Äôs unmatched security with Solana‚Äôs high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $18.4 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today‚Äôs stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012985‚Äîbut that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

The staged scene quickly spread across X, baiting users into mocking the video‚Äôs obvious flaws. The group of Pump.Fun streamers filmed themselves inside a private jet replica and pretended to crash. The ‚Äújet‚Äù had poor flooring, obvious set pieces, and even an exterior shot that gave away its inauthenticity. Pump.fun streamers farm engagement Viewers who ridiculed the streamers for pulling off a poorly executed hoax failed to see the likely intention from the start, which was farming engagement. The more users pointed out the fakery, the wider the clip circulated. That attention fed directly into the streamers‚Äô goal of farming engagement and promoting Pump.fun, especially during a time of sliding activity. The set itself was not difficult to locate. Users identified the location as FD Photo Studio in Los Angeles. The studio rents out themed spaces for photography and filming. The ‚ÄúOlympic 4‚Äù private jet backdrop was booked by the streamers, including SolJakey, Never Goon, MiniKon, and OG Shoots, for as little as $34.99 per hour.

The token dropped by 29.9%, from $0.007950 to $0.004988. In terms of trading volume , PUMP peaked at $975.76 billion on September 21, but now this volume has crashed to $61.17 million. PUMP‚Äôs market cap sank by 38.2% in just 14 days, dropping from an all-time high $2.8 billion to $1.77 billion based on data from crypto aggregator CoinGecko. The memecoin platform isn‚Äôt generating a ton of revenue either. Last Sunday, Pump.fun generated $3.74 million in revenue. That number has since dropped dramatically to below $1 million. Dune Analytics shows that Pump.fun‚Äôs revenue was $890.46k as of yesterday. Pump.fun released its native token on July 14. It raised $500 million in 12 minutes through an ICO event, but days later, 60% of PUMP presale buyers sold their tokens on centralized exchanges. Pump.fun makers also announced a buyback program on July 16, based on a report from Cryptopolitan. The total amount of PUMP tokens buybacks has surpassed $100 million. Pump. fun‚Äôs livestream feature has always been a place for weird and extreme content. Some people threatened viewers to kill their own families, while others resorted to abuse and sex just to pump their memecoins. These incidents stirred massive backlash from the crowd which led to the termination of Pump.fun‚Äôs livestream feature late last year. But that decision was temporary after livestreaming was relaunched on the platform after 5 month s in an attempt t o br ing the ‚Äúfun‚Äù back.

At the same time, recent developments around Shiba Inu‚Äîfrom token burns to ecosystem upgrades‚Äîadd complexity to the meme-coin narrative. To further spice the mix, AlphaPepe is being quietly eyed by traders as a high-upside alternative in the background. ETF Momentum & Regulatory Shifts One of the most potent ingredients for an XRP breakout is the prospect of spot XRP ETF approval. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently rolled out generic listing standards, which reduce the review timeline and ease the burden on ETF applicants. At least six XRP ETF proposals are in the spotlight, with a key decision for Grayscale‚Äôs application pegged for October 18. Some analysts now assign ETF approval odds above 99%. ETF inflows could introduce institutional capital into XRP, shifting its narrative from speculative to structural. However, past launch events have shown mixed price reactions‚Äîsometimes markets ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù despite high expectations. Technical Outlook & Key Levels From a chart perspective, XRP‚Äôs $2.70 support is now critical. If that floor holds, bulls may aim to breach the overhead resistance in the $3.20‚Äì$3.60 zone. A breakout there with volume could open the path toward $5.00. However, if XRP fails to hold $2.70, downside risk toward $2.30‚Äì$2.20 looms. Volume compression and lack of directional conviction have made this range battle more prolonged than expected. Traders are watching for RSI divergence, breakouts from consolidation patterns, and whether ETF-driven flows align with technical strength to confirm any move upward. Shiba Inu Developments: Burn & Ecosystem Signals Shiba Inu continues to be one of the most talked-about meme coins, and recent burn metrics are telling. Over 7 million SHIB tokens were burned in a 24-hour period during a recent surge in volume, contributing to speculation about supply shock dynamics. However, burn activity has also faltered. In recent weeks, SHIB‚Äôs burn rate dropped by as much as 95%, raising concerns about sustainability. Meanwhile, the Shibarium layer-2 network remains under scrutiny. After a $4 million bridge exploit earlier in 2025, the team has been reinforcing security and revisiting validator decentralization. These developments are critical: if Shibarium can regain trust and scale, SHIB‚Äôs narrative may strengthen again. Given SHIB‚Äôs volatility, it acts as both a competitor and a bellwether‚Äîits performance can influence how speculators allocate capital between meme plays and altcoins. AlphaPepe in the Mix In a market environment where top coins stall, AlphaPepe is quietly building a narrative as a meme coin bridge‚Äîone that sits between speculative hype and structured token models. Many traders now view receding momentum in blue-chips like XRP or cautious regulation as opportunities to rotate capital into meme presales that can move quickly. What gives AlphaPepe an edge is that it‚Äôs being whispered about as ‚Äúthe meme coin project institutional layers notice quietly‚Äù. This positioning means that even before major listings, visible momentum or alignment with macro shifts could amplify AlphaPepe‚Äôs presence. In other words: not just hype, but the potential to absorb spillover attention when other coins stall. Outlook & Risks If XRP captures ETF-driven momentum and breaks resistance cleanly, a push toward $5 is not off the table ‚Äî albeit ambitious. On the flip side, regulatory delays or weak fund flows could leave XRP range-bound for longer than many expect. For SHIB, the burn mechanism must be consistent and Shibarium must rebuild confidence to reignite interest. A collapse in these fundamentals could mute SHIB‚Äôs role as a meme baseline. AlphaPepe‚Äôs risk lies in execution ‚Äî listing, liquidity, tokenomics must deliver. It‚Äôs not a guarantee, but its presence as a high-volatility alternative means it could attract attention if momentum wanes elsewhere.

In the meantime, Early Bird presale in Lyno AI is appealing to investors with the promise of 200x returns. Whereas XRP has hit a temporary low, the cross-chain arbitrage system of Lyno AI is catching on with shrewd cash investors. The $5 XRP Target: Boom or Mirage in the Middle East? The $5 target of XRP is dependent on the major events such as the September 2025 UAE bank integrations. Those agreements may drive daily payments to one million transactions, which proves the increased use of the token in the Middle East. Nevertheless, XRP dropped by 6.03 percent to 2.76 during the turbulence in the market related to the late rate cuts by Fed. Still, the top analysts forecasting a 2024 release have a lot of upside potential. Lyno AI Presale Frenzy: The 200x Bet Investors Can‚Äôt Stop Talking About Presale Lyno AI is generating hype with a target 200x (14,200) return. The initial tokens will be sold at 0.05 and 0.055 in the second and third stages, respectively. As of today, 795,661 tokens have been sold, raising nearly $39,783 to a total target of $0.10 each.

Cross-chain AI algorithms follow multiple blockchains in real-time, identifying cross-chain profits.

Millisecond Arbitrage Across Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, and Beyond The platform provided by Lyno AI connects across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, and also offers liquidity access and transparent protocol visibility to users. This enables investors to exploit cross-chain arbitrage at a pace and scale that hitherto was unattainable by retail traders. The Final Call: Will You Watch XRP Crawl or Ride Lyno AI‚Äôs Explosion? In case you are looking at XRP rising to $5, Lyno AI provides another way to a 10X payoff. Those investors who overlooked the previous booms of other leaders are now able to invest in the presale that is guaranteed by Cyberscope-audited contracts and advanced AI trading.

The former's potential price increase to $5 by 2026 and the latter's promise of substantial returns create a contrasting yet intriguing investment scenario. Emerging Opportunities with Ripple in the UAE Ripple, a prominent player in blockchain-based solutions, is set to integrate with leading banks in the UAE, potentially driving its price to $5 by 2026. This integration is expected to elevate daily transactions to one million, showcasing the growing acceptance and usability of Ripple in financial transactions across the Middle East. Introducing the Lyno AI Presale: A Gateway to Exponential Returns Parallel to Ripple's advancements, Lyno AI's presale is making waves among investors aiming for high yields. The presale stages are priced attractively at $0.05 and $0.055, with a final target of $0.10 per token.

The Broad Reach of Lyno AI Across Multiple Blockchains Lyno AI's technological infrastructure spans several major blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon. This extensive network enables seamless liquidity access and increased transparency, facilitating superior arbitrage opportunities that were once beyond the reach of individual traders. Comparative Analysis: Ripple's Steady Growth vs. Lyno AI's Rapid Expansion While Ripple offers a solid growth trajectory, enhanced by strategic bank partnerships, Lyno AI presents a more volatile but potentially more rewarding investment. The latter rides on cutting-edge AI and blockchain integration, promising rapid financial returns for early investors.

According to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), he explained that XRP is positioned within an oversold market, which could indicate a potential turnaround in the future. However, Hilton made clear that short-term expectations remain bearish, particularly if Bitcoin experiences further price reductions. Hilton pointed to the overall market cap of $3.75 trillion and stressed the importance of evaluating RSI levels to determine whether cryptocurrencies are in overbought or oversold conditions. The analyst noted that the market is in an oversold state, meaning a recovery could occur, although he expects this phase to persist for some time before momentum shifts. XRP‚Äôs RSI readings, according to Hilton, reflect this oversold trend, aligning with the broader cryptocurrency landscape. This is happening right in front of you fellow XRP holders! What you can do about it! pic.twitter.com/i772USH5oy ‚Äî Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 26, 2025 Broader Market Conditions and Bitcoin‚Äôs Influence Hilton explained that XRP‚Äôs performance is tied to wider market developments, particularly Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory . With Bitcoin currently trading around the $109,000 level, analysts he follows anticipate the possibility of it dropping to between $103,000 and $105,000, with $100,000 being a more pessimistic scenario. If Bitcoin trends toward these lower ranges, Hilton warned that XRP will also decline from its present level. Another factor Hilton highlighted was the expiration of approximately $22 billion worth of crypto options contracts, including $17.5 billion in Bitcoin and $5 billion in Ethereum. He noted that these expirations are introducing uncertainty and bearish momentum into the market, which further reinforces expectations of near-term declines across multiple digital assets, including XRP. Institutional Buying and Dollar-Cost Averaging Despite short-term bearish pressure, Hilton emphasized that institutional investors and whales are taking advantage of the current market downturn to accumulate XRP. By buying at lower price levels, these larger market participants are reducing their average entry costs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Hilton himself stated that while he is not an institutional investor, he continues to buy XRP weekly and is prepared to allocate stablecoins toward additional purchases if the price falls below $2.50 or even closer to $2. Hilton explained that such strategies are rooted in dollar-cost averaging, where buying during downturns can position investors for long-term gains. He acknowledged that price declines are unfavorable to holders in the short run. However, he reiterated that institutional accumulation at current levels is a sign of confidence in XRP‚Äôs long-term prospects. Near-Term and Longer-Term Projections According to Hilton, XRP could dip below $2.50 and potentially approach $2 in the near future, especially if Bitcoin moves closer to the lower price targets projected by analysts. He suggested that September and the early weeks of October may remain under bearish influence. However, by mid-October, Hilton expects a shift toward a more bullish environment, with XRP potentially rebounding in line with broader market conditions. While he clarified that no prediction is certain, Hilton stated that his outlook is a consensus of multiple technical analysts.

His latest sales have reignited memories of the 2021 Shiba Inu (SHIB) episode that reshaped the token‚Äôs trajectory. Traders watched closely as on-chain data confirmed the transactions, sparking immediate price reactions. The move served as another reminder that Buterin rarely holds meme coins for long. Buterin Offloads Puppies and ERC20 Tokens According to Onchain Lens , Buterin sold 150 billion Puppies tokens for 28.58 ETH, valued at about $114,000. He also liquidated 1 billion ERC20 tokens, converting them into $13,900 in USDC. While relatively small compared to Ethereum‚Äôs market scale, the sales carried symbolic weight. On-chain analysts reported that the ERC20 token plunged by 70% soon after its transactions were confirmed. Puppies, which had recently gained traction, also faced heightened scrutiny as news spread across trading groups. Buterin‚Äôs wallet history has consistently shown a pattern of quick exits from meme coin allocations. Market participants viewed this week‚Äôs actions as a repeat of that strategy, triggering immediate selling pressure. For holders, the signal was clear: meme tokens associated with Ethereum‚Äôs creator do not represent a long-term endorsement. Shiba Inu Parallel and Market Impact The most recent deal was compared to the high-profile involvement of Shiba Inu in 2021 by Buterin. By this time, the developers of SHIB contacted him with billions of tokens. Buterin donated a large part of it to the COVID-19 relief in India effectively reducing the supply of SHIB. That action both came as a surprise to the community and, at the same time, generated a wave of interest that helped make SHIB one of the most well-known meme coins during that bull cycle. The same market dynamic was reflected in the sales this week, although they were on a smaller scale. The quick response of traders strengthened the idea that the influence of Buterin is not only in Ethereum . Every sale he makes has an overvalued effect due to his background with SHIB. At the time of writing SHIB is trading at around $0.00001174, suggesting a 0.57% decline in the last 24 hours.

Jeff Booth, best known for his bestselling book ‚ÄòThe Price of Tomorrow‚Äô, has long been an advocate for disruptive technologies reshaping financial systems. His recognition of XRP‚Äôs trajectory underscores the token‚Äôs growing significance in real-world finance. Rather than simply being another speculative cryptocurrency, XRP is positioning itself as a structural replacement, or replication, of critical banking functions. At the core of this claim lies Ripple‚Äôs mission of providing fast, low-cost, and reliable cross-border payments. For decades, international money transfers have relied on intermediaries, particularly the SWIFT network, which is often slow and expensive. XRP, through the XRP Ledger (XRPL), seeks to eliminate these inefficiencies. Its near-instant settlement times, minimal transaction fees, and scalability give it the potential to replicate, and in some respects improve upon, traditional banking rails. XRP‚Äôs deepening institutional adoption reinforces Booth‚Äôs view. From banks to global payment providers, financial institutions are integrating Ripple‚Äôs technology to enhance remittances and liquidity management. This momentum positions XRP not merely as an alternative asset, but as an emerging cornerstone of modern finance. Notably, replicating the banking system doesn‚Äôt mean eliminating banks, it means modernizing their core functions. XRP delivers liquidity, settlement, and value transfer with the same reliability banks provide, but with greater speed, efficiency, and decentralization. This positions XRP as a potential global, neutral bridge currency for the digital age. XRP Poised for Breakout: Analyst Predicts Imminent Rally as Key Signals Align According to market commentator Cryptobilbuwo, XRP is entering a highly favorable trading zone , and a significant rally may be imminent. His analysis highlights key technical signals, market structures, and timing factors that suggest the cryptocurrency could be on the brink of a breakout. One of the strongest indicators is XRP‚Äôs recent performance against the 200-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Historically, this long-term EMA has acted as a formidable resistance level, capping XRP‚Äôs upward momentum. However, after successfully breaking above it, XRP has now retested this line as support and is showing signs of renewed upward movement. This shift from resistance to support is often seen as a bullish signal, reinforcing the case for continued gains. Another key factor is XRP‚Äôs positioning within the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern. According to Cryptobilbuwo, XRP appears to be taking a short pause just before breaking above the resistance line of this structure. The Wyckoff model often signals the transition from accumulation to markup phases, where suppressed prices begin to surge as demand overtakes supply. This pause, therefore, may represent the final stage before momentum accelerates. Beyond technical analysis, the commentary emphasizes the importance of perseverance in market cycles. ‚ÄúProsperity comes to those who persevere,‚Äù Cryptobilbuwo notes, framing XRP‚Äôs journey as one of patience rewarded. Long-term holders who have endured extended periods of stagnation may soon benefit from what could be a pivotal rally. Therefore, timing is critical because Cryptobilbuwo projects Q4 2025 to Q1 2026 as the window for major price moves, aligning with expectations of the next crypto cycle fueled by institutional adoption and macroeconomic trends. Conclusion Cryptobilbuwo‚Äôs analysis shows XRP is shifting from consolidation to breakout territory. With the 200-week EMA now support, the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern nearing completion, and a projected timeline into late 2025‚Äìearly 2026, conditions are aligning for a decisive move. On the other hand, Jeff Booth‚Äôs remarks underscore a pivotal shift whereby XRP is transcending speculation to become a foundational layer of the future financial system. By mirroring core banking functions with superior speed, efficiency, and global reach, it emerges as both a complement and a challenger to traditional banking infrastructure.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-28 14:06:30

Blockchain technology has steadily helped companies and organizations to improve transparency, cut costs, and reduce fraud in areas like finance, supply chains, and healthcare. Now, the United Nations is taking steps to integrate the technology more deeply into its operations after testing it within its pension system. The UN backs blockchain technology The United Nations stated that blockchain technology is a key tool for its digital transformation and inclusive governance strategy after a successful trial in its pension fund system. A new white paper released by the global body concluded that blockchain provides ‚Äúthe ultimate technology for digital identity verification,‚Äù with the potential for the UN to now scale the technology across its agencies and promote it as a global digital public good. The project is centered on the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF), which manages retirement benefits for staff across the UN system. For decades, the pension fund has operated using a manual, paper-based process that required beneficiaries to prove their identity and confirm they are still alive. With more than 70,000 beneficiaries in 190 countries, the system was slow, costly, and vulnerable to fraud. The reliance on physical documents often led to errors, delays, and even suspensions. It also led to around 1,400 pension payments being paused each year because of verification problems. To address these challenges, the UN decided to utilize blockchain in partnership with the Hyperledger Foundation. The initiative was launched first in 2020, and then there was a larger rollout in 2021 when the pension fund moved to a digital certification system built on blockchain. The UN switches from paper to blockchain The white paper described the old pension system as ‚Äúa 70-year-old process prone to error and abuse.‚Äù Every year, the fund had to manage paper forms from tens of thousands of retirees worldwide. Staff spent hours receiving, opening, scanning, and archiving documents, and all these steps introduced opportunities for mistakes or delays. According to the report, this change to blockchain technology improved efficiency and transparency. Beneficiaries could confirm their status digitally, while the fund gained greater confidence with fewer weak points in the system to be exploited. ‚ÄúThe shift away from physical documentation has substantially reduced processing times,‚Äù the UN report‚Äôs authors noted. They referred to how blockchain allowed beneficiaries to securely verify their identity and status without mailing or submitting physical paperwork, cutting down on processing times and making the system more resilient, while also eliminating repetitive checks and the risk of duplicate data entry. The United Nation is now exploring ways to adapt the Digital Certificate of Entitlement model, which is the blockchain-based identity verification system, across its agencies and potentially share it with other international groups. Sameer Chauhan, the director of the United Nations International Computing Centre, wrote in the paper‚Äôs conclusion that the project provided not only a technical solution but also ‚Äúan operational model for how organizations across the UN family can collaborate to design secure, scalable, and inclusive digital public infrastructure.‚Äù Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News|Hyperledger|United Nations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-28 14:14:36

While long-term Ethereum price predictions remain bullish, attention is shifting toward Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi token solving real-world payment challenges. With over $26.7 million already raised, major exchange listings confirmed, and analysts hinting at 100x potential, RTX is becoming the go-to pick for ETH investors looking for explosive upside. Ethereum Price Prediction Extends To $6,000 On Bullish Case The ETH price today is holding near $3,998, posting a modest 2% gain after a week of sharp swings. Traders say the $4,000 mark has become a psychological barrier, tested repeatedly as volatility grips the market. Despite choppy conditions, Ethereum news shows the token outperforming many rivals, with strong interest anchored by its dominance in DeFi and stablecoin ecosystems. Analysts point out that the movement in the short-term is still within the range of $3,800 to $4,200. Breaking out at over $4,200 would see the Ethereum price forecast move nearer to $5,000 by year-end, and with good conditions, targets may hit as high as $6,000. On the other hand, any slip under $3,800 will put the Ethereum price at the risk of falling to $3,500. On-chain metrics continue to reveal heightened leverage and liquidation risks. This could make ETH vulnerable to sudden dips. Still, many long-term holders stay optimistic, with some exploring new opportunities in tokens like Remittix (RTX) that are being tipped as the ‚Äú next 100x crypto. ‚Äù ETH News Highlights Investors Diversifying Into Remittix As the ETH price today consolidates near $4,000, many Ethereum holders are eyeing new opportunities with higher upside. One name that keeps surfacing is Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi token designed to bridge crypto and traditional banking seamlessly.

As AI permeates every facet of technology, from finance to enterprise operations, a new frontier of risks and defenses is emerging. Ami Luttwak, the chief technologist at cybersecurity powerhouse Wiz, offers a sobering yet insightful perspective on this transformation. He emphasizes that cybersecurity is fundamentally a ‚Äòmind game‚Äô ‚Äì a constant strategic battle where new technological waves, like AI, inevitably create fresh opportunities for attackers. For those in the crypto space, understanding these evolving threats is paramount, as the integrity of digital assets relies heavily on robust underlying security. AI Cybersecurity: The Evolving Threat Landscape The integration of Artificial Intelligence into enterprise workflows, whether through ‚Äòvibe coding,‚Äô sophisticated AI agents, or new developer tools, is dramatically expanding the potential attack surface. While AI promises unprecedented speed in development, this velocity often comes at a cost: shortcuts and oversights that create gaping vulnerabilities for malicious actors. Luttwak highlights a critical paradox: the very tools designed to accelerate innovation can inadvertently introduce significant security debt. Wiz, a cybersecurity leader recently acquired by Google for an impressive $32 billion, has been at the forefront of studying these emerging threats. Their recent tests revealed a pervasive issue in AI-generated applications: insecure authentication implementations. Luttwak explains that developers, in their pursuit of speed, often instruct AI agents to build functionality in the easiest way possible, without explicitly demanding the most secure methods. This leads to authentication systems ‚Äì the gatekeepers verifying user identities ‚Äì being vulnerable, essentially rolling out the red carpet for attackers. This challenge isn‚Äôt confined to development. Attackers are also leveraging AI. They employ ‚Äòvibe coding,‚Äô prompt-based techniques, and their own sophisticated AI agents to craft and launch exploits with alarming efficiency. The days of purely manual hacking are waning; AI is democratizing and amplifying offensive capabilities. Ami Luttwak‚Äôs Alarming Insights on Attacker Innovation Ami Luttwak provides a stark warning: attackers are no longer just reacting; they are proactively using AI to their advantage. He notes, ‚ÄúYou can actually see the attacker is now using prompts to attack. It‚Äôs not just the attacker vibe coding. The attacker looks for AI tools that you have and tells them, ‚ÄòSend me all your secrets, delete the machine, delete the file.‚Äô‚Äù This shift means that AI tools within an organization, intended for efficiency, can be weaponized against it through clever prompting and exploitation. Beyond direct manipulation, attackers are finding new entry points through the very AI tools companies integrate internally to boost efficiency. Luttwak refers to these as ‚Äúsupply chain attacks.‚Äù By compromising a third-party service that has extensive access to a company‚Äôs infrastructure, attackers can then pivot deeper into corporate systems, creating a domino effect of breaches. A recent high-profile example is the breach of Drift, an AI chatbot startup, which exposed Salesforce data of hundreds of enterprise customers, including industry giants like Cloudflare and Google. The attackers exploited digital keys (tokens) to impersonate the chatbot, query sensitive Salesforce data, and move laterally within customer environments. Luttwak confirmed that the attack code itself was generated using ‚Äòvibe coding,‚Äô underscoring the AI-on-AI nature of modern cyber warfare. Despite the current minimal adoption of AI tools across enterprises ‚Äî Luttwak estimates around 1% have fully integrated AI ‚Äî Wiz is already observing thousands of enterprise customers impacted by AI-driven attacks every week. The speed of this revolution, with AI embedded at every step of the attack flow, demands an equally rapid response from the cybersecurity industry. Wiz‚Äôs Proactive Stance on Enterprise Security In this dynamic environment, Wiz, founded in 2020, has rapidly evolved its capabilities. Initially focused on identifying and mitigating security risks across cloud environments, Wiz has expanded its offerings to tackle the unique challenges posed by AI-related cyberattacks . Their strategy involves not only defending against AI but also leveraging AI within their own products. In September, Wiz launched Wiz Code, a solution designed to secure the software development lifecycle. It identifies and mitigates security issues early in the development process, promoting a ‚Äúsecure by design‚Äù philosophy. Following this, Wiz introduced Wiz Defend in April, offering runtime protection that detects and responds to active threats within cloud environments. This comprehensive approach ensures security from code inception to deployment and ongoing operation. Luttwak emphasizes the importance of ‚Äúhorizontal security,‚Äù which requires a deep understanding of customer applications. ‚ÄúWe need to understand why you‚Äôre building it ‚Ä¶ so I can build the security tool that no one has ever had before, the security tool that understands you,‚Äù he states. This bespoke approach allows Wiz to anticipate and counter novel AI-driven threats effectively. Safeguarding Enterprise Security: Essential Steps for AI Startups The democratization of AI tools has led to a proliferation of new startups promising to solve enterprise pain points. However, Luttwak cautions against indiscriminately sharing sensitive company, employee, and customer data with every nascent SaaS company, regardless of their AI insights. The responsibility lies with these startups to demonstrate robust security from day one. ‚ÄúFrom day one, you need to think about security and compliance,‚Äù Luttwak asserts. ‚ÄúFrom day one, you need to have a CISO (chief information security officer). Even if you have five people.‚Äù This proactive mindset means considering enterprise security features, audit logs, strong authentication, controlled access to production environments, secure development practices, security ownership, and single sign-on before writing a single line of code. Implementing these measures early prevents costly overhauls and ‚Äúsecurity debt‚Äù later on, ensuring readiness to protect enterprise data. Wiz itself exemplifies this commitment, achieving SOC2 compliance ‚Äî a stringent compliance framework ‚Äî before their product even had code. Luttwak reveals a key insight: ‚ÄúGetting SOC2 compliance for five employees is much easier than for 500 employees.‚Äù Early adoption of security best practices is not just about compliance; it‚Äôs a strategic advantage. The next critical step for startups, particularly those focused on AI, is architectural design. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre an AI startup that wants to focus on enterprise from day one, you have to think about an architecture that allows the data of the customer to stay ‚Ä¶ in the customer environment,‚Äù Luttwak advises. This minimizes data exposure and builds trust with enterprise clients. The Future is Open: Opportunities in AI Cybersecurity Despite the formidable threats, Luttwak describes this as an ‚Äúexciting time to be a leader in cybersecurity.‚Äù The landscape of AI cybersecurity is ripe for innovation. Every domain, from phishing protection and email security to malware and endpoint protection, presents fertile ground for both attackers and defenders. Startups focusing on workflow and automation tools for ‚Äúvibe security‚Äù are particularly needed, as many security teams are still grappling with how to leverage AI effectively for defense. ‚ÄúThe game is open,‚Äù Luttwak concludes. ‚ÄúIf every area of security now has new attacks, then it means we have to rethink every part of security.‚Äù This challenge presents an unparalleled opportunity for innovators to redefine cybersecurity for the AI age. The transformation of cyberattacks by AI is undeniable, and the urgency for robust defenses has never been greater. Ami Luttwak‚Äôs insights from Wiz underscore that while AI presents formidable challenges, it also opens vast new avenues for innovation in cybersecurity. By prioritizing security from the outset, understanding the evolving threat landscape, and embracing proactive solutions, organizations can navigate this new era with confidence, safeguarding their digital future in an increasingly AI-driven world.

Among the high-fliers are Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , both of which possess unique attributes and growth potential. Pepe Coin (PEPE) is a meme token whose on-ground popularity has raised a stir. Its growth prospects, though, are minimal. Predictions are that PEPE will trade in a range of $0.00000626 and $0.00000679 in January 2026, marginally above current levels. But amongst the most promising DeFi initiatives is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The initiative is currently in presale stage 6 that is over 50% sold. The tokens are selling at $0.035. The new model used by the platform for decentralized lending and borrowing has received a lot of attention. Pepe Coin (PEPE): A Breakout Opportunity on the Horizon Following months of sideways movement, Pepe Coin (PEPE) is posting amazing reversal signals that patient traders can‚Äôt help but wait to materialize. The meme token recently broke above a pivotal resistance level, which implies the potential beginning of a bullish breakout. Its price is presently $0.00000945, and the target price is forecast by the analysts to be $0.00001400+, and thus PEPE can offer a 45% uptick in the near term and potentially be a good deal before its next up move. Whereas short-term momentum seems to be positive, most are currently seeking the manner in which impetus might militate against more pragmatic initiatives and the resultant natural consequence is reconsidering Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and its rising profile within DeFi. MUTM Presale Growth and Enhanced Liquidity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been preselling strongly and is now at Stage 6, with the tokens available for sale at $0.035. The response from investors has been phenomenal, with over 16,620 investors investing over $16.5 million. Such record figures show sky-high market demand for MUTM and rising global anticipation for the project to roll out. Mutuum Finance protocol will hedge liquidity and volatility in real time dynamically. It can short illiquid positions strategically to avoid the extremes of liquidation levels, with hedging against stablecoin and ETH halting risk as well. Collateralization strategy provides additional protection, and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios are supported by lower-volatility assets. A reserve factor distributed proportionally by asset classes further increases the protection of the protocol overall as well as optimizes reserves management. In order to facilitate seamless functioning of the ecosystems, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles for token swaps, lending, collateral management, and USD-pegged asset settlement alongside prominent cryptocurrencies like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. It is fallback oracle mode-based, composite data feed-based, and DEX TWAP-based infrastructure that delivers extremely reliable price information even in unprecedented market stress. Community Incentives for Early Supporters As a token of appreciation for its early adopters, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will be given $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each, once again encouraging community participation and involvement throughout the presale journey. Volatility is among the main focus in Mutuum Finance‚Äôs collateral management system. Asset volatility dictates LTV ratios and risk classes into lower- and higher-risk buckets. Reserve multipliers are used to introduce security to range from 10% for lower-risk tokens up to 35% for higher-risk tokens, with buffer zones, without impairing portfolio diversification. A Vision for the Future: Passive Lending and Capital Efficiency Going forward, Mutuum Finance is developing a capital-backed passive lending and borrowing protocol that allows customers to borrow against securitized collateral. Two of the mechanisms ‚Äì a stability algorithm and an interest rate optimization algorithm ‚Äì will drive the future infrastructure. Both will maximize capital efficiency, enhance network resilience, and facilitate the employment of sustainable long-term capital within the Mutuum system. Pepe Coin has near-term upside, but its potential is capped. Mutuum Finance is brimming with potential with over $16.5 million raised, 16,620+ investors, and tokens valued at $0.035. Backed by robust risk management and innovative lending capabilities, MUTM is sure to prosper. Grab the Mutuum Finance presale tokens today.

Right now, all eyes are on Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a presale project that many believe could deliver the kind of gains rarely seen since the early days of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. At its current presale price of $0.0022, analysts suggest that a $100 investment could potentially yield $10,000 if the token delivers on its roadmap and achieves the projected 10,000% upside. That kind of potential makes it one of the most talked-about meme coins of the year. The Price Story of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) The Little Pepe presale has been moving fast. Stage 12 sold out early, and Stage 13 is already more than 92% complete at $0.0022 per token. Over $25.9 million has been raised from the $28.7 million goal, showing that demand and community confidence are building. With only 19 stages, early buyers are already sitting on gains from lower entries, and new investors are still in line for a 37% uplift once the token lists at $0.003. What sets LILPEPE apart is not just momentum but infrastructure. It is building on an Ethereum-based Layer 2 chain designed specifically for meme tokens. That means faster and cheaper transactions, combined with bot-resistant technology that prevents whales from sniping supply. Add zero trading tax, a completed CertiK audit, and a clear path to centralized exchange listings, and you start to see why this presale has captured attention. DOGE Price and Bullish Technicals Dogecoin remains the grandfather of meme coins. At the time of writing, it trades around $0.28 and continues to show signs of strength. The 50-day moving average is rising, the RSI is healthy, and whale wallets have been quietly accumulating. Analysts note that Dogecoin could push toward $0.41 if momentum holds. Source: Tradingview For an investor putting $100 into DOGE at $0.28, that projection could return around $146 if the price reaches $0.41. A more aggressive move toward $0.50 would nearly double the investment to about $190. These are solid returns, but the ceiling is capped by the fact that DOGE already carries a massive market cap, making 100x style gains unlikely in the short term. SHIB Price and Bullish Momentum Shiba Inu is also showing mixed but encouraging signals. Currently trading around $0.000013, SHIB recently climbed above its 20-day moving average, and its MACD shows fading bearish pressure. Analysts point to an inverse head and shoulders pattern that could unlock new bullish momentum if confirmed. Source: Tradingview If SHIB climbs to $0.000015, a $100 investment today could become $120. Should it move to $0.000020, then $100 could grow to $160. A more ambitious push to $0.000030 would double it to about $220. These numbers are appealing, but just like DOGE, SHIB is weighed down by a large circulating supply and a more mature position in the market. Why LILPEPE Could Outshine DOGE and SHIB While DOGE and SHIB remain strong players, Little Pepe brings something fresh. The project has community energy, a unique technical base, and the advantage of starting from a zero market cap. It has already passed a CertiK audit, is listed on CoinMarketCap, and has raised nearly $26 million in record time. The presale is supported by massive incentives like the $777,000 giveaway with more than 382,000 entries. A Mega Giveaway running across presale stages rewards the biggest buyers with over 15 ETH in prizes. These campaigns drive visibility and encourage long-term holding, crucial for price stability once it hits exchanges. With CEX listings expected and whales continuing to accumulate, the catalysts are lining up. If the token reaches its speculative 10000% target, $100 could become $10,000. Even a smaller multiple would still deliver returns that far outpace what DOGE or SHIB can realistically offer today. Conclusion Little Pepe is no longer just a presale meme. It has a roadmap, infrastructure, community, and buzz that rival established names in the market. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu may provide steady gains, but their growth curves are limited by size. LILPEPE, starting from a zero market cap and backed by serious momentum, offers the rare chance of outsized returns. At its current Stage 13 price of $0.0022, a $100 stake could one day be worth $10,000 if the 10000% projection plays out. With presale stages nearly sold out and the launch price already set higher, time is running out for those looking to enter early.

Binance founder CZ has recently emphasized the potential of cryptocurrencies, drawing more investor attention. The digital assets considered to have real potential by experts possess robust fundamentals, along with solid projects. A number of altcoins meet these requirements, but five of them stand out the most; Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, BNB, and Solana (SOL). Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Utility Meets Layer 2 Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has become one of the most closely watched presales of 2025. Now in Stage 13 at $0.0022, the project has raised $26,045,763 of its $28,775,000 target, with over 16 billion tokens sold (92.81%). Tokens are expected to list at $0.003, giving presale supporters an early entry point. Unlike meme tokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB), Little Pepe introduces a dedicated Layer 2 blockchain for memes. This chain could offer ultra-low fees, sniper-bot resistance, and rapid transaction finality. It also includes a memes Launchpad for community-driven projects. The roadmap‚ÄîPregnancy, Birth, Growth‚Äîbalances humor with scalability goals, marketing expansion, and exchange listings. Already on CoinMarketCap, the project is preparing to debut on two major centralized exchanges at launch, with long-term ambitions for the world‚Äôs largest platform. Ethereum (ETH): Still the Bedrock of DeFi Ethereum (ETH) remains central to the industry, with its vast network of decentralized applications. Data from DeFiLlama indicates Ethereum secures over $47 billion in total value locked (TVL), far ahead of other blockchains. While scalability remains an issue, the continued development of rollups and Layer 2 integrations suggests ETH may sustain its dominance. For investors, Ethereum‚Äôs credibility as the ‚Äúworld computer‚Äù positions it as a safer accumulation target during market uncertainty. XRP: Cross-Border Efficiency XRP is in the spotlight due to its cross-border payments use case. The U.S. regulatory clarity Ripple is getting also helps the token‚Äôs sentiment. TradingView also shows that XRP has been seeing steady demand from its institutional partners. These developments cement XRP‚Äôs accumulation thesis for 2025. Speculatively, if global payment corridors increasingly adopt RippleNet, XRP could see renewed relevance in bridging traditional finance with digital settlement layers. BNB: Utility and Exchange Dominance BNB, the native token of Binance, remains critical in sustaining trading activity, fee reductions, and DeFi participation. Despite regulatory challenges facing Binance, BNB maintains a top-five position by market capitalization. CoinMarketCap shows its daily trading volume consistently above $500 million, reflecting its deep liquidity. Accumulation trends suggest investors may view BNB as an ecosystem coin that could continue thriving as Binance expands into multiple markets. Solana (SOL): Speed and Growth Solana (SOL) has recovered from prior setbacks and now processes over 60,000 transactions per second. Developers have increasingly adopted Solana for NFTs, exchanges, and new launches. Its trading volumes frequently rival Ethereum‚Äôs layer 2 solutions, reinforcing its role as a competitive high-performance blockchain. Little Pepe Giveaway Incentives Beyond the presale, Little Pepe has introduced a mega giveaway for its biggest buyers across Stages 12‚Äì17. With 69,600 entries and 102 days left, the program rewards commitment with over 15 ETH in prizes. The top buyer may secure 5 ETH, while 18 others share additional rewards, including random allocations of 0.5 ETH. Combined with the ongoing 10 winners √ó $77,000 presale giveaway, this signals the project‚Äôs commitment to engaging its community. The bigger an investor‚Äôs buy, the bigger their chance of winning, creating an added incentive to participate early. Conclusion Crypto‚Äòs real-world impact is what CZ is focusing on, which may indicate that projects like Little Pepe (LILPEPE) are a new stage in meme finance. Ethereum (ETH), XRP, BNB, and Solana (SOL) are also diverse in this new cycle of accumulation opportunities. A balanced mix of known winners and fresh potential is a positive sign for both patient and imaginative investors this cycle.

Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, recently highlighted the transformative power of cryptocurrencies in improving the quality of life globally. This perspective has amplified interest in specific cryptocurrencies that combine strong fundamentals with innovative projects. In the realm of cryptocurrencies, several have distinguished themselves as not just speculative assets but as pioneers of financial technology. Among these, five cryptocurrencies are frequently highlighted for their investor interest and technological promise: Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL). Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A New Frontier in Meme Cryptocurrencies Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is gaining traction as one of the notable presales, currently at Stage 13 priced at $0.0022. This project has gathered over $26 million towards its funding goal, selling over 16 billion tokens. Unlike typical meme coins, Little Pepe introduces a Layer 2 blockchain tailored for meme-based projects, offering features like low transaction fees and resistance to sniper bots. Ethereum (ETH): The Foundation of Decentralized Applications Ethereum continues to be a cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem, hosting a multitude of decentralized applications. It leads with a total value locked (TVL) of over $47 billion, according to DeFiLlama, largely due to its continuous innovation in scalability and security. Leveraging Layer 2 Technologies Ethereum's integration with various Layer 2 solutions marks a significant step towards handling scalability concerns, ensuring it remains a top choice for developers and investors alike. XRP: Streamlining Global Transactions With its focus on cross-border payments, XRP has been positively impacted by the legal clarity emerging in the U.S. for Ripple, its associated company. This clarity, coupled with steady institutional demand, reinforces its position as a preferred option for global financial transactions. BNB: More Than Just a Utility Token BNB, the native token of the Binance ecosystem, is vital for a variety of functions including trading fee reductions and DeFi activities. Despite facing regulatory scrutiny, BNB consistently shows robust trading volumes which underscore its liquidity and investor confidence. Solana (SOL): High Performance and Rapid Growth Solana's architecture allows it to process transactions at exceedingly fast rates, comparable to centralized databases, making it a favorite for applications requiring high throughput such as NFTs and decentralized exchanges. Attracting Developer Interest The high transaction speed and growing adoption have made Solana a hotbed for developers looking to launch new and innovative applications on blockchain technology. Engagement and Incentives: Little Pepe's Strategic Moves Building on its presale momentum, Little Pepe has introduced a mega giveaway , rewarding large-scale buyers with substantial prizes, including 15 ETH. This strategy not only boosts engagement but also rewards community members for their early support. Conclusion The ongoing development and investor interest in these cryptocurrencies illustrate a broader trend of digital assets playing a pivotal role in the reformation of financial systems worldwide. As these technologies mature, they offer a compelling mix of old financial principles and new technological possibilities, fostering both security and innovation.

While the path to $1 is not impossible, many analysts believe that $0.50 is a more realistic short-term target. This conversation about Dogecoin has also opened the door to exploring its competitors. A few new tokens show fresh momentum and may have an even stronger case to reach $1. Among them is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , which has already rewarded early buyers with over 120% gains in its presale. Analysts suggest the token could deliver over 15,000% growth from its starting market cap, making it one of the strongest speculative plays in the meme coin space today. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price and Outlook As of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.14, according to CoinMarketCap . The coin has shown higher lows since June, suggesting steady buying interest. On the charts, DOGE has clear resistance near $0.20, which has been tested several times. If bulls flip that level into support, the next target could be $0.30. Reaching $1 is still on the table, especially if Bitcoin leads the market higher in the next bull wave. However, a move to $0.50 seems much more likely in the medium term. That level would already represent more than a 200% gain from today‚Äôs price and still allow Dogecoin to remain the leader of meme coins. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Little Pepe has become one of the year's most exciting meme coin stories. Unlike tokens that launch without structure, LILPEPE combines meme culture with real infrastructure. It is building its own Layer 2 designed specifically for meme trading, which makes swaps faster and cheaper. The token price in stage 13 of the presale is $0.0022, and over $26 million has already been raised. More than 92% of the stage is sold out, showing how quickly investors move in. From stage 1 pricing at $0.001, investors are already up by 120%. At launch, LILPEPE will be listed at $0.003, meaning buyers at the current stage can still lock in around 37% gains before trading begins. What makes LILPEPE different is the zero market cap advantage. It has room for exponential growth with no baggage of a bloated valuation. Analysts believe this sets the stage for potential 15000% returns in the coming cycles. Additionally, the project is Certik audited, sniper bot resistant, and offers zero tax on buys and sells. It also runs major community campaigns like the 777k giveaway with over 388,000 entries, plus a Mega Giveaway for top buyers worth over 15 ETH. Excitement is also building for upcoming centralized exchange listings. This could bring bigger liquidity and push momentum higher once trading opens. Many analysts now believe LILPEPE has the clearest path among meme coins to deliver 15,000% gains or more from presale levels. Popcat (POPCAT) Popcat is trading at about $0.45 today. The coin has held strong support near $0.40, which buyers have defended multiple times. Technicals suggest that if it breaks $0.50 with convincing volume, the next leg higher could take it to $0.70 and beyond. Traders speculate on a possible path to $1 in the next cycle. That means over a 2x move from current levels, which is realistic given its market position. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) Peanut the Squirrel is currently priced around $0.24. It has a circulating supply close to one billion tokens, giving it a market cap near $240 million. Chart patterns show a strong floor near $0.20 and repeated resistance at $0.30. If that barrier is cleared with sustained volume, PNUT could run toward $0.50. Analysts have suggested upside targets as high as $0.77 in 2025 if the market stays bullish. A climb to $1 would mean a $1 billion market cap, a 4x from today. That path is not guaranteed, but it cannot be ruled out in a strong meme cycle. Conclusion Dogecoin is still the king of meme coins, but its road to $1 is long and challenging. Popcat and Peanut the Squirrel both have momentum and could surprise to the upside if technical levels break. But Little Pepe is the most promising competitor with real infrastructure, a strong presale, massive community campaigns, and a zero market cap advantage that leaves room for 15000% projected gains.

Among these, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has gained noteworthy traction, showcasing significant presale gains and a robust roadmap aimed at substantial growth. A Snapshot of Dogecoin's Current Trajectory Dogecoin, a frontrunner in the meme cryptocurrency arena, trades at around $0.14 as indicated by CoinMarketCap . With its price experiencing a gentle upward trend, analysts suggest a near-term target of $0.50, a figure more attainable than the elusive $1 mark, yet still an impressive achievement should it materialize. Potential Rising Stars in Meme Coin Universe With Dogecoin's fluctuating performance, the spotlight turns to its counterparts that are making significant strides in the market. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Among the vibrant new entries, Little Pepe is strategically positioning itself within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Beyond its meme appeal, the coin is backed by an innovative Layer 2 infrastructure tailored for efficient meme trading. Despite its early stage, LILPEPE has already achieved a market presence with substantial potential for upward mobility. Further, Little Pepe distinguishes itself through substantial community engagement initiatives, including the 777k giveaway and a major giveaway targeting top investors. These campaigns, coupled with its anticipated listings on prominent exchanges, set the stage for significant valuation growth, potentially surpassing 15,000% from its presale phase. Other Notable Contenders Coins like Popcat and Peanut the Squirrel are also on the radar. Popcat, currently trading near $0.45, shows promise of breaking the $1 barrier if it overcomes established resistance levels. Meanwhile, Peanut the Squirrel, with a stable support base, could see considerable growth, aiming for a potential $1 valuation in the future. Conclusion While Dogecoin remains a beloved meme coin, the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market continuously brings new players into the limelight. Coins like Little Pepe are not only enhancing the meme coin concept through substantial technological infrastructure but are also setting new benchmarks in community engagement and market growth potential.

Although meme coins are alluring with their promotional highs, Mutuum Finance is accompanied by actual utility and innovative DeFi solutions through offering decentralized lending and borrowing on the basis of peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer protocols. The project has already successfully raised more than $16.5 million in its ongoing presale, having been acquired by more than 16,620 holders, and its value has increased from $0.01 to $0.035, with the next phase set to increase up to $0.04 since phase 6 is more than 50% sold out. With robust security measures, a clear roadmap, and a rapidly growing community, Mutuum Finance is a more suitable choice for investors looking for security and high potential returns in the light of Ethereum‚Äôs recent volatility. Ethereum‚Äôs Critical Turning Point: Support Levels to Watch Out For Before the Next Rally Ethereum (ETH) lost another significant support level, and traders are concerned about its short-term trajectory. The subsequent major support is at around the $3,800 mark, a region that will likely be retested over the coming few days. Provided ETH continues to hold at this level, it could trigger a rapid rally and even reverse the current downtrend. However, failure to hold here could lead to further decline in the price down towards the $3,500 region before turning around. While investors continue to closely watch these critical levels, a large majority are already gearing up for the next market upsurge and positioning themselves in advance in Mutuum Finance, which stands to gain a great deal when momentum comes back. Mutuum Finance Builds on Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is experiencing explosive growth during its sixth presale wave, as interest is booming as the project crosses $16.5 million raised and rallies the support of over 16,620 holders. Early investors are positioning themselves for spectacular potential gains when the token hits the open market. Aside from its strong presale, Mutuum Finance is hard at work building a solid ecosystem that further includes developing a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. To further enhance platform security and instill investor confidence, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The program invites security researchers, white-hat hackers, and developers to discover bugs in the protocol, with rewards allocated by severity level, from minor and low to critical and major. This innovative initiative demonstrates Mutuum Finance‚Äôs dedication to user security and long-term ecosystem stability. In addition to these security aspects, the project is also increasing community engagement through an early-bird token reward program worth $100,000. Through this initiative, there are 10 winners who receive $10,000 MUTM tokens each, thereby encouraging early adoption and community engagement. Vision and Technological Innovation Mutuum Finance‚Äôs main vision is to shatter the boundaries of decentralized finance (DeFi) by creating a robust, secure, and scalable ecosystem. Staying true to this function, the platform employs Chainlink oracles to power trading, lending, and settlement activities, providing highly accurate USD-denominated price feeds for major assets like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. As a precaution during times of volatile market performance, the system has fallback oracle arrangements, composite data providers, and time-weighted average prices (TWAPs) from decentralized exchanges. The protocol infrastructure is centered around a closed-order book system with significant emphasis on reducing market risk and illiquidity management. Liquidation levels, close-level parameters, and liquidator incentive structures are some of the parameters that are used to maintain a stable lending atmosphere. Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and liquidation rules are dynamically controlled based on the volatility of assets, and the higher the volatility of the assets, the stricter the lending terms. Moreover, multipliers are also reserved in accordance with asset risk weightings to increase the stability, security, and robustness of the platform under various market conditions. MUTM Takes the Spotlight Ethereum‚Äôs fall below $4,000 has provided a chance for high-potential altcoins, and Mutuum Finance is one such token. Having raised over $16.5 million, 16,620+ investors, and tokens rising from $0.01 to $0.035, MUTM brings together strong utility with real DeFi innovation. Underpinned by strong security, a well-defined roadmap, and instant adoption, it offers an attractive opportunity before the next market boom.

The legislation would require private messages to be scanned for prohibited content, sparking concerns among privacy advocates and tech leaders. Buterin argued that such measures not only undermine the fundamental right to privacy but also weaken the security of digital communications. He warned that creating backdoors for law enforcement would ‚Äúinevitably lead to their hacking,‚Äù leaving all users, including law-abiding citizens exposed to new risks. Critics Call Out Hypocrisy And Rising Dangers The controversy gained momentum after entrepreneur Peter Levels urged European citizens to reject the law. According to reports, the draft bill contains exemptions for government officials, military personnel, and intelligence officers. Buterin called this a clear act of hypocrisy , pointing out that citizens would face surveillance while authorities remain untouched. The initiative has already secured the support of 15 EU countries, but has not yet reached the majority needed under EU voting rules. Germany‚Äôs stance will ultimately decide the outcome , making it a decisive player in the bill‚Äôs future. A Push Toward Decentralized Alternatives Opponents stress that the bill clashes with Articles 7 and 8 of the EU Charter , which guarantee the protection of privacy and personal data. Some experts warn that if passed, the legislation could accelerate the adoption of decentralized Web3 platforms. Hans Rempel, CEO of Diode, noted that the slogan ‚Äúnot your keys, not your data‚Äù has become increasingly relevant as users grow wary of centralized platforms. Brickken spokesperson Elisenda F√†brega added that the EU risks losing global influence over digital privacy standards if it moves forward with the law.

The talks between Sam and Mohammed centered on building stronger cooperation between OpenAI and organizations in the Emirates. Officials reported that both men focused on artificial intelligence research and practical applications inside the country. Mohammed said : ‚ÄúThis cooperation aligns with the UAE‚Äôs ambition to establish an integrated AI ecosystem, supporting the country‚Äôs development plans and its drive to build a knowledge-based economy.‚Äù The UAE has been spending billions of dollars to become a global player in AI. It is developing one of the world‚Äôs largest AI data centers and has announced a new Arabic-language AI model. Officials are also working to use the country‚Äôs strong ties with the United States to secure access to AI technology. In May, the UAE and the U.S. signed a deal for the Gulf state to build one of the largest artificial intelligence campuses outside the United States. That deal was announced during President Donald Trump‚Äôs visit to Abu Dhabi earlier this year, underscoring the scale of the cooperation between Washington and Abu Dhabi on AI infrastructure. UAE expands AI projects and engages OpenAI The meeting between Mohammed and Sam is tied directly to these ambitions. Emirati officials want to bring OpenAI into the country‚Äôs larger AI ecosystem to ensure that investments in data centers and research projects result in real-world applications. The UAE is betting that this will help speed up its economic shift away from oil by boosting technology capacity. The government‚Äôs message was clear: it wants not only research partnerships but also deployment of AI applications across industries inside the country. The meeting also took place against the backdrop of a massive funding announcement from Nvidia, the world‚Äôs most valuable listed tech company. Last week, Nvidia said it would invest $100 billion into OpenAI to support its large-scale data center build-out, as Cryptopolitan reported. The size of this investment has raised concerns among investors about the possibility of an AI bubble. Nvidia had already taken part in a $6.6 billion investment round in OpenAI in October 2024. It also holds about 7% of CoreWeave, a firm that provides data center capacity to OpenAI and also buys Nvidia products. That stake was worth about $3 billion at the end of June. These overlapping relationships make it hard to track where the money flows. Many of Nvidia‚Äôs financing agreements are too small individually to be classified as material in filings but may be significant when added up. Nvidia‚Äôs equity stakes also help companies like OpenAI and CoreWeave secure debt for data center projects at lower interest rates. Jay Goldberg, an analyst at Seaport Global Securities, said such deals are like ‚Äúsomeone asking their parents to be a co-signer on their mortgage.‚Äù Lenders gain confidence from Nvidia‚Äôs backing and cut the cost of borrowing. Startups building data centers have often had to pay interest rates as high as 15%, compared to 6% to 9% for large corporations such as Microsoft. With Nvidia‚Äôs support, OpenAI and CoreWeave have been able to borrow at rates close to what Microsoft or Google pay. The Sam Altman meeting in Abu Dhabi and the financial moves by Nvidia show how the UAE‚Äôs AI plans, OpenAI‚Äôs expansion, and the chipmaker‚Äôs funding strategy are now tightly linked.

Cardano‚Äôs recent activities are focused on building a stronger ecosystem with a focus on stablecoin liquidity and more venture projects. In spite of these developments, a new token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is coming in with unbelievable traction. In its ongoing presale, Mutuum has already accumulated over $16.5 million, with more than 16,620 holders on board. The project‚Äôs innovative approach to decentralized finance, accompanied by its commitment to security and utility, makes it a superior substitute to ADA. With the DeFi market still increasing, Mutuum Finance is an investable prospect. Cardano (ADA), Stablecoins at the Center of a Brash New Roadmap Cardano is ready for a transition with the release into the second part of its three-year development roadmap, as stablecoins and ecosystem growth are set in the limelight. The Cardano Foundation has committed an eight-figure ADA liquidity injection to stablecoin projects, with the aim of boosting liquidity pools and powering DeFi adoption through its new Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity Budget. In addition to liquidity, the plan calls for bold action to further solidify the roots of the ecosystem, including 2 million ADA being allocated to the Venture Hub to incubate native projects and 220 million ADA to support 11 decentralized representatives, boosting participation in governance. Other projects will aim to integrate with actual world assets, broader exchange listings, and adoption of the advanced x402 payments system. Operationally, the Foundation is raising its demand generation budget by 12% and terminating its long-standing SPO delegation practice, which reflects a higher level of commitment to decentralization. As Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson hints at Cardano‚Äôs potential to ‚Äúbreak the internet,‚Äù the re-focused priority on liquidity, utility, and regulatory compliance on the platform puts it in position for the next generation of blockchain adoption, a strategic move that also positions trailblazing DeFi entries like Mutuum Finance to further build upon and expand on this new generation of financial infrastructure. Mutuum Finance Presale Acceleration: Investor Confidence at an All-Time High Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to propel its amazing pace into its sixth presale stage with record-breaking new heights, smashing all-time records with the unmatched level of investor enthusiasm. With more than 16,620 registered participants and more than $16.5 million in funds raised so far, the project is breaking records across the board, an unmistakable indicator of the growing confidence of the market in its vision for the long-term future. For people looking for meaningful and long-term returns, Mutuum Finance‚Äôs expanding ecosystem is a sound platform for investment. Security is one of the pillars of Mutuum Finance‚Äôs vision. To create a safer and stronger ecosystem, the project has partnered with CertiK to launch an official bug bounty program with an initial reward pool of $50,000. Four types of vulnerabilities, classified as critical, major, minor, and low, have been included in the program to ensure comprehensive detection and prevention of potential threats before they impact users. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs security architecture is complemented by a dynamic LTV and liquidation system, which varies in accordance with real-time collateral volatility. Reserve multiplier mechanism on the site also has a 10% buffer, reaching as high as 35% for more risky forms of collateral. This precision-driven framework strikes the balance perfectly between security and transparency, offering a stable, solid, and secure DeFi environment. Cardano vs Mutuum Finance: The Final Pick Cardano‚Äôs strategy, with an eight-figure ADA liquidity injection, 2 million ADA for venture growth, and 220 million ADA for governance, is a forceful step toward mass DeFi adoption. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance presale, with over $16.5 million raised and 16,620+ investors, shows robust market momentum. Don‚Äôt wait, join the Mutuum Finance presale today and be an early adopter in a rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem.

Analysts Highlight Digitap‚Äôs 50x Presale,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cardano-price-prediction-which-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-now-analysts-highlight-digitaps-50x-presale/,"BitcoinWorld Cardano Price Prediction: Which Is The Best Crypto To Buy Now? Analysts Highlight Digitap‚Äôs 50x Presale Cardano is hanging by a thread at $0.81. The OG altcoin slipped over 7% this week after whales dumped 160 million ADA and dormant wallets roared back to life. Analysts say $0.84 is the make-or-break zone. Hold it, and bulls could push for $0.96. Lose it, and a quick slide to $0.76 is on the cards. That‚Äôs a tricky scenario for smart investors who are looking for the best crypto to buy now. And it might explain why most wallets are moving hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Digitap ($TAP) presale . It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs first omni-bank and has already raised nearly $200K in its presale. While Cardano lingers in uncertainty, analysts hint at a potential 50x price move in 2025 for $TAP. Cardano Balances Between Key Support and Stubborn Caps Cardano is dancing on a knife‚Äôs edge. After slipping to $0.81 , ADA now finds itself locked between heavy support and stubborn resistance zones. The major support sits between $0.79 and $0.84. This level has been tested multiple times. If ADA can stay above this floor, there‚Äôs room for buyers to push toward $0.92 and possibly $0.96, both of which have acted as ceilings in the past. Climbing past $0.96 could shift sentiment and open the door to the much-awaited $1 milestone. At that point, ADA might land on the investor radar for Q4. Source: TradingView But every coin has two sides. A break below $0.79 could be in the cards. And such a scenario could expose ADA to deeper support around $0.76 and even $0.72. That would shift sentiment and put bulls on the defensive. For now, the trend somehow still leans bullish. The moving averages favor buyers, and RSI sits close to 50. In plain terms, Cardano‚Äôs Q4 2025 journey could go anywhere from here. Hold the floor, and the upside targets stay alive. Lose it, and the bears take the driver‚Äôs seat. In any case, Cardano is far from being considered the best crypto to buy now. Cardano Price Prediction: Analysts Split on Next Move Cardano‚Äôs charts seem all set for a rebound, but the story behind the scenes adds fuel to the fire. On-chain data from Santiment shows dormant wallets are suddenly waking up. ADA is moving to exchanges. History says this ‚ÄúAge Consumed‚Äù spike often signals more selling ahead. And the wallets woke up right as ADA slipped on September 22, 2025. Source: Santiment Ripple Bull Winkle sees ADA boxed in between $0.84 and $0.96. The analyst believes this range is ‚Äúthe immediate battleground.‚Äù His take is that as long as $0.84 holds, bulls keep control. Break it, and ADA will enter the bear territory. Crypto Kid is more optimistic with his take. He‚Äôs betting on ADA ‚Äúrepeating history‚Äù and breaking out in October or November. His chart points to a bullish surge if momentum sticks. Another analyst on X, FOUR , seems a bit cautious. The analyst believes ADA is testing a key support in a demand zone. Bounce here, and ADA climbs. Fail, and a deeper correction could follow. With so much uncertainty attached to Cardano, ADA doesn‚Äôt seem like the best crypto to buy now. How Digitap‚Äôs $200K Presale Shows Demand for Its Omni-Bank Model Cardano may be battling its support levels, but Digitap faced no hurdles in becoming an instant hit. Known as the world‚Äôs first omni-bank, Digitap is a complete ecosystem designed to give users banking, trading, and payments in one place. Thanks to Digitap‚Äôs latest innovation, users can now use one app where their money isn‚Äôt scattered across exchanges, wallets, and banks. That‚Äôs the promise Digitap makes. And it‚Äôs not just traders that Digitap serves. Merchants and freelancers can have peace of mind by auto-converting crypto into fiat right at the point of sale. That basically means no sleepless nights over sudden dips and no guessing games with income. Digitap is making crypto practical for everyday business. That‚Äôs something other altcoins only dream about. The market clearly sees the potential. With nearly $290K raised and over 22 million $TAP tokens already grabbed in the Digitap presale, investors are after something bigger than short-term price swings. At just $0.0125 in Round 1, $TAP is priced like a penny stock with blue-chip ambitions. The next round jumps to $0.0159. And this will hand over early buyers a stunning 27% profit before the year is even out. And this could mean $TAP is the best crypto to buy now. While ADA needs to fight to get back above resistance, Digitap is already a hot topic before its listing. It brings utility today and growth tomorrow. That‚Äôs why investors are filling their wallets with Digitap ($TAP) before its potential 50x price jump post-launch. Alt Coins to Watch: Cardano‚Äôs Struggles vs Digitap‚Äôs Rise Momentum still leans bullish, at least for now. Buyers haven‚Äôt thrown in the towel, and a solid bounce could unlock a path back to $0.92 or even $0.96, assuming volume shows up. That said, the outlook isn‚Äôt without cracks. Some dormant wallets are back in the game, larger holders appear to be cashing out, and on-chain data hints at weakening sentiment. ADA could end up stuck in its current range. ADA will be testing nerves while the market waits for a catalyst that may not arrive until later in Q4 2025. For now, if $0.84 crumbles, the ADA price slide could be quick toward $0.76 or lower. That would rattle sentiment and push investors to rethink ADA‚Äôs short-term prospects. On the other hand, Digitap remains on the higher ground. With no heavy baggage, a working presale, and a clear use case, $TAP gives investors the asymmetric upside Cardano can‚Äôt promise right now. In other words, at a time when ADA struggles for momentum, Digitap is grabbing headlines as the best crypto to buy now. Best Crypto to Buy Now: Cardano or Digitap? Cardano‚Äôs path in Q4 looks like a coin toss. Strong support zones are holding, but whale moves and dormant wallets keep adding pressure to one of the top 10 altcoins. That‚Äôs why analysts are split. Some call for a breakout, others warn of a deeper correction. For investors, this is the classic bull vs. bear standoff. But while ADA faces harsh resistance, Digitap is still in its presale sweet spot. With almost $290K raised and 50x price pump potential on the table, it‚Äôs climbing the list of top altcoins to watch as the best crypto to buy now. For investors on the hunt for the best crypto to buy in 2025, $TAP‚Äôs rising popularity and influence are hard to ignore.

The proposal aims to remove the fixed block compute unit (CU) limit after the Alpenglow update. Solana currently has a limit of 60 million CUs per block, and this limit is about to be increased to 100 million with SIMD-0286. The Firedancer team notes that this static limit is now unnecessary because with Alpenglow, blocks that cannot be processed in time can be automatically skipped. With the new mechanism, block producers will be able to add as many transactions as possible to blocks. Slower validators will skip these blocks and lose their rewards. This will incentivize lower-performing validators to upgrade their software and hardware, while also allowing network capacity to grow based on market dynamics rather than fixed limits. The Firedancer team argues that this change will create a ‚Äúflywheel effect‚Äù: Block producers will increase their performance to add more transactions, other validators will have to keep up, and ultimately, Solana‚Äôs transaction capacity will scale with its hardware power. Related News: Long-Time Analyst Changes Strategy on Altcoins: Sold Most Altcoins, Bought These If the proposal is adopted, increasing block sizes over time on Solana could mean more transaction capacity and lower congestion for users and application developers. However, experts argue that the impact of larger blocks on the network's distribution time and the potential impact on concurrent block producer designs should be carefully considered. SIMD-0370 is currently in the ‚Äúreview‚Äù phase. *This is not investment advice.

At this level, the ratio is far beyond the highs seen during the Dotcom bubble and the pandemic rally, when it reached around 190%. For markets, this is uncharted ground. This yardstick first caught attention after Warren Buffett himself called it ‚Äúprobably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment‚Äù in a 2001 Fortune column. Back then, the ratio had been near 150% at the height of the Dotcom craze. He warned investors, saying: ‚ÄúIf the percentage relationship falls to the 70% or 80% area, buying stocks is likely to work very well for you. If the ratio approaches 200% ‚Äî as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000 ‚Äî you are playing with fire.‚Äù Today, at 218%, the fire alarm isn‚Äôt just ringing, it‚Äôs deafening. Tech giants drive rally The surge has been powered by mega-cap technology firms. These companies have thrown billions into artificial intelligence projects and are being rewarded with record valuations. Equity values are growing much faster than the economy itself, creating a disconnect that is exactly what this ratio was meant to show. Other valuation tools are sending similar messages.The S&P 500‚Äôs price-to-sales ratio, according to Bespoke Investment Group, has reached 3.33.For perspective, the Dotcom peak topped at 2.27.The post-COVID boom pushed it to 3.21 before easing. That makes today‚Äôs number the highest on record. Investors like Paul Tudor Jones have also looked to the Buffett indicator in the past as a signal for overheated conditions, and the current level is well beyond anything seen in two decades. Some argue this metric doesn‚Äôt say what it once did. The U.S. economy has transformed in the last twenty years. It is less dependent on factories and heavy assets, and more on technology, software, and data networks. Traditional GDP and GNP numbers may not fully capture this shift. That has led some to suggest that higher valuations could be justified in an economy increasingly built on intellectual property. Still, the extreme reading comes as Buffett himself has stayed quiet on the indicator for years. What he has done is build a mountain of cash at Berkshire Hathaway. The firm reported a hoard of $344.1 billion in the second quarter, and it has been a net seller of equities for eleven straight quarters. He is preparing to hand over leadership to Greg Abel, but the timing of that handoff comes with Berkshire‚Äôs fortress-like balance sheet intact. Whether the indicator is outdated or not, the numbers are hard to ignore. At 218%, the market is priced higher against the economy than at any point in history.

Remittix is already on their radar, with live wallet beta testing and a fresh 15% USDT referral reward that pays out and can be claimed daily. The combination of real product progress, security credentials from CertiK, and a still-low entry price has created a window that early movers rarely see twice. Cardano price watchers remain confident in ADA‚Äôs long-term path, but rotation is real when a payment utility play shows visible execution. If you want exposure to growth with near-term catalysts, you do not wait for the crowd to bless it. ADA‚Äôs Setup Right Now At the time of writing, ADA trades at around $0.85 to $0.90. Cardano price models indicate potential resistance between $1.10 and $1.25 if buyers step in. A clean break could invite a trek toward $1.40, while a slip under $0.85 risks retesting near $0.75. Cardano price discussions remain constructive, thanks to staking, network upgrades, and developer traction. Even so, when momentum chases utility plus speed, capital can migrate. Remittix: Product Live, Rewards Live, Momentum Building Remittix is priced near $0.1130 and continues to attract attention because the wallet beta is currently active with community testers. The 15% USDT referral reward is now live and claimable every 24 hours through the dashboard, which accelerates organic distribution. Security is not something that can be ticked off quietly. CertiK fully verifies the team, and the project is ranked number one on the CertiK pre-launch leaderboard. That combination of live product plus third-party trust is exactly what risk capital wants. Centralized exchange access is lining up with BitMart and LBank confirmed, and a third listing is in preparation. Why Analysts Tip Remittix Over Passive Holds Support for 40-plus cryptocurrencies and 30-plus fiat pairs expands addressable demand. Live foreign exchange conversion and in-app swaps reduce friction for everyday use. A deflationary token design favors patient holders as utility scales. CertiK verification and a number one pre-launch rank raise credibility with institutions. A sub-one-dollar price of $0.1130 offers simple upside math if adoption increases. Bottom Line For Rotating Capital The Cardano price can still surprise to the upside, and a push through $1.10 to $1.25 would improve the trend. But if you are seeking the best mix of utility, security receipts, and immediate catalysts, Remittix has the edge today. The Wallet beta is live, 15% USDT rewards are live, CertiK verification is public, exchange listings are queued, and the price remains early. In fast markets, hesitation is a position to take. Make Cardano price work for your base exposure, but secure your asymmetric shot while the window is still open.

Here‚Äôs How to Profit from It,https://timestabloid.com/expert-predicts-xrp-mega-pump-heres-how-to-profit-from-it/,"Levi Rietveld, the creator of Crypto Crusaders, has reiterated his stance on buying XRP during price downturns, a strategy he says has been consistent across his platforms. In a recent video posted on X, Rietveld highlighted his earlier calls to purchase XRP at significantly lower prices and urged his audience to act decisively when sentiment in the market appeared weakest. ‚ÄúI told you guys to buy XRP at $2.67. I told you again to buy XRP at $2.72. Now look at where the price is today,‚Äù Rietveld said. The video, released when XRP was trading at $2.77, has since gained attention as the cryptocurrency moved higher to $2.81, recording a 24-hour peak of $2.82. MAJOR #XRP PUMP! pic.twitter.com/JCoMK2n2sf ‚Äî Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) September 27, 2025 Surviving Market Manipulation In his video, Rietveld criticized what he described as institutional efforts to shake out retail traders , suggesting that recent volatility was not purely market-driven. He urged his followers to see these periods of heavy selling as opportunities to increase their holdings rather than as reasons to sell, telling them to ‚Äúbuy more than you‚Äôve ever bought before.‚Äù Rietveld argued that retail traders often panic when prices drop, which, in his view, allows larger players to profit at their expense. He advised investors to act decisively during such downturns, insisting that discipline and confidence during volatility and market manipulation could help them avoid losses and position themselves for gains when prices recover. Encouraging Traders to Remain Alert Beyond the price discussion, Rietveld urged his audience to stay disciplined and avoid reacting emotionally to market swings. He cautioned traders against falling for what he described as common market traps and advised them to remain consistent in their strategy rather than panicking during sudden price dips . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 His tone throughout the video suggested frustration with retail traders who he believes panic in response to short-term price trends. By encouraging a disciplined strategy, Rietveld reinforced his earlier claims that staying committed during volatile periods could lead to stronger long-term results . XRP‚Äôs Price Shift While XRP struggled over the past week, its price is now recovering rapidly. The immediate price movement following Rietveld‚Äôs video has been modest but notable, with XRP rising from $2.77 to $2.81 within the same day, briefly touching $2.82. Rietveld‚Äôs post suggests an XRP Mega pump is coming, and this increase appears to serve as partial validation of his advice to buy during periods of fear.

52390632,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=822130,1759073146,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52390632.jpeg,"OPEC+ plans to raise oil production by 137,000 barrels per day in November",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/opec-to-boost-production-by-137000-barrels/,"OPEC+ is expected to approve another production increase of 137,000 barrels per day at its meeting next Sunday, according to a report from Reuters on Sunday. This follows months of output hikes since April, all aimed at regaining lost market share and taking advantage of higher oil prices . The bloc, which controls around half of the world‚Äôs oil supply, includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia, and a few other allies. Since reversing its output cut strategy earlier this year, OPEC+ has already raised quotas by over 2.5 million barrels per day, roughly 2.4% of global demand. The reversal came under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who wanted lower oil prices. OPEC+ discusses final cut rollbacks as prices spike A final decision on the November increase will be made at an online meeting on October 5, involving eight OPEC+ producers. That increase is expected to match October‚Äôs 137,000 barrels per day bump, as confirmed by the same sources. The group did not respond to media requests, and Saudi Arabia‚Äôs oil ministry also remained silent. Since the group started rolling back cuts in April, oil prices have hovered mostly between $60 and $70 per barrel. But last Friday, prices surged to their highest since August 1, crossing the $70 mark. The spike followed Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian energy sites, which hit refining operations and interrupted oil shipments ‚Äî Russia being one of the largest oil exporters globally. At the height of its coordinated production cuts, OPEC+ had pulled 5.85 million barrels per day off the market. That reduction was broken into three parts: 2.2 million bpd in voluntary cuts, another 1.65 million bpd sliced by eight members, and a broader 2 million bpd reduction agreed to by the full group. Those cuts were rolled out to prop up prices when demand fell. Now, that rollback is in full swing. The eight countries involved started removing the 1.65 million bpd layer this month with the current 137,000 bpd increase. They had already agreed to fully unwind the 2.2 million bpd voluntary cuts by the end of September. The third and final layer of 2 million bpd is still in place and is expected to remain until end-2026. Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates was given a separate approval to raise its own production by 300,000 barrels per day between April and September, as part of a side agreement within the broader OPEC+ framework. Even with all the planned hikes, many members aren‚Äôt hitting their quotas. Industry analysts say most are already pumping as much as they possibly can.

CoinDesk Senior Analyst James van Straten said bitcoin‚Äôs market structure has shifted alongside gold‚Äôs repricing. He expects a slow, stair-step advance supported by steady ETF inflows, with 10‚Äì20% pullbacks along the way. He compared the setup to gold in the early 2000s, when prices climbed for years but often paused for healthy corrections. In his framing, bitcoin may sometimes lag gold and sometimes outperform it, yet he still sees bitcoin leading on total returns over a full cycle. Read More: Bitcoin Trails Equities, Metals, and USD in Q3. Here Is a Key Level to Watch for Next Move Micha√´l van de Poppe focused on near-term levels. He called sub-$107,000 a buy zone, signaling where he thinks dip buyers are likely to step in. He also pointed to $112,000 as the ceiling to beat. A clean break and hold above $112,000 on UTC closes would, in his view, confirm strength and broaden risk appetite, the point at which flows often rotate into large altcoins. That is what he means by ‚Äúaltcoin mode.‚Äù Euro Capital CEO Peter Schiff, meanwhile, challenged Michael Saylor‚Äôs strategy by contrasting Strategy‚Äôs bitcoin exposure with a hypothetical gold program. His core claim is liquidity. He argued that tens of billions of dollars in gold could be sold with limited market impact, while trying to exit a similar bitcoin position could hit prices hard and set off copycat selling. Supporters of bitcoin would counter that any large seller could stage exits over time and use over-the-counter channels, but Schiff‚Äôs point is that gold‚Äôs market depth offers more flexibility to very large holders. CoinDesk Research analysis Window: Sept. 27, 09:00 UTC to Sept. 28, 08:00 UTC. What happened: According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, bitcoin consolidated in about a $692 band (~1%), between $109,156.82 and $109,849.28. Support showed up: repeated holds near ~$109,400 late on Sept. 27 (UTC). Resistance formed: ~$109,750 capped rebounds in that same late-evening window. Final 60 minutes: between 07:09 UTC and 08:08 UTC on Sept. 28, price popped to $109,663.84 at 08:03 UTC, then settled near ~$109,580, turning ~$109,575 into fresh, short-term support. Read-through: Support ~$109,400‚Äì$109,575; resistance ~$109,750. A UTC close above ~$109,750 sets up $110,000‚Äì$111,000. Lose ~$109,400, and ~$109,150 is next. Latest 24-hour and one-month chart read 24-hour context (as of Sept. 28, 14:41 UTC): price near $109,724 sits above ~$109,400/109,575 support and below ~$109,750 resistance. A break and hold above ~$109,750 (UTC) points to $110,000‚Äì$111,000, with $112,000 the broader momentum trigger many traders watch. A slip back under ~$109,400 risks a retest of ~$109,150, then ~$108,500. One-month context: after mid-September highs near ~$117,000, bitcoin has compressed into the $109,000‚Äì$112,000 area. Reclaiming and holding $112,000 would likely reignite upside momentum. Failing that, more sideways consolidation is the base case rather than a trend break on its own.

According to CNBC, Sam Altman‚Äôs artificial intelligence company is now valued at $500 billion and has been signing contracts worth tens to hundreds of billions of dollars even as it burns cash. Those deals have already pushed the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to record highs this week after Nvidia agreed to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. That agreement came right after a $300 billion deal between OpenAI and Oracle in July under the Stargate program, a $500 billion infrastructure project also funded by SoftBank. The spending spree has not slowed. On Thursday, CoreWeave announced it had signed to provide OpenAI up to $22.4 billion in AI infrastructure, an increase from the $11.9 billion first announced in March. Earlier this month, Broadcom said it had secured a new $10 billion customer, and analysts pointed to OpenAI. The company insists that scaling is key for future breakthroughs, but investors are beginning to question the size of the sums and OpenAI‚Äôs dependence on a growing network of infrastructure partners. OpenAI expands its giant web of commitments OpenAI has been busy building financial links with its suppliers.It took a $350 million stake in CoreWeave ahead of its IPO in March.Nvidia formalized its stake by joining a $6.6 billion funding round in October. Oracle is spending about $40 billion on Nvidia chips to power one of OpenAI‚Äôs Stargate data centers, Cryptopolitan reported from a Financial Times note in May. Earlier this month, CoreWeave disclosed an order worth at least $6.3 billion from Nvidia. Through the $100 billion investment in OpenAI, Nvidia will get equity and earn revenue at the same time. The revenue gap is huge. OpenAI expects only $13 billion this year. CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC, ‚ÄúWhen the internet was getting started, people kept feeling like, ‚ÄòOh, we‚Äôre over-building, there‚Äôs too much. Look where we are today, right?‚Äô‚Äù Altman told CNBC in August that he is willing to run the company at a loss to prioritize growth and its investments. Analysts warn about risks tied to Nvidia deal Some analysts are sounding alarms. They say the Nvidia deal resembles vendor financing patterns that helped burst the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. Nvidia has been the biggest winner of the AI boom because it makes the GPUs needed to train models and run large AI workloads. Its investment in OpenAI, to be paid out over several years, will help build data centers based on its GPUs. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be a skeptic about AI technology‚Äôs promise in general to see this announcement as a troubling signal about how self-referential the entire space has become,‚Äù Bespoke Investment Group wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. ‚ÄúIf NVDA has to provide the capital that becomes its revenues in order to maintain growth, the whole ecosystem may be unsustainable.‚Äù Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at One Point BFG Wealth Partners, said the names of companies from the late 1990s were ringing in his ears after the OpenAI‚ÄìNvidia deal. He added that the transaction is ‚Äúso much bigger in terms of dollars.‚Äù ‚ÄúFor this whole massive experiment to work without causing large losses, OpenAI and its peers now have got to generate huge revenues and profits to pay for all the obligations they are signing up for and at the same time provide a return to its investors,‚Äù Boockvar said. An OpenAI spokesperson referred CNBC to comments from Altman and Friar this week, adding that the company is pursuing ‚Äúa once-in-a-century opportunity that demands ambition equal to the moment.‚Äù Bain & Company‚Äôs 2025 Technology Report says total demand for compute could reach 200 gigawatts by 2030. Building enough data centers to meet that demand would cost about $500 billion a year, meaning AI companies would need a combined $2 trillion in annual revenue to cover the costs. Even if companies throw their full weight behind cloud and data centers, ‚Äúthe amount would still fall $800 billion short of the revenue needed to fund the full investment,‚Äù Bain said. Despite the concerns, Altman brushed off criticism on Tuesday and rejected the idea that the infrastructure spending spree is excessive. ‚ÄúThis is what it takes to deliver AI,‚Äù Altman told CNBC. ‚ÄúUnlike previous technological revolutions or previous versions of the internet, there‚Äôs so much infrastructure that‚Äôs required, and this is a small sample of it.‚Äù Get seen where it counts.

Specifically, the fund manager unloaded $250million worth of Ethereum in just five trading days. Data on spot Ethereum ETF flows by Coinglass shows that BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA ETF experienced heavy outflows during the week ending September 26, 2025. Ethereum net ETF inflows. Source: Coinglass The heaviest selling occurred on September 26, when the fund shed almost $200 million in a single day, the sharpest daily redemption of the period. Additional withdrawals on September 24 and September 22, worth $26.5 million and $15.1 million respectively, brought BlackRock‚Äôs total to $241.5 million in net sales for the week. Ethereum ETFs massive outflows Overall, the broader Ethereum ETF market also saw substantial withdrawals. Fidelity‚Äôs FETH product was hit especially hard, losing $158.1 million on September 25 and another $74.4 million the next day. Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE had a more mixed week, posting an inflow of $17.9 million on September 26 but facing steep losses earlier, including $30.3 million on September 25 and $17.1 million on September 23. Bitwise‚Äôs ETHW ETF added pressure with redemptions of $27.6 million on September 25 and $22.3 million on September 22, while VanEck, Franklin, 21Shares, and Invesco all posted smaller but steady outflows over the same stretch. Altogether, Ethereum ETFs shed more than $766 million in just five days, pointing to the fragile state of institutional sentiment toward the asset. ETH price analysis The timing of these withdrawals coincides with Ethereum‚Äôs struggle to hold key technical levels and the growing dominance of Bitcoin ETFs, which continue to attract the bulk of investor inflows. By press time, Ethereum was trading at $4,023, up about 0.2% in the last 24 hours but down over 10% on the weekly chart. Ethereum seven-day price chart.

Speaking on the Master Investor podcast , Wood said the platform could follow a trajectory similar to Solana‚Äôs rapid rise from newcomer to market leader. ARK Invest‚Äôs public funds remain centered on three key assets ‚Äî Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. According to Wood, the company also maintains exposure to Solana‚Äôs ecosystem through Breera Sports , a project tied to its treasury and backed by Middle Eastern investors. In addition, ARK is consulting with economist Art Laffer , who has been involved with the Hyperliquid project. Wood emphasized that ARK has not yet taken a position on Hyperliquid, but she believes the protocol itself merits attention as decentralized perpetual futures exchanges grow increasingly competitive. Aster Surpasses Hyperliquid Amid Rising Market Battles On September 24, 2025 , reports confirmed that the Aster platform had overtaken Hyperliquid as the sector‚Äôs leader. According to DeFiLlama , Aster‚Äôs daily trading volume of perpetual futures contracts reached $25.77 billion , signaling just how intense the race for dominance has become. Despite this shakeup, Wood stressed that the long-term structure of the crypto market will likely revolve around a few major networks. She described Bitcoin as the ‚Äúpure‚Äù cryptocurrency with a fixed supply and stable system, while Ethereum underpins much of decentralized finance. Together with Solana, these assets form the backbone of ARK‚Äôs strategy. The company also holds derivatives such as Uniswap tokens and Solana-based assets, but its focus remains squarely on the three largest cryptocurrencies. The Future Of DeFi Leadership As interest in emerging projects grows, ARK‚Äôs position reflects a belief that the crypto industry will consolidate around a limited set of dominant players. Still, initiatives like Hyperliquid and challenges from rivals like Aster ‚Äî continue to shape the evolving landscape of decentralized trading.

Solana continues to attract interest as a high-performance blockchain with a strong ecosystem of meme coins and DeFi. Mutuum Finance on the other hand is rapidly gaining traction as an innovative DeFi project with more than $16.5 million generated in presale and more than 16,620 holders welcomed on board. Its revolutionary peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract lending platform offers users genuine utility, staking rewards, and a secure, audited environment. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs ground-floor traction could deliver its holders returns that are nothing short of outstanding, and potentially have a far greater effect on small investments than traditional altcoins like SOL. Solana‚Äôs Institutional Demand Solana (SOL) is continuing to build its name as a leading blockchain in the crypto space, backed by a robust $4 billion treasury that reflects growing institutional confidence and long-term investability value. Its unmatched transaction speed and very low fees have made it a network of choice for USDC minting, which has significantly widened its presence in decentralized finance (DeFi) and cross-border payments. Moreover, Solana‚Äôs support for innovations such as the USDX stablecoin that is celebrated for transparency and stability further boost its adoption and utility within financial verticals. Nevertheless, with institutional capital flooding into tested projects such as Solana, Mutuum Finance is building up steam for its prospects of delivering exponential growth and transforming early investments into phenomenal opportunities. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance is offering early investors the exclusive opportunity to buy MUTM tokens at a much cheaper rate before the project‚Äôs official launch. As tokens are being offered at just $0.035 during Phase 6, demand has been exceptional, the presale has already raised over $16.5 million and attracted more than 16,620 token holders, reflecting growing confidence and trust in the project‚Äôs long-term vision. To further improve platform security and involve the community, Mutuum Finance has launched an official Bug Bounty Program on CertiK with payouts of up to $50,000 in USDT. It invites developers, white-hat hackers, and security researchers to audit the codebase for vulnerabilities. Payouts are made according to the severity of the issues discovered, so even minor bugs are encouraged to be fixed quickly to maintain the highest security standards. Mutuum Finance is a hybrid lending platform that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models to deliver unparalleled flexibility and efficiency. Better Accuracy with Oracle-Powered Infrastructure To enable precise and real-time pricing, Mutuum Finance integrates Chainlink oracles with price feeds for top-cap tokens such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform‚Äôs infrastructure also features fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references, the multi-layer approach designed to safeguard the protocol even in the event of volatile bear markets. The high accuracy of pricing is important when it comes to collateral management as well as liquidation processes and risk calculations. It strengthens the platform under any market condition. While Solana offers battle-tested utility and institutional backing, Mutuum Finance offers a more dynamic growth potential. Having collected over $16.5 million, with 16,620+ investors and tokens priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM combines real DeFi use case, staking rewards, and safe oracle-powered infrastructure. Its revolutionary hybrid lending model and early-stage momentum make it a prime choice for investors seeking high-return potential. Join the Mutuum Finance presale now to get in on the ground floor before the next growth stage.

With the market sentiment flipping and the BTC price stalling, several US investors cashed out on their positions in the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market cap. After posting strong performances over the past few weeks, the tides appear to be shifting for the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund market , with investor appetite in the United States seemingly waning. This latest round of withdrawals ended an inflow streak of four consecutive weeks for the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs Register $418 Million Net Inflows According to the latest market data, the US Bitcoin ETFs registered a daily total net inflow of $418.25 million on Friday, September 26. This performance continued the terrible run of form for the crypto-linked investment products, which recorded only a positive inflow day in the past week. Breaking things down, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (with the ticker FBTC) posted the most significant daily net outflows, losing more than $300 million on the day. BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust came in second, with a total daily withdrawal of $37.25 million to close the week. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) recorded a daily total net outflow of $23.79 million on Friday, while Ark & 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) lost $17.81 million in value on the day. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and Bitcoin Trust were the only other Bitcoin ETFs with double-digit outflows ($17.14 million and $12.57 million, respectively) on the day. VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL) was the only exchange-traded fund to record any activity on Friday, with a daily net outflow of $9.28 million. This negative $418.25 million performance amounted to a cumulative $902.5 million net outflow in the past week. This negative weekly performance marked the end of a streak of four consecutive weeks of positive inflows. In the previous two weeks, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs registered more than $3 billion in capital inflows, as the macroeconomic conditions shifted in favor of risk assets. Bitcoin Price Overview However, the crypto market seems to have cooled off, as seen with the price of Bitcoin over the past week. The premier cryptocurrency lost over 5% in its value, falling from around $116,000 to beneath the $110,000 level in the last seven days. With the Bitcoin price struggling at the moment, it is no shock that the Bitcoin ETFs have seen massive withdrawals in the past week. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $109,690, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.",ETF|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-28 16:00:26

However, while the Bitcoin price seems to have fallen into a consolidation phase in recent weeks, the general feeling in the market has always been that there remains an upside potential for the market leader. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has come forward to echo these sentiments while identifying the ‚Äúbiggest catalyst‚Äù to kickstart a potential rally. ‚ÄòExceptionally Dovish‚Äô Fed Chair Could Guide BTC To $200,000: Novogratz In a recent interview with Kyle Chasse on YouTube, Novogratz shared that the next major move for the Bitcoin price could hinge on the potential replacement of US Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell. According to the Galaxy Digital CEO, the BTC price could go on a significant rally if the next Fed chair is exceptionally dovish. Related Reading: The Mobility Advantage: Why Bitcoin‚Äôs Portability Makes It Superior To Traditional Gold Novogratz revealed that the appointment of a dovish Fed chair is the potential biggest bull catalyst for Bitcoin and the crypto market. The CEO affirmed that the conversation changes for the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency, which could reach as high as $200,000, if there is a leadership change. For context, a dove refers to a policymaker or advisor (typically in the Federal Reserve) who takes a looser monetary stance, including interest rate cuts, in a bid to grow the economy. The US Fed cutting interest rates is usually bullish for crypto and other risk assets, as it means that traditional investment instruments like bonds offer less lucrative returns. Hence, investors tend to flock to digital assets and the equities market. However, Novogratz noted the potential impact of aggressive rate cutting on the US dollar. While lower interest rates are usually positive for risk assets like Bitcoin, it has the opposite effect on the dollar market. The Federal Reserve announced a rate cut of 25 basis points (25bp) after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September. This decision‚Äîfirst of its kind this year‚Äîis expected to be the first of a couple more rate cuts to come before the end of 2025. Bitcoin Price At A Glance While the Bitcoin price responded positively to the Fed‚Äôs decision to cut rates in September, the premier cryptocurrency has struggled to build on the macro-driven momentum. As of this writing, BTC is valued at around $109,570, reflecting a mere 0.1% decline in the past day. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Is Over?

Still, seasoned traders and early investors are starting to consider Little Pepe (LILPEPE) the most suitable meme coin to purchase currently. Although established meme coins have already had meaningful valuations, LILPEPE manages to delight in both virtuous and delectable use of viral culture, and an opportunity to earn enormous returns with a very low probability of success is rare. Suggestions from industry analysts and community-savvy individuals include a 100x potential LILPEPE as a better acquisition option for those attracted by meme coin buying cats, akin to other massive, successful transformations in history. What Sets LILPEPE Apart In contrast to other meme coins built on hype alone, LILPEPE is developed according to a Layer 2-inspired ecosystem, which is designed to ensure scalability, low costs, and deter baiting by sniper bots. It is currently experiencing a very high market presence, as indicated by its high presale amount of over $ 26 million and the sale of over 16 billion tokens even prior to its exchange session. In addition to the hype, LILPEPE incorporates community gains, including its Mega Giveaway, where the reward is 15 ETH, and its near-current-time giveaway, which does the same at 777k, keeping the initiative going and motivating participants. The combination of utility, community support, and early presale access positions LILPEPE as a serious contender for long-term growth. LILPEPE is not just another meme coin; it‚Äôs an ecosystem designed to sustain demand. The tier-1 CEX listing, CertiK-audited smart contract, and high vesting schedule are among those that attract traders to keep their products out of sudden dumps. LILPEPE is in its active growth phase, compared to Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin, which have already utilized much of their initial momentum. This is why LILPEPE presents a good opportunity to invest and receive an impressive return in the near future. Presale Momentum and Market Position With Stage 13 of its presale live, LILPEPE is attracting serious investor attention. Early buyers at $0.0022 are set to benefit from an expected launch price of $0.003, providing instant upside before trading even begins. Analysts are confident that if LILPEPE captures just a fraction of Shiba Inu‚Äôs early adoption momentum, it could deliver massive returns to presale participants. Its Layer-2 infrastructure for memes sets it apart in the crowded meme coin market, offering a combination of speed, security, and community-driven growth that established coins cannot match. The market is reacting. People are very positive about the community, and social sentiment is very positive. Traders know that LILPEPE‚Äôs mix of meme culture and real-world usefulness could make it better than older meme coins, especially during a bull cycle when early adoption and viral traction lead to the most significant gains. The 100x Opportunity The biggest reason traders are backing LILPEPE over Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin is its untapped growth potential. SHIB and PEPE have already experienced massive growth in prices, whereas LILPEPE is a comparatively new company. It possesses a credible approach and offers expansion opportunities, which are supported by its successful presale, upcoming IPO on exchanges, and integration into the Layer-2 ecosystem. For investors who want to make the same huge profits as early meme coins, LILPEPE is a straightforward way to get 100x returns. It combines market demand, technology, and community incentives into one token. For those seeking the next big meme coin breakout, LILPEPE stands out as the best buy right now. Its innovative ecosystem, presale momentum, and robust community incentives make it not just another joke token, but a strategically positioned investment in the fast-growing world of meme coins. Conclusion If you‚Äôre searching for a meme coin with massive upside potential, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is capturing the attention of traders for a reason. With its Layer 2 infrastructure, sniper-bot-resistant smart contracts, and massive community giveaways, it has the tools to surpass both Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin in value and adoption. Investors who get in during the presale could be positioned for life-changing returns, as LILPEPE is uniquely poised for a 100x run in this meme coin cycle. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to be part of the next meme coin revolution‚Äîthe opportunity is here, and LILPEPE is leading the charge.

He highlighted that Ripple, the company behind XRP, has been involved in global payment discussions for over a decade. According to him, the Federal Reserve began exploring faster payment options in 2013, and by 2015, a federal payments task force was established that included Ripple. He emphasized that Ripple‚Äôs early recognition by institutions positioned it as a key player in payment modernization. In 2014, the World Bank and the Better Than Cash Alliance, a group including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, and governments of over 30 countries, released a report titled Opportunities of Digitizing Payments. The following year, Ripple became the only cryptocurrency-focused company featured on the Better Than Cash Alliance website. ITS CLEAR #RIPPLE HAVE A BIG PLAN FOR #XRP .

He pointed to the SDG logo appearing across initiatives, including the U.N.‚Äôs XChange platform for carbon credit solutions, which he said ‚Äúis officially utilizing XRP.‚Äù He presented this as evidence that XRP is already part of sustainability-focused efforts . He also highlighted Ripple‚Äôs role in advancing global standards for cross-border transactions. Lord XRP referred to ISO 20022, a messaging standard becoming mandatory for financial institutions by 2025 , stating that Ripple was the first member focused on distributed ledger technology. Ripple‚Äôs partnerships with over 300 financial institutions worldwide were central to his argument. He cited major banks such as Bank of America, American Express, Santander, PNC, HSBC, SBI, and Standard Chartered, as well as collaborations with central banks and financial authorities across Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Influence of Leadership and Industry Affiliations Lord XRP noted Ripple‚Äôs leadership team includes former officials from the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the SEC, PayPal, Uber, Amazon, and SWIFT.

Positioning XRP for the Future Lord XRP framed these developments as proof of Ripple‚Äôs relevance in digital payments. ‚ÄúNow, do Ripple and XRP sound like they‚Äôre going to disappear, or do they sound like they‚Äôre part of a much bigger plan?‚Äù he asked. Through his remarks, he portrayed XRP as more than a cryptocurrency, positioning it as an integral component of global payment networks and ongoing modernization initiatives.

France has previously denied similar accusations made by Durov, asserting that there was no request for censorship regarding Romanian conservative voices ahead of elections, but has yet to respond to his latest accusations Durov implicates French clandestine services According to Durov‚Äôs post , the request came via an intermediary and initially involved a list of flagged channels. As requested, Telegram looked into the channels flagged by the French (and Moldovan) authorities, identified a few that were in clear violation of its rules and promptly removed them. Durov said Telegram did it as part of its duty. However, he claimed that the intermediary then offered a quid pro quo: in exchange for even more cooperation, French intelligence would whisper good things about Durov to the French judge in charge of his August 2024 arrest related to Telegram‚Äôs moderation practices. This did not impress Durov, who described it as an improper attempt to influence the French judiciary or an exploitation of his legal vulnerability to sway Eastern European politics. He tagged it ‚Äúunacceptable on several levels‚Äù and highlighted that the same pattern has been observed in Romania. ‚ÄúShortly thereafter, the Telegram team received a second list of so-called ‚Äòproblematic‚Äô Moldovan channels,‚Äù Durov wrote on X. ‚ÄúUnlike the first, nearly all of these channels were legitimate and fully compliant with our rules. Their only commonality was that they voiced political positions disliked by the French and Moldovan governments.‚Äù Telegram refused to act on the request and will most likely not in the future, as the platform under Durov‚Äôs leadership has emphasized a commitment to freedom of speech and will not remove content for political reasons. Durov ended the write-up by vowing to keep exposing ‚Äúevery attempt to pressure Telegram into censoring our platform.‚Äù ‚ÄúStay tuned,‚Äù he wrote as if promising more bombshell revelations in the future. Durov has had regular correspondence with the French government At the time of this writing, French authorities have responded to Durov‚Äôs latest claims. The last time the founder made similar claims in May regarding how the head of France‚Äôs foreign intelligence agency demanded that he ban Romanian conservative voices ahead of the elections, France‚Äôs intelligence service, the DGSE, expressed denial. France‚Äôs foreign ministry also dismissed Durov‚Äôs claims, claiming they were ‚Äúunfounded allegations,‚Äù and labeling them ‚Äúmerely a diversionary maneuver from the real threats of interference targeting Romania.‚Äù Completely unfounded allegations are circulating on Telegram and Twitter regarding alleged French interference in the Romanian presidential election. France categorically rejects these allegations and calls on everyone to exercise responsibility and respect for Romanian‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/PxFO7KnzDm ‚Äî France Diplomacy üá´üá∑üá™üá∫ (@francediplo_EN) May 18, 2025 It reminded the masses of how Romanian authorities had annulled the first round of the Romanian presidential elections due to Russian interference that helped far-right candidate CƒÉtƒÉlin Georgescu win. He was ultimately banned from running again, and Romanian prosecutors later launched criminal proceedings accusing him of using social media manipulation and bots to spread misinformation during the pre-election campaign. At the same time, the DGSE did confirm that officials indeed had meetings with Durov ‚Äúon several occasions in recent years ‚Ä¶ to remind him firmly of his company‚Äôs responsibilities,‚Äù to prevent terrorist and child pornography threats. However, Durov has said that the secret service never brought up the child pornography issue and was more particular about ‚ÄúIPs of terror suspects in France‚Äù as their main focus was always geopolitics.

As many look at the Pepe coin price prediction for the coming months and digest the latest Dogecoin developments, there is a rising alternative in view. Remittix (RTX) updates toward the end of Q3 suggest this new project may offer a more grounded upside compared to PEPE or DOGE. Pepe Coin Price Prediction: Bubble or Bounce? PEPE currently trades at $0.00000931, down about 1.74% over 24 hours. According to some analysts, PEPE may drop around 25%, targeting about $0.0000057, citing a weak technical outlook and bearish sentiment. Longer-term forecasts vary widely. Some projections see average prices near $0.0000129 through later years. Other models show a 2025 range from $0.0000170 to $0.0000267 as a fair upper bound. Dogecoin: More Than Just a Meme Dogecoin is trading at about $0.23 as of late September 2025, with solid volume and persistent community buzz. Recent news points to DOGE facing resistance, but also eyes of optimism. Analysts note DOGE is nearly 70% below its all-time high of $0.73. Some forecasts suggest DOGE has the potential for a strong breakout, with one source even mentioning a possible 800% rally if the altcoin season resurfaces. Remittix Is Offering Grounded Growth Beyond Memes When placed side by side with meme names like PEPE and DOGE, Remittix projects a more sustainable growth path rather than riding speculative sentiment. The Remittix team is now verified by CertiK, and Remittix is ranked number one on CertiK for pre-launch tokens. Its beta wallet is already live, being tested by community users. The 15% USDT referral program enables instant 24 24-hour claimable rewards. As meme tokens depend heavily on hype cycles, Remittix anchors itself with working infrastructure and real use cases. A $250,000 giveaway is active to expand reach. It has surpassed $20 million and $22 million milestones to secure two CEX listings and is preparing a third. Remittix has sold over 672 million tokens, is priced at $0.113, and has raised over $26.7 million. Here are five core strengths that Remittix brings to the table: Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency Ranked number one among pre-launch tokens Ideal for freelancers, remitters and global earners Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd Remittix‚Äôs strong security, real product progress, and structural advantages make it far less exposed to meme volatility. For those weary of PEPE‚Äôs swings or DOGE‚Äôs narrative dependency, Remittix is a credible contender to watch heading into Q4. Remittix Tops Them All Pepe coin price prediction remains uncertain and often extreme, while Dogecoin‚Äôs latest news shows both challenges and points of renewed exposure. But the Remittix updates at the end of Q3 present a clear alternative: a crypto with utility, security, and momentum rather than a mere meme tag.

In its latest update, the team says it has identified and fixed the root cause and expects full functionality to resume within 24 hours. Hyperdrive promises compensation Hyperdrive‚Äôs latest communication asserts that the flaw has been fixed and that markets should resume within a day, if not sooner. The team says it has already identified the affected accounts and will implement a compensatory plan. However, details on compensation terms have not yet been disclosed. Users are cautioned against interacting with the protocol or sending funds until full functionality is confirmed. Hyperdrive reiterated the need to trust only its official channels and warned against scams, particularly unsolicited direct messages requesting keys. A transparent and timely post-mortem, full reimbursements, and clear communication could help undo reputational damage. But any failure to deliver promised repayments, or further security lapses, could erode user confidence irreversibly. If the compensation plan succeeds and markets resume, Hyperdrive may salvage much of its standing. But if not, the incident could mark a turning point for governance scrutiny in the Hyperliquid ecosystem, which just launched its own USDH stablecoin on September 24, as Cryptopolitan reported. Despite Hyperdrive‚Äôs reassurances, community sentiment around it and other Hyperliquid-based protocols is not at optimal levels right now. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMex, who has been bullish on Hyperliquid, recently dumped all his HYPE tokens. The Hyperdrive exploit adds to the ecosystem‚Äôs headache, as it came barely 48 hours after a separate project, HyperVault, saw a $3.6 million outflow in what is now suspected to be a rug pull. HyperVault‚Äôs X account has been deleted, and its website is reportedly inaccessible. Earlier this year, Hyperliquid was also hit by the JELLYJELLY manipulation in March, which led to the token‚Äôs delisting. Services to resume after brief pause post-exploit On September 27, Hyperdrive posted on X that it had become aware of issues impacting its protocol, specifically in the Primary USDT0 Market and Treasury USDT Market. To contain potential damage, the protocol halted all interest mechanisms, paused markets, and suspended withdrawals. In a follow-up post released hours later, Hyperdrive declared that the root cause had been identified and rectified, and that a compensation plan for affected accounts would be deployed soon. The team said markets should return to normal operations within 24 hours. According to third-party reporting, the exploit affected two user accounts in the Treasury market and is estimated to have drained around US$773,000. Blockchain analytics indicate that the stolen funds were divided and bridged to BNB and Ethereum via the debridge protocol, with 288.37 BNB and 123.6 ETH going to the respective chains. Exploit took advantage of technical fault The vulnerability that was reportedly exploited in this incident appears to come from a flaw in its router contract. This allowed the attacker to invoke arbitrary calls on contracts in the whitelist and bypass the platform‚Äôs security to move user funds from the thBILL Treasury Market. Analysts claim the attack looks like the work of a professional; however, the narrow scope, limited to two markets, allowed Hyperdrive to contain damage before it became a protocol-wide compromise. For the Hyperliquid ecosystem, this isn‚Äôt good news, as it is coming amid increasing concern about the network‚Äôs security posture. Analysts say the cluster of incidents is testing users‚Äô confidence in the Hyperliquid stack.

With market conditions showing volatility, these tokens present different opportunities. Solana, with institutional backing, Litecoin which is supported by ETF filings and Remittax (RTX), which is a PayFi altcoin with potential to explode. The investors who have committed their funds early on may enjoy significant returns provided the trend is maintained, and this is a time to consider the portfolio. Solana Shows Strength Amid Bullish Reversal Solana price is currently $203. After a strong rebound, SOL has become the top gainer among large-cap cryptocurrencies. Data from CoinGlass shows over $15 million wiped out in its derivatives market due to a liquidation imbalance. Short traders bore heavier losses, while long positions faced minor impacts, signaling growing bullish control. Analysts are confident that a potential Solana ETF could further fuel upside, pushing the price toward new records. The combination of technical strength and institutional interest makes SOL a compelling pick for early adopters seeking significant returns. Litecoin Surges With Institutional Support Litecoin price is currently around $104. LTC recently rallied after Grayscale‚Äôs ETF filing, sparking strong technical interest and whale accumulation. Santiment says that 1,000 to 1 million LTC wallets increased 181,000 coins in 24 hours, which indicates calculated buying pressure. LTC has support over $100, and short-term resistance is 115-120. Analysts indicate LTC may hit $147 with the possibility of hitting $200 in the near future should the momentum carry on. Litecoin has institutional interest, technical backing, and historical bull trends in its favor as a long-term altcoin competitor.

Ethereum is still dragging its feet on full account abstraction, and Tron keeps adding patches that don‚Äôt really change the user experience. Both call themselves top crypto assets, but where‚Äôs the breakthrough that actually makes Web3 easier? BlockDAG answers that directly. The Awakening has gone live with EIP-4337 account abstraction already active, rolling out gas sponsorships, batching, and social recovery as real tools for everyday users. The Ethereum (ETH) price update shows innovation is slow, while BlockDAG moves ahead with upgrades you can already use. The Tron (TRX) price forecast points to growth in transactions, but it doesn‚Äôt solve usability issues. That‚Äôs why BlockDAG looks like the smarter pick. For anyone following leading crypto assets, this is the project delivering what others only talk about. BlockDAG Awakening Unlocks Smart Accounts The Awakening has gone live with EIP-4337 account abstraction already active, and that instantly sets BlockDAG apart from the rest. Instead of waiting for years of incremental updates like Ethereum, BlockDAG users already get features that make Web3 less intimidating. Gas sponsorships allow transactions without needing upfront fees, batching makes complex actions simple and cheap, and social recovery ensures lost keys don‚Äôt mean lost funds. These upgrades flip the experience from developer-heavy to user-friendly, giving BlockDAG the credibility of being the first mover in an area where other top crypto assets are still catching up. While Ethereum continues to roll out account abstraction step by step, BlockDAG has delivered it in one bold move. That matters because making crypto easier to use is just as important as performance gains or scaling. For developers, the Awakening also includes a new IDE and runtime upgradability, but it‚Äôs the live utility of smart accounts that shows BlockDAG is already ahead. The comparison is clear: Ethereum is gradual, BlockDAG is live. Backing this tech progress is a presale that has turned into one of the biggest of 2025. With over $410 million raised, more than 26.4 billion coins sold, and a community of 312,000 holders, the numbers show strong demand. Around 3 million people mine daily on the X1 app, and 20,000 physical miners have already shipped. At a limited-time price of $0.0013 per coin, the presale still positions buyers for huge upside, with ROI projections as high as 3,025% when it lists at $0.05. Compared with other leading crypto assets, BlockDAG offers both innovation and moneymaking potential. ETH Liquidations Add Sell Pressure The latest Ethereum (ETH) price update shows the token slipping under $4,000, with recent trading data putting it around $3,880‚Äì$3,970. Analysts point to heavy derivatives liquidations, over $1.7 billion across crypto, with ETH taking a big share, along with pressure from a looming $22 billion options expiry. Macro headwinds like a stronger dollar and the threat of a U.S. government shutdown have also weighed on sentiment. On the charts, ETH is struggling to hold $3,800‚Äì$4,000 as support, while resistance near $4,200‚Äì$4,500 remains unbroken. The current Ethereum (ETH) price updates suggest further downside is possible if these supports don‚Äôt hold. On the protocol side, Ethereum is still preparing its Pectra upgrade, with key proposals such as EIP-7251 and EIP-7702 expected in mid-2025. But account abstraction remains gradual compared with networks already running it live. That slower rollout hasn‚Äôt stopped ETH from being one of the top crypto assets, though competition is growing. Among other leading crypto assets, Ethereum remains a mainstay, but the focus on gradual improvements rather than immediate usability could shift attention toward faster-moving projects. TRX Gains Utility Across DeFi The latest Tron (TRX) price forecast highlights steady growth supported by rising on-chain activity. TRON recently overtook Ethereum in daily USDT transfers, moving huge volumes with lower fees. Proposal 789, which cut smart contract energy costs by 60%, has already made dApp and DeFi usage cheaper across the network. This comes on top of TRON‚Äôs scale: more than 332 million user accounts, over 11 billion transactions processed, and a total value locked of around $28 billion. Analysts see TRX trending toward $0.36‚Äì$0.37 in the short term, suggesting moderate upside in the months ahead. Beyond the numbers, TRON is building momentum with rebranding, treasury expansions, and academic research pointing to its dominance in stablecoin transfers. The Tron (TRX) price forecasts factor in these fundamentals, showing why TRX continues to hold its ground among top crypto assets. While some investors compare it with other leading digital coins, TRON‚Äôs edge comes from scale, low-cost transfers, and a strong DeFi ecosystem. With these advantages, TRX remains a network that combines high usage with solid market positioning. Looking Ahead The most recent Ethereum (ETH) price update shows the token under $4,000, with traders watching if support around $3,800 holds. The gradual rollout of upgrades like Pectra keeps Ethereum relevant, but users still face limits compared to newer projects. On the other side, the Tron (TRX) price forecast reflects steady growth as lower fees and USDT transfers fuel activity, with analysts pointing toward short-term targets near $0.36. Both remain strong top crypto assets, but their progress highlights how different paths can look when it comes to usability. That‚Äôs where BlockDAG stands apart. The Awakening has gone live with EIP-4337 account abstraction already running, making gas sponsorships, batching, and social recovery available now rather than years later. With over $410 million raised in its presale, millions mining daily, and ROI projections above 3,700%, BlockDAG is delivering the kind of features that other leading crypto assets are still working toward.

This autumn, experts are pointing to a new AI project, Ruvi AI (RUVI), as the answer. With powerful institutional backing and a credible 100x forecast, they argue that Ruvi AI offers latecomers a chance to secure even bigger gains than what is currently possible with established giants like Solana. This bullish outlook is fueled by a presale that is attracting massive attention. Ruvi AI has officially blown past the $4 million fundraising milestone, with an incredible 285 million tokens sold to a fast-growing global community of over 3,900 holders . This record-breaking demand is a clear signal that the market sees Ruvi AI as this season‚Äôs top pick for exponential returns. Why Latecomers Are Choosing RUVI Over SOL While Solana remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, its massive market cap means the days of 100x returns are long gone. For new capital, the growth potential is limited. Smart investors understand that life-changing wealth comes from identifying projects at the ground floor, before they achieve mainstream recognition. Ruvi AI presents this exact opportunity. Unlike speculative meme coins, Ruvi AI‚Äôs 100x forecast is built on a solid foundation of utility. The project is focused on revolutionizing the massive $104 billion creator economy , giving it a clear, real-world application that attracts institutional capital. This fundamental strength is reinforced by key credibility markers, including a successful smart contract audit by CyberScope and a high-profile listing on CoinMarketCap , which has established it as a premier AI project. This combination of institutional trust and explosive growth potential is why it‚Äôs being hailed as the top pick for autumn. The Super App Fueling the 100x Forecast The engine driving Ruvi AI‚Äôs explosive potential is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is engineered to become an indispensable tool for content creators, which will create sustainable, long-term demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining content production. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. Last Call: A Guaranteed 40% Price Jump Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . However, this entry point is disappearing at an astonishing rate. In a powerful demonstration of market demand, 20% of the Phase 3 allocation was sold in just a few days . According to the project‚Äôs official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. The project‚Äôs VIP program is structured to maximize returns for early investors: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway further rewards top supporters. The Verdict For investors who feel they missed out on Solana‚Äôs initial run, the market is offering a second chance. With a presale demonstrating overwhelming demand, strong institutional backing, and a clear path to a 100x valuation, Ruvi AI has emerged as this autumn‚Äôs top pick. The opportunity to secure life-changing gains is here, but the window is closing fast.

52393669,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=822167,1759078849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52393669.jpeg,Meta and Tesla are competing to lead the humanoid robot market using AI-powered devices,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/zuck-meta-elon-tesla-humanoid-robot-race/,"Mark Zuckerberg stepped on stage with AI glasses, but what looked like a gadget reveal is now tied to a much bigger story. This is about Meta and Tesla heading into a direct fight over humanoid robots, according to the Wall Street Journal. For years, Zuck and Elon Musk circled each other with social media barbs, competing platforms, and even a teased cage fight that never happened. This time the clash could move from the internet to the world of machines built to act like people. Up until now, the rivalry was more about pride and money. When Meta launched Threads in 2023 to compete with Elon‚Äôs X, that seemed like the loudest move. But humanoid robots are different. They promise a new market, powered by artificial intelligence, where companies compete not just for users but for control of the future of work and life. Meta uses AI glasses to build a robot future The newest Meta glasses went on sale Tuesday. They come with cameras inside the lenses and a screen that shows video right in front of the eyes. The glasses can capture exactly what the user sees, and Meta has said that some of this audio and video could be used to improve its products. That means video data that can train machines. On September 17, Meta tried showing off these glasses by having a chef cook for a party with help from the AI in the device. The demo crashed, but the message was clear. This technology was designed to watch people, learn tasks, and later hand those lessons over to robots. Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, told investors last week that Meta could have 20 million glasses in use within two years. That would be almost double the number of Tesla cars expected on the road by then. He wrote, ‚ÄúEvery Meta glasses user may be training a humanoid avatar iterated in simulation across billions of scenarios in a digital omniverse.‚Äù That means even the most boring home videos, like making dinner, could become training clips for robots learning how to function in daily life. Meta has also built Project Aria, another wearable designed to collect AI and robotics data. Andrew Bosworth, the company‚Äôs chief technology officer, said in June: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre thinking about having an AI that is always on, using cameras and microphones‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs actually pretty similar to a robot who‚Äôs got the same kind of packages in terms of how it should understand the world.‚Äù Tesla pushes Optimus to learn like humans Tesla is leaning on its fleet of self-driving cars to create a bridge to humanoid robots. With more than eight million cars on the road, the company has already built up one of the largest pools of video data in the world. That footage trains Tesla‚Äôs computer vision system, and Elon has said the natural next step is robots. The company‚Äôs robot, called Optimus, is being trained in new ways. In May, Milan Kovac, who was then a Tesla vice president, posted that ‚ÄúOne of our goals is to have Optimus learn straight from internet videos of humans doing tasks‚Ä¶ We recently had a significant breakthrough‚Ä¶ and can now transfer a big chunk of the learning directly from human videos to the bots.‚Äù For Tesla, that means taking third-person video footage and teaching a machine how to copy it. By contrast, Meta‚Äôs first-person glasses can record what people actually see as they move. That difference could give Meta an edge. But Elon has set his own scale. He predicted that by 2040, there would be 10 billion humanoid robots in the world. Meta recruits experts as Elon sets bold numbers Meta‚Äôs push into robots is still early, but it is moving. Earlier this year, Zuck hired Marc Whitten, former CEO of General Motors‚Äô self-driving unit Cruise, to lead a new robotics group. He also brought in Sangbae Kim, an MIT robotics professor known for building a four-legged ‚Äúcheetah‚Äù robot that could run at speed. At the same time, Meta has been recruiting big AI talent, offering packages worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Zuckerberg calls this race for advanced AI ‚Äúsuperintelligence,‚Äù and he says it will be the foundation of everything from wearables to robots. On the ‚ÄúACCESS‚Äù podcast earlier this month, Zuckerberg admitted the costs are huge but said speed matters more than money. ‚ÄúIf we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that is going to be very unfortunate obviously,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut‚Ä¶ if you build too slowly‚Ä¶ then you‚Äôre just out of position on what I think is going to be the most important technology that enables the most new products and innovation and value creation in history.‚Äù KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|Meta|Tesla,EN,0,0,MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-28 17:00:49

The chart highlights a technical signal that historically preceded a significant downward price movement. The marked crossover on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator coincides with a dark red zone on the chart, a pattern that resembles a prior bearish period in early 2025. That earlier period saw XRP decline by 47% before rebounding sharply. The recent bearish cross now raises questions among traders about whether a similar drop could occur. Steph Is Crypto‚Äôs warning places attention on the possibility of near-term downside pressure, suggesting that the technical trend may not favor immediate gains for the token. WARNING: #XRP BEARISH WEEKLY MACD CROSS CONFIRMED! pic.twitter.com/iNhOrJoJRT ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 28, 2025 Is XRP‚Äôs Price About to Drop Again? XRP has struggled over the past few months, with the most notable decline coming in early September when the asset fell to $2.71. The digital asset began regaining ground around September 7, but Steph‚Äôs chart suggests that another notable downturn is coming. While this news is bearish, a closer look at the chart reveals something intriguing. XRP experienced the bearish MACD cross earlier in the year and lost the $3 support, trading below it for months. However, this breakdown gave way to a sharp rise in July, when the asset rose to its all-time high of $3.65 . This context tempers some of the pessimism as it suggests that a pullback has not always marked the end of bullish momentum for XRP. The focus now shifts to whether the latest technical pattern will again act as a precursor to an extended advance after any short-term weakness. While the signal remains negative in the short term, history shows that the digital asset‚Äôs price action has often been cyclical, responding to shifts in market conditions and investor sentiment. Attention Turns to October Developments Beyond chart indicators, traders are paying close attention to fundamental factors that could influence XRP in the coming months. A key upcoming milestone is the anticipated decisions on spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) scheduled for October. Analysts see these decisions as potentially pivotal for market sentiment, since approval could provide new avenues for institutional participation and greater liquidity in the asset. The expectation of ETF approval has already injected some optimism into the community.

While ADA fights to hold ground, one PayFi project is stealing headlines: Remittix , which has raised over $26.7 million from 672 million tokens sold at $0.1130 each. With Cardano forecasts split between $0.50 and $1, and viral presales trending, traders are asking which project offers the bigger upside. Cardano Price Forecast: Support And Resistance Levels Source: Trading View The latest Cardano Price prediction shows ADA hovering near $0.78 after a 90% rally earlier in 2025. Analysts warn that failure to hold above $0.75 could drag ADA to $0.55, while a strong October close over $0.92 may fuel a breakout toward $1.32. Longer-term targets remain bullish, with some forecasts pointing to $2.05 by year-end if ETF approvals and institutional inflows materialize. Still, bearish scenarios linger, with support zones at $0.65. This makes the near-term Cardano Price outlook uncertain but highly watched. Remittix: Viral PayFi Presale Dominates Charts While Cardano Price action keeps traders cautious, Remittix has emerged as one of the most talked-about tokens of 2025. The PayFi leader blends real-world adoption with DeFi features, offering instant crypto-to-bank payments with transparent FX conversion. Ranked #1 on CertiK‚Äôspre-launch leaderboard, Remittix is already topping trending charts. Unlike speculative plays, it has proven adoption plans, which is why whales and retail investors alike are piling in. Here‚Äôs why Remittix continues to lead the narrative: ‚óè Over $250,000 community giveaway campaign energizing global participation‚óè CEX listings confirmed with BitMart and LBank, improving liquidity access‚óè Wallet beta launched, enabling fast, low gas fee crypto payments‚óè CertiK team verification builds strong trust for long-term growth‚óè Business-focused API designed to power real-world merchant adoption ADA Or Remittix: Which Has The Edge? Both projects have strong communities, but the outlook differs. Cardano Price predictions hinge on technical levels and ETF speculation, while Remittix is surging ahead with adoption-focused tools and viral growth. For traders seeking the next big altcoin under $1, Remittix may offer a clearer path to expansion. If ADA delivers on its roadmap, it could reclaim $1, but the PayFi momentum behind Remittixpositions it as one of the best crypto projects 2025 with potential for breakout growth.

Shiba Inu: The Veteran Meme Coin Still Igniting FOMO Shiba Inu (SHIB) has long been a poster child for speculative crypto bets. What keeps SHIB alive is its strong community and its ongoing efforts to expand utility beyond memes. Lately, SHIB is flashing signs of life again. Some analysts now project SHIB could test resistance levels near $0.000017 or even $0.00003 if momentum holds. Others warn volatility is low, and any failed breakout could send it slipping back toward support zones. Dogecoin: Meme OG Making a Mainstream Push Dogecoin (DOGE) is no longer just a joke coin; it‚Äôs trying to solidify a place in the mainstream. With its new ETF listing, DOGE is now accessible via traditional brokerage flows, and that may unlock capital from institutional desks that previously avoided memes. From a technical angle, DOGE has broken above key resistance levels and reclaimed its 200-day EMA. Analysts suggest a path toward $0.40‚Äì$0.60 if broader crypto markets cooperate. Some call it ‚Äúthe OG memecoin with real leverage now that institutional doors are open.‚Äù But make no mistake: DOGE is still volatile. Profit-taking could hit hard if Bitcoin tumbles. Still, many early buyers are already up 200‚Äì300%, and momentum traders are piling in‚Äîhoping they don‚Äôt regret it. Remittix: The Under-the-Radar DeFi Project Ready to Burst Remittix (RTX) is positioning itself not as a meme, but as a cross-chain, payment-first DeFi project aimed at bridging crypto and fiat via real bank rails. It‚Äôs emerging as a favorite among those chasing early stage crypto investment opportunities. In short: Remittix wants to let users send crypto and convert it to fiat in real time, with minimal gas fees, across chains. Its beta wallet is currently in final testing ahead of a Q3 launch. What many don‚Äôt yet grasp is how deep this gets: it supports over 30 fiat currencies, plans listings on centralized exchanges (such as BitMart and LBank), and is fully CertiK-verified. Compared to SHIB or DOGE, Remittix is leaning less on hype and more on utility, architecture, and roadmap. Its community growth has been rapid. Whales are already accumulating. Analysts are beginning to call it ‚ÄúXRP 2.0‚Äù or ‚Äúthe next best crypto to buy now.‚Äù Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction ‚óè Global Reach: crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries‚óè Real-world Utility: built to move value, not just meme chatter‚óè Low Gas Fee Crypto: minimal friction for remittances‚óè Over $26.7 Million Raised: massive capital flow into its presale‚óè Centralized Exchanges Confirmed: BitMart & LBank listing coming up This is not just another token, it‚Äôs a top crypto under $1 with real infrastructure ambitions. The presale has crossed $26.7 million, 672 million RTX tokens are sold, and more than 25,000 holders are already on board. $250,000 Giveaway + Referral Push: Don‚Äôt Be the One Who Missed It With so much momentum building, Remittix is now turbocharging user acquisition. The team just launched a $250,000 giveaway to reward early adopters. On top of that, they unlocked a referral program: every time someone you refer buys RTX, you instantly get 15% back in USDT, claimable every 24 hours from your dashboard. No waiting weeks or months. No locked bonuses. Paid in USDT. You share your referral link, new buyers bring in liquidity, and you get rewarded directly. Some early testers report earning hundreds or even thousands of dollars weekly just by sharing. The network effect is real. If you sit on the sidelines now, you risk regretting tomorrow‚Äôs breakout. Latecomers will wish they had held a piece of Remittix before the wallet went live and the listings launched.

This XRP price prediction is based on recent upgrades, the expansion of payment systems, and discussions about ETF approval. XRP Price Prediction: Is $10 Possible In 2027? Ripple (XRP) is one of the top crypto gainers of 2025, and it has managed to bounce off yearly trend lines, trading between $2 and $ 3. It is currently ranked number 3 among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Analysts believe that this momentum is sponsored by the regulatory clarity seen in the United States. The GENIUS ACT was signed a few months ago, and Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, XRP, is expected to enter the market soon. Market watchers believe all this bullish news supports the XRP prediction of $10 by 2027. Additionally, rumors about the approval of an XRP ETF had continued to circulate in the market. Analysts believe that the approval will happen in the coming months. ETH approval will increase institutional adoption, thereby supporting the XRP price prediction of $10. Currently, XRP‚Äôs price is trading at $2.78, having dropped from $3.20 due to the recent market pullback. Seasoned crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, believes XRP must hold $2.70 support to keep the chance of a rebound to $3.20 alive. Source: Ali_chart via X . While the XRP price prediction of $10 is feasible, remember that it represents only a 3x increase from current levels, which may not be enough to impress investors. They are instead investing in a PayFi solution, Remittix (RTX), which promises a 1000x gain by 2027. What do you need to know about Remittix? Remittix (RTX): The ‚ÄòXRP 2.0‚Äô Set To Eclipse Ripple Some have dubbed Remittix (RTX) the ‚ÄúNext XRP‚Äù as it carved out a unique niche for itself in the payments space. Remittix is building a real-world utility that facilitates direct transfers of cryptocurrency to fiat across 30+ countries, supporting over 40 cryptocurrencies. While XRP is only adopted by business owners who accept cryptocurrency, Remittix allows business owners to accept cryptocurrency, which is then converted into fiat currency and deposited into their accounts. Remittix Highlights: A full CertiK audit has been completed; liquidity and team tokens have been locked for a period of three years. RTX is built for real-world utility and adoption.

While pack leader BTC is, its volatility and reactions to macroeconomic news prompt other investors to look elsewhere. Mutuum Finance is at just $0.035 stage 6 of its presale. Mutuum Finance has also raised more than $16.5 million and onboarded more than 16,620 holders, displaying a positive sign on market sentiment. With its security audits, decentralized lending and borrowing, and staking rewards, Mutuum Finance has real utility and growth potential, and therefore it is among the leading candidates to be a big gainer in 2025. Bitcoin In Strain Before Upcoming Inflation Data Bitcoin (BTC) is in short-term bearish tension, with experts predicting further price falls in the next few days. The leading cryptocurrency traded at $111,336, falling by 1.8% in the last 24 hours and 5.4% in the last seven days as investors expect announcement of PCE inflation data, a key macroeconomic indicator that will determine trend direction. Prediction markets are showing that 61% of the respondents who were polled think the price of BTC will fall to $105,000 before any meaningful recovery would be realized, and extreme selling pressure would be expected within ranges of $115,000 and $119,000. Analysts also regard $110,051 and $109,500 as short-term bear targets. Additionally, with Fed rate cut odds at 83.4% next month, a better inflation surprise can result in even more forceful policy action that, in turn, can prolong the squeeze even more on Bitcoin and risk assets. In this case, investors further flock to alternative opportunity Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Numbers Show Strong Support Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has set a new presale record milestone at Stage 6 today. The tokens are valued at $0.035 today, which is 16.17% up from the previous round. The investor demand continues to be robust, with over 16,620 investors placing over $16.5 million thus far. In keeping with its people-first philosophy, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway as a token of gratitude to early supporters. 10 people will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens, and this is proof of the project‚Äôs intent to build long-term value and base its network. Stronger Security and Efficient Risk Management Security is most critical to Mutuum Finance. The company introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program to incentivize developers and security researchers for bug identification and reporting. Discoveries are evaluated on four levels of severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, to provide end-to-end safeguarding against threats and platform security strategy. In essence, Mutuum Finance is an LTV system that‚Äôs risk-adjusted. Every asset has a collateral limit calibrated precisely against the risk of the asset to create a more stable and balanced lending environment. Additional protection for users during times of volatile market conditions, the protocol also features a buffer reserve mechanism where assets that are higher-risk are proportionally allocated larger reserve values as additional collateral. Dynamic LTV rates and liquidation rates are tuned relative to current market conditions such that the protocol is extremely responsive and volatility-sensitive. A reserve multiplier range of as low as 10% on riskier classes to 35% on more conservative classes is yet another layer of systemic hedges. Efficiency is the second pillar of Mutuum Finance‚Äôs framework. Assets are kept to a minimum as collateral in an effort to be able to utilize maximum levels of capital, and correlated assets of a similar nature are optimized for final lending and borrowing efficiency. Collectively, these transactions reduce the risk of insolvency, increase user confidence, and create a more stable and sustainable lending market. The Stronger Pick While remaining the gold standard of inflation uncertainty era, volatility in Bitcoin is forcing investors into diversified options. Mutuum Finance takes the lead with over $16.5 million raised, over 16,620 investors, and tokens priced at $0.035 in its ongoing presale. Backed by robust security, risk management revolution, and utility in real life, MUTM is a wonderful hedge against macroeconomic volatility. Ride Mutuum Finance‚Äôs current presale and experience an upright stance before the next market shift.

The digital currency world is buzzing with opportunities, and while meme coins like Pepe and Brett are grabbing attention with their latest price surges and community updates, the real spectacle is happening elsewhere. The MoonBull presale is officially live, offering early access to crypto gems, a nearly unbeatable entry price, and exclusive whitelist rewards designed for ambitious investors seeking the next big opportunity. Each stage of this presale adds more thrill, with limited allocations and automatic referral bonuses creating a frenzy that spreads across social channels like wildfire. Missing this moment could mean losing out on staggering token rewards and life-changing ROI. Stay ahead of the curve and discover why MoonBull presale is the talk of the town. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: MoonBull, Pepe, and Brett. MoonBull‚Äôs Bull Engine: Liquidity, Rewards, and Scarcity MoonBull shines as the new meme coin with a system designed to reward every holder and stabilize the market simultaneously. Each $MOBU token sale triggers a smart contract that redistributes value across the ecosystem. Two percent of each transaction boosts liquidity, deepens the trading pair, reduces slippage, and makes trading smoother for everyone. Another 2% is automatically shared with holders, creating a compounding effect that grows their balance just by holding. Meanwhile, 1% of tokens are permanently burned, steadily reducing the total supply and increasing rarity as demand surges. The result is a self-reinforcing cycle that balances rewards, scarcity, and market health. Additionally, MoonBull‚Äôs referral system is designed for true community builders. Share your unique code and your invitee receives 15% extra $MOBU, while you instantly earn 15% of their purchase. Monthly leaderboards reward the top three referrers with a 10% USDC bonus and 4th and 5th place with 5% each. All rewards are automatic and backed by an 11% allocation of 8.05 billion $MOBU tokens. Smart referrals, combined with liquidity, rewards, and scarcity, create a frenzy that connects personal growth with the coin‚Äôs viral momentum. MoonBull Presale Explosion: Early Access Crypto Gem MoonBull presale is now live and stealing the spotlight among meme coin presales. With 23 electrifying stages, the early access entry price starts at just $0.000025, increasing by 27.40% at each subsequent stage until reaching the listing price of $0.00616. Early investors stand to see a staggering 24,540% ROI potential. Imagine investing $200 in Stage 1, you would receive 8,000,000,000 tokens, which could be worth $49,280 at listing. The rush is real as every moment counts. This presale is the kind that ignites digital wallets and spreads across social channels like wildfire. The limited allocation at each stage, combined with automatic referral bonuses and compounded rewards, makes this opportunity feel like diamond hands paying off overnight. Don‚Äôt fade this pump, MoonBull presale momentum is unstoppable, and missing even one stage could mean missing a massive crypto windfall. Every stage completed adds pressure and excitement, ma king it one of the most viral meme cryptos to join right now. Pepe: Meme Coin Momentum Pepe continues to dominate social media chatter, capturing attention with its community-driven memes and rapid token adoption. With recent improvements in its staking rewards and tokenomics, Pepe is maintaining strong trading volumes while creating a loyal holder base. The token‚Äôs ecosystem rewards participants for long-term holding, making it an appealing option for those seeking stability in the meme coin frenzy. Social media virality is increasing its visibility, but unlike the MoonBull presale, Pepe‚Äôs early entry rewards have already been settled, meaning the opportunity for a massive ROI is less pronounced for newcomers. The latest updates keep it trending, proving it remains a strong competitor in the meme coin market. Brett‚Äôs Strong Performance and Growing Buzz Brett has emerged as a meme token with steady growth and expanding utility. Recent network updates and liquidity enhancements have made trading smoother and more attractive for newcomers. The token rewards active community participation, increasing engagement while stabilizing price movements. Brett‚Äôs marketing campaigns and partnerships are creating consistent buzz across crypto platforms, positioning it as a meme coin with lasting appeal. While it shows impressive traction, the explosive early-stage potential, like that seen in MoonBull‚Äôs presale, is not available for latecomers, emphasizing the advantage of getting in early on MoonBull‚Äôs exclusive presale. Conclusion: MoonBull, Pepe, and Brett Presale and Updates As the crypto world expands, MoonBull‚Äôs presale shines as a new meme coin offering unmatched early access to crypto gems, meme token ROI potential, and whitelist rewards. Pepe and Brett provide valuable community-driven updates and growing ecosystems, but the real momentum and potential for exponential gains are in MoonBull‚Äôs presale stages. From liquidity injections and compounded reflections to a referral system that actually pays, every aspect of MoonBull is designed for maximum excitement and engagement. Don‚Äôt wait on the sidelines while the presale accelerates. Secure your stage allocation now and join one of the most anticipated meme coin presales of 2025.

The deal marked the first merger of two publicly traded bitcoin treasuries, and according to a Wall Street banker familiar with the situation, this is just the start of a massive consolidation wave among the DATs. The banker, who opted to remain anonymous, outlined three scenarios for how DATS may evolve. Mergers to add more BTC The first of the three paths is the DAT-to-DAT mergers. Strive‚Äôs acquisition of Semler is the first clear example of unifying BTC holdings, boosting bitcoin per share, and establishing governance under one roof, the banker said. When it closes, the deal will create a new company that will hold nearly 11,000 BTC after Strive‚Äôs simultaneous $675 million purchase of 5,885 coins . It's worth noting that Semler‚Äôs shares had been trading below the value of its bitcoin, effectively assigning negative value to its medical device business. For Strive, the acquisition consolidates balance sheets, adds BTC scale, and pushes forward a key company metric: Bitcoin per share . ‚ÄúStrive‚Äôs merger announcement is accretive in bitcoin per share, meeting our short-term goal,‚Äù CEO Matt Cole wrote on X . ‚ÄúWe believe the combined power of the entities will give the combined company more ability to access the capital markets in a way that will drive increased bitcoin per share and accretion in a way neither could do on their own.‚Äù With the bitcoin treasury market being saturated with many publicly traded companies, this strategy is likely to be one of the most efficient ways to grow for the DATs. The cash-flow angle The banker said the second path of evolution is acquiring cash-flowing businesses to offset dilution and fund ongoing BTC purchases. Metaplanet , Japan‚Äôs largest bitcoin holder, has already said it will use its treasury to buy cash-generating businesses as part of its ‚Äúphase two‚Äù strategy. Metaplanet is also exploring the use of perpetual preferred stock, a financing strategy that Strategy (MSTR) has already employed, allowing it to buy bitcoin without diluting shareholders through at-the-market (ATM) common stock offerings. No more SPACs Third, is merging with legitimate businesses instead of using special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), according to the banker. SPACs are shell firms designed to take companies public quickly, but the ‚Äúde-SPAC‚Äù process can be messy, requiring shareholder votes, regulatory filings, and often suffering from investor redemptions. Making things more complex, to bridge funding gaps, many SPACs rely on PIPEs (private investments in public equity), which bring dilution, discounts and uncertainty. For DATs, merging directly with a company that already has operations and governance avoids these pitfalls. The evolution of DATs The bottom line is that DATs are at a point where they need to evolve and get creative with their growth strategies. In fact, other companies are already catching on to this trend. Recently, FRNT Financial (TSXV: FRNT ), a digital asset investment bank, said it has entered into a consulting agreement with an undisclosed DAT with $100 million worth of digital assets in its balance sheet.

Bitcoin broke below $110,000, while Ethereum also slipped under $4,000. This downturn triggered billions in liquidations and pushed the Fear and Greed Index into fear territory. However, data from on-chain analytics platform Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) reveals that accumulation is quietly underway. Despite the price declines, exchange outflows for both assets have remained strongly negative. Related Reading: XRP Eyeing Explosive Move In Next Few Months, Research Shows Key Weekly Metrics An extended decline carried over from the previous week saw the Bitcoin price falling below $110,000 with increasing selling pressure and liquidations of leveraged positions. However, despite this sharp move to the downside, on-chain data illustrates an interesting different trend occurring beneath the surface of the volatility. According to figures provided by the on-chain analytics platform Sentora, more than $5.75 billion worth of BTC flowed out of centralized exchanges over the course of the week. This outflow, although small compared to periods of strong bullish action, shows a lingering investor conviction, especially among some investors that might be taking advantage and buying the dip. Ethereum‚Äôs price movement over the same period was even more pronounced than that of Bitcoin. The price crash saw the leading altcoin break down beneath the psychologically significant $4,000 support level and proceed to briefly test lower zones around $3,850. Still, despite the depth of this decline, the exchange flow data makes it clear that the bearish price action did not manage to deter accumulation activity across the network. Over $3.08 billion worth of ETH exited exchanges during the week, which serves as evidence of a continued willingness among investors to steadily accumulate Ethereum, even in the face of short-term losses and market pressure.

Data shows that Ethereum‚Äôs total supply on exchanges has dropped to just 14.8 million ETH, its lowest level since 2016. Much of this supply has been redirected into staking, long-term cold storage, and DeFi protocols, which have all led to a drastic decline in the ETH on trading platforms. ETH balance on exchanges. Source: Glassnode Data from a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor CryptoOnchain adds further weight to this trend of heavy outflows. Between August and September 2025, Ethereum‚Äôs 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) netflow dropped below -40,000 ETH per day, the lowest level seen since February 2023. This persistent negative netflow shows that investors have been steadily shifting their ETH away from exchanges and placing it into staking, cold storage, or other long-term holding options. ‚ÄúLower exchange balances equals reduced short-term supply,‚Äù the analyst said.

52395158,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84528,1759082448,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Crypto 101: How to Secure Your Profits During Bull Markets,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-101-how-to-secure-your-profits-during-bull-markets/,"Bull markets in crypto are exciting times. Prices climb rapidly, portfolios multiply in value, and optimism runs high across the community. But with that excitement also comes risk: gains can vanish just as quickly as they appear if investors fail to plan their exit strategies. Knowing how to secure profits during a bull run is one of the most important skills any trader or investor can learn. At the same time, new opportunities continue to emerge alongside established projects. Analysts have recently highlighted MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the standout altcoin picks for the ongoing bull market. With its remarkable growth pace and consistent milestones, the project has become a focus for early investors hoping to capture extraordinary returns. The Importance of Taking Profits The biggest mistake many investors make during bull runs is assuming the rally will never end. In reality, every cycle eventually cools down, and those who held on too long often watch their gains evaporate. Securing profits does not mean exiting the market entirely ‚Äì it means carefully locking in portions of your winnings while still keeping exposure to potential upside. By gradually selling at different price points, investors can reduce risk without missing out on continued growth. This strategy, known as ‚Äúscaling out,‚Äù is widely used by experienced traders to protect their capital while still benefiting from further price appreciation. Avoiding Emotional Decisions Emotions are the enemy of rational investing. In a bull market, fear of missing out (FOMO) can push investors to chase prices at unsustainable levels. Likewise, greed can prevent them from selling when they should. By creating a profit-taking plan in advance, investors can stick to predetermined rules rather than making hasty decisions in the heat of the moment. Simple steps, such as setting automatic sell orders or using portfolio-tracking apps, can help enforce discipline and reduce emotional stress when markets move quickly. A New Opportunity in the Spotlight While securing profits is critical, choosing the right projects early in a bull run is equally important. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been flagged by analysts as one of the most promising altcoins of 2025, thanks to its record-breaking presale growth and expanding ecosystem. The project is attracting both retail traders and whales, fueling speculation that it could deliver one of the most significant returns of the current market cycle. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its combination of viral appeal and structured development. Unlike meme coins that rely solely on community hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building long-term value while still capturing the excitement of early-stage investing. If its trajectory continues, the potential rewards for early participants could be enormous. Diversification Matters Even in bull markets, it‚Äôs dangerous to put all your capital into a single asset. Diversification helps spread risk and allows investors to capture growth across different areas of the market. For example, some investors hold a mix of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and selected altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. This combination balances the stability of large-cap assets with the explosive potential of emerging projects. Diversification also includes allocating some capital to stablecoins or cash reserves. That way, when corrections occur, investors have funds available to buy back in at lower prices. Setting Realistic Targets Another key strategy is setting realistic profit targets. It‚Äôs easy to believe that every coin will skyrocket indefinitely, but history shows that markets move in waves. By defining clear goals ‚Äì whether doubling an investment, tripling it, or hitting a specific dollar figure ‚Äì investors can avoid getting caught up in unrealistic expectations. Sticking to these targets ensures that profits are secured along the way, leaving investors better positioned to withstand market corrections. Conclusion Bull markets present massive opportunities but also major risks. The smartest investors are those who secure their profits strategically, control their emotions, and diversify wisely. As attention shifts to projects with breakout potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing headlines as a top altcoin pick , with analysts predicting extraordinary upside for those who act early. For newcomers and veterans alike, combining disciplined profit-taking with smart project selection could make this bull run one to remember.

According to reports, state officials say residents lost about $177 million to schemes tied to crypto ATMs. There are roughly 600 of those machines across the state, and lawmakers moved quickly after steep losses and repeated complaints from victims, many of them older adults. New Limits And Refund Rules Under the new rules , operators must put limits and safety checks on the kiosks. Based on reports, new customers will be capped at $2,000 per day. Existing users can move up to $10,500 per day. Operators must show clear warnings on the screen and get users to acknowledge them before the cash is turned into crypto. If a new user was tricked into using a kiosk, the operator must issue a full refund, including fees, if the fraud is reported within 30 days. Receipts are required for every transaction. Arizona cracks down on crypto ATM scams that cost residents $177 million https://t.co/nx3vHKRB5G ‚Äî Tucson Sentinel (@TucsonSentinel) September 27, 2025 How Scams Work And Who Is Targeted Scammers commonly impersonate banks, government offices or family members. They call or message victims and tell them to rush to a kiosk and pay cash into a crypto wallet to ‚Äúresolve‚Äù a fake emergency. Once the cash is sent, it can be very hard to get back. Reports have disclosed that older adults are hit hardest and that individual losses can run into tens of thousands of dollars. Lawmakers said those patterns made clear why stricter rules were needed. Technology And Enforcement Tools The law also encourages the use of anti-fraud tools, including blockchain analytics software that can flag suspicious wallet activity. Operators will be expected to adopt systems that detect red flags before money moves out. Enforcement falls to the state Attorney General‚Äôs office, which can investigate and impose penalties when operators fail to follow the rules. Authorities say monitoring will be key, and that cooperation from kiosk owners and payment firms will matter. Enforcement Challenges Ahead The law does not ban crypto ATMs. It regulates them. That means success will depend on how well the rules are enforced and whether operators actually comply. Some consumer advocates have pushed for stricter curbs on high-value transactions. Questions remain about coverage for victims who lost money before the law took effect. Reports suggest some law enforcement officials want wider powers to freeze suspect wallet addresses, but those steps bring technical and legal hurdles.

A wave of accumulation is happening from Ethereum and Ripple to emerging projects like Little Pepe , Mantle, and WLFI. This week is inspiring because Little Pepe is showing community strength and offering buyers in the presale stage 13 a possible 36.36% gain before launch, while early investors are already up by 120%. Ethereum (ETH) ‚Äì The Network That Powers DeFi Ethereum is still the backbone of decentralized finance and remains a must-have for many millionaires. At the time of writing, the price of ETH is $4,493 according to CoinMarketCap . Over the past week, ETH gained close to 9% and briefly touched above $4,750 before easing slightly. Onchain activity is rising too, with fees climbing by about 35% and active addresses increasing by 10%. Institutions are also leaning in through staking and ETF interest, making Ethereum a steady play with long-term appeal. ETH price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap Ripple (XRP) ‚Äì The Bridge Asset Facing Resistance Ripple‚Äôs XRP remains one of the most traded assets in the market. At the time of writing, the price of XRP is moving around $3.10 and has been struggling to hold above $3.15. Data shows that large holders have quietly increased their positions, which suggests confidence in the token‚Äôs future role in cross-border finance. For millionaires buying now, the appeal lies in accumulation during dips while waiting for broader clarity. XRP price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap Little Pepe (LILPEPE) ‚Äì Community Strength Meets Real Utility Among the five coins, Little Pepe is the project that combines meme culture with real substance. The presale is currently in stage 13, with tokens selling at $0.0022. At the time of writing, $26,050,535 has been raised out of $28,775,000, with over 16 billion tokens sold. Stage 12 sold out quickly, and early buyers have already seen gains of 120%. Current investors still have the potential for a 36.36% gain since the launch price is $0.0030. Beyond the numbers, Little Pepe has secured a Certik audit with a score above 95%, is now listed on CoinMarketCap, and is running both a $777k giveaway and a mega giveaway of more than 15 ETH for top buyers across stages 12 to 17. Built on an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2, it offers ultra-low fees, zero transfer tax, and anti-bot protections, separating it from many meme coins. Mantle (MNT) ‚Äì Infrastructure With Quiet Momentum Mantle has been catching attention after governance upgrades and ecosystem growth. Reports revealed that World Liberty Financial accumulated over 3.5 million MNT tokens valued at around $3 million. At the time of writing, Mantle is trading close to $0.80 and has recorded steady weekly gains, signaling that some whales see it as an extended play on blockchain infrastructure. MNT offers strategic upside for investors betting on Layer 2 solutions beyond Ethereum. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) ‚Äì The Speculative Play With Visibility WLFI is a volatile but attention-grabbing. At the time of writing, the price of WLFI has gained over 13% this week, helped by governance votes that approved token buybacks and burns to reduce supply. Its listing on major exchanges has boosted liquidity but also faces sharp corrections, reminding investors of the risk. Millionaires treat WLFI as a token that can deliver significant gains in the short term if momentum holds. Closing Thoughts Ethereum remains the anchor, Ripple remains an accumulation story, Mantle and WLFI bring infrastructure and speculative angles, but Little Pepe ties it all together by giving investors early access to a project with strong community appeal and solid foundations. With the presale at stage 13 almost closing, investors have a final window to capture up to 36.36% gain before launch, while the project‚Äôs long-term vision sets it apart. For those looking beyond short-term trades, Little Pepe is the coin that defines the next chapter of community-driven projects backed by real technology.

Investors, developers, and analysts are already scanning 2025 for the best crypto presales to invest in 2025 , and three names dominate conversations: BullZilla, Avalanche, and Toncoin. Each coin offers a unique edge, whether it is high-yield staking, advanced DeFi ecosystems, or mass adoption through messaging platforms. Among these, BullZilla is drawing attention for its explosive return potential and unique presale mechanics. Avalanche continues to push technical boundaries in decentralized finance, while Toncoin leverages its powerful integration with Telegram‚Äôs massive user base. Together, they illustrate the diverse range of opportunities available in today‚Äôs cryptocurrency economy. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Presale That Turns Loyalty Into Power BullZilla ($BZIL) has captured headlines in 2025‚Äôs presale arena by combining meme coin energy with serious tokenomics. Investors often seek projects that strike a balance between hype and sustainable design, and BullZilla has achieved this blend by linking community growth to financial incentives through its Roarblood Vault and HODL Furnace. Stage 4C Snapshot BullZilla‚Äôs presale is currently in Stage 4C for $0.00009907. More than $670,000 has already been raised, with over 2,000 holders securing allocations. These numbers highlight a project that isn‚Äôt just gathering momentum, but has already achieved measurable community traction. A glance at BullZilla‚Äôs ROI calculations shows what makes this stage attractive. At its current presale price, tokens acquired today could multiply significantly once listing occurs. For instance, a $1,000 buy secures over 10 million tokens, which at listing translates into more than $53,000 in value if projections hold. How to Buy BullZilla Coins For newcomers, joining the BullZilla presale is straightforward and takes only minutes: First, set up a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Then, purchase Ethereum (ETH) through a reputable exchange, such as Coinbase or Binance, and transfer it to your wallet. Next, connect the wallet to the official BullZilla presale portal. Once connected, swap your ETH for $BZIL, select the amount, and confirm the transaction. Your allocation is instantly secured and claimable at the presale‚Äôs conclusion. Applications: Roarblood Vault and HODL Furnace BullZilla strength is not just its token price; it is the ecosystem built around loyalty. The Roarblood Vault acts as the project‚Äôs treasury, powering rewards, referrals, and long-term growth. Holders who bring in new investors are rewarded with a 10% bonus on every purchase of $ 50 or more. Referral owners, in turn, collect 10% of every referred purchase. This approach transforms community members into active ambassadors while aligning financial rewards with project expansion. Post-presale, the Vault continues to fund rewards, ensuring that the ecosystem maintains traction long after the token lists. This continuity of incentives distinguishes BullZilla from projects that lose momentum once their presale closes. The HODL Furnace amplifies loyalty further. By staking tokens, holders earn an annual percentage yield (APY) of 70%, one of the highest rates available in the market. More importantly, rewards vest over time, strengthening the position of those who hold long-term. This staking system is designed to convert weak hands into what the project calls ‚Äúdiamond claws,‚Äù rewarding conviction with consistent growth. ROI Showcase: $3,000 Investment Scenario Imagine an investor allocating $3,000 at Stage 4C. At today‚Äôs price, that purchase secures over 30 million tokens. When the listing price hits $0.00527141, that $3,000 translates into nearly $160,000 in value. The calculated ROI stands at an extraordinary multiple, demonstrating why BullZilla is regarded as one of the best crypto presales to invest in 2025. Avalanche: Reinventing Finance Through Decentralization While BullZilla thrives on presale energy and loyalty-driven mechanics, Avalanche takes a more technical route. It has become a pillar of decentralized finance (DeFi), often compared to Ethereum for its high-speed infrastructure. Avalanche‚Äôs network is capable of processing thousands of transactions per second, with near-instant finality. This capability makes it ideal for decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, and tokenized assets. Analysts note that its Avalanche DeFi ecosystem is among the most robust, housing hundreds of applications and billions in total value locked. One of Avalanche‚Äôs standout features is its subnet architecture, which enables the parallel execution of customized blockchains on the same network. Developers can launch their own subnets tailored to specific industries, from gaming to financial services. This flexibility encourages innovation while keeping costs predictable and manageable. For investors, Avalanche remains relevant because it bridges the gap between retail and institutional adoption. Recent partnerships with major financial players underscore its role in bringing blockchain closer to mainstream finance. In 2025, with DeFi expanding again following regulatory adjustments, Avalanche remains a contender in any conversation about the best crypto presales to invest in 2025. Toncoin: From Messaging App to Financial Superapp If Avalanche is infrastructure and BullZilla is loyalty economics, Toncoin represents mainstream adoption at scale. Built originally by Telegram‚Äôs team and now maintained by the TON Foundation, Toncoin‚Äôs growth has accelerated as Telegram integrates crypto features directly into its messaging platform. With Telegram boasting over 900 million active users worldwide, the potential of Toncoin is hard to ignore. Its seamless wallet integrations within chats make sending, receiving, and storing crypto as simple as sending a message. This user-friendly approach positions Toncoin as a bridge between Web2 and Web3, lowering entry barriers for millions of first-time crypto users. Beyond payments, Toncoin supports smart contracts, decentralized applications, and NFTs. Its Telegram adoption strategy gives it an immediate audience unmatched by most projects. Unlike presales that must work tirelessly to find holders, Toncoin already has a ready-made distribution network in place. Developers see Toncoin‚Äôs ecosystem as fertile ground for mini-apps and integrations. Analysts predict that its adoption could rival major payment networks if current growth continues. For investors in 2025, Toncoin offers accessibility, scale, and network effects that are rare in the best crypto presales to invest in 2025. Closing Thoughts Bull Zilla , Avalanche, and Toncoin each highlight distinct paths to growth in the crypto space. BullZilla leverages presale design, loyalty rewards, and staking yields to attract high-risk, high-reward investors. Avalanche builds sustainable ecosystems for decentralized finance, appealing to developers and institutions. Toncoin focuses on user adoption through integration with one of the world‚Äôs largest messaging apps. Together, they reflect the variety of opportunities available in today‚Äôs market. For those exploring the best crypto presales to invest in 2025, these three projects showcase how presales, infrastructure, and adoption strategies intersect. The final choice depends on whether an investor values explosive ROI, technical architecture, or user scalability.

Fees, which are a key indicator of actual network usage, reveal a sharp reversal after Solana dominated mid-September with highs around $2.2 million compared to BNB Chain‚Äôs $0.6-$0.8 million. BNB Chain Activity Spikes From September 20 to 22, CryptoRank observed that BNB Chain surged to roughly $1.1-$1.4 million in daily fees, while Solana cooled to about $0.85-$0.95 million. This surge coincided with the launch of Aster DEX on BNB Chain, an event publicly endorsed by Binance founder CZ, driving fresh user activity, liquidity inflows, and growing paid demand for BNB Chain‚Äôs blockspace. As of September 23, Aster‚Äôs TVL reached $1.52 billion, according to DefiLlama, following a sharp uptick in the month‚Äôs final week. The influx of liquidity indicates that users are turning to Aster for decentralized trading and yield farming. Reflecting this momentum, the platform briefly overtook Hyperliquid in daily trading volume. Over the past 24 hours, Aster recorded a trading volume of $515.51 million, which pushed its weekly volume above $3 billion. This growing user engagement on Aster and record-breaking fee activity can also be seen in the broader surge in BNB Chain‚Äôs overall network adoption. Data compiled by Chainspect revealed that BNB Chain reached a new activity milestone after processing over 16.5 million transactions in a single day on September 21st. This throughput translated to an average of 191 transactions per second (TPS) recorded continuously for 24 hours, which evidenced the network‚Äôs growing capacity and adoption. Additionally, Santiment found that BNB Chain secured the second spot in terms of the leading blockchain ecosystems by total development activity over the past 30 days. This ranking reflects the volume of development events, such as smart contract updates, protocol enhancements, and ecosystem integrations. BNB Chain is trailing only Ethereum, while outpacing other prominent networks like Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum. BNB Defies Market Sell-Off On the price front, BNB, the native token of BNB Chain, bucked the trend as it defied the broader crypto market‚Äôs downtrend. After recently joining the four-digit club, the token rebounded sharply even as other major coins struggled.

Now, another seismic shift is underway, mirroring that early scramble for essential resources: the race to build the AI Infrastructure that will power the next generation of digital innovation. Just as robust blockchain networks were crucial for crypto‚Äôs ascent, immense computing power and vast data centers are now the bedrock for artificial intelligence. The scale of investment is staggering, with industry leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimating that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on this vital infrastructure by the end of the decade. This isn‚Äôt just about software; it‚Äôs about physical power, immense data facilities, and the underlying architecture that makes AI possible. This article delves into the colossal deals shaping this new frontier, examining how tech giants are pouring billions into building the future. The Billion-Dollar Race for AI Infrastructure The global pursuit of artificial intelligence dominance has triggered an unprecedented investment spree in foundational technologies. Every major tech player, from established giants to ambitious startups, recognizes that cutting-edge AI models are only as powerful as the infrastructure supporting them. This realization has ignited a parallel race, a true arms race in the digital realm, to construct the colossal computing backbone required. The figures involved are astronomical, placing immense strain on existing power grids and pushing the industry‚Äôs building capacity to its absolute limit. Companies like Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI are at the forefront, orchestrating deals that redefine the scale of technological investment. Their spending is not just about gaining a competitive edge; it‚Äôs about laying the groundwork for an AI-driven future, one server rack, one data center, and one massive energy supply at a time. The sheer volume of capital flowing into this sector underscores its strategic importance, marking AI Infrastructure as the most critical investment area in tech today. Microsoft and OpenAI: A Strategic Partnership Evolves The contemporary AI boom arguably began with a pivotal agreement in 2019: Microsoft‚Äôs initial $1 billion investment in the then-non-profit OpenAI. This deal was more than just a financial injection; it strategically positioned Microsoft as OpenAI‚Äôs exclusive cloud provider. As the demands of AI model training intensified, Microsoft‚Äôs investment increasingly took the form of Azure cloud credits rather than direct cash. This arrangement proved mutually beneficial: Microsoft boosted its Azure sales figures, while OpenAI secured essential funding for its largest operational expense ‚Äì computing power. Over the subsequent years, Microsoft‚Äôs commitment escalated, reaching nearly $14 billion, a move anticipated to yield substantial returns as OpenAI transitioned to a for-profit entity. This partnership became a blueprint for others in the industry. However, the dynamic between the two giants has evolved. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer rely exclusively on Microsoft‚Äôs cloud services. While Microsoft retains a right of first refusal for future infrastructure needs, OpenAI is now free to explore other providers if Azure cannot meet its specific requirements. Concurrently, Microsoft has begun investigating alternative foundation models to power its own AI products, signaling a move towards greater independence from the AI pioneer. This strategic shift highlights the intense competition and the need for diversification in the rapidly expanding AI landscape. Other significant partnerships have emerged, reflecting the success of this model. Anthropic, for instance, has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, alongside making kernel-level modifications to Amazon‚Äôs hardware to optimize it for AI training. Google Cloud has also forged ‚Äúprimary computing partner‚Äù agreements with smaller AI firms like Lovable and Windsurf, though these did not involve direct equity investments. Even OpenAI has continued to secure its computing future, notably receiving a substantial $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, specifically earmarked for purchasing more of the company‚Äôs indispensable GPUs. Oracle‚Äôs Astounding Leap into Cloud Computing In a dramatic display of its ambition, Oracle has rapidly ascended as a major player in the AI Infrastructure arena. The first hint of this surge came on June 30, 2025, when Oracle disclosed an SEC filing revealing a $30 billion cloud services deal with an undisclosed partner. This figure alone surpassed Oracle‚Äôs total cloud revenues for the entire preceding fiscal year, sending a clear signal of its new strategic direction. The partner was later confirmed to be OpenAI , instantly securing Oracle a coveted spot alongside Google as one of OpenAI‚Äôs primary hosting partners post-Microsoft exclusivity. Predictably, Oracle‚Äôs stock experienced a significant rally, reflecting investor confidence in its newfound prominence. Just a few months later, Oracle made an even more astonishing announcement. On September 10, the company unveiled a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, slated to commence in 2027. This monumental agreement caused Oracle‚Äôs stock to climb even higher, briefly propelling founder Larry Ellison to the status of the world‚Äôs richest individual. The sheer scale of this deal is breathtaking, especially considering that OpenAI does not currently possess $300 billion in available funds. This massive commitment presumes immense future growth for both companies, coupled with a significant degree of faith in the long-term trajectory of AI development. Regardless of the future expenditure, this deal has already firmly cemented Oracle‚Äôs position as one of the preeminent Cloud Computing providers for AI workloads and a formidable financial force within the technology sector. It underscores the strategic importance of securing vast computing resources for AI development and deployment, making Oracle a critical enabler of the ongoing AI revolution. Building Hyperscale Data Centers: Meta‚Äôs Ambitious Plans For tech behemoths like Meta, which already command extensive legacy infrastructure, the journey into advanced AI Infrastructure is equally complex and considerably expensive. Mark Zuckerberg has publicly stated Meta‚Äôs intention to invest an astounding $600 billion in U.S. infrastructure by the close of 2028. This commitment reflects the company‚Äôs aggressive pivot towards AI. In just the first half of 2025, Meta‚Äôs spending surged by $30 billion compared to the previous year, predominantly fueled by its escalating AI ambitions. While a portion of this investment is directed towards substantial cloud contracts, such as a recent $10 billion agreement with Google Cloud, an even larger share is being channeled into the construction of two colossal new data centers. One such project is ‚ÄúHyperion,‚Äù a sprawling 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, projected to cost an estimated $10 billion to build out. Upon completion, Hyperion is expected to deliver an impressive 5 gigawatts of compute power. A notable aspect of this site is its innovative arrangement with a local nuclear power plant, designed to manage the immense energy demands. Simultaneously, a slightly smaller facility named ‚ÄúPrometheus‚Äù in Ohio is anticipated to become operational in 2026, with its power supplied by natural gas. These massive undertakings, while crucial for advancing AI capabilities, are not without significant environmental costs. Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI, for instance, constructed its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. This facility has quickly emerged as one of the county‚Äôs largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, attributed to a series of natural gas turbines that environmental experts contend violate the Clean Air Act. The development of these hyperscale Data Centers highlights the critical need for sustainable energy solutions as the AI boom continues to accelerate, placing unprecedented demands on global power resources. The Stargate Moonshot: Grand Vision or Pipe Dream? Just two days after his second inauguration, President Trump unveiled a highly ambitious joint venture dubbed ‚ÄúStargate,‚Äù involving SoftBank, OpenAI , and Oracle. This project was conceived with the staggering goal of investing $500 billion into building AI infrastructure across the United States. Named after the iconic 1994 film, Stargate was launched with immense fanfare, with Trump proclaiming it ‚Äúthe largest AI infrastructure project in history.‚Äù OpenAI CEO Sam Altman echoed this sentiment, declaring, ‚ÄúI think this will be the most important project of this era.‚Äù The broad outline of the plan designated SoftBank as the primary financier, with Oracle tasked with handling the extensive buildout, guided by input from OpenAI. President Trump committed to overseeing the initiative, promising to streamline regulatory processes to accelerate its progress. However, skepticism surfaced early on, notably from Elon Musk, a business rival of Altman, who publicly questioned whether the project had the necessary funds. As the initial hype subsided, the project‚Äôs momentum appeared to wane. In August, Bloomberg reported that the partners were struggling to reach a consensus on key aspects of the venture. Despite these challenges, the Stargate project has made tangible progress. Construction has commenced on eight Data Centers in Abilene, Texas, with the final building anticipated to be completed by the end of 2026. This initiative, while facing hurdles, underscores the national strategic importance placed on developing robust AI Infrastructure and securing a leading position in the global AI race. The Unseen Strain: Power Grids and Environmental Impact of AI Infrastructure The relentless expansion of AI Infrastructure , particularly the proliferation of hyperscale data centers, is placing an unprecedented strain on global power grids and raising significant environmental concerns. Training and running advanced AI models, especially those powered by high-performance GPUs from companies like Nvidia , consume vast amounts of electricity. This demand is not merely incremental; it represents a fundamental shift in global energy consumption patterns. Utilities worldwide are scrambling to upgrade infrastructure and secure new energy sources to meet the projected needs of these digital behemoths. The reliance on fossil fuels, such as natural gas, for powering many of these new facilities, as seen with Meta‚Äôs Prometheus project or xAI‚Äôs plant in Memphis, contributes directly to carbon emissions and air pollution, challenging environmental regulations like the Clean Air Act. This highlights a critical dilemma: advancing AI capabilities while simultaneously addressing climate change. The push for more sustainable energy solutions, including renewable sources and nuclear power, is becoming increasingly urgent. As more and more Data Centers come online, the long-term environmental footprint of the AI revolution will depend heavily on innovative energy strategies and a commitment to green technology, moving beyond purely economic considerations to embrace ecological responsibility. The Competitive Edge: How Cloud Computing Giants are Battling for AI Dominance The race to provide the underlying compute power for AI has transformed the Cloud Computing landscape into a fiercely competitive battleground. Major players like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) are employing diverse strategies to capture market share. This includes offering highly specialized services, making strategic equity investments, and even engaging in bespoke hardware modifications to optimize for AI workloads. The partnerships with companies like OpenAI are central to these strategies. Microsoft‚Äôs early and deep integration with OpenAI gave Azure a significant head start, showcasing the power of a tightly integrated ecosystem. Amazon‚Äôs investment in Anthropic, coupled with kernel-level hardware adjustments, demonstrates a commitment to deep optimization for specific AI partners. Google Cloud, while not always making direct investments, is aggressively pursuing ‚Äúprimary computing partner‚Äù deals with emerging AI firms, integrating them into its expansive network. The competition extends beyond just cloud services to the very hardware that underpins AI. Nvidia , with its market-leading GPUs, plays a pivotal role, becoming an indispensable supplier for all these cloud providers and AI developers. The ability to secure access to Nvidia‚Äôs latest chips is a critical differentiator. This intense competition benefits AI developers by driving innovation, improving service offerings, and potentially lowering costs over time. However, it also creates a complex web of dependencies and strategic alliances, where the choice of a cloud provider can significantly impact an AI company‚Äôs development trajectory and market access. The battle for AI dominance is not just about who has the best models, but who can provide the most robust, scalable, and efficient Cloud Computing infrastructure to run them. Conclusion: The Enduring Legacy of the AI Infrastructure Race The colossal investments pouring into AI Infrastructure represent more than just a fleeting trend; they signify a fundamental reshaping of the global technological landscape. From Microsoft‚Äôs strategic early bets on OpenAI to Oracle‚Äôs breathtaking multi-billion-dollar deals and Meta‚Äôs commitment to hyperscale Data Centers , the scale of capital expenditure is truly unprecedented. This race is driving innovation, pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in Cloud Computing , and simultaneously creating immense challenges related to energy consumption and environmental impact.

Currently at $0.035, MUTM has already garnered more than $16.5 million in its presale and has had more than 16,620 holders, increasing market belief. Unlike DOGE, founded on hype and speculation trading, Mutuum Finance offers genuine DeFi applications in its lending and borrowing process, robust security measures, and staking rewards. MUTM is a high-performing token with immense growth opportunities and turning it into a viable contender for those who seek real value and appreciation in the future. Dogecoin‚Äôs Next Big Moment? Dogecoin (DOGE) is once more making enormous waves as experts are calling for almost 200% more in the near future. The reason behind the optimism is top-tier whale accumulation and rising hope that a DOGE ETF with a 99% probability of listing is on its way. Such an event will most likely put DOGE back in the limelight, having the potential to push it above its last all-time high and reviving mainstream interest. Investors are wondering if this is the catalyst that secures DOGE‚Äôs long-term value, or just another hype-driven spike. For most investors, that is precisely why growing interest is being shifted to newer player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Reports Strong Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to experience strong momentum as it enters Phase 6 of its presale, gaining over 16,620 investors and raising over $16.5 million. Increasing entry is evidence of growing faith in the project‚Äôs long-term future and vision for the decentralized finance future. As part of its commitment to its values of transparency and security, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program. The program enables security researchers and developers to scan for platform vulnerabilities at four severity levels, namely critical, major, minor, and low. The program is just one of the several that Mutuum is taking to become even more secure on its infrastructure and earn the trust of its burgeoning community. Dynamic Interest Rates and Maximum Efficiency In the center of the Mutuum Finance protocol is an computerized real-time floating interest rate system that adjusts according to liquidity levels. Under periods of high liquidity, the cost of borrowing goes down, which stimulates lending and capital flowing in. Under periods of low liquidity, borrowing cost goes up to stimulate loan repayments and new deposits. The self-balancing mechanism achieves a natural equilibrium, reducing the potential for over-leveraging and overall ecosystem health. Efficiency is also maintained with collateral optimization, particularly when co-related assets are utilized. Collateralized positions entered into in a secure manner command more borrowing capacity with improved Loan-to-Value (LTV) terms, and reserve factors act as buffers during periods of market fluctuations. Volatile assets have greater reserve requirements to maintain low uncertainty, but stable low-volatility assets can have increased borrowing with minimal liquidation risk. LTV ratios and liquidation points are constantly updated to reflect each token it lists‚Äô distinctive volatility profiles, evenly distributing risk throughout the platform. With its presale success, ground-breaking risk management technology, and solid commitment to security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a robust and resilient network well-positioned for long-term adoption, expansion, and prosperity in the DeFi market. Hype vs Utility Dogecoin‚Äôs potential 200% rise is exciting, but its climb remains founded on guesswork and hype. Mutuum Finance, with a value of $0.035, has already raised over $16.5 million and gained over 16,620 investors, reflecting strong market trust. With real DeFi utility, complex risk management, and a real way to long-term success, MUTM is the investment to take.

Big Tech, a.k.a. the Magnificent Seven (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla), once defined the AI boom, but the trade is spreading further. Since ChatGPT placed AI at the center of the global economy around three years ago, investors have gone crazy pouring money into Big Tech, making it responsible for more than half of the S&P 500‚Äôs 70% surge since 2023, according to data from Bloomberg. Now the gains are moving beyond Big Tech, and strategies built only around the seven giants risk missing the next winners. The group is still massive. The Mag 7 controls almost 35% of the S&P 500, with earnings projected to rise more than 15% in 2026 and revenue up 13%. The rest of the index is expected to post 13% earnings growth and just 5.5% in revenue. But performance inside the seven tells two different stories. Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta are up between 21% and 33% this year. Apple, Amazon, and Tesla are trailing, their roles in an AI-driven market far less certain. Analysts add new companies to the trade Some on Wall Street are cutting the list down. A ‚ÄúFab Four‚Äù of Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon has been suggested. Jonathan Golub at Seaport Research recommended removing Tesla to create a ‚ÄúBig Six.‚Äù Ben Reitzes at Melius Research added Broadcom to make an ‚ÄúElite 8.‚Äù But none of these attempts capture all the companies benefiting from AI. Oracle has surged more than 75% in 2025 as its AI-related cloud services took off. Palantir, once a niche software firm, is now the top performer in the Nasdaq 100, surging 135% this year on AI demand. Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, which oversees $16.4 trillion, said: ‚ÄúA company can become too big to ignore. It could be that as the AI story evolves, new winners take the place of the old winners, even if the previous ones continue to do fine.‚Äù This is not the first time Wall Street has reshuffled the names that dominate. The Nifty Fifty ruled the 1960s, the Four Horsemen carried the Nasdaq through the dot-com bubble, and FAANG defined the mobile and social media era. Each club was dominant for its time, but each eventually gave way to new leaders. The same pattern is now playing out with AI. Index makers formalize the expansion Cboe Global Markets announced the Magnificent 10 Index on September 10, including the original seven plus Broadcom, Palantir, and Advanced Micro Devices. The announcement came the same day Oracle posted its biggest one-day gain since 1992 with a strong forecast, yet it was excluded. Nick Schommer, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, which manages $34.7 billion, said : ‚ÄúWe do need to expand the conversation beyond just the Mag Seven. Oracle is definitely a part of it now, and so is Broadcom.‚Äù Cboe said the index was built on criteria like liquidity, market value, trading volume, and leadership in artificial intelligence and digital transformation. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Oracle, Broadcom, and Palantir are repeatedly mentioned by investors as critical to the AI ecosystem. Palantir is also singled out as one of the few clear software winners while firms like Salesforce and Adobe face doubts about being left behind. The AI boom is lifting companies outside the seven. Apple is flagged as falling behind in AI, while Tesla faces a crowded electric vehicle market. Still, both have loyal investors. Apple supporters believe the iPhone will become the gateway device for AI. Tesla‚Äôs backers place their hopes on Elon Musk‚Äôs push into autonomous driving and humanoid robots. AI demand is boosting energy producers, networking companies like Arista Networks, memory makers such as Micron, and storage firms including Western Digital, Seagate, and SanDisk. But not all players are available on the market. OpenAI, reportedly valued at $500 billion, remains private, as do Anthropic and SpaceX, though they still shape the AI environment.

Such a move, if it happens, could provide momentum across the market. For meme tokens like PEPE, this forecast translates into potential 5x returns, while presale star Layer Brett (LBRETT) is being tipped for even greater upside ‚Äî with projections of 50x gains. The call has divided opinion. Some see it as confirmation that crypto‚Äôs bull run is only just heating up, while others remain skeptical that Ethereum can achieve such lofty levels so quickly. Either way, the buzz has pushed alternative plays like PEPE and Layer Brett into the spotlight, as investors weigh where the next major multiples could come from. Ethereum price predictions for Q4 Ethereum‚Äôs price has been building strength throughout 2025. With increasing Layer 2 activity, institutional inflows and continued dominance in DeFi, analysts believe ETH could be preparing for a breakout. A $10,000 target would mark a huge milestone and supporters argue that such levels are justified by Ethereum‚Äôs role as the backbone of Web3. Of course, not everyone is bullish. Some critics warn that resistance remains strong near current levels and the Ethereum price may need multiple catalysts to sustain a run into five figures. Still, institutional buying and whale accumulation suggest that ETH has a strong foundation heading into the final quarter of the year. Pepe looks to ride Ethereum‚Äôs wave The meme coin sector remains tightly tied to broader market moves. For PEPE, analysts suggest that an ETH breakout could act as a tailwind. Current forecasts put the possibility of a 5x run on the table if liquidity continues to flow into meme assets. Optimists point out that PEPE still commands one of the largest meme communities, keeping its relevance intact. Yet skeptics argue that PEPE has already delivered most of its exponential gains and that new entrants could steal momentum. Volatility remains high and not all traders are convinced it can maintain the hype through Q4. Even so, PEPE remains a name to watch if ETH pushes higher. Layer Brett prepares for liftoff The real excitement, though, surrounds Layer Brett . While ETH and PEPE are already established, LBRETT is still in presale and offers significantly more room to grow. Tokens are fixed at $0.0058, with more than $4 million raised to date. At the time of writing, staking rewards are 626% APY , though they decline quickly as more wallets join ‚Äî meaning early adopters stand to benefit most. Built as an Ethereum Layer 2, Layer Brett combines meme coin virality with serious utility. Fast transactions, low fees, NFT rollouts, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging all feature in its roadmap. The process is simple too: Connect a wallet and purchase with ETH or USDT. Community traction has been impressive. Telegram and X groups hover near 10k members each, TikTok has grown beyond 25k followers and YouTube coverage continues to expand. A $1 million giveaway is also on the way, reinforcing engagement and helping LBRETT generate viral momentum that rivals established meme coins. Which has the strongest upside? The Ethereum price prediction for Q4 has set the tone for bullish sentiment across the market. PEPE could certainly benefit if ETH breaks into new highs, but many analysts believe the biggest opportunity lies in tokens still at presale. That‚Äôs where Layer Brett is shining, blending the strength of Ethereum Layer 2 with community-driven hype and the potential for 50x returns. Join the LBRETT presale today ‚Äî early entry could define your Q4 gains.

Right now, no project is demonstrating more blistering speed than Ruvi AI (RUVI). Its presale is moving at such a historic pace, with Phase 3 nearing 20% completion in just a few days, that analysts are now openly suggesting it could surpass the legendary success of Dogecoin (DOGE) in record time. This bold forecast is backed by a presale that can only be described as a phenomenon. Ruvi AI has officially blown past the $4 million fundraising milestone, with over 285 million tokens now in the hands of a rapidly growing global community of more than 3,900 holders . This level of demand is why experts are drawing parallels to the early, explosive days of Dogecoin, suggesting Ruvi AI has the momentum for a similar, life-changing rally. The Formula for Outpacing a Legend What made Dogecoin‚Äôs rise so iconic was its ability to capture overwhelming market demand. Ruvi AI is now showing that same viral potential but with a crucial advantage: it‚Äôs backed by real-world utility. While DOGE‚Äôs success was driven by community hype, Ruvi AI‚Äôs value is firmly anchored in its mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . This fundamental strength provides a solid foundation for sustainable growth that even DOGE didn‚Äôt have in its early days. The project‚Äôs credibility is further cemented by a successful smart contract audit by CyberScope , which verifies its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , establishing it as a premier AI project. This powerful combination of speed, utility, and trust is why analysts believe its path to success could be even faster than Dogecoin‚Äôs. The Super App Fueling the Record-Breaking Demand The engine driving Ruvi AI‚Äôs explosive presale is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is engineered to become an indispensable tool for content creators, which will create a continuous cycle of user adoption and token demand. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining content production. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. Last Chance for Ground-Floor Entry Before a 40% Price Jump The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at an incredibly low $0.020 . However, with 20% of the stage‚Äôs allocation selling out in days, this opportunity is vanishing at an astonishing rate. According to the project‚Äôs official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure a guaranteed paper gain before the next leg up. The project‚Äôs VIP program is structured to maximize returns for those who act now: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway further rewards top supporters, strengthening the project‚Äôs vibrant community. The Verdict The market is speaking loud and clear. With a presale moving at record speed, a utility-driven ecosystem, and a guaranteed price increase just around the corner, Ruvi AI has all the ingredients to not only match but potentially surpass Dogecoin‚Äôs success. For investors, this is a time-sensitive opportunity to get in on the ground floor of what could be the next crypto legend.

Elliot Wave analysis, combined with a confirmed double-bottom and bullish flag formation, indicates that XRP may be preparing for one of its strongest upward moves yet. Currently, XRP is completing Wave 2 of the Elliot Wave cycle, which typically serves as a corrective phase before the longest and most bullish Wave 3. This stage has historically been associated with explosive growth, often fueled by increasing market participation and positive macro catalysts. If the analysis holds true, XRP could be entering a decisive breakout phase in the weeks ahead. Notably, technical indicators strengthen this bullish outlook as the double-bottom signals exhausted selling and renewed accumulation, while the bullish flag points to momentum coiling beneath resistance. Together, they suggest XRP is not consolidating but gearing up for a decisive upward breakout. Beyond technical patterns, fundamentals are aligning in XRP‚Äôs favor. A major catalyst is the rising likelihood of a spot XRP ETF approval, an event that could mirror Bitcoin‚Äôs ETF-driven surge by unlocking institutional capital, boosting liquidity, and expanding mainstream investor access. Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger is emerging as a frontrunner in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, bridging blockchain with traditional finance. From real estate to commodities, assets can now be issued and traded seamlessly on XRPL, where speed and efficiency give it a competitive edge. This positions XRP not just as a speculative token, but as a core driver of financial innovation. Together, XRP‚Äôs technical strength and fundamental momentum signal a powerful setup. Wave 3 in Elliott Wave theory, the ‚Äòmoney wave‚Äô where the biggest gains unfold, appears ready to ignite. With bullish patterns confirmed and catalysts like potential ETF approval and XRPL‚Äôs RWA expansion accelerating, XRP could be approaching its most decisive rally in years. Whale Drops $48.9M on XRP ‚Äî Market Gears Up for Bullish Breakout According to market analyst Xaif Crypto, a crypto whale has just executed a massive purchase of 17,555,420 XRP, a transaction valued at approximately $48.9 million. The bold move has sent ripples across the XRP community, fueling speculation of an imminent bullish trend. Whale activity often signals market sentiment, especially in blue-chip assets like XRP. A $48.9M buy reflects strong confidence, hinting that institutional players and high-net-worth investors anticipate significant upside. All eyes are now on whether this whale buy signals more than short-term hype. If it marks the start of sustained institutional accumulation, XRP‚Äôs outlook could prove far more bullish than many skeptics expect. Conclusion The $48.9 million whale purchase reflects rising confidence in XRP‚Äôs long-term potential. Beyond fueling a possible short-term rally, it may signal the early stages of institutional accumulation, underscoring XRP‚Äôs growing relevance in the shifting crypto landscape. Meanwhile, XRP sits at the crossroads of bullish technicals and transformative fundamentals. Elliot Wave analysis points to an explosive Wave 3, reinforced by a double-bottom and bullish flag signaling breakout momentum.

Academic researchers overwhelmingly prefer Chris Waller, yet many believe that Kevin Hassett has the better odds of actually taking the job in 2026, according to a Financial Times poll conducted by the Clark Center for Global Markets at the University of Chicago‚Äôs Booth School of Business. Out of 44 respondents, 82% said Waller should lead the central bank, but only 20% thought he would end up in the role. Meanwhile, 39% picked Hassett as the likeliest successor. The split between preference and prediction comes down to President Donald Trump. His second term has been defined by heavy pressure on the central bank, and he has repeatedly demanded interest rates be cut to 1%. He argues this would lift growth and ease the government‚Äôs borrowing costs. Trump has not shied away from personal attacks either, branding Powell a ‚Äúmoron‚Äù and a ‚Äúnumbskull‚Äù for refusing to slash rates at the pace he wants. Trump pushes Fed to cut deeper The Fed cut rates this month for the first time since December, lowering the benchmark federal funds range to 4‚Äì4.25% with a quarter-point cut. That was not enough for Trump‚Äôs latest board nominee, Steve Miran, who dissented and pushed for a 50 basis point cut. Miran also called for five more quarter-point cuts before the year ends, more than double what any other senior Fed policymaker supports. Waller, though seen as more cautious than Miran, had been one of two dissenters during the July meeting when he voted for a smaller quarter-point cut. This time, he refused to join Miran‚Äôs demand for the bigger half-point move. Johns Hopkins University economist Robert Barbera argued that Waller‚Äôs independence hurts his chances of rising to the top, saying , ‚ÄúWaller looks like a central banker, rather than someone who is prostrating himself for the job of Fed chair. And that‚Äôs precisely why he won‚Äôt get it.‚Äù Not one of the economists surveyed supported Miran as their preferred pick for chair. Yet 20% still named him a possible Trump choice. Betting markets show Waller holding a narrow lead over Hassett, but Hassett is seen as having the political advantage. Trump himself has said his preferred candidates are Waller, Hassett, and former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, stressing that loyalty and a readiness to slash rates are what matter most to him. Interviews raise pressure as economy weakens The tension grew when Trump attempted to fire Lisa Cook, a current Fed governor, accusing her of mortgage fraud. Cook denied the allegations and is challenging the move in court, a case that could set limits on presidential power over monetary policy. At the same time, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is overseeing the early interview round for the next chair. Marc Sumerlin, one of 11 names on the longlist, met with him on Friday. The first round is expected to end within two weeks. Scott himself had once been floated as a top contender, but Trump later signaled he wanted him to stay at Treasury. Even so, Cryptopolitan reported that Scott has made it known he wants whoever becomes chair to reform the Fed‚Äôs governance and shrink its balance sheet, which ballooned from years of quantitative easing. The Chicago-Booth poll narrowed the field to five: Waller, Hassett, Bessent, Warsh, and Miran. Whoever takes over will face an economy hit from tariffs, a cooling labor market, and the risk of stagflation. Most Fed officials expect Trump‚Äôs tariffs to create one-off spikes in prices for a few goods, and they are willing to accept slower hiring rather than risk runaway inflation. But many of the economists in the poll now believe stagflation is becoming more likely. Nikolai Roussanov of the Wharton School said, ‚ÄúThe dual mandate puts the Fed in a bind, but if recent history is any guide ‚Äî the last couple of decades, at least ‚Äî the FOMC tends to prioritise employment over inflation.‚Äù Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Economy|Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-28 19:10:52

In a post on X, Aljarrah stated, ‚ÄúStrategically, all on-chain value flows will eventually touch liquidity layers like XRP that manage settlement and efficiency.‚Äù His remarks highlight a view shared by many long-time XRP advocates who believe that the token remains central to future cross-border value transfer despite new pilots by established financial institutions. A lot of questions on SWIFT‚Äôs pilot with Ethereum L2 Linea. Let them build. Strategically, all on-chain value flows will eventually touch liquidity layers like #XRP that manage settlement and efficiency. pic.twitter.com/n2YbgdOvhn ‚Äî Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) September 27, 2025 SWIFT‚Äôs On-Chain Pilot with Linea SWIFT launched a pilot on September 26, 2025, to test on-chain messaging and settlement using Linea , an Ethereum Layer-2 network built by Consensys. The program includes several global banks aiming to improve the speed and transparency of cross-border messaging and tokenized asset transfers. Linea‚Äôs zero-knowledge technology appeals to institutions for its privacy features. Still in its early phase, the initiative raises questions about the role of settlement assets, like XRP . Aljarrah‚Äôs Position on XRP‚Äôs Role Aljarrah‚Äôs statement suggests that while SWIFT explores new technical frameworks, he considers XRP essential for settlement. XRP‚Äôs design for efficient value transfer enables it to function as a bridge asset between networks and currencies, and Aljarrah emphasized that all on-chain value flows will ultimately pass through liquidity layers, such as XRP. This perspective has persisted within the XRP community for years, positioning XRP as more than a digital token but as infrastructure for fast, low-cost, and scalable settlement. Aljarrah‚Äôs focus on liquidity layers aligns with industry discussions about the need for assets that can seamlessly connect diverse payment networks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Viable Alternative to Legacy Systems XRP‚Äôs supporters and many experts see it as a viable alternative to SWIFT‚Äôs traditional model of international payments. Advocates highlight its ability to reduce settlement times from days to seconds while maintaining low fees. The belief that XRP could complement or even replace parts of SWIFT‚Äôs existing infrastructure underpins much of the optimism voiced by figures like Aljarrah. Although SWIFT‚Äôs pilot with Linea represents a significant step toward integrating blockchain into mainstream banking operations, the debate over the future of global settlement remains active. For Aljarrah and many other XRP proponents, the ongoing developments reinforce the view that XRP‚Äôs efficiency, liquidity, and track record position it as a natural participant in any system designed to move value across borders.

In his statements, Pal suggested that Bitcoin's traditional 4-year cycle has now turned into a 5-year cycle due to macroeconomic factors, and stated that the next peak is expected in the second quarter (Q2) of 2026. According to Pal, the main factor driving Bitcoin price movements is not the ‚Äúhalving‚Äù (half-time), contrary to popular belief, but the global business cycle. Raoul Pal attributes the main reason for the extension of the cycle to the ISM (Institute for Supply Management) Purchasing Managers Index, an indicator of the Business Cycle of the US economy. Related News: Is CZ Behind the Most Popular Altcoin of Recent Times? He Made a Statement According to Pal's findings: Debt Maturity Extension: The extension of the average maturity of US debt from 4 to 5 years between 2021 and 2022 also postponed the business cycle by one year. ISM and the Business Cycle: According to analysts, cryptocurrency market price movements follow the ISM index. A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while a reading above indicates economic expansion. Pal noted that since its peak in 2021, the ISM has remained below 50, one of the longest contractions in decades. Based on this 5-year cycle driven by debt maturity extension, Pal predicts that the peak of the ISM, and therefore Bitcoin, will shift to the second quarter of 2026. ‚ÄúCurrently, the ISM is above 50 and the economy is not booming. The global economy is not yet in an expansion and Bitcoin is following suit,‚Äù Pal said. *This is not investment advice.

The Barclays iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN, the biggest of these vehicles, has grown by more than 300% in 2025. The appeal is straightforward. If the stock rally breaks, volatility will soar and these products will pay out. But while they wait for that moment, investors face steep costs that eat away at returns. These costs are built into how the funds work. Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called them ‚Äúa chainsaw ‚Äî very effective at certain jobs, but it can cut your arm off.‚Äù He was referring to the way the funds lose money when market swings expected in the future exceed those happening now. Timing is everything. Anyone who bought the Volatility Shares 2x Long VIX Futures ETF on April 1 before sweeping US tariffs hit would have tripled their money by selling on April 8. But holding that same fund for a year would have produced a 78% loss. This risk hasn‚Äôt stopped inflows. VXX is down 32% with $1 billion in assets and 312% net inflows. UVIX is down 78% with $510 million and 215% inflows. UVXY is down 57% with $690 million and 150% inflows. VIXY is down 33% with $343 million and 115% inflows. All four funds show how money keeps flowing into VIX products even as their performance bleeds. Investors increase VIX holdings while costs mount Michael Thompson, co-portfolio manager at Little Harbor Advisors, said ‚Äúthese can increase in price pretty dramatically, almost like an option but without an expiration date.‚Äù He added that if a correction doesn‚Äôt happen on schedule, ‚Äúyou can still hold on to your long vol ETP shares.‚Äù These vehicles offer a basic hedge for investors who own stocks because the VIX tends to rise when the S&P 500 falls. Unlike the 2018 rush into short-volatility trades that led to ‚ÄúVolmageddon,‚Äù the current surge in hedging isn‚Äôt expected to set off a market shock. Retail traders are ‚Äúlooking to do something cautious, something protective,‚Äù said Rocky Fishman, founder of the research firm Asym 500. He estimated that 40% of open interest in VIX futures is now held by exchange-traded products. But carrying these bets costs real money. UVIX charges an expense ratio of 2.8% and now holds two VIX futures expiring in October and November. Each day it sells part of October and buys November until October expires, then shifts November into December. Because October trades below November, the fund sells low and buys high, draining cash. Rolling contracts also pushes down the front-month future and lifts the next-month bet. ‚ÄúThey have to sell the front one and buy the second one on a daily basis to keep their expiration at a weighted 30 days,‚Äù said Matthew Thompson, Michael‚Äôs brother and co-portfolio manager. ‚ÄúIt stands to reason that the front two months should steepen, which, ironically, increases the carrying cost of those instruments.‚Äù Strategists outline VIX curve trades as hedge funds join rush This rolling problem has happened before. More than a decade ago, retail investors piled into the United States Oil Fund ETF to mimic crude gains but saw returns trail spot prices. Today, implied volatility (the market‚Äôs view of future price swings) stays muted as stocks grind higher. Small realized moves make options cheaper and hold down the spot VIX index and front-month futures. That has left the VIX futures curve steep, with both opportunities and risks. Strategists at Societe Generale SA have suggested trades to exploit the discount known as contango, noting that the curve is also concave ‚Äî it steepens near expiration. One idea is selling the near-term VIX future and buying the next month because the front contract tends to sink faster. But there‚Äôs a clear hazard. Brian Fleming and Kunal Thakkar said ‚Äúthe main risk is a sharp and volatile equity selloff, which manifests itself through the VIX curve moving upwards and inverting significantly.‚Äù Some investors see the losses as the cost of protection against a market drop.

Cardano, Chainlink, and Avalanche have shown activity, but many traders are shifting focus to Remittix (RTX) as the best crypto to buy now. Cardano price prediction shows ADA facing bearish patterns and consolidation. Chainlink is forming a triangle breakout setup, hinting at a potential $100 target. AVAX is seeing high DeFi activity but continues to fluctuate around $28. Amid this, Remittix is gaining traction for its strong fundamentals, real-world utility, and CertiK verification. Cardano Price Prediction Signals Bearish Pressure The Cardano price is currently $0.786. ADA has formed a death cross on the four-hour chart, signaling potential downward momentum. The asset dropped from $0.888 to $0.788 early this week, with a low of $0.754 on Thursday. Over $855 million in crypto liquidations occurred in the last 24 hours. This is mostly from long positions. Currently, the short-term resistance is near $0.86, with support at $0.735. The upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade promises a 30‚Äì55x throughput increase, which could improve Cardano‚Äôs long-term prospects and support future gains. Chainlink Price Update: Triangle Setup Forms Chainlink is trading at $21.04, with LINK consolidating in a triangle pattern, with the upper line acting as resistance and the lower line as support. Analyst Ali Martinez notes that a rebound from $16, the 0.5 Fibonacci level, could trigger a breakout toward a $100 target. LINK‚Äôs trend shows consolidation, but long-term accumulation by whales suggests demand remains strong. Traders are monitoring the triangle for signals of breakout or breakdown, as volatility could increase in the short term. Avalanche Price Forecast and DeFi Growth AVAX is currently $28 despite a recent drop of 18% in the past week. Avalanche‚Äôs DEX activity hit $31 billion in September 2025. Institutional support, including AgriFORCE and AVAX One, adds confidence in network growth. Weekly trading volumes are strong, reaching $4.2 billion, showing more active retail and institutional participation. However, price swings highlight the volatility of crypto, even with high DeFi activity. Investors should track liquidity, support zones, and network adoption for potential AVAX gains. Why Remittix Is The Best Crypto To Buy Now While other altcoins fluctuate, Remittix (RTX) is steadily attracting attention. The token has raised over $26.7 million, sold over 672 million tokens, and is currently priced at $0.1130. CertiK has verified the project, ranking it #1 for Pre-Launch Tokens. The wallet beta is live, allowing early users to test features ahead of broader adoption. With real-world PayFi applications, Remittix is positioned as a practical investment beyond speculative hype. Investors are seeing Remittix as a safer, high-potential altcoin to buy this quarter: Officially ranked #1 on CertiK for Pre-Launch Tokens. The Wallet beta is now live, enabling early community testing. Over $26.7 million raised through token sales. 672 million tokens sold, reflecting strong market interest. Built for cross-border crypto-to-fiat payments with real utility. Conclusion: Remittix Takes The Lead While Cardano, Chainlink, and AVAX show potential, there are still volatility and technical challenges. XRP and other speculative tokens continue to face swings. Remittix, however, combines a solid roadmap, CertiK verification, a live wallet beta, and real-world use cases. With over 672 million tokens sold, $26.7 million raised, and a price of $0.1130, Remittix is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy now. Q3 2025 may see new investors prioritizing RTX for both stability and high potential upside.

All major averages barely moved last week, even after President Donald Trump announced fresh tariffs late Thursday, but investors now face a week loaded with events that carry much heavier risks. Tuesday is the official end of Q3, a period that saw the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq hit all-time highs. At the same time, Washington is running out of time to avoid a shutdown, with the government set to close on Wednesday afternoon unless a funding deal is struck. Congress struggles while jobs data hangs in balance Economists on Wall Street expect 43,000 new non-farm payroll jobs in September and unemployment steady at 4.3%. Oxford Economics predicts a stronger number, saying the economy likely added 85,000 jobs in September, which ‚Äúshould reassure the Federal Reserve that the labor market isn‚Äôt deteriorating, allowing the central bank to keep policy on hold at its October meeting,‚Äù according to them. The risk of withheld data has raised concerns at the Fed. Last week, Lisa Cook, a sitting Fed governor, continued her legal fight against the Trump administration‚Äôs attempt to remove her from the board over allegations tied to 2021 mortgage fraud. Her legal team urged the Supreme Court to reject the effort, and she was backed in an amicus brief filed by former Fed chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen. The shutdown also raises the threat of real job losses. Oxford Economics noted that in a typical shutdown, about 40% of federal workers are furloughed with back pay restored afterward. This time the White House has signaled agencies to prepare for layoffs, not furloughs. Economic calendar and Wall Street expectations brings tension to the trading floor The market will also react to a stacked calendar of economic releases. Monday brings Dallas Fed manufacturing activity data. On Tuesday, we will be awaiting the FHFA house price index for July, the MNI Chicago PMI for September, JOLTS job openings for August, Conference Board consumer confidence for September, and Dallas Fed services activity. Wednesday features MBA mortgage applications, ADP private payrolls, S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, ISM manufacturing PMI, construction spending for August, and Wards total vehicle sales for September. Thursday will include Challenger job cuts for September, initial jobless claims for the week ending Sept. 27, factory orders for August, and the final durable goods orders reading. Friday, if not derailed by the shutdown, will see the nonfarm payrolls report, unemployment rate, average hourly earnings month-on-month and year-on-year, the S&P Global US services PMI final reading, and the ISM services index. Earnings are thin, with Carnival Corporation, Jefferies, Vail Resorts, and Diginex reporting Monday, Paychex and Lamb Weston reporting Tuesday, and Nike reporting Wednesday, which makes it the most notable corporate release of the week. Thursday and Friday bring no significant earnings updates, as major banks won‚Äôt begin Q3 earnings until mid-October, meaning the market must ride through political and economic turbulence without new corporate anchors. Despite the uncertainty, the S&P 500 finished Friday‚Äôs session above 6,600. Investors have not forgotten the shock of Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù announcements earlier this year. Losses tied to that moment were wiped out in a month. Meanwhile, volatility has collapsed since, with the VIX falling from above 50 in April to the mid-teens on Friday. Since July 1, it has traded above 20 only once, as Cryptopolitan just reported . After rebounding in May, the S&P 500 climbed back to record levels in an orderly fashion. Plus hedge funds use them as well, especially for short-term trading, according to Robert Harlow, associate head of global multi-asset research at T.

Even as Bitcoin cools off below $110,000, meme tokens like DOGE continue to spark debate, with some analysts suggesting that a rebound in market sentiment could still pave the way for another run at its all-time highs. But in parallel, new contenders like Layer Brett (LBRETT) are gathering momentum ‚Äî and some argue the upside there could dwarf even the best case for Dogecoin. Dogecoin price prediction for 2025 This classic meme coin remains one of the most widely recognized assets in crypto. The most optimistic Dogecoin price prediction scenarios suggest DOGE could retest $0.75 in 2025 if Bitcoin and Ethereum continue their uptrend. With its global brand recognition and grassroots following, some say DOGE still has room to capture speculative energy in a bullish environment. Back in 2021, DOGE became the face of the meme coin phenomenon, skyrocketing thousands of percent in just months. But repeating that level of growth is far harder now. Its massive market cap and supply mean that while doubling or tripling is realistic in a bull market, the parabolic runs of old look out of reach. This makes the most ambitious Dogecoin price prediction feel modest compared to what smaller-cap tokens can achieve. The limits of DOGE hype Analysts also highlight that while DOGE is capable of sharp rallies, its massive supply puts a cap on growth. For holders chasing 10x or higher multiples, the reality is that DOGE may no longer deliver the outsized returns it once did. Even the rosiest outlooks for 2025 frame a possible doubling or tripling, not the 100x gains that once made headlines. That‚Äôs why attention is shifting toward new presale tokens where upside is uncapped. Meme momentum still drives crypto, but projects with fresh utility and smaller market caps are drawing interest from investors who want to replicate the wild wins of earlier cycles. Layer Brett builds momentum Enter Layer Brett (LBRETT) ‚Äî a meme coin with Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure beneath the surface. Priced at just $0.0058 per LBRETT in presale, it has already raised over $4 million. At the time of writing, staking rewards sit around 626% APY, though these reduce quickly as more wallets lock in. This creates a strong incentive for early participation, since later buyers will see lower yields once the pool expands. Beyond the presale numbers, Layer Brett has a packed roadmap. Features include NFT drops, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging, all designed to keep the ecosystem active long after launch. The process of buying into LBRETT is simple ‚Äî connect a wallet and purchase with ETH or USDT ‚Äî making access easy for newcomers and veterans alike. Community traction has added fuel. Telegram and X groups hover near 10k members, TikTok has pushed past 25k followers, and YouTube reviews are building momentum. A teased $1 million giveaway is also on the way, which could bring even more visibility and early adoption. The best-case scenario For DOGE, the best case in 2025 likely means regaining relevance in the broader bull run ‚Äî perhaps returning to highs near $0.75 if everything breaks right. For Layer Brett, the opportunity looks far larger. With staking rewards still in the hundreds of percent, a presale price below one cent and Layer 2 utility that sets it apart from typical memes, LBRETT‚Äôs path to 50x or more appears far more achievable. Don‚Äôt wait for DOGE to recover ‚Äî LBRETT offers real upside right now.

While the immediate outlook remains neutral and range-bound, market participants are closely watching whether XRP can maintain its footing or build momentum toward the next bullish leg. The $2.60 level, marked by the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), stands out as the most important line of defense. Historically, the 200-day EMA has acted as a long-term trend indicator, separating bullish from bearish phases. As long as XRP remains above this level, the broader uptrend stays intact. A decisive break below, however, could invite selling pressure and open the door for a deeper pullback toward $2.40. On the flip side, resistance between $2.95 and $3.08 has become the key battleground for buyers and sellers. This zone has repeatedly capped upside attempts, making it the primary hurdle for a confirmed breakout. A clean push above $3.08 would not only break the current consolidation range but could also reignite bullish sentiment, potentially paving the way for a move toward higher targets. At present, XRP‚Äôs neutral stance reflects a market in waiting mode. Traders appear cautious, weighing the risks of a breakdown against the potential of a breakout. Short-term holders may look to trade in the range between $2.60 and $3.00, while long-term investors are likely more focused on whether the 200-day EMA holds strong support. Therefore, XRP‚Äôs stability above $2.60‚Äì$2.74 is keeping bullish hopes alive, but the path forward hinges on its ability to defend the 200-day EMA and eventually clear resistance near $3. Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD Powers Africa‚Äôs $329B Remittance Market With Faster, Cheaper Transfers According to top market analyst X Finance Bull, Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD stablecoin is rapidly emerging as a transformative force in Africa‚Äôs $329 billion remittance market. Designed to facilitate fast, low-cost transactions, RLUSD is positioning itself as a modern alternative to traditional cross-border systems like SWIFT, which have long been criticized for their slow settlement times and high fees. Africa, one of the largest remittance corridors globally, relies heavily on inflows from migrant workers sending money back home. However, these payments often face bottlenecks, with fees sometimes exceeding 8% of the total amount sent. For families depending on remittances for essentials like education, healthcare, and food, the cost burden is significant. RLUSD directly addresses this pain point by enabling near-instant transfers at a fraction of the cost, offering much-needed relief to millions of households. Beyond individual remittances, RLUSD is also driving efficiency in cross-border trade across the continent. Africa‚Äôs fragmented banking infrastructure and reliance on U.S. dollar settlements have historically slowed commerce between nations. By offering a stable, blockchain-based settlement layer, RLUSD reduces friction and speeds up transactions between businesses, merchants, and financial institutions. This efficiency boost could be a catalyst for increased intra-African trade, aligning with the goals of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). One of the most disruptive aspects of RLUSD is its potential to replace SWIFT rails for African corridors. SWIFT has served as the backbone of international finance for decades, but its outdated messaging system is often slow, opaque, and expensive. RLUSD leverages Ripple‚Äôs blockchain infrastructure to deliver real-time settlement with transparency and security, a leap forward compared to the multi-day processes SWIFT relies on. According to X Finance Bull, RLUSD‚Äôs adoption also reflects a broader trend of emerging markets leapfrogging outdated financial systems in favor of blockchain-based solutions. Much like how mobile money revolutionized payments in Africa, RLUSD could redefine remittances and cross-border commerce by providing speed, cost-efficiency, and reliability. Conclusion As the remittance market continues to grow, RLUSD‚Äôs role may expand well beyond personal payments. From facilitating trade settlements to enabling new financial products, its integration into Africa‚Äôs financial ecosystem highlights the region‚Äôs openness to innovation. Meanwhile, XRP‚Äôs current consolidation paints a picture of balance between cautious buyers and watchful sellers. The 200-day EMA at $2.60 remains the pivotal level to defend, while resistance near $3.00 stands as the gateway to renewed bullish momentum.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-28 19:49:23

Bitcoin Investor Shares A Bold Prediction According to his post on X, the repeated slogan arrived as Bitcoin and Ethereum were under selling pressure, and it drew quick attention from traders and analysts alike. Trump‚Äôs Crypto Footprint Based on reports, Eric Trump‚Äôs comments come as the Trump family‚Äôs business moves into the crypto sector in a bigger way. He and his brother backed American Bitcoin, and their stake in that company swelled to about $1.5 billion after the firm‚Äôs recent market action. American Bitcoin‚Äôs public moves and partnerships have pushed the family further into mining and accumulation strategies, which makes Eric‚Äôs calls more than casual commentary. Buy the dips! ‚Äî Eric Trump (@EricTrump) September 26, 2025 Market players noticed the timing. Bitcoin has been trading lower this week, with prices near $109,500, a slide of more than 6% over seven days, while Ethereum hovered around $4,020, down by about 8% in roughly the same span. Those drops, small by some historical standards but sharp enough to stir nerves, set the scene for the ‚Äúbuy the dips‚Äù rallying cry. Market Moves And Reactions Reaction to Eric Trump‚Äôs message was mixed. Some retail traders echoed the sentiment, using it as a buy signal. Others pushed back. Analysts warned that public endorsements often coincide with heightened short-term volatility. Reports flagged a pattern: when high-profile figures urge buying at perceived lows, price swings can follow before any sustained recovery. There is precedent that tempers enthusiasm. After one prior push by Mr. Trump to increase exposure to Ethereum earlier this year, ETH fell about 35% in the months that followed before later staging a rally. Experts Urge Caution Beyond price moves, some observers pointed out possible conflicts of interest. Reports have tied Eric Trump to advisory roles at Metaplanet and to business ventures that stand to benefit if demand for listed crypto-related stocks rises.

Meanwhile, market veterans said the basic math matters more than a slogan. Macro forces, liquidity flows, and institutional positioning usually drive sustained trends. Social posts can spark quick buying or selling. They rarely change the underlying balance of supply and demand by themselves. Short-term traders often act on sentiment. Long-term holders watch fundamentals. Both groups felt the echo of this latest push.

After months of Bitcoin dominance, capital is now shifting aggressively into altcoins, marking the start of what traders call ‚Äúaltcoin season.‚Äù In this phase, smaller-cap projects tend to outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum, often delivering returns that can multiply portfolios several times over. Retail investors are moving quickly, trying to establish positions before the next leg up. Unlike past rallies where hype often came late, this cycle is seeing early and strategic positioning into promising projects. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most talked-about assets, with analysts expecting it to be one of the standout performers of this altcoin season thanks to its rapid growth and accelerating community momentum. Altcoin Season Takes Center Stage One of the clearest signs of a transition to altcoin season is the decline in Bitcoin‚Äôs market dominance. As capital flows from Bitcoin into mid-cap and small-cap coins, investors are chasing higher returns outside the established giants. This pattern is familiar, but in 2025 the shift is happening more swiftly than in previous years. While Bitcoin still trades above $110,000 and holds its place as the market leader, the pace at which altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche have attracted liquidity shows that traders are eager to diversify. The rising number of new projects gaining traction underscores the market‚Äôs hunger for fresh narratives. Why This Bull Market Stands Out Unlike the 2017 cycle dominated by ICO mania or the 2021 rally powered by meme coins and DeFi, the current bull market is unfolding against a backdrop of growing institutional adoption. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), clearer regulatory frameworks, and corporate treasury allocations have provided a more solid foundation for Bitcoin and Ethereum. This foundation gives investors confidence to take bigger bets on altcoins, believing the broader market is less fragile than in past years. Retail participants are no longer just chasing memes ‚Äì they are seeking projects with sustainable ecosystems and clear roadmaps, creating a more balanced mix of speculation and utility. A Rising Star Gains Traction Within this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly carved out a unique position. Its presale has smashed through multiple funding milestones in record time, signaling a surge of demand from both retail buyers and whales. Analysts predict it could be one of the best-performing altcoins during this bull cycle, thanks to its mix of limited supply, community-driven growth, and expanding ecosystem. During altcoin season, projects that can generate hype while offering real long-term potential tend to dominate. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to check both boxes, making it one of the most anticipated launches of 2025. If the current trajectory continues, investors who entered early could see remarkable upside as listings and partnerships drive further adoption. Retail Investors Positioning Early Another major difference in this bull market is how quickly retail traders are positioning themselves. In the past, many joined late in the cycle, often after prices had already skyrocketed. This time, access to presales, community-driven Telegram groups, and crypto media coverage has allowed everyday investors to secure early entry points. The presence of projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which are openly highlighting their milestones, adds to the sense of urgency. Retail participants are treating this altcoin season as an opportunity not just to speculate but to establish long-term positions before institutional players begin to dominate the later stages of the rally. Outlook for the Months Ahead If history is any guide, altcoin season typically lasts several months, often culminating in parabolic moves across dozens of smaller assets. The challenge for investors is identifying which projects can sustain their growth beyond the hype. Bitcoin‚Äôs stability above $110,000 provides a strong foundation, but it is altcoins that will likely dictate the pace of retail-driven gains in the near term. Analysts believe that as liquidity flows into riskier bets, the market will produce both extraordinary winners and sharp corrections. Risk management and strategic profit-taking will remain crucial even as opportunities for outsized returns multiply. Conclusion The 2025 bull market is proving to be unlike those that came before it. Institutional adoption provides a safety net, but altcoins are where the real excitement lies as retail traders rush to secure early positions. MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as one of the top contenders in this phase, with momentum suggesting it could outperform much of the market during altcoin season.

The asset began building momentum in November 2024 and experienced an explosive move to $3.39 in January, marking its highest price in years. Saul (@uptownsaul), a crypto enthusiast active on X, shared a three-month XRP chart, highlighting this extended positive trend, and showing where XRP could go in the coming months. The 3M XRP chart pic.twitter.com/Mf31CA79aF ‚Äî Saul (@uptownsaul) September 28, 2025 A Closer Look at the Chart The chart shows a consistent upward trajectory over the last several months, culminating in a strong push above earlier resistance zones. XRP has only posted positive 3-month candles in 2025. This rise pushed it to a new all-time high of $3.65 in July, elating the community about where it could go next. XRP also outperformed Ethereum for five consecutive months earlier in the year, and has shown remarkable strength throughout the year. Saul highlighted several horizontal price levels on the chart, indicating the potential milestones XRP might aim for if the current momentum persists. Where is XRP Going Next? At the time of Saul‚Äôs post, the chart displayed XRP at approximately $2.79. The digital asset has experienced some turbulence recently, as it lost the crucial $3 support level. However, like many market participants, Saul predicts that the asset will continue its upward trajectory. With XRP currently heading toward the $3 level, Saul has outlined $3.40 as the next target. Subsequent price targets include $12.8, $27.2, $115.2, and a final target of $244.8. While Saul did not publish a full analysis alongside the image, the chart suggested an expectation of continued gains if XRP sustains its present trend.

In 2025, the asset benefited from renewed trading volume as institutional interest, as this year saw the end of the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This year also saw increased utility discussions within the payments space, particularly regarding cross-border transaction efficiency and real-world asset tokenization . These initiatives are advancing rapidly, and when combined with the return of institutional interest, XRP could reach Saul‚Äôs triple-digit targets sooner than many market participants anticipate.
