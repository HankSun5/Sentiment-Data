The renowned market strategist appeared on CNBC's “The Exchange” program to assess the recent sharp declines in cryptocurrency markets. Lee stated that the market crashes were caused by a technical chain reaction that occurred around October 10th and led to the liquidation of approximately 2 million accounts. According to Lee, the crash was sparked by a pricing error on an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange. The price of a stablecoin, which would normally be $1, momentarily dropped to $0.65 due to a lack of liquidity on the exchange. According to Lee, the crash was sparked by a pricing error on an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange. The price of a stablecoin, which would normally be $1, momentarily dropped to $0.65 due to a lack of liquidity on the exchange. The error allegedly occurred on the Binance exchange, and the asset responsible was the USDe stablecoin issued by Ethena Labs. Binance's lack of liquidity in the USDe pair was the spark that set off this chain reaction. Related News: What Does the Future Hold for XRP in the Coming Days? Analysis Company Provides Critical Levels This price deviation triggered the exchange’s Automatic Deleveraging (ADL) mechanism. Lee explained that the system executed trades based on this erroneous internal price, resulting in a chain reaction in which approximately 2 million crypto accounts, including those that had been profitable just minutes before, were liquidated. Tom Lee argued that this incident had a devastating impact on market makers, who act as the crypto ecosystem's “central bank.” He noted that market makers were forced to reduce liquidity to cover the gaps in their balance sheets, saying, “As prices fell, they were forced to sell more. The gradual decline we've seen over the past few weeks reflects this 'crippling' state of market makers.” *This is not investment advice.

While the live price currently sits around $0.4057 , analysts are projecting a massive upward trajectory. Some models suggest ADA could reach anywhere from $1.20 to as high as $2.05 by year-end , rewarding those who have held through the volatility. Adding fuel to this fire is the highly anticipated Midnight launch roadmap , recently revealed by the Cardano founder. The timeline confirms that NIGHT claims and initial market trading will begin on December 8, 2025 , marking a pivotal moment for the network’s privacy-focused partner chain. As the Cardano ecosystem expands into privacy and enterprise solutions, the complexity of managing these diverse assets increases. Investors need a unified tool to navigate this growth, which is exactly why the GeeFi Team built GeeFi . The Command Center for Multichain Finance GeeFi is a high-performance, non-custodial mobile wallet designed to give you absolute sovereignty over your digital wealth. Since development began in 2023 , the priority has been engineering a secure environment for the modern investor. Publicly released in 2024 , the application supports a vast array of major networks, including Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more , ensuring you are never restricted to a single ecosystem as the market evolves. The platform functions as a comprehensive crypto hub. It features essential tools like built-in swaps , cross-chain bridging , and on/off-ramp services that allow for easy movement between fiat and digital currencies. Security is paramount, with integrated AML protocols and WalletConnect support for safe interaction with decentralized applications via the Web3 browser . The app is available now for Android , with an iOS version currently in development. Future-Proofing with the GEE Token The ecosystem is powered by the GEE token , an ERC-20 utility asset with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 . Holding GEE unlocks the full potential of the platform, including benefits within the upcoming HUB, DEX, and GeeFi Card which are currently in development. The tokenomics are designed to be deflationary, creating long-term value retention mechanisms for holders who participate in the ecosystem’s growth. The presale structure is designed to reward early conviction. There are 400 million tokens allocated for the public sale, distributed across 10 phases . The market has responded aggressively to this structure, as over $250,000 was raised in the first 24 hours of its presale launch . Early participants secure the best possible entry, as the token price will see an increment with each new phase. Capitalizing on the Early Window The window to secure GEE at this entry point is narrowing. Investors who act before the presale ends and the token launches on major exchanges position themselves for maximum upside. Token utility includes governance rights, fee reductions, and exclusive crypto card perks. Additionally, the referral program offers a 5% bonus in GEE on every purchase made via your personal link. Don’t let Cardano’s stagnation dictate your financial future, diversify into GeeFi today and start earning immediately.

The recently launched Granite upgrade is a major development, slashing transaction fees by an incredible 99.9%. This enhancement aims to make the blockchain more attractive for high-throughput applications and institutional adoption, reinforcing Avalanche’s focus on scalability and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. This push for technical excellence, however, highlights a fundamental disconnect in the crypto world. While network fees become negligible, the practical ability for a user to spend their AVAX on everyday goods remains a major obstacle. This is the exact usability problem that innovative platforms like GeeFi were designed to solve, bridging the gap between digital asset ownership and real-world commerce. A Tale of Two Worlds: Network Fees vs. Spending Friction The Granite upgrade is a huge step forward for Avalanche, enabling faster processing and dramatically lower costs for developers and users transacting on-chain. Yet, for the average person, this doesn’t change the complex process required to use their crypto in a store. The path from wallet to checkout typically involves sending funds to an exchange, converting them to fiat, and waiting for a bank transfer. This is the friction the GeeFi Team identified as a key barrier to mainstream crypto adoption. Development on their solution began in 2023, with a public launch in 2024 to introduce a platform that makes digital assets as spendable as cash. Their focus is on creating a direct link between your crypto wallet and the global economy. GeeFi: Self-Custody Meets Global Spending GeeFi delivers a powerful combination of a secure non-custodial wallet and the globally recognized GeeFi Card . With a non-custodial wallet, you retain complete control over your private keys and your funds. This upholds the core principle of self-sovereignty, ensuring your assets are always yours without relying on a third party. The GeeFi Card, powered by the VISA and Mastercard networks, connects directly to this wallet. This integration enables real-time spending at millions of locations worldwide, from online stores to local cafes. There is no need to pre-load a card or convert assets in advance. The entire experience is managed through the GeeFi app, which is live on Android and receives continuous updates, with an iOS version currently in development . An Invitation to Financial Innovation History shows that major technological shifts create valuable opportunities for early supporters who understand the long-term vision. We are at a similar moment in the evolution of digital finance, where projects delivering genuine utility will lead the next wave of growth. The GeeFi presale is an invitation to be part of this transformation. The project has already demonstrated strong market demand, having raised over $250,000 by selling more than 5.3 million tokens . This is more than just a token sale; it’s a chance to support the infrastructure that will make digital assets a practical tool for everyday life. The GEE Token: Your Gateway to Enhanced Utility The GEE token is the utility asset at the heart of the GeeFi ecosystem. By holding and staking GEE, users can access a tiered rewards program offering benefits like cashback on card purchases and reduced transaction fees. The platform also features a high-yield staking option with an APR between 45-55% , rewarding users for their active participation. The public presale for the GEE token is currently active, with a price of $0.05 . This price is scheduled to increase after the first phase of the presale concludes, presenting a time-sensitive opportunity for early participants. To foster community growth, GeeFi also features a referral program that gives you a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through your personal link.

From Tucson to New York, from one-man startups to sprawling corporations, devices that should’ve been retired years ago are still limping along, and it’s dragging down everything from workplace performance to national productivity. According to Reviews.org, the average smartphone in America is now held for 29 months, up from 22 months in 2016. That may not sound dramatic, but when multiplied by millions of consumers and thousands of companies, those extra months spell trouble. According to CNBC, people just aren’t swapping out devices like they used to, and the domino effect is becoming clearer by the year. Heather Mitchell, an American retiree living in Tucson, is one of many Americans stretching the life of their old tech. Her Samsung Galaxy A71 is six years old, and while she admits it’s “a jalopy,” she has no plans to trade it in. “I love Samsung phones, but can not afford a new one right now. A new phone would be a luxury,” Heather said. Aging gadgets, falling productivity, and a costly wait That kind of decision might make sense for someone on a tight budget, but when businesses start doing the same, the cost is much higher. A recent report from the Federal Reserve found that for every extra year companies delay tech upgrades, overall productivity falls by about a third of a percent. Stretch that across the entire economy and it’s a hit worth billions. America still leads when it comes to corporate reinvestment, but the impact is visible globally. If investment patterns in Europe had mirrored the U.S. since 2000, the productivity gap with the U.S. would’ve shrunk by 29% for the U.K., 35% for France, and an astonishing 101% for Germany. But while companies are somewhat faster than households at cycling out old hardware, they’re still not keeping up with the speed of innovation. Cassandra Cummings, who runs New Jersey’s Thomas Instrumentation, said outdated devices are throttling networks. “Older devices were built before 1GB speeds became normal. Now networks have to work around them, which means slowing everything down just to stay compatible,” Cassandra said. She doesn’t deny upgrades are expensive, especially for small businesses or individuals who are barely covering bills. But the alternative, holding on forever, comes with hidden costs. Cassandra says repairable or modular devices could help ease the transition, but “we’ve built a throw-away culture,” and that makes it hard for people to keep up without constantly buying new gear. Steven Athwal, who runs The Big Phone Store in the U.K., says the real issue is what people are expecting from them. “Trying to run modern workloads on ancient tech is a drain,” Steven said . Lagging processors, failing batteries, and outdated software are killing morale and wasting energy. Even worse, the booming repair and resale industry that could fill this gap is still ignored, underfunded, and unregulated in America. Workplaces suffer while employees cling to what’s familiar Jason Kornweiss, who leads advisory services at Diversified, says old devices aren’t just an annoyance, they’re also an operational nightmare. He cited internal workplace studies showing 24% of employees now work overtime due to outdated technology, and 88% feel innovation is stifled by it. Jason pointed to the disconnect between behavior and reality. “People know their tech is holding them back, but they’re still reluctant to trade it in,” he said. Familiarity with aging systems often wins over the hassle of learning a new device. Even when IT shows up with upgrades, employees groan. Slower systems mean more hours lost, less multitasking, and less creativity. Jason believes that “time is the most valuable thing a worker has,” and old devices are consuming too much of it. Najiba Benabess, dean of business at Neumann University, sees a growing problem. She says many small businesses are sinking hours into maintenance and repairs, all while productivity quietly erodes. “Keeping devices longer might look smart,” Najiba said, “but it chips away at our national competitiveness.” And back in Arizona, Heather isn’t planning to buy anything new unless absolutely necessary. “In 26 years, this is only my fifth phone,” she said.

The crypto expert points to a striking precedent from Q4 2016 when XRP dropped to $0.0054. Following this decline, the asset rallied massively beyond $3 in January 2018. The asset rose by 55,455% (554x), a remarkable climb. X Finance Bull believes the current decline is a deliberate shakeout and not a sign of weakness. Are you scared on $XRP price action right now? WATCH THIS! In Q4 2016, $XRP got crushed in a brutal shakeout. Price dropped to just $0.0054, then exploded to $3 in months. That’s a 55,455% gain or a 554x. Insane, right? It’s happening again.

His post began by asking whether investors were concerned about XRP’s recent price movement. He described the sharp decline as the result of market manipulation. He stressed that a similar pattern appeared before XRP’s long rally 8 years ago. His claim rests on the idea that deep pullbacks occur before large expansions. He presents the recent move as a setup, not a signal of exhaustion. New Activity Builds Behind XRP He also pointed to new activity around the asset. He cited the arrival of spot ETFs . He noted Ripple’s push into cross-border payments and early tokenization pilots. He claims that companies and countries now consider XRP for future reserves. Additionally, he mentioned a shift in U.S. policy toward digital assets. He included a reference to President Donald Trump’s position on crypto. He stated that Ripple’s CEO and legal counsel are in talks with the president , seeing this as confirmation of rising support.

He stated that “trillions are lining up behind XRP.” He framed this as a critical moment for holders. He asserted that a major expansion phase is just ahead. He based this view on rising infrastructure, institutional access, and political momentum. He argued that the current price zone creates opportunity. His position centers on conviction during high volatility. A Call for Resolution The post closed with a call for resolution. He wrote, “I know what I hold.” He compared the present chart structure with earlier cycles. He claimed that investors should treat the current period as an opportunity for long-term positioning . He urged market participants to stay focused on utility growth and rising institutional access.

According to trading data from Upbit and Bithumb, the country's two largest exchanges, many altcoins have seen notable jumps in volume. Korean investor interest is particularly strong in highly liquid assets like XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. When Upbit and Bithumb's 24-hour trading volumes were combined, the most prominent altcoins were listed as follows: XRP — $448 million Bitcoin — $354 million Tether (USDT) — $261 million Ethereum (ETH) — $178 million 0G — $124 million Intuition (TRUST) — $115 million Creditcoin (CTC) — $102 million Solana (SOL) — $100 million Toshi (TOSHI) — $60 million Momentum (MMT) — $53 million Dogecoin (DOGE) — $52 million Related News: Watch Out: Massive Token Unlocks Coming in 22 Altcoins Next Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Upbit is once again at the center of the volume boom in South Korea. The exchange alone reached $336 million in XRP and $268 million in Bitcoin trading volume. On the Bithumb side, Tether led the way with $136 million in volume, suggesting increased demand for stablecoins due to arbitrage and KRW migrations. The data also suggests that local investors aren't solely focused on major coins. On Upbit, volume growth in more niche projects like 0G ($110 million), Intuition ($97 million), and Creditcoin ($80 million) was notable. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin Slips, Solana Surges, and Apeing Claims the Early-Mover Throne",https://timestabloid.com/searching-for-the-best-altcoins-in-panic-season-bitcoin-slips-solana/,"Every crypto cycle delivers chaos first and profits later. The market loves to punish hesitation before rewarding conviction. Panic season is here again. Bitcoin slips below key support zones while traders panic over liquidations. Memes turn serious. Fear makes hands weak and portfolios shaky. Yet history keeps repeating the same lesson. When Bitcoin drops, the best altcoins sneak in and steal the show. Crypto traders have seen this pattern so many times that even mosquitoes are laughing at late buyers. The people who win are not the ones who wait for a perfect moment. They are the fast movers. They buy when others freeze. They chase opportunity before the world wakes up. That is exactly what is happening now. Bitcoin is cooling, but two breakout stories are heating the stage: Solana is absorbing institutional liquidity like a sponge at a soda spill, and Apeing is emerging with one of the fastest-growing whitelist demands of the year. Analysts say crypto responds to confidence. But degens know the truth. Crypto responds to energy, memes, and timing. That is why $APEING and Solana are showing strength even while the biggest markets tremble. The Best Altcoins are beginning their run, and those who hesitate might become the “I could have been rich” club once again. Apeing Claims the Early-Mover Throne Among Best Altcoins Apeing takes a completely different approach. It is not trying to be safe. It is not trying to be serious. It is unapologetically degen. Built for those who act fast when others freeze, Apeing is already gaining recognition as one of the Best Altcoins for pure upside potential. Its entire culture rewards aggression, instinct, and FOMO-master energy. Early access momentum around Apeing is growing rapidly. Traders are lining up because they know what happens when communities move early together. That is how power shifts. The whitelist gives first-in positioning at the lowest possible entry pricing, long before the hype machine turns the token into a rocket. Early participants are securing spots cheaper than everyone else will ever see again. Once the public frenzy begins, entries climb, and the moon tickets get expensive fast. Stage 1 for $APEING is expected to open at $0.0001, while projections suggest a $0.001 listing zone. That means a baseline 10x before the real chaos even starts. When the staking, hype, and social explosion hit together, the early buyers are looking at 10,000%+ potential returns. That does not mean guaranteed profit. It means those who choose to move early have math on their side. Allocation remains limited, and hesitation is the enemy in a fast-moving meme ecosystem. This is why so many investors already label Apeing as one of the Best Altcoins going into the next bull cycle. Early Access for Those Who Move First Crypto never rewards hesitation. Traders overthink. They refresh charts. They panic at every dip. Meanwhile, decisive players secure positions and lock in the ground floor entries the world will envy later. The Apeing whitelist is a chance to act before headlines take over. The instinctual degens know exactly what that means. Apeing culture is simple. Act fast. Trust your gut. Do not let hesitation rob opportunity. The Best Altcoins are not about waiting. They are about movement. That is why the ones who APE have historically earned the loudest celebrations when the market wakes up. Bitcoin Correction Creates a Vacuum Hungry Coins Will Fill Soon Bitcoin continues to struggle as Federal Reserve uncertainty shakes markets. When the world’s largest cryptocurrency bleeds, investors rush to hedge risk or rotate into faster opportunities. Data from multiple market trackers shows a clear rise in liquidation levels. Futures traders who used high leverage are now crying into their keyboards after getting wiped out in seconds. But this is crypto. Nothing stays down forever. Market cycles repeat like a viral meme. Bitcoin leads. It pumps. Everyone gets hyped. Then correction hits. The weak hands flee, and the strong hands begin looking for the Best Altcoins with more upside potential. This rotation is normal. Veteran traders see it as a discount season. Analysts from leading crypto research platforms note that early altcoin rotation historically precedes the next wave of bullish growth. Solana Surges While Bitcoin Sleeps, and Institutions Know Why Solana does not wait politely for Bitcoin to recover. It acts. It wins on speed and adoption. The network traffic remains packed with active users, NFTs, liquid staking, and booming meme coins. But what is turning Solana into one of the Best Altcoins right now is not just the community, it is the big money flooding in. Traditional finance sees Solana as a rare combination of scalability and user growth. As major ETFs tracking Solana gain exposure and liquidity, institutions with billions in dry powder finally have a doorway into the chain. When big bags move, charts stop joking and start sprinting. Solana’s role in payments, gaming, and decentralized exchanges keeps expanding, creating a path that is far from a meme. Analysts on social platforms keep highlighting Solana as one of the Best Altcoins with long runway ahead. Conclusion Crypto markets test patience before they reward courage. Bitcoin slipping does not mean doom. It means the spotlight is shifting. The Best Altcoins rise during panic because early movers position for maximum upside. Solana continues to gain institutional adoption and strong technical growth. Apeing accelerates retail energy with a lightning-fast whitelist and unmatched entry pricing. Winners in crypto are not the ones who wait. They are the ones who decide before the rest of the world thinks it is safe. Right now, the Best Altcoins are not asking for permission. They are already preparing for the next breakout chapter. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apeing Website Telegram: Join the Apeing Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apeing ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions About the Best Altcoins What are the key factors that make a crypto project one of the Best Altcoins? Projects considered the Best Altcoins usually show strong demand, high trading volume, active communities, and clear real-world or ecosystem utility. Investors also look for catalysts such as exchange listings, institutional support, or early-access opportunities that can accelerate market growth. Why is Apeing seen as a major contender among the Best Altcoins right now? Apeing stands out because its whitelist gives early movers access at the lowest pricing before larger demand pushes the chart higher. The project embraces fast-paced meme culture and rewards instinctive decision-makers, making $APEING attractive to traders seeking major upside potential during the next crypto rotation. Is Bitcoin still relevant if traders are focused on the Best Altcoins? Yes. Bitcoin remains the foundation of the crypto market. However, when Bitcoin consolidates or dips, money often rotates into high-energy altcoins with greater room to grow. The Best Altcoins tend to outperform during these transition phases when investors chase faster returns. What makes Solana one of the Best Altcoins in this market cycle? Solana continues to gain adoption from institutions, developers, and users thanks to fast scaling, low fees, and its expanding NFT and DeFi ecosystem. ETF exposure and high network activity suggest long-term confidence, positioning Solana as a top growth asset in the Best Altcoins category. Summary This editorial analyzes the shift in crypto market leadership during Bitcoin weakness. Falling prices and rising fear lead investors toward faster-growing opportunities also known as the Best Altcoins. The article highlights Solana’s institutional growth and Apeing’s early-access momentum as the main narratives shaping current rotation. Solana benefits from adoption, scalability, and ETF expansion. Apeing delivers high-risk, high-reward culture and ultra-low whitelist entry pricing that can produce large returns if market conditions turn bullish. The analysis stresses that decisive timing, not hesitation, drives success in crypto cycles. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

At just $0.035 to enter, MUTM is making headlines fast due to its quickly accelerating presale success and its genuine DeFi use case, as well as its growth development already being established to rival and potentially outperform many big altcoins at this point and beyond. In contrast, Solana (SOL) is struggling to maintain any serious momentum at all. The market favors new crypto development at any cost now much higher than before. MUTM is drawing attention as the top crypto that could redefine early-stage DeFi opportunities this cycle. Solana Faces Serious Breakdown Risk as Price Hangs on to Last Support Levels Solana (SOL) is on the brink of a major technical breakdown and may quickly enter the $85 to $55 region if it fails to show signs of bouncing back beyond key support at $130. Until Solana shows significant signs of bouncing back, selling pressure is expected to continue. As market players continue to monitor this development and begin to hunt for new crypto projects displaying initial growth momentum to join or invest in, opportunities presented by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have already presented explosive growth rates at the presale stage. MUTM is now being seen as a top crypto for investors seeking early adoption in DeFi. MUTM Presale: Taking Advantage of the Movement Before Phase 7 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is causing significant market hype as it is nearing the end of Phase 6 for its presale. The current price of its tokens is $0.035, marking a 250% jump from its initial price at Phase 1. It is notable that it has received contributions of over 18,140 individuals worth $18.9 million. As the project embarks on Phase 7, the cost will increase to $0.04, getting closer to the expected market listing price of $0.06. This kind of growth makes MUTM one of the most promising top crypto options for investors to invest in for its high returns within the DeFi market at such an early stage. Phase 2 Roadmap: Showcase Product Maturity As Phase 6 is soon to be completed, Mutuum Finance is moving into Phase 2 of its development roadmap, which involves product validation and readiness for operational success. This development phase completes the smart contract infrastructure and also finishes the development of the DApp user interface. The activation of V1 Protocol is expected to constitute the first operational test for this platform to demonstrate its primary functionality. Phase 2 bridges the gap between initial investors and usability to further establish MUTM as having strong fundamentals for being a cryptocurrency and having utility use cases. To encourage active participation in the program, Mutuum Finance is launching a reward dashboard displaying the top 50 token holders. Users can track their rankings in real-time and adjust their position relative to others to create a sense of competition and engagement. This reward system not only inspires engagement but also inspires loyalty for being rewarded for being part of MUTM’s community-driven growth and now being cemented as the new crypto holding real DeFi utility and value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Poised to Outperform Solana This Cycle Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most promising DeFi projects around at the moment, having succeeded in presale Phase 6 with over 95% of its sales completed among 18,140 investors to raise more than $18.9 million at just $0.035 per token. This is expected to go higher to $0.04 in presale Phase 7 before being listed at $0.06 on markets. With real utility and fast adoption during its initial stages because of its complete DeFi ecosystem offering lending and borrowing services, interest-bearing mtTokens, and even Gamification features for its leaderboard, MUTM is one top crypto you should lock down for potentially high percentage returns before the market’s next boom.

Traders warn that recent moves by long-term holders are changing how the market reacts to stress. Liquidity has thinned, and that makes price swings larger than usual. Related Reading: Dogecoin Goes Wall Street: Grayscale Confirms Nov. 24 ETF Launch Schiff Issues A Stark Warning According to gold investor Peter Schiff, Bitcoin is “finally having its IPO moment.” He said that when veteran holders turn into sellers, supply at the top of the market rises and future selloffs can become deeper. “This much Bitcoin moving from strong to weak hands not only increases the float, but also means future selloffs will be bigger,” Schiff said on Saturday. His view has been repeated by bearish voices for years, but this time the comment lands against clear on-chain moves and big ETF outflows. Traders note that when confident, long-term holders prune positions near local peaks; when many do it at once, price action often becomes more violent. Some argue that after all these years Bitcoin is finally having its IPO moment now that there’s enough liquidity for the OGs to cash out. I agree, but this much Bitcoin moving from strong to weak hands not only increases the float, but also means future selloffs will be bigger. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 22, 2025 Whale Moves And Major Sales Based on reports, whales and early wallets moved over 400,000 BTC in October, activity linked with large selling pressure. One early investor, Owen Gunden, reportedly liquidated his entire 11,000 BTC stake across October and November. High-profile retail figures also sold: Robert Kiyosaki announced a sale worth roughly $2.25 million, saying he bought when BTC was about $6,000 and sold near $90,000, and that he plans to redeploy proceeds into income businesses. Analysts at Bitfinex point to two key drivers of the recent drop: long-term holder sales and leveraged liquidations in derivatives markets. When margin positions unwind, prices can cascade lower before the market finds support. ETF Flows And Retail Sentiment According to Bloomberg and fund filings, investors pulled nearly $1 billion from Bitcoin ETFs in a single session, the second-largest daily outflow among the group of 12 funds. BlackRock’s IBIT led with $355 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC and Fidelity’s FBTC each saw about $200 million leave. Over the past month, ETF products have recorded roughly $4 billion in net outflows. Citi Research figures cited by market watchers place every $1 billion withdrawn at roughly a 3.4% negative swing in Bitcoin’s price. Still, there was a counter-move: reports show ETFs posted $238 million of inflows yesterday, underlining how flows can reverse quickly.

People watching the market will likely pay close attention to what these veteran holders do, because their actions could decide how steep the next crash might be.

According to NYDIG’s latest analysis, the very factors that powered Bitcoin’s impressive 2024-2025 rally have now reversed direction, creating significant headwinds for the cryptocurrency market. This surprising turn of events highlights how market dynamics can shift rapidly, catching even experienced investors off guard. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Decline? The current Bitcoin price decline stems from multiple factors that previously supported growth. NYDIG’s research reveals that market mechanics, rather than investor sentiment alone, are primarily responsible for the downturn. The firm emphasizes that understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the current market environment effectively. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded five consecutive trading days of net outflows, marking a dramatic reversal from the massive inflows witnessed earlier this year. This shift represents one of the most significant contributors to the ongoing Bitcoin price decline. Meanwhile, stablecoin supply has decreased for the first time in months, indicating reduced liquidity in the crypto ecosystem. How Have Market Fundamentals Shifted? The analysis points to several key changes in market fundamentals: ETF outflows: Consistent selling pressure from institutional products Stablecoin contraction: Reduced market liquidity affecting trading volumes Capital flight: Rapid exit of funds following recent market events Corporate strategy changes: Slowing adoption in treasury management Ethena’s USDe stablecoin has been particularly affected, losing nearly half of its circulating supply since the October 10th liquidation event. This rapid capital exit suggests deeper market concerns beyond simple price corrections. The Bitcoin price decline reflects these fundamental shifts in capital allocation and risk appetite. Why Are Corporate Strategies Losing Momentum? Corporate Digital Asset Treasury strategies have recently lost their earlier momentum, according to NYDIG’s findings. Many companies that previously embraced Bitcoin as a treasury asset are now reconsidering their positions amid market volatility. This hesitation contributes to the current Bitcoin price decline by reducing institutional buying pressure. The reversal in corporate enthusiasm represents a significant change from earlier trends. During the rally, companies actively accumulated Bitcoin as part of their treasury management strategies. Now, with market conditions shifting, many are adopting a more cautious approach, waiting for clearer signals before making additional commitments. What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Price Action? Understanding the current Bitcoin price decline requires recognizing that markets move in cycles. The factors driving today’s downturn were yesterday’s growth engines. This cyclical nature means investors should focus on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price movements. NYDIG’s analysis suggests that market participants should monitor several key indicators: ETF flow data: Watch for reversal in outflow trends Stablecoin supply: Monitor for stabilization or growth Institutional activity: Track corporate adoption patterns Market sentiment: Observe shifts in investor confidence The current Bitcoin price decline, while concerning, represents a natural market correction rather than a fundamental breakdown. Historical patterns show that such corrections often create buying opportunities for patient investors who understand the underlying technology and adoption trends. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to drop to $84,000? The drop resulted from multiple factors including ETF outflows, stablecoin supply contraction, and reduced corporate treasury activity, all contributing to the Bitcoin price decline. How long might this Bitcoin price decline last? Market corrections vary in duration, but historical patterns suggest they typically last until fundamental factors like ETF flows and stablecoin supply stabilize. Should investors be worried about the current Bitcoin price decline? While concerning, this represents a normal market correction. Long-term investors should focus on fundamentals rather than short-term price movements. What signs should I watch for recovery? Key recovery indicators include reversal in ETF outflows, stablecoin supply growth, and renewed corporate treasury activity. How does NYDIG’s analysis differ from other market views? NYDIG emphasizes market dynamics over sentiment, providing data-driven insights into the structural factors behind the Bitcoin price decline. Are stablecoin issues affecting the entire crypto market? Yes, stablecoin supply contractions reduce market liquidity, affecting trading across multiple cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin. Share Your Thoughts Found this analysis helpful?

DeFi Lending Explodes to Record Highs Galaxy Research, in its latest report, attributed the continued expansion of DeFi lending to several factors. This includes the growth of “points farming” and airdrop incentive programs, which encourage users to keep loans open even under market stress. Increasing use of improved collateral assets such as Pendle PTs, which allow users to loop stablecoin strategies at favorable loan-to-value ratios, is also another factor, in addition to rising crypto asset prices, which increase borrowing capacity as collateral values appreciate. The report, however, warned that there is potential for double-counting in the combined CeFi and DeFi lending totals, as some CeFi entities borrow through DeFi protocols before lending those assets to off-chain clients, which makes it difficult to separate on-chain and off-chain exposures. With the increase in DeFi activity, this sector’s lending dominance over CeFi venues climbed to a new all-time high of 62.71% at the end of Q3 2025, up from 59.83% in Q2 2025 and higher than the previous peak of 61.99% in Q4 2024. Meanwhile, the crypto-collateralized portion of collateral debt position (CDP) stablecoin supply fell by $658 million, or 7.4%, quarter-over-quarter, though the report again noted possible double-counting involving CeFi entities that mint CDP stablecoins to fund loans to off-chain borrowers. Overall, total crypto-collateralized lending expanded by $20.46 billion in Q3, reaching a new all-time high of $73.59 billion. By quarter’s end, DeFi lending applications accounted for 55.7% of the market, up 588 basis points from Q2 2025. During the same period, CeFi venues held 33.12%, down 36 basis points, while CDP-backed stablecoin supply represented 11.18%, down 547 basis points. Combined, DeFi lending apps and CDP stablecoins gave on-chain lending venues a 66.88% market share, slightly above the prior all-time high of 66.86% set in Q4 2024. The report also highlighted that DeFi lending remained resilient despite volatile market conditions, as outstanding borrows hit a daily record of $43.82 billion on October 7 before easing by only 11.55% to $38.76 billion by October 31. Key Industry Moves In Q4, however, major players invested in strengthening the lending ecosystem. For instance, in October, Ripple partnered with Immunefi to boost the security of the proposed XRPL Lending Protocol and launched a global “Attackathon” that invited elite Web3 security researchers to stress-test the system ahead of an upcoming validator vote. By November, ecosystem expansion continued as leading stablecoin issuer Tether made a strategic investment in Ledn, a Bitcoin-backed lending platform, in a bid to strengthen self-custody, financial resilience, and broader institutional adoption.

This serious security event has raised important questions about blockchain safety and protocol testing procedures. The Cardano chain split represents one of the most significant security incidents in recent blockchain history, drawing federal attention to cryptocurrency infrastructure vulnerabilities. What Caused the Cardano Chain Split? The Cardano chain split occurred when developers conducted what they described as a security test that went terribly wrong. During routine protocol testing, a transaction exploited a deserialization bug in the system. This technical vulnerability caused the blockchain to temporarily divide into separate chains before developers could implement an emergency patch. Four Cardano developers involved in the incident have publicly acknowledged their careless actions. They explained they were attempting to determine if malicious transactions could be submitted to the network. However, they made a critical error by failing to properly test the transaction on the testnet first. How Did the FBI Get Involved in the Investigation? The Federal Bureau of Investigation entered the picture after the Cardano Foundation formally referred the matter to law enforcement. This move demonstrates the seriousness with which blockchain organizations treat security breaches, even when they appear to be accidental. Key aspects of the FBI investigation include: Examining the technical details of the deserialization bug Reviewing communication and documentation around the security test Assessing potential damage to network integrity Evaluating whether proper protocols were followed What Were the Developers Trying to Accomplish? The developers stated they were conducting legitimate security research to strengthen the Cardano network. Their goal was to identify potential vulnerabilities before malicious actors could exploit them. However, their methodology proved flawed when they used AI assistance to directly block traffic on a Linux server without adequate safeguards. This approach bypassed standard testing procedures and created the perfect conditions for the Cardano chain split to occur. The incident highlights the delicate balance between rigorous security testing and maintaining network stability. What Does This Mean for Cardano’s Future? The Cardano chain split and subsequent FBI investigation have significant implications for the blockchain’s reputation and security protocols. While the developers claim the incident was unintentional, the federal probe underscores the importance of proper testing methodologies in decentralized systems. Positive outcomes from this situation include: Increased awareness of testing protocol importance Potential for improved security standards across the industry Demonstration of accountability through law enforcement involvement Opportunity for enhanced developer training and procedures Conclusion: Lessons from the Cardano Chain Split The FBI investigation into the Cardano chain split serves as a crucial reminder that blockchain security requires meticulous attention to detail and proper testing protocols. While the developers’ intentions may have been positive, their execution created significant network instability. This incident will likely lead to improved security practices across the cryptocurrency industry and demonstrates that even well-intentioned actions can have serious consequences when proper procedures aren’t followed. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly happened during the Cardano chain split? The Cardano chain split occurred when developers testing security protocols accidentally triggered a deserialization bug through a malicious transaction, causing the blockchain to temporarily divide before being merged with an emergency patch. Why is the FBI investigating this incident? The FBI became involved after the Cardano Foundation referred the matter to law enforcement, treating it as a significant security incident that potentially compromised blockchain integrity. Was the Cardano chain split intentional? Developers claim the incident was unintentional and occurred during security testing when they failed to properly check a transaction on the testnet before implementation. How long did the chain split last? The chain division was relatively brief as developers quickly implemented an emergency patch to merge the split chains and restore network stability. What is a deserialization bug? A deserialization bug is a software vulnerability that occurs when data is converted from a storage format back into an object, potentially allowing malicious code execution if not properly handled. Will this affect ADA’s price or network usage? While short-term price fluctuations are possible, the long-term impact depends on how effectively Cardano addresses security concerns and restores investor confidence through improved protocols.

He stated that holders with under 500 XRP are in a group with millions of other accounts. The XRP Rich List in his video confirms this. The table shows over 2.5 million accounts with balances between 20 and 500 XRP, while more than 3.4 million hold 0 to 20 XRP. These ranges grab the bulk of the network and set the stage for the steep decline in account numbers as balances rise. Rietveld called attention to this shift by noting the massive drop in wallets holding 500 to 1,000 XRP. The Rich List shows 252,365 accounts in that range. Balances Rise While Account Counts Shrink The next group tightens further. Balances from 1,000 to 5,000 XRP cover 593,297 accounts. The data then moves through smaller segments, such as 176,631 accounts holding 5,000 to 10,000 XRP and 180,723 accounts in the 10,000 to 25,000 range.

At 25,000 to 50,000 XRP, the number drops to 69,262 accounts. At 50,000 to 75,000 XRP, it reaches 28,174. These numbers demonstrate the narrowing path toward the upper levels of XRP ownership, as retail investors get priced out . The Exact Threshold for the Top 1% Rietveld used the Rich List data to provide insight into the top 1% of token holders. In the video, he stated that to reach the top 1%, a holder must have 50,637 XRP. The table shows that 73,143 accounts hold balances equal to or greater than that amount. This value represents the cutoff that separates the top 1% holders from others. It also highlights how quickly the numbers can move, as larger wallet balances are rising .

This crucial market sentiment indicator just made a surprising move, climbing six points to reach 19. However, before you get too excited, understand that we’re still firmly planted in ‘extreme fear’ territory. Let’s explore what this means for your crypto investments and why this reading matters more than you might think. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as the market’s emotional thermometer. It measures investor sentiment on a scale from 0 to 100, where zero represents extreme fear and 100 indicates extreme greed. Think of it as the pulse of market psychology – when fear dominates, opportunities often emerge for savvy investors. This powerful tool doesn’t rely on guesswork. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculation combines multiple data sources: Market volatility (25% weighting) Trading volume (25% weighting) Social media mentions (15% weighting) Market surveys (15% weighting) Bitcoin’s market dominance (10% weighting) Google search trends (10% weighting) Why Does the Current Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reading Matter? At 19 points, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests that investors remain deeply cautious. This extreme fear reading typically occurs during market bottoms or significant corrections. Historically, buying during extreme fear periods has often rewarded patient investors, though timing remains challenging. Consider this perspective: when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hits extreme lows, it often signals that weak hands have already sold. The remaining holders tend to be more committed, potentially setting the stage for a recovery once sentiment improves. How Can You Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in Your Strategy? The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 19 provides valuable context for your investment decisions. Many experienced traders view extreme fear periods as potential accumulation opportunities. However, always combine this data with fundamental analysis and proper risk management. Remember these key points when interpreting the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Extreme fear often precedes market rebounds Combine sentiment data with technical analysis Never invest more than you can afford to lose Consider dollar-cost averaging during fear periods What’s Next for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? While the six-point improvement in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows some sentiment recovery, we need sustained movement above 25 to exit extreme fear territory. Watch for consistent improvements across all the index components, particularly trading volume and social media sentiment. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has proven remarkably accurate at identifying market extremes. As we monitor its movement from the current 19 reading, remember that sentiment shifts can happen quickly in cryptocurrency markets. Final Thoughts on Today’s Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reading The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 19 tells a clear story: fear continues to dominate, but subtle improvements are emerging. This creates a fascinating environment where cautious optimism meets persistent worry.

These token unlocks represent critical moments for investors and traders alike, potentially creating both opportunities and challenges in the cryptocurrency space. What Are Token Unlocks and Why Do They Matter? Token unlocks occur when previously locked or vested cryptocurrency tokens become available for trading. These events can significantly impact market dynamics by increasing circulating supply. Understanding these scheduled token unlocks helps investors make informed decisions and anticipate potential price volatility. According to data from Tokenomist, this week’s schedule includes multiple substantial token unlocks across various projects. Each unlock represents a different percentage of circulating supply, which determines its potential market impact. Larger percentage unlocks typically create more significant price pressure. This Week’s Major Token Unlocks Schedule The period from November 24-30 features several important token unlocks that market participants should monitor closely. Here’s the complete breakdown of scheduled releases: XPL : 88.89 million tokens ($17.3 million) on November 25 HUMA : 168 million tokens ($4.32 million) on November 26 JUP : 53.47 million tokens ($12.6 million) on November 28 HYPE : 9.92 million tokens ($314 million) on November 29 OP : 31.34 million tokens ($9.42 million) on November 30 ZORA : 166 million tokens ($8.6 million) on November 30 KMNO : 229 million tokens ($11.76 million) on November 30 How Do These Token Unlocks Affect Market Dynamics? The HYPE token unlock stands out with its massive $314 million value, representing 2.66% of circulating supply. Such substantial token unlocks often lead to increased selling pressure as early investors and team members gain access to their tokens. However, the actual market impact depends on various factors including project fundamentals and overall market sentiment. Market analysts closely watch these token unlocks because they can signal both risk and opportunity. While increased supply typically puts downward pressure on prices, well-managed projects often see these events as milestones rather than setbacks. The key is understanding each project’s tokenomics and unlock schedule. What Should Investors Consider During Token Unlock Events? Investors facing these token unlocks should evaluate several factors before making decisions. Consider the percentage of circulating supply being unlocked, the project’s historical performance during previous token unlocks, and current market conditions. Additionally, research whether the project has mechanisms to mitigate unlock impacts. Successful navigation of token unlock periods requires strategic thinking. Some traders use these events as buying opportunities if they believe the market has overreacted. Others prefer to reduce exposure before major token unlocks and re-enter positions once the dust settles. Key Takeaways From This Week’s Token Unlock Schedule This week’s token unlocks present a mixed picture with varying impacts across different projects. The HYPE token unlock dominates in dollar value, while other projects show higher percentage unlocks relative to circulating supply. Investors should approach each token unlock individually rather than applying blanket strategies. Remember that token unlocks are normal events in cryptocurrency project lifecycles. Well-established projects with strong fundamentals often weather these events successfully. The most important factor remains the underlying value and utility of each project beyond the temporary supply increases from token unlocks. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are token unlocks? Token unlocks refer to the release of previously locked or vested cryptocurrency tokens into circulating supply, typically following predetermined schedules outlined in project tokenomics. Why do token unlocks often cause price drops? Token unlocks increase circulating supply, which can create selling pressure if recipients choose to sell their newly accessible tokens, potentially driving prices downward. How can investors prepare for token unlock events? Investors can monitor unlock schedules, research project fundamentals, assess historical price patterns during previous unlocks, and consider adjusting positions accordingly. Are all token unlocks negative for prices? Not necessarily. Some projects experience minimal price impact if the unlock was anticipated or if the project has strong ongoing demand that absorbs the additional supply. What percentage of circulating supply is considered significant for token unlocks? Generally, unlocks representing more than 2-3% of circulating supply warrant close attention, though the specific impact varies by project and market conditions. Where can I find reliable token unlock schedules? Platforms like Tokenomist, CoinMarketCap, and project official documentation provide reliable token unlock schedules and related data.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $85,976.32 on the Binance USDT market, marking a significant downturn that has investors scrambling for answers. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Decline? The sudden Bitcoin price movement below $86,000 represents one of the most notable corrections in recent weeks. Market analysts point to several factors contributing to this downward trend. First, increased regulatory uncertainty has created hesitation among institutional investors. Second, profit-taking from recent gains has accelerated the selling pressure. Moreover, broader market conditions and macroeconomic factors are influencing cryptocurrency valuations across the board. How Significant Is This Bitcoin Price Movement? Understanding the context of this Bitcoin price drop requires looking at key market indicators: Trading volume has increased by 35% during the decline The $86,000 level previously served as strong support Market sentiment has shifted from bullish to cautious Long-term holders appear to be holding positions despite volatility This Bitcoin price movement reflects typical market cycles where periods of rapid growth are often followed by corrections. However, the speed of this particular decline has caught many traders off guard. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors?

The candles are hugging the lower Bollinger Band, signaling persistent sell-side pressure. The RSI sits near oversold levels around the low 30s, showing weakness but not yet a confirmed reversal. MACD remains deeply bearish with widening negative momentum. Unless buyers step in, Sonic may retest the $0.10–$0.095 support zone.

The candles continue to form lower highs and lower lows, while the Bollinger Bands show price hugging the lower band, signaling persistent selling momentum. The MACD remains in negative territory with no bullish crossover in sight, and the Balance of Power stays weak, indicating sellers remain dominant. Unless SONIC reclaims the $0.115–$0.120 resistance zone with strong volume, further downside toward $0.102–$0.098 is likely. A bounce is possible but not yet confirmed.

The Bollinger Bands are widening slightly, suggesting rising volatility as sellers remain in control.

Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.5123 price by 2025 and $3.72 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and assessing personal risk tolerance are essential for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity. Why is Sonic (Prev FTM) down today? Sonic (S) is down today because both the 1-day and 4-hour charts show strong bearish momentum, with price repeatedly rejecting the mid-Bollinger Band and trending along the lower band. The 50-day and 50-period moving averages are sloping downward, confirming sustained selling pressure. RSI remains weak on both charts, sitting near or below 40, signaling lack of buying strength. MACD also shows bearish continuation, with the signal line above the MACD line and red histogram bars growing. Together, these indicators show sellers firmly in control, driving Sonic lower. Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $3.11 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $3.72. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic will not approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $5.53. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good, long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast prices could reach between $3.11 and $3.72, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev. FTM) Sonic Labs announced on Sept 2 that they have secured near-unanimous approval to issue about $150 million in new S tokens to drive U.S. expansion, including launching an ETF, creating a Nasdaq PIPE vehicle, and forming Sonic USA LLC in New York.

Among the top coins, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is attracting dip-buyers thanks to growing ecosystem activity, Solana (SOL) is also maintaining investor confidence because of its robust high-performance network even amidst its volatility fluctuations for now. But among all cryptos that are being hotly pursued at this point is none other than Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is rapidly growing to become one of the most front-running DeFi cryptos at just $0.035 and already deep into Phase 6 of its presale stage. MUTM is already beyond 95% of Phase 6 being sold out because of its explosive market interest even at such an early stage and because analysts are increasingly recommending it as the next crypto to explode very soon. Shiba Inu Shows Early Signs of Strength as Buyers Attempt Breakout At the moment, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is range-bound within a strong accumulation range, where buyers are making efforts to overcome weak momentum. One of the most crucial indicators to focus on is when it cleanly breaches above the median Band’s middle region of Bollinger Bands, marking the very first sign of strength to catalyze its mild reversal. When SHIB Moss handles this crucial move to its favor, its enormous task for now is to breach its 200 EMA to validate its significant reversal. Until this is achieved, traders take their time to carefully observe SHIB’s markets. This is also causing investors to probe Mutuum Finance, making it a top candidate for the best cryptos to buy this cycle. Solana Nears its Most Crucial Support Point for This Month Solana (SOL) is now poised to enter a crucial phase because market indicators begin to suggest growing fatigue among buyers as prices remain perilously close to testing the $126 level of support, which is now the last major hurdle before potentially falling to $95. Traders are awaiting developments cautiously because failure at this point may lead to prices falling significantly, but getting past the 20 EMA may just bring prices back to $183, emphasizing just how critical this point is for SOL at this juncture and beyond. Momentum is also beginning to pick up for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), rising as the next crypto to explode. MUTM Presale: Taking Advantage of Investor Storm Mutuum Finance is moving higher and higher in the DeFi crypto market, as it is soon to reach full capacity for its presale Phase 6. The current price for MUTM tokens is $0.035, marking the last stage before entering presale Phase 7, where prices will go up by 20% to $0.04. This project has already cemented its place as one of the most sought-after initiatives for 2025 and has successfully completed Phase 5 while accumulating $18.9 million from 18,140+ participants. Innovation is at its peak while focusing on sustainability and growth strategies to offer a very good investment option to its investors while being one of the most profitable best cryptos to buy before the next market bull run takes place. A New Stablecoin for DeFi Enhancement One of the most significant events for Mutuum Finance will be launching its fully collateralized and USD-pegged stable coin, which will form the foundation for its lending and borrowing marketplace. This collateralized asset provides security for borrowers and lenders alike. With its integration of a stablecoin into its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance provides low-risk opportunities for returns to all categories of investors, whether retail or institutional investors. Another way through which it facilitates growth within DeFi is by ensuring its introduction of a stablecoin improves market liquidity and enhances scalability as well as security within DeFi. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly being identified as one of the most notable top cryptocurrencies to keep your eye on as it passes through this market downturn with Phase 6 of their presale being over 95% sold out among 18,140+ investors to raise $18.9+ million. At $0.035, opportunities to participate remain before entering Phase 7 at $0.04. Utilizing its fully collateralized stablecoin to facilitate lending and borrowing functions and further integrating itself into DeFi makes MUTM the next crypto to explode with strong potential for early investors.

As an investor, staying informed about key financial events can mean the difference between capitalizing on opportunities and missing crucial market shifts. This week brings several significant economic releases that could impact your portfolio decisions. Why This Week’s Key Financial Events Matter for Your Investments Understanding the schedule of key financial events helps you anticipate market volatility and make informed decisions. This week features critical data releases that could influence Federal Reserve policy and market sentiment. Moreover, with Thanksgiving affecting trading hours, timing becomes even more crucial for active investors. Monday’s Economic Indicators: Setting the Week’s Tone November 25 kicks off with the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) release at 1:30 p.m. UTC. This important inflation gauge measures the average change in selling prices received by domestic producers. Watch for: Core PPI trends excluding food and energy Year-over-year inflation comparisons Market reaction to unexpected deviations These key financial events often trigger immediate market responses, making them essential monitoring points. Tuesday’s Data Deluge: Multiple Market Movers November 26 brings a packed economic calendar with three major releases. At 1:30 p.m. UTC, we get both the preliminary third-quarter GDP figures and initial jobless claims data. Then at 3:00 p.m. UTC, the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data arrives – the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Later at 7:00 p.m. UTC, the Federal Reserve publishes its Beige Book, providing anecdotal information about economic conditions across different regions. This comprehensive snapshot helps investors gauge the Fed’s perspective on the economy. How Do International Events Fit Into Your Strategy? On November 27 at 1:00 a.m. UTC, South Korea announces its interest rate decision. While U.S. markets are closed for Thanksgiving, global events continue to shape international market sentiment. Remember that Asian market movements often influence subsequent U.S. trading sessions. Navigating Holiday Trading Hours and Market Closures Thanksgiving brings important schedule changes that affect these key financial events. U.S. markets close entirely on November 27 and operate on shortened hours November 28. Consider these implications: Reduced liquidity during holiday sessions Potential for increased volatility in thin trading Opportunities in extended hours trading Planning around these market closures helps you manage risk effectively during this week’s key financial events. Actionable Insights for This Week’s Trading Successful navigation of this week’s key financial events requires strategic preparation. Focus on understanding how each data point might influence Federal Reserve policy expectations. Monitor bond market reactions closely, as they often lead equity market movements. Most importantly, maintain perspective – single data points rarely change long-term trends. Frequently Asked Questions Why is the Core PCE data so important? The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge because it excludes volatile food and energy prices, providing a clearer view of underlying inflation trends. How do holiday trading hours affect market behavior? Reduced trading volumes during holidays can amplify price movements and increase volatility, making risk management particularly important during these periods. What should I watch for in the Fed Beige Book? Focus on regional employment trends, wage pressures, and business sentiment indicators, as these often signal broader economic shifts before they appear in hard data. How do international rate decisions impact U.S. markets? Global central bank actions affect currency markets, international capital flows, and risk sentiment, all of which can influence U.S. market performance when trading resumes. Should I adjust my strategy for shortened trading sessions? Consider reducing position sizes, widening stop-loss orders, and avoiding complex strategies that require normal liquidity conditions. Which economic indicator has the biggest market impact this week? The Core PCE data typically generates the most significant market reaction, given its importance to Federal Reserve policy decisions.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in South Africa to restart discussions on a CEPA. The decision marks a significant reversal after a two-year hiatus in trade talks. According to India’s Ministry of External Affairs, the two leaders decided that negotiations will soon be undertaken on a “high-ambition” agreement, which could potentially open markets and create new investment opportunities. Carney accepted Modi’s invitation to visit India early in the new year. Officials from both governments will begin technical discussions ahead of that visit. The two leaders hope to boost bilateral trade to $70 billion by 2030. Last year, trade was around C$31 billion (US$22 billion). Canada seeks stronger access to India’s rapidly growing economy, while India aims for deeper ties with a G7 partner. Diplomatic efforts restore trust after the rift India-Canada relations have been strained since a major diplomatic spat in 2023. Canada had accused India of complicity in the killing of a Sikh separatist leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in its Vancouver area. The Canadian authorities offered what they described as credible evidence that agents linked to the Indian government were involved. India dismissed the accusations as baseless. The standoff led to wide diplomatic expulsions. Both countries recalled their top diplomats and suspended significant diplomatic, trade, and military ties. It would be nearly two years before the relationship thawed much further. The diplomatic channels largely froze along the way. Formal engagement stalled, including talks on trade and economic cooperation . Then came new developments in early 2025 under the leadership of new leaders in Canada. Mark Carney, who later became the Governor of the Bank of Canada, prioritized repairing relations with India. He pledged to start rebuilding trust and getting the government involved again. That shift in tone opened a door for a conversation. Behind the scenes, the two governments started quietly easing tensions. They restored contact among senior diplomatic and security personnel. They met behind closed doors to discuss national security issues, and intelligence exchanges continued. They also reengaged in conversation on trade and investment, showing a greater willingness to negotiate. New opportunities open as talks restart Both countries are now preparing for a range of new opportunities as trade negotiations resume. Following a nearly two-year hiatus, Canada and India see a renewed dialogue as an opportunity to restore commercial relations. Education is one of the country’s strongest bridges, as Canada hosts one of the largest populations of international students from India worldwide. As relationships improve, officials expect to see less friction in visa processes, more research collaborations, and new institutional exchanges. Both governments have committed to supporting further student mobility and academic collaboration. Agriculture is another priority for the two countries. Canada is one of the world’s major producers of pulses, grains, and fertilizers. India is a vast and sprawling country with an increasingly discerning palate. Reopening the talks would allow each side to negotiate reduced tariffs and more predictable rules on imports, along with increased cooperation on food security. The new agenda also places a focus on clean energy and climate technology. Canada is looking to export expertise in hydrogen, carbon capture, and renewable energy. What India really needs are partners who will work to steer the country’s future away from dependence on fossil fuels. This renewed dialogue forms a path for companies in both countries to build green infrastructure. Civil nuclear technology is likely to re-emerge as a key area of cooperation. Canada has been a supplier of nuclear fuel and technology for generations. India is ramping up its civilian nuclear programme to accommodate increasing electricity requirements. With diplomatic tensions easing, nuclear cooperation, once perceived as too sensitive, can move forward with greater confidence, officials said. The mobility of skilled workers is another significant opportunity. Canada struggles with labour gaps in healthcare, transportation, construction, and other areas of the economy; India, a country with a rich pipeline of skilled laborers.

This significant movement raises important questions about the team’s strategy and what it means for the token’s future price action. What Does the 1inch Team Withdraw Mean for Investors? The 1inch team withdraws 20 million 1INCH tokens from one of the world’s largest exchanges over a 14-hour period. According to on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, this substantial transaction occurred at an average price of $0.1856 per token. This move represents one of the largest single withdrawals by the team in recent months. When the 1inch team withdraws tokens from exchange custody, it typically signals several possible scenarios: Long-term holding strategy – Moving tokens to cold storage Ecosystem development – Preparing for upcoming projects Price confidence – Belief in future appreciation Staking preparation – Getting ready for network participation How Does This Impact the 1INCH Token Supply? Following this transaction, the 1inch team’s address now controls an impressive 111 million 1INCH tokens. This massive holding, valued at approximately $20.34 million, represents a significant portion of the circulating supply. The team’s average acquisition price sits at $0.184, very close to current market levels. The timing of when the 1inch team withdraws tokens often provides clues about market sentiment. Currently, 1INCH trades at $0.1829, showing a minor 0.11% decline over the past 24 hours. This stability despite the large withdrawal suggests market confidence in the team’s actions. Why Should Crypto Traders Monitor Team Movements? Smart investors always pay attention when a project team makes substantial moves. The decision by the 1inch team to withdraw millions of dollars worth of tokens from exchange custody demonstrates their commitment to the project’s long-term success. Such actions often precede important developments or indicate strong belief in future price appreciation. Key factors to consider when analyzing team movements include: Transaction size – Larger withdrawals typically carry more significance Timing – Movements during price dips or rallies tell different stories Frequency – Regular patterns versus one-off events Market conditions – How the move relates to broader crypto trends What Can We Learn From This Strategic Move? The recent action where the 1inch team withdraws tokens from Binance provides valuable insights into project management and token economics. With their average purchase price very close to current market levels, the team demonstrates confidence in their project’s fundamentals. This move potentially reduces selling pressure on exchanges, which could support price stability. Moreover, when a project team maintains significant token holdings, it aligns their interests with those of regular investors. The 1inch team’s substantial position ensures they remain motivated to drive the project’s success and increase token value over time. Conclusion: Strategic Positioning for Future Growth The decision by the 1inch team to withdraw $3.71 million in tokens represents a strategic positioning move that signals confidence in their project’s future. This substantial reduction of exchange-held tokens decreases immediate selling pressure while demonstrating the team’s long-term commitment. For investors, this action provides reassurance about the project’s direction and the team’s belief in their token’s value proposition. Frequently Asked Questions Why would the 1inch team withdraw tokens from Binance? The 1inch team likely withdraws tokens for long-term holding, staking, or upcoming ecosystem development. Moving tokens off exchanges reduces immediate selling pressure and demonstrates commitment to the project. How much 1INCH does the team now hold after this withdrawal? Following this transaction, the 1inch team holds 111 million 1INCH tokens worth approximately $20.34 million at current prices. Does this withdrawal affect 1INCH token price? While large withdrawals can influence market sentiment, the immediate price impact appears minimal. The token remains stable, trading at $0.1829 with only a 0.11% decline. What was the average price of the withdrawn tokens? The 1inch team withdrew tokens at an average price of $0.1856 per 1INCH token, very close to their overall average acquisition price of $0.184. Should investors follow team token movements? Yes, monitoring team movements provides valuable insights into project confidence and potential future developments. However, it should be one factor among many in investment decisions. How often does the 1inch team make large withdrawals? While occasional large withdrawals occur, this $3.71 million movement represents one of the more significant recent transactions by the team. Found this analysis helpful?

Their frustration resulted in the need for a “boycott” against the financial services holding company. This backlash followed a news leak that MSCI, which stands for Morgan Stanley Capital International, a global provider of financial market indices, data, and analytics useful for investors globally, intends to eliminate crypto treasury firms from its indexes. MSCI is one of the world’s most influential index providers, and its decisions can drive billions of dollars in institutional investments. Inclusion in an MSCI index often attracts passive investment from mutual funds, ETFs, and large pension funds, while exclusion can trigger automated sell-offs and reduced liquidity for affected companies.” This move was scheduled to take effect starting in January 2026, according to the news. Interestingly, sources noted that JP Morgan earlier shared this information in a research note. Bitcoin advocates urge individuals to boycott against JPMorgan Bitcoin and Strategy’s supporters have called on people to come out in large numbers to protest against JP Morgan . In response to this call, real estate investor and Bitcoin advocate Grant Cardone released a statement claiming that he only managed to withdraw $20 million from JPMorgan Chase & Co. Following this allegation, Cardone vowed to file a lawsuit against the firm over credit card issues. The real estate investor’s statement illustrated the intense nature of the situation surrounding the online boycott. Regarding his claims, Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser urged Cardone to take down JP Morgan and invest his money in a Strategy and BTC. According to reports from reliable sources, if MSCI decides to remove crypto treasury firms from its stock indexes, funds and asset managers may be forced to automatically sell their shares if they need to buy specific types of financial instruments. Analysts warned that such an act could hurt the entire cryptocurrency market. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Strategy was added to the Nasdaq 100 in December 2024. The Nasdaq 100 is a stock market index that includes 100 of the largest and most actively traded non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. This significant milestone enabled Strategy to benefit from the passive capital derived from funds and investors who hold shares in the Nasdaq 100. The uncertainty surrounding the proposed changes in MSCI policy ignites debates in the industry Michael Saylor, the executive chairman and founder of Strategy, had earlier commented on the proposed changes in MSCI policy. Saylor argued that Strategy was not a fund, a trust, or a holding firm but a Bitcoin-backed structured finance company. He explained that, “Funds and trusts simply hold onto assets. Holding companies keep investments. We create, design, issue, and run our operations.” On the other hand, sources noted that the proposed change in MSCI listing regulations would require any treasury company with more than 50% of its balance sheet in cryptocurrency to lose its index status. Afterwards, the companies affected would be presented with two options to choose from. These options include: the firm decides to either lower its crypto holdings to fall below the limit for index inclusion or decide to quit receiving passive capital from market indexes. Following this explanation, analysts expressed their belief that a sudden sell-off by crypto treasury companies, reacting to the proposed MSCI change, could lower digital asset prices.

Recent reports reveal that approximately $1 billion has evaporated from their digital asset portfolio since early September. This massive loss highlights the extreme volatility that even wealthy investors face in the crypto markets. How Did Trump Family Crypto Holdings Lose $1 Billion? The Bloomberg Billionaires Index tracks the dramatic decline in Trump family crypto holdings from $7.7 billion to their current level of $6.7 billion. The losses stem from multiple sources within their cryptocurrency portfolio. The family’s diverse exposure to digital assets meant they felt the market downturn across several investments simultaneously. Three main components contributed to the billion-dollar loss in Trump family crypto holdings: $800 million from Trump Media’s cryptocurrency positions $330 million from American Bitcoin investments $120 million from the TRUMP memecoin decline What Caused the Massive Losses in Trump Family Crypto Holdings? The significant losses in Trump family crypto holdings are directly linked to their exposure through Trump Media. The company held substantial positions in both spot and options contracts for Bitcoin and Crypto.com (CRO). When the broader cryptocurrency market experienced its recent downturn, these leveraged positions amplified their losses considerably. However, the situation isn’t entirely bleak for the Trump family crypto holdings. Bloomberg analysis indicates they maintain several financial cushions that position them better than average investors. Their diversified approach to cryptocurrency investing includes revenue-generating projects that provide ongoing income streams. Is There Hope for Recovery in Trump Family Crypto Holdings? Despite the staggering losses, the Trump family crypto holdings story contains elements of resilience. Their DeFi project, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), guarantees them a portion of token sale revenue. This innovative approach has already generated approximately $900 million in cashouts from token sales, providing crucial liquidity during the market downturn. Interestingly, Eric Trump has publicly characterized the current market conditions as a buying opportunity. This perspective suggests the family might be considering additional investments to average down their positions or acquire new assets at discounted prices. Their long-term strategy for Trump family crypto holdings appears to remain intact despite short-term setbacks. What Does This Mean for Average Crypto Investors? The dramatic decline in Trump family crypto holdings serves as a powerful reminder that even well-connected, wealthy investors aren’t immune to market volatility. The cryptocurrency space remains highly speculative, and diversification across different asset types within the crypto ecosystem doesn’t guarantee protection during broad market downturns. However, the family’s ability to weather such significant losses also demonstrates the importance of having multiple revenue streams and exit strategies. Their experience with Trump family crypto holdings offers valuable lessons about risk management and portfolio construction in the digital asset space. Conclusion: Lessons from Trump Family Crypto Holdings Crash The billion-dollar loss in Trump family crypto holdings represents one of the most significant wealth evaporations in recent cryptocurrency history. While the numbers are staggering, the family’s diversified approach and existing financial cushions provide important risk management examples for other investors. Their experience underscores the critical need for proper position sizing and the dangers of overexposure to volatile assets, even for wealthy individuals and families. Frequently Asked Questions How much did Trump family crypto holdings lose exactly? The Trump family crypto holdings decreased by approximately $1 billion, falling from $7.7 billion to $6.7 billion according to Bloomberg’s tracking. Which assets caused the biggest losses in Trump family crypto holdings? Trump Media positions accounted for $800 million in losses, American Bitcoin investments lost $330 million, and TRUMP memecoin declined by $120 million. Are the Trump family crypto holdings completely wiped out? No, they still maintain $6.7 billion in crypto holdings and have financial cushions including $900 million already cashed out from token sales. How did Trump Media contribute to the Trump family crypto holdings losses? Trump Media held substantial spot and options contracts for Bitcoin and CRO that amplified losses during the market downturn. What is Eric Trump’s view on the current market conditions? Eric Trump has described the current market as a buying opportunity, suggesting the family might see value at current price levels. Do the Trump family crypto holdings include any protective measures? Yes, their World Liberty Financial project guarantees them token sale revenue, providing ongoing income streams during volatile periods.

54822149,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=867061,1763949560,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54822149.jpeg,Citi Wealth chief bullish as top tech stocks pull back,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/citi-wealth-chief-bullish/,"Citigroup’s wealth-management division is maintaining a cautiously optimistic view on the long-term prospects of the tech sector. Head of Wealth at Citi, Andy Sieg says the bull market still looks strong because investors remain calm, even as the stocks of big tech companies decline. The S&P 500 is down approximately 2% this month, and investors have begun questioning AI company stocks due to their unstable prices. Big tech companies lost value, and Nvidia initially rose, but then dropped before things improved slightly. The backdrop for Citi’s cautious optimism is a sharp downturn in major tech names this month. The S&P 500 is down nearly 4.4%, on pace for its worst November since 2008, as AI-related stocks undergo a broad reassessment. Nvidia, once a poster child for the AI boom, has fallen around 11% in November, despite delivering strong quarterly earnings. Other heavyweight tech names are under pressure too — Microsoft and Amazon declined following downgrades and mounting concerns over lofty valuations. On November 19, the S&P 500 recorded its fourth straight session of losses, slipping 0.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.2%, highlighting just how much investor sentiment has turned. Citi Wealth is growing because rich clients are putting in more new money than ever before Andy Sieg said many rich clients don’t want to lose money now that the market is uncertain, so they use investment products like structured notes to prevent big losses and still make a profit. He explained that the bull market still has room to grow because investors aren’t buying stocks recklessly just because the prices have dropped, as expected when a market boom comes to an end. Sieg joined Citi in 2023 from the Bank of America and wants the bank to stop focusing on simply giving business loans and turn towards helping clients grow and manage their investments. He has made so many changes to the bank’s operations that the amount of client investments grew by 14% compared with the same time last year. Inflows also reached $37.1 billion in the first nine months of the year, and this shows just how much clients trust Citi to help them grow their money. Citi’s wealth business is more popular in Asia because most of the bank’s money comes from this region, especially Chinese clients. The bank also gets strong inflows from non-resident Indians who live in Singapore, Dubai, and London. Citi is still committed to its Citigold business in Asia, even though it left some consumer banking markets like China, India, and Taiwan, as the bank serves clients who have about $200,000 in assets. The bank also wants to combine its retail banking division in the U.S. with the wealth division, and Kate Luft will head this new merger and report to Andy Sieg. Citi will be able to give clients all the services they need in one place and build a global wealth business that protects their customers’ money. Citi is making big changes quickly to make its wealth business stronger The bank is cutting 20,000 non-essential jobs to reduce costs and focus on areas that make the most money or have the most potential. However, it still trades below book value, so it needs to show investors that its plan is working and that it can create more value for them over time. Citi is also struggling with leadership because claims about Andy Sieg’s management style forced the bank to hire an outside law firm, Paul Weiss, to investigate the allegations. CEO Jane Fraser said she is “comfortable” with the findings of the investigation, showing that the claims do not interfere with the changes being made. Siege also said the claims were false and that they have not stopped the wealth division from growing and producing strong results like the $37.1 billion in new money from clients in the first nine months of the year. The company also increased investment assets by 14% compared with last year, so the results speak for themselves. Citi’s wealth business is growing steadily, even with the unstable market, as its new investment assets have been increasing consistently from 2023 to 2025. The bank aims to grow in the long term, bring in new clients, and help them protect and grow their money safely, even when the market goes up and down.

This bipartisan effort represents a major development in the country’s approach to digital assets, focusing specifically on stablecoins rather than creating a broad framework for the entire virtual asset market. What Do These Stablecoin Bills Actually Propose? The three stablecoin bills under consideration come from both major political parties, demonstrating cross-party support for cryptocurrency regulation. Representative Kim Eun-hye of the People Power Party and Representatives Kim Hyun-jung and Ahn Do-geol of the ruling Democratic Party have each introduced proposals that share several key requirements: Minimum capital requirement of 5 billion won (approximately $3.6 million) for all stablecoin issuers Clear regulatory framework specifically for stablecoins Enhanced consumer protection measures Transparency requirements for reserve backing Why Focus Specifically on Stablecoin Regulation? Unlike comprehensive cryptocurrency frameworks, these stablecoin bills target a specific segment of the digital asset market. Stablecoins have gained significant attention due to their potential impact on financial stability and their growing use in cryptocurrency transactions. The targeted approach allows lawmakers to address the most pressing concerns while avoiding the complexity of regulating the entire digital asset ecosystem. The capital requirement of 5 billion won represents a substantial barrier to entry, ensuring that only well-funded, serious organizations can issue stablecoins in South Korea. This measure aims to prevent the kind of instability seen in other markets where undercapitalized stablecoin projects have collapsed. How Will These Stablecoin Bills Affect the Market? The implementation of these stablecoin bills could bring several important changes to South Korea’s cryptocurrency landscape. First, legitimate stablecoin projects will gain credibility and trust from users and investors. Second, the clear regulatory framework may attract more institutional participation in the digital asset space. However, the high capital requirements might also limit competition, potentially favoring larger financial institutions over smaller startups. The market will need to adapt to these new standards, which could lead to consolidation among existing stablecoin providers. What Makes These Stablecoin Bills Different? These proposals stand out because they represent rare bipartisan cooperation in the often-divisive world of cryptocurrency regulation. The fact that lawmakers from both major parties have introduced similar stablecoin bills suggests a consensus on the need for regulation in this specific area. Moreover, the focus on stablecoins rather than broader cryptocurrency regulation indicates a pragmatic approach. Lawmakers appear to be addressing the most immediate concerns first, potentially paving the way for more comprehensive legislation in the future. Looking Ahead: The Future of Stablecoin Regulation Today’s review of these stablecoin bills marks a crucial moment for South Korea’s cryptocurrency industry. If passed, these regulations could set a precedent for other nations considering similar measures. The successful implementation of these stablecoin bills might encourage further regulatory clarity in other areas of the digital asset market. The global cryptocurrency community will be watching closely as South Korea moves forward with these stablecoin bills. The outcome could influence regulatory approaches worldwide and potentially shape the future of stablecoin adoption in mainstream finance. Frequently Asked Questions What are the key requirements in these stablecoin bills? The most significant requirement is the 5 billion won capital minimum for stablecoin issuers, along with transparency and consumer protection measures. When will these stablecoin bills become law? The bills are currently under review. If approved by the committee, they will proceed through the legislative process, which could take several months. How do these stablecoin bills affect existing stablecoin projects? Existing projects will need to comply with the new regulations, including meeting the capital requirements, or cease operations in South Korea. Why are stablecoins receiving special regulatory attention? Stablecoins are seen as potential systemic risks due to their peg to traditional currencies and growing adoption in financial transactions. Will these regulations apply to international stablecoin issuers? The bills likely apply to any stablecoin available to South Korean users, regardless of the issuer’s location. How do these compare to stablecoin regulations in other countries? South Korea’s approach appears more specific than some broader frameworks, focusing intensely on capital requirements and issuer credibility.

He posted documents showing that the asset now holds an active Digital Token Identifier within the ISO framework. This identifier allows for formal recognition and acceptance across the ISO payment system. Assets with this type of identifier often see stronger market activity. The images he shared included technical records and an academic paper. These explain how identifiers help digital assets fit into international payment standards. This information drew interest because SWIFT has transitioned to the ISO 20022 standard . Yes, XRP has an active Digital Token Identifier within the ISO framework. This identifier enables a digital asset to be formally recognized and accepted across the ISO payment system. Assets with ISO-recognized identifiers will experience stronger market participation and… pic.twitter.com/ynrHGuwcEv — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 22, 2025 A Clear Shift Toward ISO 20022 Many institutions are now working with new messaging rules that demand clean, well-structured data. This standard enables financial institutions to exchange data in a single, unified format. It provides banks with faster communication and more detailed information in every message. The global shift is still ongoing. This identifier potentially extends XRP’s reach to all these institutions. No cryptocurrency is ISO 20022 compliant . That includes XRP. Blockchains do not follow the strict messaging rules the standard requires. Still, XRP sits closer to this system than other digital assets. It recently topped the list of ISO 20022 cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. Ripple built its technology to support clear payment information. It designed its network to work with financial messages that match institutional needs. This design gives XRP a path into ISO 20022-aligned environments . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why XRP’s Digital Identifier Matters The Digital Token Identifier for XRP acts as a formal tag within the ISO structure. It gives payment systems a way to identify XRP. This does not make XRP ISO 20022 compliant. However, it allows institutions to treat XRP as a known asset in systems that use this standard. Cryptocurrencies in the ISO system can be used in international transactions between institutions. This shows how identifiers help assets interact with systems that expect clear labels and structured data. SMQKE noted that assets with ISO 20022-recognized identifiers often see higher trading volumes. He linked this to stronger market interest, saying that higher volumes can support price growth. His point reflects how liquidity works in digital markets. When more institutions can access an asset, activity rises. XRP now holds an identifier that supports this access. This places it within systems that depend on structured data. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

However, the introduction of ZK-verifiable mindshare data changes everything by bringing mathematical certainty to data reliability. The partnership between Brevis and Kaito represents a major leap forward in data transparency. Brevis applies zero-knowledge proof technology to validate Kaito’s calculations, enabling on-chain verification via BNB Chain. This means anyone can confirm the accuracy of the mindshare data without accessing the proprietary algorithms behind it. How does ZK technology transform data verification? Zero-knowledge proofs work like a mathematical magic trick – they prove that a computation is correct without revealing how it was done. For prediction markets, this means: Complete verification of data accuracy Privacy protection for proprietary algorithms Trustless validation that anyone can perform On-chain proof of computation integrity The ZK-verifiable mindshare data system records all calculation results as cryptographic proofs. These proofs serve as permanent, tamper-proof evidence that the data hasn’t been manipulated. This transformation turns previously unverifiable AI-based metrics into a trustless structure that significantly enhances reliability for all prediction market participants. Why does this matter for prediction markets? Prediction markets thrive on accurate, trustworthy data. When participants can’t verify the information they’re using, market efficiency suffers. The introduction of ZK-verifiable mindshare data addresses this fundamental challenge head-on. Polymarket users now have access to sentiment data that carries mathematical proof of its integrity, creating a more robust and reliable trading environment. This innovation represents a crucial step toward fully trustless decentralized systems. By combining Kaito’s AI expertise with Brevis’s zero-knowledge technology, the partnership delivers ZK-verifiable mindshare data that sets new standards for transparency. Market participants can now make decisions with confidence, knowing the underlying data has been cryptographically verified. What does the future hold for verified data? The implications extend far beyond Polymarket. This breakthrough in ZK-verifiable mindshare data creates a blueprint for other decentralized applications requiring verified external data. The technology demonstrates how zero-knowledge proofs can bridge the gap between proprietary data sources and trustless verification, opening new possibilities across DeFi, insurance, and governance systems. As more platforms adopt similar verification methods, we’ll likely see increased institutional participation in prediction markets. The ability to provide mathematically proven data reliability removes a significant barrier to entry for traditional finance players who require auditable, verifiable information sources. Frequently Asked Questions What is ZK-verifiable mindshare data? ZK-verifiable mindshare data refers to sentiment and investment data that has been mathematically proven accurate using zero-knowledge proofs, without revealing the underlying calculation methods. How does this benefit Polymarket users? Users can trust that the mindshare data hasn’t been manipulated, enabling more confident trading decisions based on verified information. What technology makes this verification possible? Brevis uses zero-knowledge proof technology to create cryptographic proofs that validate Kaito’s data calculations on BNB Chain. Can anyone verify the data independently? Yes, the system allows anyone to independently verify the cryptographic proofs, ensuring complete transparency and trustlessness.

The Financial Intelligence Unit’s crackdown signals a new era of regulatory scrutiny for digital asset platforms operating in one of Asia’s most important cryptocurrency markets. Why Are Crypto Exchanges Facing Penalties? The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) discovered significant AML compliance gaps during inspections of South Korea’s leading crypto exchanges. These violations prompted immediate regulatory action, highlighting the government’s commitment to financial security in the digital asset space. Authorities conducted thorough on-site examinations at five major platforms: Dunamu (Upbit) – August 2024 Korbit – October 2024 Gopax – December 2024 Bithumb – March 2025 Coinone – April 2025 What Penalties Await These Crypto Exchanges? The FIU plans to impose multiple sanctions including institutional penalties, personnel sanctions, and substantial fines. The regulatory body follows a first-in, first-out approach based on inspection dates, meaning Dunamu will likely face consequences first. Industry experts suggest the penalties will be significant. The report clearly states that heavy consequences for these crypto exchanges appear unavoidable given the severity of the AML violations discovered during inspections. How Will This Impact South Korea’s Crypto Market? This regulatory action represents a pivotal moment for crypto exchanges in South Korea. The FIU’s firm stance demonstrates that compliance is no longer optional for digital asset platforms operating in the country. Market analysts predict several immediate effects: Increased compliance costs for all crypto exchanges Tighter regulatory oversight across the industry Potential market consolidation as smaller platforms struggle with new requirements Enhanced investor protection through better AML practices What Does This Mean for Crypto Exchange Users? While these penalties might cause temporary disruptions, they ultimately benefit users of crypto exchanges. Stronger AML enforcement means better security, reduced fraud risk, and increased institutional confidence in South Korea’s digital asset ecosystem. The FIU’s actions should reassure investors that authorities are actively working to create a safer environment for cryptocurrency trading. However, users might experience more rigorous verification processes when using these crypto exchanges in the future. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Regulation South Korea’s decisive action against major crypto exchanges marks a significant step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. By enforcing strict AML compliance, regulators are building the foundation for sustainable growth in the digital asset sector. These penalties serve as a clear warning to all crypto exchanges that regulatory compliance is essential for long-term operation. Frequently Asked Questions Which crypto exchanges are facing penalties? Upbit (Dunamu), Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax are all facing potential sanctions from South Korea’s FIU. When will the penalties be announced? The FIU will likely finalize penalties on a first-in, first-out basis corresponding to their inspection schedule, beginning with Dunamu. What types of penalties can we expect? The sanctions may include institutional penalties, personnel sanctions, and substantial financial fines for AML violations. How will this affect cryptocurrency trading in South Korea? While there might be temporary disruptions, the long-term effect should be positive through enhanced security and regulatory clarity. Are other crypto exchanges at risk? All crypto exchanges operating in South Korea should expect increased regulatory scrutiny and must ensure robust AML compliance programs. What should investors do during this period? Investors should continue normal operations but remain aware of potential platform changes as exchanges implement stronger compliance measures.

Why Noomez Coin is Positioned to Outperform the Rest of the Market,https://timestabloid.com/is-altcoin-season-about-to-start-why-noomez-coin-is-positioned/,"The debate around altcoin season is intensifying as market rotations accelerate and liquidity slowly returns to mid-cap and emerging assets. Bitcoin dominance is retreating from recent highs, Ethereum volume has stabilized, and several sector-specific tokens have posted early recoveries including Sui (+4.2 percent), Ton (+3.8 percent), and PEPE (+5.1 percent). Traders are watching these shifts closely because historically, early momentum in mid-caps is one of the clearest signals that fresh capital is preparing to expand into speculative opportunities. Against this backdrop, presale entries are gaining attention for their fixed pricing and insulated growth mechanics, with Noomez standing out as one of the most active early-stage projects in the market. Market Behavior Ahead of a Potential Altcoin Rotation Analysts tracking the altcoin season index note that rotations typically begin when investors start shifting away from Bitcoin after periods of consolidation. Over the past week, on-chain data has shown early inflows into mid-cap assets and improving sentiment around speculative coins. While these signals do not yet confirm a full breakout, they illustrate that liquidity is preparing to move. This environment naturally pushes traders toward presales. Stage-based models remain insulated from intraday volatility, giving buyers fixed entry points even when open-market prices fluctuate. Investors rely on these mechanics during uncertain phases because demand is transparent through holder growth and capital raised, unsold-token burns tighten supply, and structured stage progression prevents manipulation. For many, presales provide the early-cycle stability they look for before larger rotations begin. Noomez Coin: Stage 5 Demand Surges as Price Rises and Time Runs Out The Noomez token has become one of the fastest-moving presales this month. A few days ago, the price increased from $0.0000187 to $0.0000230 , officially activating Stage 5 . Holder count has already reached 183 , and the project has raised $41,401.63 , reflecting steady, hour-by-hour buying. In this stage, the time is limited, and the next price jump is approaching as Stage 6 prepares to open. Many traders entering now understand that waiting could mean paying more later, especially with the increasing pace of purchases. Short mid-section bullets for clarity: Stage 5 price: $0.0000230 Next jump at Stage 6 Stage progression tied to demand and time Buyers entering now secure the lowest remaining entry With participation rising, traders evaluating early-cycle opportunities see Noomez as one of the next meme coins positioned to explode once presale supply tightens further. Why People Are Rushing to Buy Noomez Now Beyond fixed pricing, Noomez includes layered reward systems that amplify gains and encourage early positioning. The referral program allows buyers to share codes and trigger a 10%bonus for both sides of the transaction, and a general 250% bonus is currently active through the BONUS250 code. The staking system, Noom Rewards , offers up to 66%t APY , with a 2x multiplier for those who entered between Stages 1 and 7. Rewards accumulate during presale and unlock 30 days after launch , giving early buyers long-term yield potential even before the token lists. Buyers entering now point to one critical factor: the time is running out , and each stage raises the floor. This has pushed many investors to buy Noomez before Stage 6 begins. The Stage X Million Airdrop: A Reward System Built for Excitement Every stage of the Noomez presale concludes with a dramatic event: the Stage X Million Airdrop . At the end of each phase, one eligible wallet receives X million $NNZ , where X equals the stage number. How fairness is protected: Minimum $20 of $NNZ required for eligibility One entry per wallet Winner selected through a transparent randomizer Launch: How the Transformation Happens When all 28 stages close, Noomez transitions from presale to open-market trading. All purchased tokens are distributed directly to holders, the Gauge becomes fully illuminated, and the presale narrative concludes with the beginning of live trading. The launch occurs on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) with trading pairs on PancakeSwap , supported by 15% liquidity locked through a third-party locker. Once trading begins, the Access Engine activates, sending partner project tokens automatically to $NNZ holders. Noom Rewards staking also opens for 30–365 days, and the lore continues expanding into the broader Noomverse. For many early buyers, this moment represents the transition from presale believers to Genesis Holders. Final Outlook While markets are still forming the early conditions of a rotation, traders watching altcoin dominance and the index altcoin season metrics believe that speculative capital is preparing to flow back into emerging assets. Noomez has positioned itself at the center of this potential shift with stage-based pricing, transparent burns, guaranteed progression, and one of the most active presale communities of the quarter. With Stage 5 active and Stage 6 approaching, buyers who want to secure early exposure are acting now.

As many as 80 companies have expressed interest. But regulators say only a select few will be approved when the first batch of licenses are revealed in early 2026. Hong Kong is the first jurisdiction where stablecoin reserves must be backed exclusively by High Quality Liquid Assets – ultra safe, short-term holdings that can be converted to cash on demand. This rigorous rulebook hasn’t proved a deterrent. “It’s a sign that firms are eager to tap into the crypto system without taking on the market’s more volatile risks”, said Dr Hin Liu, a lecturer in law at Oxford University and digital asset consultant. The collapse of JPEX Liu said the new Stablecoin Ordinance, which came into effect on August 1, is a concerted effort to rebuild trust in Hong Kong’s digital asset market following a string of scandals. “The most recent memory of crypto in the public is of NFT’s tanking and crypto scams and fraud. The Stablecoin Ordinance signals that Hong Kong is a robust place to do business.” The latest, and largest was the collapse of JPEX, an unlicensed crypto platform which is accused of siphoning off roughly $166 million from Hong Kong investors between 2020 and 2023. Hong Kong police are still dealing with the fallout. A central bank model for stablecoins Hong Kong is putting its stablecoin governance under one roof. The HKMA, the city’s de facto central bank, is in charge of the entire stablecoin “stack” from licensing to reserve management, custody, redemption, and distribution. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will continue to oversee the wider virtual asset ecosystem. It is an unusual setup. In most jurisdictions, stablecoins are supervised by securities watchdogs or a patchwork of financial regulators, rather than a single monetary authority. Under the new framework, the HKMA can grant, suspend or revoke licences, and investigate potential breaches. Firms that dispute an HKMA decision may appeal to a newly created Stablecoin Review Tribunal and ultimately the Court of Appeal if needed. The dedicated tribunal marks “a level of regulatory accountability that’s still missing in most jurisdictions,” said Joshua Chu, a lawyer, law lecturer and Co-Chair of the Hong Kong Web3 Association. “Compared with the U.S, South Korea or Japan, where disputes can stretch on for years in normal courts, Hong Kong’s tribunal gives the industry a credible, expert focused point of reference,” he said. Building institutional trust in uncharted waters A core rule of the Stablecoin Ordinance is that issuers must be able to show they hold enough ultra-liquid assets to redeem every stablecoin at full value on demand. It’s a challenge that extends beyond simply designing a solid regulatory framework. “Maintaining a 1:1 peg day after day in order to create this institutional trust is crucial,” said Professor Alex Preda is a blockchain researcher at King’s College London. “The quality of the collateral matters, but it doesn’t automatically create trust.” As volumes scale, he said, issuers will need to make intraday adjustments – a job that cannot be done by automation. Preda believes that institutional trust will need to be earned in the emerging sphere of stablecoins. “These big traditional financial institutions on the ground in Hong Kong have a lot of financial expertise, but they don’t have the engineering expertise to automate this kind of balance.” Preda said given their limited crypto know-how, Hong Kong’s established players will most likely partner up with companies that specialize in digital assets. It’s a trend that is already underway. Standard Charter’s Hong Kong unit has formed a joint-venture with Animoca Brands and HKT to apply for a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin license. Tokenization as reinvention Hong Kong is racing to turn tokenized assets into the backbone of its financial infrastructure. Its tokenization mission is driven by three interlocking frameworks. The HKMA’s Fintech 2030 strategy, which sets the city’s overarching digital finance agenda. The SFC’s ASPIRe roadmap which regulates tokenised products, and HKMA’s LEAP framework which outlines the underlying settlement infrastructure needed to support them. Joshua Chu said the city is positioning itself as a serious regulated institutional finance hub. He said that business opportunities are shifting to tokenized funds, asset backed securities, and digital asset custody services, rather than on “overhyped models like direct tokenized real estate ownership”. “These models face structural obstacles from stamp-duty and property-transfer rules as well as the unresolved legal status of tokens.” This shift has already begun to shape the market. On November 13 HKMA launched its EnsembleTX pilot, to test tokenized bank deposits in real value transactions. The project follows recent tokenized money-market funds and tokenized gold issuances by major banks. If the pilots are successful Hong Kong could become one of the first jurisdictions in the world to integrate tokenized deposits directly into its banking infrastructure. Missing pieces in Hong Kong’s digital asset framework But Chu said there were several gaps to fill before Hong Kong’s tokenisation framework can operate at scale. He said the trading of tokenised securities remains thin because the city has yet to build the market infrastructure needed for investors to buy and sell these products easily. He added that regulators have yet to spell out what protections or disclosures retail investors would receive if these products eventually become widely available. The city also faces a technical challenge – building systems that allow different blockchains to interact, but doing so in a way that respects both Hong Kong’s and Beijing’s regulatory boundaries. Chu points out that regulators have also restricted stablecoins to preapproved users and wallets. It’s a requirement that prevents them from functioning like an open circulating payment instrument. For regulators, that perimeter is a feature rather than a flaw. It’s a way to show that the city can innovate without inviting the kind of volatility that has rattled the crypto market. Whether Hong Kong can maintain that balance as tokenisation spreads into more parts of its financial system will determine how far its ambitions can go, and how much of the global market it can realistically claim.

According to Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, companies adopting Digital Asset Treasury strategies face an uphill battle maintaining their stock premiums. This revelation sends shockwaves through the cryptocurrency investment community. Why Crypto-Hoarding Firms Can’t Sustain Premiums Matt Hougan recently took to social media platform X to explain the structural challenges facing crypto-hoarding firms. He argues that most companies implementing DAT strategies will eventually trade at negative premiums. The core issue lies in fundamental business dynamics that work against these firms over time. Hougan identifies three major burdens that accumulate and devalue DAT strategies: Corporate operating costs that continuously drain resources Liquidity problems that limit financial flexibility Execution risks that threaten strategy implementation The Growth Challenge for Crypto-Hoarding Companies What methods can crypto-hoarding firms use to increase their crypto holdings per share? According to Hougan, the options are both limited and uncertain. For the strategy to maintain value, growth must be continuous and substantial. However, most crypto-hoarding firms struggle with this requirement. The structural dynamics create a scenario where the burdens outweigh the benefits. Consequently, these companies face mounting pressure that eventually leads to discounted trading. What This Means for Crypto-Hoarding Investors Investors in crypto-hoarding firms should understand the inherent risks. The premium sustainability issue affects long-term value creation. While short-term gains might appear attractive, the structural challenges pose significant threats. Hougan’s analysis suggests that crypto-hoarding firms need more than just cryptocurrency exposure to succeed. They require robust business models that can withstand the accumulating burdens he describes. The Future of Digital Asset Treasury Strategies Will all crypto-hoarding firms face this premium decline? Hougan believes most will eventually trade at discounts. The structural factors he identifies create persistent headwinds that are difficult to overcome. This doesn’t mean DAT strategies are doomed. However, crypto-hoarding firms must address these challenges proactively. Companies that find ways to mitigate operating costs, improve liquidity, and manage execution risks might still succeed. FAQs: Understanding Crypto-Hoarding Firm Challenges What are crypto-hoarding firms? Crypto-hoarding firms are companies that implement Digital Asset Treasury strategies, holding significant cryptocurrency reserves as part of their corporate treasury management. Why do crypto-hoarding firms struggle with premiums? They face structural challenges including ongoing corporate operating costs, liquidity constraints, and execution risks that accumulate over time and devalue their strategies. Can any crypto-hoarding firms maintain premiums? While challenging, some firms might succeed if they develop methods to continuously increase crypto holdings per share and effectively manage the structural burdens. What should investors look for in crypto-hoarding firms? Investors should evaluate how companies address operating costs, liquidity management, and execution risk mitigation in their DAT strategies. How quickly do premiums typically decline? The timeline varies, but Hougan suggests the structural dynamics eventually cause most DAT companies to trade at discounts as burdens accumulate. Are there successful examples of crypto-hoarding firms? While some companies have shown temporary success, long-term sustainability remains challenging due to the structural factors identified by Hougan.

This massive wave of forced closures has sent shockwaves through the trading community, highlighting the extreme volatility that characterizes these leveraged trading instruments. What Are Crypto Perpetual Futures and Why Do Liquidations Matter? Crypto perpetual futures represent one of the most popular trading instruments in digital assets. Unlike traditional futures with expiration dates, these contracts continue indefinitely. However, when markets move sharply against traders’ positions, exchanges automatically close these leveraged trades to prevent further losses. The recent $132 million liquidation event demonstrates how quickly conditions can change in crypto perpetual futures markets. Breaking Down the $132M Crypto Perpetual Futures Bloodbath The liquidation distribution reveals critical insights about market sentiment and positioning. Bitcoin led the carnage with $73.83 million in forced closures, while Ethereum followed closely at $49.58 million. Solana accounted for $8.63 million of the total crypto perpetual futures liquidations. Key liquidation statistics include: Bitcoin: 67.8% short positions liquidated Ethereum: 50.22% long positions closed Solana: 57.14% short positions wiped out How Can Traders Navigate Crypto Perpetual Futures Volatility? Understanding risk management becomes crucial when trading crypto perpetual futures. The recent liquidations underscore the importance of proper position sizing and stop-loss orders. Many traders learned the hard way that leverage can amplify both gains and losses in these volatile crypto perpetual futures markets. Successful crypto perpetual futures traders often employ: Conservative leverage ratios Diversified portfolio allocation Regular monitoring of funding rates Clear exit strategies for both profits and losses What Do These Massive Liquidations Signal for Crypto Markets? The concentration of short liquidations in Bitcoin and Solana suggests many traders were betting against price increases. Conversely, Ethereum’s balanced liquidation ratio indicates mixed sentiment. These crypto perpetual futures movements often precede significant price trends as forced closures create additional market pressure. Market analysts watch crypto perpetual futures liquidations closely because they can: Indicate potential trend reversals Reveal overcrowded trading positions Create cascading price effects Signal changing market sentiment Essential Lessons From the $132M Liquidation Event The dramatic crypto perpetual futures liquidations serve as a stark reminder about market risks. While these instruments offer significant profit potential, they also carry substantial danger. The $132 million wiped out in 24 hours demonstrates why education and caution remain vital when engaging with crypto perpetual futures. As we reflect on this liquidation event, remember that sustainable trading involves more than chasing quick profits. Understanding market mechanics, managing emotions, and implementing robust risk strategies separate successful crypto perpetual futures traders from those who become liquidation statistics. Frequently Asked Questions What causes liquidations in crypto perpetual futures? Liquidations occur when a trader’s position loses enough value that their collateral can no longer cover potential losses. Exchanges automatically close these positions to protect themselves and other traders. How can I avoid getting liquidated in crypto perpetual futures? Use lower leverage, maintain adequate margin, set stop-loss orders, and avoid overconcentrating positions. Regular monitoring and risk management are essential. Why do Bitcoin liquidations tend to be higher than other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin typically has the highest trading volume and open interest in perpetual futures markets, making it more susceptible to large liquidation events during volatility. Can liquidations affect cryptocurrency prices? Yes, large liquidations can create cascading effects as forced selling or buying pressure impacts market prices, sometimes triggering additional liquidations. What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations occur when prices drop sharply, forcing buyers to sell. Short liquidations happen when prices rise rapidly, forcing sellers to buy back their positions. Are perpetual futures riskier than spot trading? Yes, perpetual futures involve leverage, which amplifies both potential profits and losses, making them significantly riskier than spot trading.

ETH is now attempting to recover but faces resistance near $2,890. Ethereum started a fresh decline after it failed to stay above $2,800. The price is trading near $2,840 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,960 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below the $2,720 zone. Ethereum Price Attempts Recovery Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $3,000 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH price dipped below $2,880 and entered a bearish zone. The decline gathered pace below $2,800 and the price dipped below $2,700. A low was formed at $2,621 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,058 swing high to the $2,621 low. Ethereum price is now trading near $2,840 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . If there is another recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $2,890 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,058 swing high to the $2,621 low. The next key resistance is near the $2,920 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,950 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,960 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A clear move above the $2,960 resistance might send the price toward the $3,020 resistance. An upside break above the $3,020 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,120 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term.

BMNR trades at a slight discount to NAV, offers a $0.01 dividend, and prepares to launch its ETH staking Validator Network in early 2026. Despite recent underperformance and technical oversold conditions, BMNR presents a favorable risk/reward profile if ETH finds support at $2,100-$2,600. I maintain a hold rating on BMNR, preferring direct crypto exposure, but see potential for a rally into the January shareholder meeting. Tom Lee has become a controversial name on Wall Street. The famed analyst turned strategist and now chairman of Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) is regarded by many for his long-standing accurate bullish market calls. When volatility strikes, however, critics are quick to dub the former J.P. Morgan analyst a perma-bull. He has garnered increased attention for bold cryptocurrency predictions, including a $200,000 bitcoin price target by January 2026 and a multi-fold ether rise over the years to come. Today, I’m digging into BMNR, a publicly traded company that has evolved from a traditional bitcoin mining operation into a major player in the cryptocurrency space. Along with MicroStrategy (MSTR), Bitmine Immersion is what’s known as a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT). These structures have been criticized lately for helping to stir up volatility in bitcoin and ether. I have a hold rating on BMNR. After a hot start to the second half of the year, BMNR has given way to the bears. The fund is now –23% since the start of the third quarter, underperforming both bitcoin and ether. Of course, BMNR is most directly tied to ether, so analyzing price trends in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is key. DATs Losing Ground in 2H25 Stockcharts.com According to the company , “ Bitmine is a bitcoin and Ethereum network Company with a focus on the accumulation of crypto for long-term investment, whether acquired by our bitcoin mining operations or from the proceeds of capital raising transactions. Company business lines include bitcoin mining, synthetic bitcoin mining through involvement in bitcoin mining, hashrate as a financial product, offering advisory and mining services to companies interested in earning bitcoin-denominated revenues, and general bitcoin advisory to public companies.” BMNR's goal is to increase shareholder value by acquiring ETH in a treasury and increasing the ETH held per share, along with achieving a 5% stake in the Ethereum network. Bitmine: Significant Ether Upside Possible Bitmine In November, BMNR reported FY 2025 results. Net income was $328 million, and fully diluted earnings per share verified at $13.39. It declared a $0.01 dividend, making Bitmine the first large-cap cryptocurrency company to offer such a shareholder payout. Tom Lee noted ongoing crypto volatility following a major ETH liquidation even back on October 10. Still, he was outspoken in the media last week, calling for a significant bottoming process in the works across bitcoin and ether. October 10 Crypto Meltdown Event & Bitcoin Market Depth Bloomberg Operationally, Bitmine prepares to launch its Made-in-America Validator Network (MAVAN) for ETH staking in early 2026, beginning with a pilot program using three top staking providers. The firm also highlighted its position as the largest ETH treasury in the world and plans to hold its annual shareholder meeting at the Wynn Las Vegas on January 15, 2026. In the here and now, Bitmine reported $13.2 billion in crypto and cash holdings, including 3.5 million in ETH tokens on November 10. Bitmine's Ether Fair Value Calculation Matrix Bitmine Bitmine's Path to 5% Bitmine Currently, the company’s net asset value per share is $27.85, with a price per share of $26.60. So, it trades at a slight discount to NAV. The current market price to NAV is near multi-month lows, too. BMNR Market Value Now at a Discount to NAV BMNR.Rocks How Bitmine Increases Value BNMR believes there are several strategies to increase ETH per share (hence its value). One approach is to issue stock at a premium to the dollar value of ETH held per share. Another is to issue equity-linked securities, which allows the company to monetize volatility embedded in the stock and underlying ETH held. Income generated from operations can also be used to acquire more of the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, staking rewards provide another avenue to increase ETH holdings, while the company itself can look to acquire DATs trading at close to the NAV of ETH held. Risks and Opportunities to BMNR and Crypto Of course, much depends on the macro outlook . As it stands, the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates when it meets next on December 9-10. The Fed Fund futures market pins a 70% implied chance of a third-consecutive quarter-point ease. If an cut is announced, I expect both bitcoin and ether to rally . What’s more, with support now in play with bitcoin, we could see a notable bounce into year-end, particularly given the washout since October 10. Key to the rally will be overall liquidity, however. A risk is that global liquidity continues to retreat if central banks around the world pull back on easing. Furthermore, BMNR dilution is a potential peril for existing and prospective shareholders. At a more industry level, as quantum evolves, encryption methods could be at risk. I am encouraged by Cathie Wood’s recent stakes in Bullish, Bitmine , and Circle, which lends added institutional support. Liquidity: Key to Crypto Price Action Zero Hedge Looking ahead, corporate event data provided by Wall Street Horizon show an unconfirmed Q1 2026 earnings date of Wednesday, January 14 BMO. Before that, shares trade ex a $0.01 dividend on Friday, December 5. Corporate Event Risk Calendar Wall Street Horizon The Technical Take BMNR itself has reached technical oversold conditions, as evidenced by its RSI momentum oscillator tagging the 30 mark for the first time this year. Shares are now below both their 50-day moving average and the upward-sloping 200dma. But with erratic price action around the announcement that Tom Lee would be chairman, I assert that paying closer attention to ether’s technicals is more important. BMNR: Below the 200dma, Overwold, High Overhead Supply Stockcharts.com Notice in the chart below that ETH has retreated to key long-term support at the $2600 mark. That’s where the price from which it launched back in July. There is another potential downside target and support spot just above $2100. Like BMNR, ether’s RSI is near 30 and the lowest since April. Soon, there will almost certainly be a negative “death cross,” a pattern in which the 50dma moves below the 200dma. That occurred early last week with bitcoin, and perhaps added to its downside price action and overall volatility. But if a bottom is indeed in play, then resistance is up at $4100. Between the current price and that target lies a high amount of volume by price from previous buyers and existing holders. For now, long BMNR, while eyeing $2100 on ETH presents a favorable risk/reward strategy in my view. Ether: $2600 and $2100 Support, Washed Out RSI, Death Cross Imminent Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on BMNR. A crypto investor myself, the company is attractive regarding its valuation (price to NAV), but I would rather simply own bitcoin and ether rather than take on the added risk (albeit with potential enhanced upside) of this Digital Asset Treasury company. I would not be surprised to see BMNR rally into its annual shareholder meeting in January... that's definitely an event to keep on your radar.",ETH-USD|BMNR,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-24 03:39:00

This potential monetary policy shift could have significant implications for investors and the broader economy. Why is the Fed rate cut generating so much attention? The Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions directly influence everything from mortgage rates to business loans and investment returns. Barclays analysts have identified a fascinating dynamic within the central bank’s leadership. Their research suggests that while Powell favors cutting rates, he faces substantial internal opposition that could make this Fed rate cut particularly challenging to implement. What’s causing the division within the Fed? According to Barclays’ detailed analysis, the Federal Reserve’s voting members appear split into two distinct camps: Six members likely prefer maintaining current interest rates Five members appear ready to support immediate rate reductions The remaining uncertainty creates a delicate balancing act for Chairman Powell This internal tension makes the potential Fed rate cut especially significant, as it would require Powell to navigate complex political dynamics within the central bank. How will Powell overcome resistance to the Fed rate cut? Barclays emphasizes a crucial factor in this equation: the considerable influence of the Federal Reserve Chairman. Historical patterns show that committee members rarely publicly oppose the chairman’s strongly held positions. This institutional dynamic suggests Powell may successfully orchestrate the Fed rate cut despite the apparent division. What does this mean for your investments? The potential Fed rate cut carries important implications for various asset classes. Lower interest rates typically benefit: Stock markets as borrowing costs decrease Real estate through lower mortgage rates Emerging markets as capital flows increase Growth companies that rely on financing However, the internal Fed division suggests this decision won’t come easily, potentially creating market volatility during the deliberation process. Conclusion: A pivotal moment for monetary policy The coming weeks will reveal whether Powell can successfully navigate the internal divisions and deliver the anticipated Fed rate cut . This situation highlights the complex interplay between economic data, institutional politics, and leadership influence at the highest levels of central banking. The outcome will not only affect interest rates but also signal the Fed’s confidence in the economic outlook. Frequently Asked Questions When will the Fed make its next rate decision? The Federal Reserve’s next policy meeting occurs next month, where they will announce whether to implement a Fed rate cut or maintain current levels. Why would the Fed cut rates with internal opposition? Chairman Powell may believe economic conditions warrant stimulus despite some committee members’ concerns about inflation or other factors. How often do Fed members oppose the chairman? Historical data shows public opposition to the chairman’s position is relatively rare, occurring in only about 15% of major policy decisions. What economic indicators might justify a Fed rate cut? Key factors include slowing job growth, declining inflation, weakening consumer spending, or concerns about global economic stability. How quickly do Fed rate cuts affect the economy? Most economic impacts become noticeable within 3-6 months, though financial markets typically react immediately to the announcement. Could the Fed cut rates multiple times this year? While possible, multiple Fed rate cuts would depend on sustained economic weakness and resolution of current internal divisions.

According to Pablo Sabbatella, founder of Web3 audit firm opsek, North Korean hackers have successfully infiltrated up to 20% of all crypto firms. This alarming revelation comes from an exclusive interview with DL News that exposes a sophisticated infiltration strategy targeting the heart of the cryptocurrency industry. How Are North Korean Hackers Targeting Crypto Companies? The infiltration method is both simple and brilliant. Between 30% and 40% of job applications received by cryptocurrency companies originate from North Korean hackers. These aren’t random attempts to steal funds through external attacks. Instead, these North Korean hackers seek legitimate employment to gain direct system access and operate crypto infrastructure from within. Their strategy goes beyond traditional cybercrime. Once inside, these operatives can manipulate systems, access sensitive data, and potentially control critical infrastructure. The implications are staggering for an industry built on trust and security. What Makes This Infiltration Strategy So Effective? The North Korean hackers employ several clever tactics to bypass security measures: They pay individuals in developing countries to use their identity and account information They create convincing professional profiles and resumes They target multiple companies simultaneously They focus on gaining long-term access rather than quick thefts This approach allows them to circumvent international sanctions while building persistent access to cryptocurrency infrastructure. The long-term nature of their operations suggests strategic planning rather than opportunistic crime. Why Should Crypto Companies Be Concerned? The threat from North Korean hackers represents more than just financial risk. When these operatives gain employment, they can: Access private keys and wallet information Manipulate transaction records Compromise smart contract security Gather intelligence on security protocols Moreover, the scale of this infiltration means that the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem faces systemic risk. With up to 20% of companies potentially compromised, the trust foundation of decentralized finance becomes vulnerable. How Can Crypto Firms Protect Themselves? Companies must implement robust verification processes for all job applicants. Enhanced background checks, multi-factor authentication, and continuous monitoring of employee activities become essential. The traditional approach to hiring in the fast-moving crypto space may need fundamental restructuring. Regular security audits, especially those focusing on internal threats, should become standard practice. The opsek findings highlight that external security measures alone cannot protect against determined North Korean hackers seeking employment access. The Bigger Picture: Sanctions and International Security This infiltration strategy directly supports North Korea’s efforts to bypass economic sanctions. By gaining control of cryptocurrency infrastructure, these operatives can: Move funds internationally without detection Launder money through legitimate channels Fund other prohibited activities Build economic resilience against sanctions The connection between these North Korean hackers and national security objectives makes this more than just a criminal enterprise. It represents a state-level threat to the global financial system. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Security The revelation that North Korean hackers have infiltrated up to 20% of cryptocurrency companies should serve as a critical wake-up call. The industry must recognize that security threats now come not just from external attacks but from within organizations themselves. Comprehensive security protocols, thorough employee vetting, and ongoing vigilance are no longer optional—they’re essential for survival in the evolving threat landscape. Frequently Asked Questions How do North Korean hackers bypass company security checks? They pay individuals in developing countries to use their identities and account information, creating legitimate-looking job applications that pass initial screening processes. What percentage of crypto companies are affected? According to opsek’s founder Pablo Sabbatella, up to 20% of cryptocurrency companies may have been infiltrated by North Korean hackers. Why are crypto companies specifically targeted? Cryptocurrency companies provide direct access to digital assets and financial infrastructure, making them ideal targets for bypassing international sanctions and moving funds anonymously. What can companies do to prevent this type of infiltration? Implement enhanced background checks, multi-factor authentication, continuous employee monitoring, and regular security audits focusing on internal threats. How long has this infiltration been happening? While exact timelines aren’t specified, the sophisticated nature of the operation suggests it has been developing over an extended period. Are traditional financial institutions also at risk? While the current focus is on crypto companies, the same infiltration tactics could potentially target any financial institution, though cryptocurrency’s decentralized nature presents unique vulnerabilities.

54826147,https://invezz.com/?p=2977987,1763956209,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Crypto market rally: top reasons why Bitcoin and altcoins are rising,https://invezz.com/news/2025/11/24/crypto-market-rally-top-reasons-why-bitcoin-and-altcoins-are-rising/,"A crypto market rally is happening, with Bitcoin and most altcoins being in the green. Bitcoin jumped to $87,000 on Monday, while the market capitalization of all tokens jumped to the $3 trillion mark. Some of the top gainers were coins like Canton, Hedera, Story, Bittensor, Kaspa, and Hyperliquid, which jumped by over 6%. Top crypto gainers | Source: CMC Crypto market rally happening as investors buy the dip A potential reason for the ongoing crypto market rally is that investors are buying the dip after plunging by double digits in the past few weeks. It is common for investors to buy an asset after plunging hard after some time. In this case, the ongoing crypto market rally could be happening as investors anticipate more gains over time now that most coins have become bargains. However, the ongoing buying the dip could also be part of a dead-cat bounce, a situation where an asset in a freefall bounces back briefly and then resumes the downtrend. Investors are also buying the dip after Bitcoin and altcoins became highly oversold. For example, Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved to a low of 27 on Friday. Stock market rally Another possible reason why the crypto market rally is happening is that investors are paying close attention to the performance of the stock market, which is gaining momentum. American stock index futures are all in a strong uptrend, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 indices rose by 150, 40, and 200 points, continuing the Friday’s gains. The three gained by 493, 65, and 195 points, respectively. The same is happening in other countries, with top indices like the KOSPI , Hang Seng , and ASX Indices rising by over 1% on Monday. It is common for the crypto market to rally when top stock market indices are rising because the two assets are closely correlated. Futures open interest rising The ongoing crypto market rally is happening as third-party data points to improvements in the futures market. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that the futures open interest jumped by 1.9% in the last 24 hours to $127 billion. Bitcoin’s open interest rose to $60 billion, its highest level since November 21 and much higher than the weekend low of $58 billion. Soaring futures open interest is a sign that investors are starting to gradually use leverage. Still, the open interest remains significantly lower than the October high of over $225 billion. Meanwhile, liquidations retreated in the past few days, meaning that fewer bullish positions are being closed forcefully today. XRP and Dogecoin ETF approvals The other potential catalyst for the ongoing crypto market rally is that investors are anticipating the approval of some altcoin ETFs in the next few days. Grayscale will launch the spot XRP and DOGE ETF this week and the Chainlink fund next week. Other similar ETFs will be unveiled this week. Eric Balchunas @EricBalchunas · Follow Grayscale Dogecoin ETF $GDOG approved for listing on NYSE, scheduled to begin trading Monday. Their XRP spot is also launching on Monday. $GLNK coming soon as well, week after I think 8:58 PM · Nov 21, 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter These launches are coming at a time when demand for altcoin ETFs are doing well. Data shows that the spot Solana ETFs have added over $510 million in inflows, while XRP funds added $422 million. The Canary Litecoin ETF had inflows of $7.26 million, while Hedera has gained by $76 million. Rising Federal Reserve interest rate cuts odds The crypto market rally is also happening as investors focus on the rising odds that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates. Polymarket data shows that these odds have jumped to 70% from last week’s low of 50%. Similarly, the CME Fed Futures odds for a cut rose to 67.1%. A rate cut and the end of the quantitative tightening will be bullish for the crypto market.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Bitcoin edged higher above $87,000 on Monday as Asian markets opened in a firmer mood, with stocks gaining after traders ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve could deliver a rate cut in December. Investors started the week by adding back risk exposure, encouraged by the prospect of easier policy even as Fed officials continue to send mixed signals. The move came at the start of a busy few days that will bring fresh US retail sales and producer price data, as well as a closely watched budget announcement from British finance minister Rachel Reeves. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $87,461, up 1.5% Ether : $2,854, up 1.1% XRP : $2.08, up 2.6% Total crypto market cap: $3.06 trillion, up 0.9% Fed Easing Bets Surge After Williams Signals Rates Could Fall Soon Expectations for Fed easing picked up after New York Fed President John Williams said on Friday that interest rates can fall “in the near term,” a phrase traders quickly seized on. Fed funds futures now assign about a 57% chance of a 25-basis-point cut next month, up from less than 30% only a week earlier, reflecting a swift repricing of the policy path. Trading in US cash Treasuries was shut in Asia because of a holiday in Japan, but futures held steady, signalling that bond markets are waiting for more data. @LynAldenContact says Bitcoin is unlikely to face a major crash because the market hasn’t reached euphoric conditions. #Bitcoin #Crypto https://t.co/AAETixIwDH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 23, 2025 The outlook for rates has become harder to read after a record US government shutdown earlier this month disrupted economic releases, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday it had “cancelled” the October consumer price report because officials were unable to collect the necessary data. Holiday Closure In Japan Keeps Regional Trading Volumes Muted Even with some of the usual macro signposts missing, the prospect of lower borrowing costs helped lift equities. MSCI’s broad index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose about 0.4%, trimming part of last week’s decline, while South Korea’s tech-heavy Kospi gained roughly 0.7%. Overall activity was thinner than usual as Japanese markets were closed for a holiday. Futures pointed to further stabilisation in Western markets. Contracts linked to the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 added around 0.5%, and Eurozone blue chip futures also advanced, extending the rebound that began on Wall Street on Friday after a run of dovish leaning remarks from Fed officials. Gains across Asia were not evenly shared. Chinese stocks lagged as local chipmakers fell sharply following a report that Washington was considering allowing Nvidia to resume sales of a key chip into the mainland. The main Shanghai and Shenzhen CSI 300 and the Shanghai Composite slipped about 0.3% each, and gains in Hong Kong were capped. Oil Prices Slip As Markets Weigh Potential Supply Boost From Peace Progress At the same time, the possibility of resumed Nvidia shipments offered some relief for China’s large internet platforms, which rely on advanced chips to power artificial intelligence projects. Broader sentiment also took cues from geopolitics. The US and Ukraine said they had agreed on an “updated and refined peace framework” aimed at ending the war with Russia. That development kept pressure on oil prices, as traders weighed the possibility of improved supply conditions if tensions ease further. For crypto-focused investors, the combination of a firmer Bitcoin price, softer yields and a gentler tone from parts of the Fed offered a measure of relief after recent volatility. With key US data still to come and the central bank heading into its early December meeting with an incomplete picture of inflation, traders in Asia are watching whether the renewed appetite for risk can carry Bitcoin further away from last week’s lows.

The price is now recovering from $1.820 and might face hurdles near the $2.150 pivot level. XRP price started a recovery wave from the $1.820 zone. The price is now trading above $2.00 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2.00 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above $2.150. XRP Price Eyes Recovery XRP price extended losses below the $2.00 support, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price even spiked below $1.90 before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $1.8177, and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the $1.88 and $1.95 levels. The bulls were able to push the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.140 swing high to the $1.817 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2.00 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.00 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.140 swing high to the $1.817 low. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.120 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.150 level. A close above $2.150 could send the price to $2.20. The next hurdle sits at $2.250. A clear move above the $2.250 resistance might send the price toward the $2.320 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.40. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.150 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.00 level. The next major support is near the $1.980 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.980 level, the price might continue to decline toward $1.880. The next major support sits near the $1.8450 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.80.

A parliamentary filing this week revealed that nearly 14,000 premises were found to have tapped power illegally since 2020, with operators bypassing or tampering with meters to run mining equipment without detection. Crypto Mining Crisis The Energy and Water Transformation Ministry said the scale of unauthorized consumption, worth RM4.6 billion (worth $1.106 billion), evidenced how the surge in crypto mining has strained national utilities, even in the absence of dedicated regulations for the sector. According to the ministry, authorities have stepped up coordinated enforcement by allowing TNB and multiple agencies, such as the police, the communications regulator, and the anti-corruption commission, to seize mining rigs at targeted sites. Officials added that the utility has created an internal database that stores ownership and tenancy information for locations flagged for suspected power theft, giving investigators a centralized tool to monitor patterns of abnormal electricity usage. The ministry noted that this system now guides inspection efforts and helps identify operations attempting to evade billing. In addition, TNB is also rolling out smart meters at distribution substations to track real-time power flows and detect manipulation early. The government said these measures aim to tighten oversight as illicit crypto mining continues to pose financial and operational risks to Malaysia’s energy network. Crackdown Last August, Malaysian authorities intensified their crackdown on electricity theft linked to cryptocurrency mining, arresting seven individuals believed to be running illegal BTC operations. The suspects, three Malaysians and four foreigners, were detained in separate actions, and police confirmed that they had no prior criminal records. Investigators seized 52 mining rigs and related equipment of around RM250,000, as miners continue to seek low-cost or free power to stay competitive. Police had then noted that electricity theft, an offence under Section 33(5) of the Electricity Ordinance, carries fines of up to RM100,000 and possible jail time. The arrests followed similar findings in Sarawak, where the state utility reported recurring power theft by mining operators. A joint raid there uncovered two linked sites allegedly stealing around RM30,000 in electricity each month, with 120 machines confiscated.

Recent Bitcoin price analysis from top market experts reveals a crucial consolidation phase that could determine the cryptocurrency’s next major move. The world’s largest digital asset appears stuck in a narrow trading range, leaving investors questioning when the next breakout might occur. What Does Current Bitcoin Price Analysis Reveal? According to Vincent Liu, CIO of Kronos Research, the recent Bitcoin rebound represents typical market behavior following sharp declines. His Bitcoin price analysis suggests the asset lacks sufficient momentum to break through current resistance levels. The current consolidation pattern indicates market uncertainty as traders await clearer signals. Liu emphasizes that liquidity constraints continue to pressure Bitcoin’s price action. This detailed Bitcoin price analysis points to several key factors affecting the market: Limited buying pressure at higher price levels Reduced trading volume across major exchanges Institutional hesitation amid regulatory uncertainty Seasonal market patterns affecting cryptocurrency flows Why Is The $88,000 Level So Critical? Crypto analyst Rachael Lucas provides compelling Bitcoin price analysis that highlights the importance of the $88,000 support level. Her examination of market structure reveals fragility in current price action. Lucas warns that failure to maintain this crucial level could trigger significant downward movement. Her technical Bitcoin price analysis identifies several concerning patterns: Weakening support at key psychological levels Decreasing trading volume during recovery attempts Bearish divergence in momentum indicators Increased selling pressure near resistance zones What Can Investors Expect Next? Current Bitcoin price analysis suggests the cryptocurrency will likely continue trading between $85,000 and $90,000 until market conditions improve. Both analysts agree that establishing a solid base above $88,000 remains essential for any sustainable upward movement. This consolidation period, while frustrating for some traders, actually represents healthy market behavior. The comprehensive Bitcoin price analysis from multiple experts converges on several key points: Sideways trading provides opportunity for accumulation Clear break above $90,000 could signal renewed bullish momentum Drop below $85,000 might test the $80,000 support level Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic despite current stagnation How Should Traders Navigate This Phase? Professional Bitcoin price analysis recommends specific strategies during consolidation periods. Rather than fearing sideways movement, experienced traders view these phases as opportunities. The current range-bound trading allows for precise entry and exit points while minimizing volatility risk. Based on thorough Bitcoin price analysis , consider these actionable insights: Monitor volume spikes for breakout confirmation Set alerts at key support and resistance levels Diversify entry points within the trading range Maintain stop-loss orders below critical support Frequently Asked Questions How long might Bitcoin continue trading sideways? Most analysts expect the consolidation phase to last several weeks, depending on market catalysts and trading volume changes. What would trigger a breakout from the current range? Significant institutional buying, positive regulatory developments, or major adoption news could provide the momentum needed for a breakout. Is sideways trading bad for Bitcoin? Not necessarily. Consolidation periods often precede major moves and allow the market to establish stronger support levels. What’s the worst-case scenario if Bitcoin breaks below $85,000? Analysts suggest the next major support sits around $80,000, which would represent approximately a 6% decline from current levels. Should I buy Bitcoin during sideways trading?

This monumental step brings us closer to seeing the first XRP ETF trading on a major U.S. exchange under the ticker symbol XRPZ. For XRP enthusiasts and crypto investors, this represents a potential game-changer in institutional adoption. What Does This XRP ETF Approval Mean for Investors? The NYSE Arca filing with the SEC confirms that Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF meets all necessary exchange requirements. This certification is crucial because it demonstrates that the proposed fund satisfies the exchange’s standards for: Market surveillance procedures Liquidity and trading mechanisms Investor protection measures Operational infrastructure However, it’s important to understand that this doesn’t guarantee SEC approval. The regulatory body must still conduct its own comprehensive review before giving the final green light. Why is the XRP ETF Such a Big Deal? The potential approval of an XRP ETF represents a significant milestone for several reasons. First, it would provide mainstream investors with regulated exposure to XRP without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. This XRP ETF would offer: Enhanced accessibility for traditional investors Regulatory oversight and protection Simplified trading through conventional brokerage accounts Increased legitimacy for XRP as an asset class The XRP ETF proposal comes at a time when institutional interest in digital assets continues to grow exponentially. What Challenges Remain for the XRP ETF? Despite clearing the NYSE Arca hurdle, the XRP ETF faces several significant challenges. The SEC has historically been cautious about approving cryptocurrency-based ETFs, particularly those involving assets with ongoing regulatory questions. Key considerations include: Market manipulation concerns Custody and security arrangements Price discovery mechanisms Ongoing regulatory clarity for XRP Moreover, the SEC will likely examine whether the underlying XRP market provides sufficient protection against fraud and manipulation. How Could This XRP ETF Transform the Market? If approved, Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF could have far-reaching implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. This XRP ETF would potentially: Open floodgates for institutional capital Increase overall market liquidity Set precedent for other cryptocurrency ETFs Enhance price stability through diversified participation The XRP ETF approval could serve as a catalyst for broader regulatory acceptance of digital assets within traditional financial systems. What’s Next for the XRP ETF Application? The SEC now enters a review period where it will evaluate the proposal against various regulatory standards. This process typically involves: Public comment periods Detailed analysis of market impact Assessment of investor protection measures Evaluation of surveillance-sharing agreements The timeline for a decision remains uncertain, but market participants are watching closely for any developments that might indicate the SEC’s position on this innovative XRP ETF product. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for XRP Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF clearing NYSE Arca’s listing requirements marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency evolution. While regulatory hurdles remain, this development signals growing institutional confidence in digital assets. The potential approval of an XRP ETF could fundamentally change how traditional investors access and perceive cryptocurrencies, potentially paving the way for broader market acceptance and integration. Frequently Asked Questions What is an XRP ETF? An XRP ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of XRP, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly owning it. When will the XRP ETF be available for trading? The XRP ETF cannot begin trading until it receives final approval from the SEC, which could take several months or longer. What ticker symbol will the XRP ETF use? The proposed ticker symbol is XRPZ, as indicated in the NYSE Arca filing with the SEC. How is this XRP ETF different from buying XRP directly? The XRP ETF provides regulated exposure through traditional brokerage accounts, eliminating the need for cryptocurrency wallets or exchanges. What are the risks of investing in an XRP ETF? Rights include regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, and the possibility of SEC rejection, in addition to standard investment risks. Could the SEC reject the XRP ETF application? Yes, the SEC has full authority to approve or reject the application based on its assessment of investor protection and market integrity concerns. Found this analysis helpful?

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-is-xrp-done-heres-what-it-means/,"The latest post from Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) has shocked many market participants. He stated that “XRP is done,” sharing a video to back up this seemingly bearish claim. However, the video tells a different story. He highlighted a pattern that many viewers may have missed. His chart suggested strength, not weakness. The setup is similar to previous moments that produced large moves. This implies that XRP may be repeating a bullish historical pattern . #XRP is done. pic.twitter.com/Uo2QtILPk7 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 23, 2025 Historical Oversold Levels The chart shows XRP during previous oversold levels, and each cycle produced a sharp rise immediately after. The numbers show clear positive reactions to oversold conditions in 2020, 2022, and 2024. The 2020 drop created a major shift. XRP reached an extreme reading that year, then surged by 1,600% to a peak of $1.96 in 2021. This move established the pattern that Steph is tracking now. The 2022 oversold point produced another clear reaction. XRP jumped by 250% after hitting that mark. The pattern repeated in 2024. XRP hit the same condition and then climbed by 800%. The increase strengthened the idea that oversold moments for XRP often serve as setups for major swings rather than signals of collapse. Current Conditions and 2025 Targets XRP sits in that same position again. It trades at $2.07 while technical indicators show an oversold reading. The numbers from the previous cycles offer potential targets if the market repeats any of those reactions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A move similar to 2022 would take XRP up by 250% to $7.24. A move that mirrors 2024’s 800% gain would lift the price to double digits , with a target of $18.63. A repeat of the 2020 cycle would produce the largest result. A 1,600% increase from the current level would push XRP to $35.19. XRP’s Next Steps The market now waits for confirmation. Traders understand the role of oversold readings in XRP’s history. The current conditions mirror setups that produced major moves in previous years. Steph’s video brought that history back into focus. The data shows clear reactions in each cycle. His video did not reject the idea of risk, but his chart pointed toward strength. He highlighted the same oversold event that many traders now study. The setup does not guarantee a repeat of past moves, but the numbers offer context for anyone tracking XRP’s long-term structure .

Have you been tracking the dramatic shifts in cryptocurrency investments? The latest data reveals a startling trend: US spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded their fourth consecutive week of net outflows, with a staggering $4.34 billion exiting these funds. This persistent withdrawal pattern raises crucial questions about investor sentiment and market direction. Why Are Bitcoin ETFs Bleeding Billions? The outflow numbers tell a compelling story. According to data from SoSoValue, last week alone saw $1.22 billion leave Bitcoin ETFs. This marks the fourth straight week of negative flows, creating a cumulative outflow that’s shaking investor confidence. The consistent pattern suggests deeper market concerns beyond temporary fluctuations. Several factors could be driving this trend: Market volatility concerns affecting risk appetite Regulatory uncertainty impacting institutional decisions Profit-taking behavior after previous gains Macroeconomic pressures influencing overall investment strategy BlackRock’s IBIT Takes Major Hit: What Does It Mean? The situation becomes more concerning when we examine specific funds. BlackRock’s IBIT experienced $1.09 billion in net outflows last week alone. This represents the second-largest weekly outflow in the fund’s history, signaling significant institutional repositioning. This massive withdrawal from one of the most prominent Bitcoin ETFs indicates that even established players aren’t immune to current market pressures. The scale of these outflows suggests institutional investors might be reassessing their cryptocurrency exposure amid changing market conditions. How Do These Outflows Impact Bitcoin’s Future? While four weeks of consecutive outflows might seem alarming, it’s essential to consider the broader context. Bitcoin ETFs have experienced both massive inflows and outflows throughout their history, reflecting the cryptocurrency market’s dynamic nature. However, the current trend does highlight several important considerations: Market maturity indicators – How institutional investors respond to volatility Price correlation patterns between ETF flows and Bitcoin value Long-term adoption signals despite short-term fluctuations Regulatory development impacts on investor behavior What Can Investors Learn From This Trend? The ongoing Bitcoin ETFs outflow situation provides valuable lessons for both new and experienced investors. Understanding these patterns helps develop better investment strategies and risk management approaches. Key takeaways include: Diversification remains crucial in volatile markets Short-term fluctuations don’t necessarily indicate long-term trends Institutional behavior often precedes retail investor moves Market sentiment can shift rapidly in cryptocurrency spaces Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin ETFs Landscape The $4.34 billion outflow from Bitcoin ETFs over four weeks represents a significant market development that demands attention. While concerning on the surface, these movements are part of the natural ebb and flow that characterizes emerging financial markets. Investors should monitor these trends while maintaining perspective about cryptocurrency’s evolving role in global finance. Frequently Asked Questions How long have Bitcoin ETFs been experiencing outflows? US spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded four consecutive weeks of net outflows, with the cumulative total reaching $4.34 billion. Which Bitcoin ETF saw the largest outflows recently? BlackRock’s IBIT experienced $1.09 billion in net outflows last week, marking the second-largest weekly outflow in the fund’s history. Are these outflows unusual for Bitcoin ETFs? While significant, outflows are part of normal market cycles. Bitcoin ETFs have experienced both substantial inflows and outflows since their introduction. What do these outflows mean for Bitcoin prices? ETF flows can influence short-term price movements, but Bitcoin’s value is affected by multiple factors including adoption, regulation, and macroeconomic conditions. Should investors be concerned about these outflows? Investors should monitor the situation but maintain a long-term perspective. Market fluctuations are common in emerging asset classes like cryptocurrency. Where can I track Bitcoin ETF flow data?

This dramatic market movement presents both alarming challenges and unexpected opportunities for currency traders and investors navigating these turbulent waters. Asia FX Faces Mounting Pressure from Fed Policy Uncertainty The Asian currency complex has entered a dangerous phase as Federal Reserve policy confusion creates massive headwinds across regional markets. Major currencies including the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, and Indonesian rupiah have all experienced significant depreciation against the strengthening US dollar. The primary driver remains the Federal Reserve’s ambiguous stance on interest rate cuts, leaving market participants scrambling for direction. Federal Reserve Doubts Create Global Currency Chaos Why are Federal Reserve doubts causing such widespread market disruption? The answer lies in the delicate balance of global capital flows. When the Fed signals uncertainty about future rate cuts, it triggers a flight to safety that benefits the US dollar at the expense of emerging market currencies. This creates a perfect storm for Asia FX markets, where: Foreign investment outflows accelerate as yields become less attractive Import costs surge due to weaker local currencies Central banks face difficult choices between growth and stability Indian Rupee Defies Gravity with RBI Support Mechanism While most Asian currencies struggle, the Indian rupee has mounted an impressive defense against the dollar onslaught. The Reserve Bank of India has deployed multiple tools to prevent the currency from collapsing to new record lows. Their intervention strategy includes: Intervention Tool Impact Effectiveness Dollar Sales Immediate liquidity support High Forward Market Operations Future currency stability Medium Verbal Intervention Market sentiment management Variable RBI Support Proves Crucial in Currency Market Battle The Reserve Bank of India’s aggressive stance has transformed the rupee’s trajectory from certain collapse to remarkable resilience. Their comprehensive support package demonstrates how central bank intervention can alter market dynamics even in the face of overwhelming global pressures. The RBI’s multi-pronged approach has successfully: Prevented panic selling among domestic investors Maintained import-export balance despite global volatility Protected foreign exchange reserves from excessive depletion Currency Markets at Critical Juncture: What Comes Next? The current situation in currency markets represents a pivotal moment for global financial stability. As Asia FX continues to struggle with Federal Reserve uncertainty, the successful rupee defense provides a blueprint for other central banks. However, the sustainability of these interventions remains questionable if global conditions continue to deteriorate. FAQs: Understanding the Asia FX and Rupee Situation What is causing the Federal Reserve policy uncertainty? Mixed economic data and conflicting inflation signals have created confusion about the timing of potential rate cuts. How effective is RBI intervention in currency markets? The Reserve Bank of India has demonstrated strong capability in managing currency volatility through coordinated market operations. Which Asian currencies are most vulnerable to Fed policy changes? Currencies with large current account deficits and high foreign debt exposure face the greatest risk from Federal Reserve policy shifts. Can the rupee maintain its recovery without continuous RBI support? Sustained recovery requires both domestic economic strength and favorable global conditions beyond just central bank intervention. What impact does this have on cryptocurrency markets? Currency volatility often drives increased interest in cryptocurrencies as alternative stores of value and hedging instruments. The dramatic events unfolding across Asia FX markets underscore the fragile nature of global currency stability. While Federal Reserve doubts continue to create widespread uncertainty, the Indian rupee’s remarkable turnaround demonstrates the power of decisive central bank action. As markets navigate these challenging conditions, the lessons from RBI’s successful intervention will likely influence central bank strategies worldwide. The coming weeks will prove crucial in determining whether this represents a temporary reprieve or the beginning of a new equilibrium in global currency markets.

The announcement , published on an SEC page, reads: “The NYSE Arca certifies its approval for listing and registration of the Grayscale XRP Trust ETF Shares, a series of Grayscale XRP Trust ETF, under the Exchange Act of 1934.” Grayscale’s latest crypto ETFs offer U.S investors easy access to DOGE and XRP, adding to the company’s growing suite of products that track Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , Dogecoin (DOGE), and Ethereum (ETH) . Both listings are direct conversions from Grayscale’s existing private-placement trusts into publicly traded products. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, shared the screenshot of $GDOG’s approval on X and confirmed $GXRP’s approval in the same post. He also hinted that $GLINK, Grayscale’s Chainlink (LINK) ETF, may launch the following week. Grayscale Dogecoin ETF $GDOG approved for listing on NYSE, scheduled to begin trading Monday. Their XRP spot is also launching on Monday. $GLNK coming soon as well, week after I think pic.twitter.com/c6nKUeDrtI — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 21, 2025 Spot ETF Approvals Surge in the U.S. Since the SEC approved the first U.S. spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in January 2024, the number of spot ETFs has surged. Spot crypto ETFs exchange-traded products (ETPs) that mirror the real-time price of an underlying digital asset. They acquire cryptocurrencies from authorised crypto exchanges or other holders and secure them in digital wallets - often cold, offline storage to reduce hacking risks. ETFs then issue shares that correspond to the number of tokens they hold and sell shares on traditional stock exchanges, prices reflecting the prevailing market price of the underlying crypto. Spot crypto ETFs appeal to retail investors who want exposure to cryptocurrency price movements without the risks and complexities of directly purchasing and safeguarding digital assets. Instead of using crypto exchanges and managing private keys, investors can buy ETF shares through traditional brokerages and gain regulated exposure to the asset. Spot ETFs have significantly boosted mainstream crypto adoption by offering convenience, regulatory oversight, market accessibility and potential tax benefits.

Your prayers have been answered. Israeli blockchain innovator Orbs has just launched the groundbreaking dSLTP protocol, bringing professional-grade stop-loss and take-profit functionality to decentralized trading for the very first time. What Exactly is the dSLTP Protocol? The dSLTP protocol represents a quantum leap in DeFi trading security. Built on Orbs’ advanced L3 infrastructure, this innovative solution automatically executes sell orders when tokens hit predetermined price levels. Think of it as your personal trading bodyguard that never sleeps. This breakthrough technology bridges the gap between centralized and decentralized finance. Previously, sophisticated risk management tools were exclusive to platforms like Binance and Coinbase. Now, the dSLTP protocol democratizes these essential features for every DeFi participant. Why Does DeFi Desperately Need Stop-Loss Protection? Imagine watching your portfolio plummet while scrambling to manually execute trades. The dSLTP protocol eliminates this nightmare scenario. Here’s what makes this innovation so crucial: Automated protection against sudden market crashes Emotion-free trading decisions based on preset parameters 24/7 monitoring without requiring constant attention Institutional-grade tools available to retail traders How Does the dSLTP Protocol Actually Work? The mechanics behind the dSLTP protocol are elegantly simple yet powerfully effective. Users set their desired stop-loss and take-profit levels before entering trades. The protocol then vigilantly monitors price movements across multiple decentralized exchanges. When prices approach your predetermined thresholds, the dSLTP protocol springs into action. It automatically executes the trade at the optimal available price, ensuring you never miss your exit point due to slow reflexes or market volatility. What Advantages Does This Bring to DeFi Traders? The implementation of the dSLTP protocol transforms the DeFi trading experience in several meaningful ways. First, it provides peace of mind knowing your positions are protected against unexpected market movements. Moreover, the dSLTP protocol enables more sophisticated trading strategies. You can now set multiple exit points, manage risk more effectively, and participate in DeFi markets with the same confidence as traditional finance veterans. Is This the Future of Decentralized Trading? The introduction of the dSLTP protocol marks a significant milestone in DeFi evolution. By bringing CeFi-level capabilities to decentralized platforms, Orbs is paving the way for mass adoption. This innovation demonstrates that DeFi can compete with traditional finance on features while maintaining its core advantages of transparency, accessibility, and user control. The dSLTP protocol represents just the beginning of this convergence. Final Thoughts: A New Era for DeFi Security The dSLTP protocol isn’t just another DeFi feature—it’s a fundamental upgrade to how we approach decentralized trading. By combining the security of automated risk management with the freedom of blockchain technology, Orbs has created something truly transformative. As more traders discover the power of the dSLTP protocol, we can expect to see increased confidence and participation in DeFi markets. This innovation proves that the future of finance doesn’t have to choose between sophistication and decentralization. Frequently Asked Questions What makes the dSLTP protocol different from existing DeFi tools? The dSLTP protocol specifically addresses the gap in automated risk management that has long separated DeFi from traditional trading platforms, offering true stop-loss and take-profit functionality. Do I need technical knowledge to use the dSLTP protocol? No, the protocol is designed for ease of use. The interface allows traders to set their parameters without needing to understand the complex underlying technology. Which decentralized exchanges support the dSLTP protocol? The protocol is built to be compatible with multiple DEXs, though specific integration details are best checked directly with Orbs’ official documentation and announcements. How secure is the dSLTP protocol against potential exploits? Built on Orbs’ L3 infrastructure, the protocol benefits from multiple security layers, though as with any DeFi tool, users should always conduct their own due diligence. Can the dSLTP protocol guarantee execution at exact price points? While it aims for optimal execution, like all decentralized systems, final execution prices may vary slightly due to network conditions and liquidity factors. Is there any cost to using the dSLTP protocol? Standard network fees apply for transactions, but the protocol itself doesn’t impose additional costs beyond the necessary blockchain transaction fees.

Financial authorities are expected to issue both institutional and individual sanctions, along with fines, against major trading platforms that breached anti-money laundering obligations, according to a local report published Monday. The Korea Financial Intelligence Unit, or FIU, is moving through cases in the order of its on-site inspections, effectively using a first-in, first-out approach. The Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is expected to impose institutional and personal penalties on Korbit, Gopax, Bithumb, and Coinone in sequence, following Dunamu. Industry insiders expect the violations to be similar across exchanges, with penalties comparable to… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 24, 2025 FIU Preparing Sanctions After Completing Major Exchange Inspections The report said that the FIU plans to sanction the remaining large exchanges after already acting against Dunamu, the operator of Upbit. Since last year, the unit has carried out inspections at Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and GOPAX to check compliance with rules such as Know Your Customer checks and the reporting of suspicious transactions. Most fieldwork is now complete, and legal reviews and sanctions committees are underway. Since the FIU is following the sequence of its inspections, markets expect decisions to land in roughly the same order as visits were made. Dunamu was inspected in August last year, followed by Korbit in October, GOPAX in December, Bithumb in March this year and Coinone in April. Bithumb could be pushed back in the queue after an additional on-site review of its order book operations. Sanctions Expected To Follow Dunamu Precedent With Similar Penalties Ahead The process will mirror the Dunamu case, where officials first decided on personal and institutional sanctions, then confirmed the size of the fine. In February, the FIU issued a disciplinary warning to Dunamu’s chief executive and slapped the exchange with a three-month suspension on new customer deposits and withdrawals for breaches of the Special Financial Transactions Act. On Nov. 6, it added a fine of 35.2b won. Industry participants expect similar findings across the remaining exchanges, given that inspectors examined broadly the same anti-money laundering controls. Regulators are expected to announce further institutional and personnel sanctions, alongside sizable monetary penalties. Officials and market observers have signalled that total fines across the group could reach into the hundreds of billions of won, although the final amounts will depend on the number and seriousness of violations at each platform. Crypto Markets Face Stricter Oversight While Korea’s Sanctions Process Continues With four exchanges still awaiting decisions, the FIU is unlikely to finish its sanctions calendar this year. Most of the remaining actions are expected to be wrapped up by the first half of next year, keeping regulatory pressure elevated over a period when global crypto markets are already adjusting to stricter oversight. The enforcement drive comes as South Korea faces renewed uncertainty over its long-delayed crypto tax regime . Officials have warned that the country is still far from ready to start taxing virtual assets by the scheduled Jan. 2027 date, citing gaps in infrastructure and detailed guidance. After five years of political debate, technical planning and repeated postponements, talk of a fourth delay has returned to the agenda. In parallel, policymakers are trying to show they are still open to innovation. The ruling Democratic Party recently launched a new crypto policy task force that it says will “foster growth” in digital assets and blockchain.

Strategy founder Michael Saylor rejected MSCI’s classification, and argued his firm is a Bitcoin-backed structured finance company, not a passive investment vehicle. If the rule goes through, companies with more than 50% of their balance sheets in crypto would lose index eligibility and the passive capital that comes with it. JP Morgan Faces Crypto Uprising The backlash against JP Morgan intensified over the weekend when frustration surged in the Bitcoin community after news that MSCI, the influential index provider formerly known as Morgan Stanley Capital International, plans to exclude crypto treasury companies from its indexes beginning in January 2026. The proposal was shared in a JP Morgan research note, and led to a wave of criticism and boycott calls from Bitcoin advocates and retail supporters who argue that the decision could trigger damaging sell-offs and destabilize the crypto market. The sentiment online quickly escalated. Real estate investor and outspoken Bitcoin supporter Grant Cardone said he already withdrew $20 million from Chase and intended to sue the bank over alleged credit card misconduct. Max Keiser amplified the boycott message by urging followers to “Crash JP Morgan and buy Strategy and BTC.” Many in the Bitcoin community see the proposed exclusion policy as a direct attack on companies that hold large amounts of digital assets on their balance sheets, especially those seen as key pillars of the ecosystem. MSCI’s proposed changes would apply to any company with 50% or more of its balance sheet in crypto assets. Such firms would no longer qualify for index inclusion, which could have severe knock-on effects. Index-tracking funds and asset managers, which are required to hold only approved financial instruments, would be forced to sell affected stocks automatically. The resulting sell pressure could greatly impact share prices of crypto treasury companies and potentially spill over into the digital asset markets themselves. One of the most heavily affected firms could be Strategy, the Bitcoin-focused treasury company that was founded by Michael Saylor. After being added to the Nasdaq 100 in December of 2024, Strategy benefited from passive inflows tied to index funds. Saylor pushed back hard against the MSCI proposal, and argued that the classification is fundamentally flawed. He explained that Strategy is “not a fund, not a trust, and not a holding company,” but rather a “Bitcoin-backed structured finance company” that actively creates, issues, and operates financial products. According to Saylor, treating active Bitcoin treasury companies like passive investment entities misrepresents their function and penalizes innovation. Analysts warn that if the MSCI policy is finalized, the affected companies will face a difficult choice: either reduce their crypto exposure below the 50% threshold or sacrifice their index eligibility — and with it, crucial passive capital flows.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-24 05:30:00

The Grant Cardone JPMorgan boycott represents a dramatic stand against what many in the crypto community see as institutional attacks on emerging financial technologies. This bold move comes after JPMorgan issued warnings about potential massive outflows from Strategy, triggering a chain reaction across markets. Why Is Grant Cardone Leading This JPMorgan Boycott? The Grant Cardone JPMorgan boycott began when the banking behemoth published a report predicting Strategy could face up to $2.8 billion in outflows if removed from the MSCI index. Cardone responded immediately by closing his JPMorgan accounts and transferring his funds to Wells Fargo. Moreover, he publicly urged concerned investors to stop using Chase credit cards, calling for collective action against what he perceives as anti-competitive behavior. This dramatic escalation highlights the growing tension between traditional financial institutions and the cryptocurrency sector. The banking giant’s warning caused Strategy’s stock price to plummet below $200, hitting a yearly low of around $170 last Friday. Consequently, crypto community members have rallied behind Cardone’s protest, describing the situation as a coordinated attack on innovation. What Does This Boycott Mean for Investors? The Grant Cardone JPMorgan boycott represents more than just one investor’s protest. It signals a fundamental shift in how successful investors view traditional banking relationships. Here are the key implications: Institutional credibility at stake – Major banks face growing scrutiny over their crypto positions Investor migration – High-net-worth individuals are reconsidering banking partnerships Market volatility – Banking reports can significantly impact crypto-related stocks Regulatory attention – Such public disputes often attract regulatory review Furthermore, this situation demonstrates how quickly financial alliances can change in today’s digital economy. The speed at which Cardone moved his accounts underscores the fluid nature of modern banking relationships. How Are Markets Reacting to This Banking Protest? The immediate market reaction to the Grant Cardone JPMorgan boycott has been significant. Strategy’s stock experienced sharp declines, while other crypto-related assets showed increased volatility. However, the broader impact extends beyond price movements. This protest has sparked crucial conversations about: Banking transparency in crypto reporting Institutional influence on emerging technologies Investor protection in volatile markets The future of bank-crypto relationships Market analysts are closely watching whether other prominent investors will join Cardone’s protest. The potential for a wider movement could reshape how traditional banks approach cryptocurrency analysis and reporting. What Can We Learn From This Financial Standoff? The Grant Cardone JPMorgan boycott teaches us several important lessons about modern finance. First, individual investors now have platforms to challenge institutional narratives. Second, the lines between traditional and digital finance continue to blur. Most importantly, this situation shows that financial credibility works both ways – institutions must maintain trust with their clients just as investors must trust their financial partners. This protest also highlights the growing power of social proof in financial decisions. When respected investors like Cardone take public stands, they influence market sentiment and individual investment choices. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Grant Cardone start boycotting JPMorgan? Cardone initiated the boycott after JPMorgan warned about potential massive outflows from Strategy, which he viewed as an unfair attack on the company and its investors. How much money did Cardone move from JPMorgan? While exact figures aren’t disclosed, Cardone confirmed he closed all his JPMorgan accounts and transferred his funds to Wells Fargo. What impact did JPMorgan’s report have on Strategy’s stock? The report caused Strategy’s stock price to fall sharply, dropping below $200 and hitting a yearly low of around $170.

At the same time, cryptocurrencies surged, led by Bitcoin’s climb to $87,000, while political developments took center stage with President Donald Trump preparing to outline a healthcare cost proposal and the US and Ukraine advancing a new peace framework. Global markets surge Global equities found renewed strength on Monday, recovering from last week’s volatility that stemmed partly from concerns over stretched technology valuations. Investors positioned ahead of a data-heavy week featuring US retail sales and producer price figures, as well as the UK’s budget announcement from Finance Minister Rachel Reeves. MSCI’s broad index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.99%, while South Korea’s Kospi added 0.3%. Japan’s markets were closed for a public holiday, keeping trading volumes subdued. Futures tied to major US indices pointed to further gains: Nasdaq futures climbed 0.81%, S&P 500 futures advanced 0.53% and EUROSTOXX 50 futures were up 0.76%. The positive momentum followed comments from Fed official John Williams, who said interest rates could fall “in the near term,” reinforcing expectations for easing. Goldman Sachs now expects a December rate cut followed by additional reductions in March and June 2026. Fed funds futures show a 57% probability of a 25-basis-point cut next month, up sharply from under 30% a week earlier. In currency markets, the yen weakened to 156.54 per dollar, hovering near a 10-month low as investors watched for potential intervention from Japanese authorities. The dollar remained firm against the euro and sterling. Crude oil prices eased slightly, with Brent at $61.29 a barrel and US crude at $58.07. Spot gold declined 0.5% to $4,045.45 an ounce. Donald Trump to unveil new healthcare plan President Donald Trump is preparing to unveil a framework aimed at addressing US healthcare costs, with an announcement expected as early as Monday, reported MSNBC, citing White House officials. The plan, dubbed the “Healthcare Price Cuts Act,” seeks to eliminate what the administration calls “surprise premium hikes” under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). It would end zero-premium subsidies and introduce minimum payments to verify eligibility and curb alleged “ghost beneficiaries.” The proposal also includes a deposit program that would direct savings from lower-premium plans into taxpayer-funded Health Savings Accounts. Trump will present the plan alongside CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz at the White House. With ACA subsidies set to expire at year-end, risking sharp premium increases for nearly 22 million Americans, both parties face mounting pressure to act. Recent polling from KFF shows 74% of Americans support extending ACA tax credits. Crypto markets surge Cryptocurrencies rallied strongly on Monday, with Bitcoin jumping to $87,000 and total market capitalization touching $3 trillion. Altcoins such as Canton, Hedera, Story, Bittensor, Kaspa, and Hyperliquid gained over 6%. Analysts attribute the upswing partly to investors buying the dip after significant recent declines. Bitcoin’s RSI fell to 27 on Friday, signaling oversold conditions. A broader stock market rally also helped lift sentiment, reinforcing the close correlation between equities and digital assets. Futures data from CoinGlass show open interest rising 1.9% to $127 billion, indicating increased leveraged positioning. Liquidations have dropped, suggesting a stabilization in the market. Meanwhile, anticipation of new altcoin ETFs, including spot XRP and Dogecoin products from Grayscale, added momentum. Strong inflows into existing Solana and XRP funds have reinforced expectations of sustained demand. United States and Ukraine advance peace framework Geopolitical headlines also shaped broader market sentiment. The US and Ukraine announced they have developed an “updated and refined peace framework” aimed at ending the war with Russia. The White House described the discussions as “constructive” and emphasized a shared commitment to pursuing a lasting peace. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the meeting with Ukrainian officials “the most productive and meaningful so far.” President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine is fully committed to diplomacy, prioritizing “reliable peace, guaranteed security” and respect for those defending the country. The developments offered cautious optimism for markets, particularly in commodities, where hopes of improved supply dynamics weighed on oil prices.

Economist Reveals What Happens If Bitcoin Falls 90%,https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-trouble-bitcoin/,"Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has been in the headlines recently following the Bitcoin price crash into the $84,000 territory. The market crash had put it dangerously close to the company’s average buy price of $74,443, with only a 30% crash separating the company’s massive 649,870 BTC holding from being in the red. This has led the company to publicly defend its position and strategy amid call-outs from the likes of economist Peter Schiff. Strategy’s Bitcoin Stash In Trouble? Last week, economist Peter Schiff first called out the Strategy team , questioning the viability of its Bitcoin strategy given that the price of the digital asset was crashing. This came amid call-outs that Michael Saylor’s strategy of issuing MSTR shares to buy Bitcoin was already failing. Schiff, in an X post, called out the company’s entire business model of issuing preferred stocks and then using the proceeds to actually buy more Bitcoin. According to the analyst, the company’s entire business model was actually based on the fact that the issued preferred shares were being bought by income-oriented funds while the company accumulates Bitcoin. However, Schiff called out the company that it would not be able to actually pay out the published yields. In this case, once the fund managers realize that these published yields will never be fulfilled, they would have no choice but to begin dumping out their MSTR stocks, triggering a ‘death spiral.’ At the time, the company had addressed the rumors of its potential bankruptcy, explaining that the company had a very long runway. As the post made on X read, “At current $BTC levels, we have 71 years of dividend coverage assuming the price stays flat.” Additionally, the post explained that only a 1.41% appreciation in the Bitcoin price actually covers the company’s dividend obligations. Despite this, Schiff has not let up on the company, with another post addressing Strategy’s claim that a 90% Bitcoin crash would not affect the company. The economist explains that even if this were true, it is unlikely that Strategy’s investors would actually be fine with losing 90% of their investment. In the event that the Bitcoin price does crash 90%, Peter Schiff explains that the MSTR stock will likely be trading at a huge discount compared to its BTC holdings. In this case, it could accelerate the losses of its investors. On the BTC front, with the price still trending above $80,000, the Strategy stash is still firmly in profit. According to data from the Bitcoin Treasuries website, the company is still sitting on 16% gains, bringing its current profit on its holdings to over $5 billion at the time of writing.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Economist|Economist news|MicroStrategy|MicroStrategy Bitcoin|MicroStrategy BTC|MicroStrategy news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-24 06:00:47

In a recent post, crypto investor 24HRSCRYPTO outlined why he believes XRP’s future strength is tied to liquidity, usage, and the practical needs of global financial infrastructure. His comparison between Bitcoin and XRP centers on what he sees as the difference between speculation and genuine utility, presenting his case through clear numbers and long-term projections. Rest assured, $100 XRP is not a dream. It’s math, liquidity, and patience. Imagine having the discipline to put $5,000 in and actually hold until 2030… Here’s me being generous and running a fair comparison…. even though most people are completely misled about where Bitcoin’s… — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) November 21, 2025 A Structured Look at Value and Outcomes 24HRSCRYPTO uses a simple investment scenario to illustrate his point: a $5,000 allocation held until 2030. In this model, he compares Bitcoin at a projected price of $1.5 million to XRP at $100 . Based on his calculations, the Bitcoin position would return approximately $89,000, while the XRP position would generate around $259,000. He notes that the comparison is deliberately fair and generous, given that many investors misunderstand where Bitcoin’s future growth is expected to come from. He states that Bitcoin’s upside is driven mostly by speculation, relying on market participants purchasing the asset at higher levels. He contrasts this with what he views as XRP’s foundation in settlement demand, utility , and the liquidity requirements of financial institutions. From his perspective, XRP’s potential is based on the real volume expected to move through systems designed for global transactions. He presents this distinction as the reason long-term consistency holds more weight than reactive market behavior, especially for assets built for operational use. Reactions From the Community Not everyone agreed with the long-term projection. XRPWON-Jason Jude criticized the $100 figure, arguing that XRP has not yet crossed the $5 threshold and that discussions about significantly higher targets appear unrealistic at this stage. He expressed the need for more grounded expectations before considering such levels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another community member, Don, supported the idea that the utility will define which assets survive. He pointed out that the crypto market has changed, and investors entering the space now prioritize tokens that serve a clear role. He noted that projects without purpose will struggle, reinforcing the view that long-term relevance depends on real-world application rather than hype-driven cycles. 24HRSCRYPTO’s analysis emphasizes the difference he sees between speculative growth and utility-based value. His argument centers on XRP’s connection to liquidity, settlement activity, and institutional demand. Whether or not his price target proves correct, his position reflects the ongoing focus on assets built for tangible financial use, rather than those driven purely by market momentum.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin’s recent rally has reversed, with NYDIG calling the shift “actual capital flight.” October’s liquidation event broke the inflow loop, turning spot ETFs into a headwind and compressing DAT premiums and stablecoin supply. Despite outflows, Bitcoin dominance is rising as traders rotate out of risk assets. Head of research Greg Cipolaro said the same reflexive loop that powered Bitcoin’s run, ETF inflows, digital asset treasury (DAT) demand and rising stablecoin liquidity, has now flipped into reverse, signaling what he calls “actual capital flight,” not just sour sentiment. ETF Inflows Flip Negative After October Shakeout, Says NYDIG In a Friday note , Cipolaro explained that Bitcoin’s last major leg higher was closely tied to strong inflows into spot ETFs and aggressive treasury accumulation. However, a sharp liquidation event in early October broke that loop. ETF inflows turned negative, DAT premiums collapsed and stablecoin supply slipped for the first time in months. These are, he said, the classic markers of liquidity leaving the system. “Once that loop breaks, the market tends to follow a predictable sequence,” Cipolaro wrote. “Liquidity tightens, leverage tries to rebuild but fails to gain traction, and narratives that previously drove inflows stop working. The story changes, but the mechanics don’t.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the market’s biggest success story of 2024–2025, have now become a headwind, reversing from a consistent inflow engine into sizable net outflows. Cipolaro emphasized that broader factors like global liquidity shifts, macro uncertainties and structural market stress are all helping shape the current drawdown. $BTC ETF Inflows & Outflow Statements Prepare yourself for everything coming your way with INFINIT, go through every recent market updates with just a PROMPT chart – @Infinit_Labs pic.twitter.com/KsiMoXxq72 — chainsage (@cryptovishal7) November 24, 2025 Despite the selloff, Bitcoin dominance is rising, a familiar pattern during market downturns. As riskier assets unwind, capital often retreats into Bitcoin as the most liquid and established asset. Dominance briefly pushed above 60% in early November before settling around 58%, per CoinMarketCap. DATs and stablecoins were a major structural demand base for Bitcoin earlier in the cycle. Now, DAT premiums have compressed across the sector and stablecoin supply has dipped, signaling that investors are pulling liquidity out of crypto broadly. Still, Cipolaro said the DAT space remains stable, with no visible signs of financial stress. “Leverage remains modest, interest obligations are manageable, and many DAT structures allow issuers to suspend dividend or coupon payments if needed,” he said. Long-Term Bitcoin Thesis Unshaken Even as near-term risk builds, Cipolaro argued that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, driven by institutional adoption, sovereign interest and its role as neutral programmable money, remains unchanged. “Nothing in the past few weeks changes that long-horizon trajectory,” he wrote. “But the cycle story — driven by flows, leverage and reflexive behavior — is now asserting itself more forcefully. Investors should hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.” He warned that if past cycles are any indication, the path ahead may be uneven and emotionally taxing, marked by sudden dislocations as liquidity reshuffles once again. As reported, the New York Stock Exchange has approved the listing of Grayscale’s XRP and Dogecoin exchange-traded funds, clearing both products to begin trading on Monday.

South Korea’s premier digital asset exchange, Bithumb, has just announced a groundbreaking development that’s set to shake up the crypto market.

This strategic move opens up new trading opportunities for Korean investors and international traders alike. What Makes the Bithumb PIEVERSE Listing So Important? The Bithumb PIEVERSE listing represents more than just another cryptocurrency addition to the exchange’s portfolio. Bithumb stands as one of South Korea’s largest and most trusted cryptocurrency platforms, making this listing a substantial vote of confidence in the PIEVERSE project.

The KRW trading pair means Korean investors can directly purchase PIEVERSE using their local currency, eliminating the need for multiple conversion steps. Why Should You Care About This New Listing Opportunity? New exchange listings often create significant market movements and trading opportunities. The Bithumb PIEVERSE listing could potentially drive increased liquidity and visibility for the token. Here are key benefits you should consider: Enhanced Accessibility : Korean traders can now access PIEVERSE directly through their preferred local exchange Increased Liquidity : More trading pairs typically lead to better price discovery and reduced slippage Market Validation : Bithumb’s rigorous listing process adds credibility to the PIEVERSE project Convenient Trading : Direct KRW pairing simplifies the buying and selling process for Korean investors How Can You Prepare for the Bithumb PIEVERSE Trading Launch?

Korean exchanges typically require comprehensive KYC procedures, so complete these requirements well in advance. Second, research the PIEVERSE project thoroughly—understand its use case, technology, and roadmap. Third, monitor market conditions leading up to the listing, as broader crypto market trends can significantly impact new token performance. Remember that new listings often experience high volatility during initial trading hours. Consider setting limit orders rather than market orders to maintain price control. Additionally, diversify your approach rather than going all-in immediately after listing. What Challenges Might Traders Face with This New Listing? While the Bithumb PIEVERSE listing presents exciting opportunities, traders should remain aware of potential challenges. Initial trading volume might be unpredictable, potentially leading to price swings. Furthermore, as with any new listing, there could be technical issues or delays during the first hours of trading. Regulatory considerations remain important for Korean traders. Always ensure compliance with local cryptocurrency regulations and tax reporting requirements. International traders should verify whether their jurisdictions permit trading on South Korean exchanges. Final Thoughts: Seizing the Bithumb PIEVERSE Opportunity The Bithumb PIEVERSE listing represents a significant development in the cryptocurrency landscape. This move not only expands trading options but also demonstrates growing institutional confidence in emerging digital assets. As November 24 approaches, informed preparation will be key to capitalizing on this new market opportunity. This listing could serve as a catalyst for increased adoption and recognition of the PIEVERSE ecosystem. However, always remember that cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks. Conduct thorough research, implement risk management strategies, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Frequently Asked Questions What time does Bithumb PIEVERSE trading begin? Trading starts at 8:00 a.m. UTC on November 24 for the KRW trading pair. Can international traders participate in the Bithumb PIEVERSE listing?

Enhanced governance mechanism upgrades, ecosystem development, and expanded global community outreach will drive the DAO’s future roadmap. Meanwhile, the platform will deepen its focus on the CeFi and DeFi integration, ultimately delivering a new financial order to the industry that is more transparent, efficient, and verifiable.

Is the Drop Over? Here's What Analysts Say",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-btc-crosses-87000-is-the-drop-over-heres-what-analysts-say/,"Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery after the sharp decline and mass liquidations experienced at the beginning of last week. Bitcoin Rises to $87,500 Despite Fragile Market Structure The world's largest crypto asset rose 1.8% in the last 24 hours to reach $87,645. The price fell to around $81,000 on Friday, sparking widespread market panic. Not only Bitcoin but also other major cryptocurrencies are showing a recovery trend. Ethereum is trading at $2,834, up 0.5 percent, XRP is trading at $2.09, up 2.65 percent, and Solana is trading at $133, up 2.5 percent. The overall crypto market capitalization is also up 1 percent in the last 24 hours. Analysts describe this rise as “a rapid reaction rise on a fragile base.” Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu stated that the current price action is a “post-flush bounce, with shallow liquidity, fragmented flow, and long-term investors accumulating.” Liu stated that Bitcoin could enter a tight consolidation period in the $85,000-$90,000 range in the short term. Market sentiment remains weak, with the fear and greed index currently at 19 points, down from 13 at the start of the week and still in “extreme fear” territory. Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase following its sharpest correction of the cycle, according to BTC Markets analyst Rachael Lucas. Lucas said that while the price holding above $86,000 is positive, the market structure remains fragile. According to the analyst, persistence above $88,000 will confirm the bottom formation; otherwise, the price may drop back to the $80,000 level. Lucas also emphasized that short-term investors are closely monitoring funding rates and liquidation levels, while long-term investors still rely on Bitcoin's inherent demand. For institutional investors, he noted that this is not an exit, but a “rotation period,” and that ETF outflows are being considered within the scope of risk management. *This is not investment advice.

This staggering $2 billion open interest reveals crucial insights about trader expectations and market sentiment. But what does this massive position really mean for Bitcoin’s future price trajectory? Why Is the Bitcoin Options Market So Active Right Now? The Bitcoin options market has become a key indicator of institutional and professional trader sentiment. Currently, the $80,000 put options lead the pack with approximately $2 billion in open interest. This massive position suggests that many traders are either hedging against potential downside or betting on Bitcoin failing to reach $80,000 in the near term. Following closely behind are $85,000 put options with $1.97 billion in open interest. However, the third-largest position tells a different story – $140,000 call options valued at $1.56 billion. This divergence creates an intriguing battle between bearish and bullish perspectives within the Bitcoin options market. What Do These Massive Put Options Really Mean? Put options give holders the right to sell Bitcoin at a specific price. The concentration around $80,000 indicates several possible scenarios: Hedging strategy : Large holders protecting their Bitcoin investments Bearish speculation : Traders betting on price declines Risk management : Institutions preparing for volatility The sheer size of these positions demonstrates how mature the Bitcoin options market has become. With billions in open interest, these aren’t small retail trades but significant institutional moves that could influence broader market direction. How Does the Call Option Activity Compare? While put options dominate the top positions, the $140,000 call options represent substantial bullish interest. This creates a fascinating dynamic in the Bitcoin options market where both extreme bearish and extremely bullish positions coexist. The call options suggest some traders remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential despite the protective put positions. This divergence often occurs during periods of uncertainty or before major market-moving events. Traders use the Bitcoin options market to express their views while managing risk through different strike prices and expiration dates. What Should Crypto Investors Watch Next? Monitoring the Bitcoin options market provides valuable signals for all cryptocurrency participants. Key factors to watch include: Open interest changes at key strike prices Volume spikes around major economic events Put-call ratios for sentiment indicators Expiration dates that could trigger volatility The current activity in the Bitcoin options market suggests professional traders are preparing for significant price movements. Whether this leads to breakout or breakdown will depend on broader market fundamentals and macroeconomic conditions. Conclusion: Navigating the Options Landscape The dominance of $80,000 put options in the Bitcoin options market reveals sophisticated risk management at play. While it might seem bearish on surface, these positions often represent hedging rather than outright pessimism. The simultaneous presence of large call options indicates continued long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s potential. Understanding these dynamics helps investors make more informed decisions. The Bitcoin options market has evolved into a crucial barometer of institutional sentiment, providing insights beyond simple price charts. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin put options? Bitcoin put options give holders the right to sell Bitcoin at a specific price by a certain date. They’re often used for protection against price declines or for bearish speculation. Why are $80,000 put options so popular? The $80,000 strike price represents a key psychological level where many traders want protection or see potential resistance. The $2 billion position suggests significant institutional activity. Does high put option volume mean Bitcoin will drop? Not necessarily. Large put positions often represent hedging by Bitcoin holders rather than pure bearish bets. Many institutions use puts to protect long positions. How does options trading affect Bitcoin’s price? Options trading doesn’t directly impact spot prices, but large positions can influence market sentiment and dealer hedging activities that might affect price movements. What’s the difference between puts and calls? Put options profit from price declines, while call options benefit from price increases. Both provide leverage and risk management capabilities. Where can I track Bitcoin options data? Major derivatives exchanges like Deribit provide real-time options data. Many financial data platforms also offer options market analytics for Bitcoin.

This shocking revelation comes as Binance, the global cryptocurrency giant, intensifies its surveillance of North Korean crypto hacking operations that threaten the entire digital asset ecosystem. Why Is North Korean Crypto Hacking So Dangerous? North Korea’s sophisticated cyber operations have evolved into a major threat to cryptocurrency security. According to Kim Min-jae, Binance’s specialist investigator, these illicit activities involve complex hacking schemes that steal virtual assets through various criminal methods. The stolen funds then spread across multiple exchanges, creating a web of illegal transactions that challenges global security protocols. During the recent “Binance Blockchain Study” event in Seoul, investigators revealed the alarming scale of these operations. The North Korean crypto hacking network operates with military precision, targeting digital assets to bypass international sanctions and fund prohibited activities. How Does Binance Combat This Threat? Binance employs advanced monitoring systems to track suspicious activities linked to North Korean crypto hacking. The exchange’s security team focuses on several key areas: Real-time transaction monitoring across the blockchain network Pattern recognition algorithms that detect unusual fund movements International collaboration with law enforcement agencies Multi-exchange coordination to track fund dispersal The exchange’s proactive approach to monitoring North Korean crypto hacking demonstrates its commitment to maintaining market integrity. By identifying and reporting suspicious transactions, Binance helps prevent the laundering of illegally obtained digital assets. What Makes This Monitoring So Crucial? The persistence of North Korean crypto hacking poses significant risks to the entire cryptocurrency industry. These operations not only steal valuable assets but also undermine trust in digital currencies. When hackers successfully move stolen funds through multiple exchanges, they create challenges for regulatory compliance and investor protection. Moreover, the sophistication of North Korean crypto hacking techniques continues to evolve. Investigators note that these groups employ advanced methods to conceal their activities, making detection increasingly difficult. This constant cat-and-mouse game requires continuous innovation in security measures. What Are the Global Implications? The fight against North Korean crypto hacking extends beyond individual exchanges. This battle affects: International security and sanctions enforcement Cryptocurrency adoption and mainstream acceptance Investor confidence in digital asset safety Regulatory framework development worldwide As Binance continues its vigilance against North Korean crypto hacking, the entire industry benefits from enhanced security protocols. The exchange’s efforts contribute to a safer ecosystem for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions How serious is the North Korean crypto hacking threat? Extremely serious. North Korea ranks as the world’s third-largest Bitcoin holder primarily through illicit activities, making their hacking operations a top priority for global security agencies. What methods do North Korean hackers use? They employ sophisticated cyber attacks including phishing schemes, exchange breaches, and malware to steal cryptocurrencies, then use multiple exchanges to launder the funds. How effective is Binance’s monitoring system? Binance’s advanced detection systems have proven highly effective in identifying and tracking suspicious transactions linked to North Korean crypto hacking activities. Can individual investors protect themselves? Yes, by using reputable exchanges, enabling two-factor authentication, and monitoring transaction histories regularly, investors can significantly reduce their risk exposure. What happens when Binance detects suspicious activity? The exchange freezes suspicious accounts, reports to relevant authorities, and collaborates with other exchanges to track fund movements across platforms. Are other exchanges also monitoring this threat? Yes, most major exchanges now implement similar monitoring systems, though Binance’s scale and resources give it particular advantage in tracking North Korean crypto hacking patterns.

This concentration establishes the range as an important area of interest because it reflects a significant volume of holders whose positions originate around that price. The heatmap attached to the tweet shows a dense band of supply in this region, indicating that it has acted as a cost basis for a wide portion of the market over the past several months. The chart displays price movements from late 2024 through November 2025, with the highlighted cost basis cluster aligning with the analyst’s point. The supply indicator, included in the heatmap, reinforces the scale of this zone by showing how much XRP corresponds to that cost basis level. The chart’s snapshot for November 20, 2025, identifies a cost basis range slightly above $1.75, consistent with the figure cited in the commentary.

Crypto Evan expressed that the support zone at $1.75 could remain intact if market conditions stabilize, expressing interest in monitoring for a potential upward move. Another commenter, Emily, took a more cautious stance, noting that the support level may be at risk if downward pressure continues. These reactions reflect different expectations around the impact of concentrated cost basis areas. For some, these zones represent potential stabilization points if holders choose not to sell below their acquisition range. For others, large clusters of supply may raise the risk of heavier selling if the price falls meaningfully beneath these thresholds. The data presented in the shared heatmap contributes to a broader understanding of XRP’s current technical landscape . Cost basis concentrations often provide insight into how holders might behave during periods of volatility. With the $1.75 level marking one of the largest supply clusters, traders may continue to monitor whether the asset sustains movement above this point or tests it further.

The Hong Kong-based Web3 investor said the approval from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority would allow it, once conditions are met and final sign-off is granted, to manage a collective investment fund in or from the ADGM. For a company that has long positioned itself at the intersection of gaming, NFTs and digital assets, the move marks a push deeper into institutional territory. Middle East Expansion Gains Momentum With Abu Dhabi Regulatory Backing Animoca Brands describes itself as a digital asset advisory services and an investment management arm that now backs more than 600 portfolio companies. The in-principle approval strengthens that strategy by giving the firm a clearer regulatory footing for capital formation and fund structures. The company has been steadily expanding in the Middle East and already maintains a presence in Dubai to support Web3 activity across the region. The Abu Dhabi decision, while still conditional, advances its plan to build a regulated footprint in key markets, subject to local licences and approvals. Omar Elassar, managing director for the Middle East and head of global strategic partnerships at Animoca Brands, said, “The UAE is a growing hub for activity in Web3 and digital assets. This in-principle approval supports our regional strategy to build regulated, institutional pathways for participation while continuing to partner with founders and enterprises across the ecosystem.” ADGM officials framed the move as part of their effort to attract more blockchain and digital asset players into a rules-based environment. Middle East Expansion Gains Momentum With Abu Dhabi Regulatory Backing Animoca Brands is pursuing its regulatory buildout alongside a return to public markets. Earlier this month, it entered into a non-binding agreement with Nasdaq-listed Currenc Group to pursue a reverse merger that targets a valuation of about $1b, with closing expected by the end of 2026. If completed on those terms, shareholders of Animoca Brands would own roughly 95% of the combined company’s issued shares, while existing Currenc shareholders would hold about 5%. The proposed deal would mark Animoca’s comeback to public markets after it was delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange in 2020 amid governance concerns and its involvement in crypto-related activities.

Firms first engage in pre-application discussions, submit a detailed regulatory business plan, ownership information, financial projections and their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing framework. The FSRA then reviews technology, custody arrangements and senior staff, including senior executive officers and compliance leaders. Only after those checks does the regulator issue an in-principle approval, which is a conditional green light rather than a licence to operate. The IPA comes with a list of requirements, such as meeting base capital thresholds, finalizing systems, obtaining residence visas for key personnel and lining up third-party audits. Once a firm satisfies those conditions within the required timeframe and evidences this to the FSRA, it can obtain full Financial Services Permission. That final licence allows the company to incorporate within ADGM, secure a commercial licence and begin regulated activities such as trading, custody or advisory services for virtual assets. Well-prepared applicants typically move through the full process within a few months.

The community has proposed a dramatic acceleration in Solana inflation reduction that could reshape its economic future. This bold move through governance proposal SIMD-0411 represents one of the most significant economic adjustments in recent blockchain history. What Does the Solana Inflation Reduction Proposal Actually Mean? The Solana community has introduced SIMD-0411, a governance initiative that seeks to double the current inflation reduction rate from 15% to 30%. This accelerated Solana inflation reduction strategy would push the network toward its long-term economic targets much faster than originally planned. The proposal demonstrates the community’s commitment to creating sustainable token economics. If approved, this enhanced Solana inflation reduction approach would achieve the target 1.5% inflation rate by early 2029. This timeline represents a substantial three-year acceleration compared to the original 2032 schedule. The faster timeline reflects growing confidence in Solana’s ecosystem maturity and adoption trajectory. Why Accelerate Solana Inflation Reduction Now? The timing of this proposal raises important questions about current market conditions and strategic planning. Several factors make this an opportune moment for enhanced Solana inflation reduction measures: Ecosystem maturity – Solana has demonstrated robust network performance and growing adoption Market conditions – Current economic environment favors deflationary monetary policies Community consensus – Growing support for faster transition to sustainable tokenomics Competitive positioning – Aligning with industry trends toward economic sustainability The accelerated Solana inflation reduction plan signals strong confidence in the network’s ability to thrive under more conservative monetary policy. This move could potentially enhance Solana’s appeal to long-term investors seeking predictable token economics. How Will This Impact SOL Holders and the Broader Ecosystem? The implications of this accelerated Solana inflation reduction extend across the entire ecosystem. For SOL token holders, the changes could create several important effects: Enhanced scarcity – Reduced token issuance could increase scarcity over time Price stability – Lower inflation typically supports price stability Long-term value – Sustainable economics often correlate with sustained value appreciation Staking adjustments – Validators and stakers may need to adapt to changing reward structures The broader Solana inflation reduction strategy also affects developers and projects building on the network. A predictable economic environment can encourage long-term planning and investment in ecosystem development. What Challenges Could This Accelerated Timeline Present? While the benefits of faster Solana inflation reduction are compelling, the proposal also presents potential challenges that the community must consider: Transition speed – Rapid changes require careful economic management Staking economics – Validators must adjust to changing reward structures Market adaptation – The market needs time to price in the accelerated timeline Governance coordination – Successful implementation requires broad community support The Solana inflation reduction proposal represents a calculated risk that balances immediate economic adjustments against long-term sustainability goals. The community’s ability to navigate these challenges will determine the proposal’s ultimate success. Conclusion: A Bold Step Toward Sustainable Blockchain Economics The proposed acceleration of Solana inflation reduction marks a pivotal moment in the network’s evolution. This governance initiative demonstrates the community’s proactive approach to economic management and long-term planning. By potentially reaching the target inflation rate three years ahead of schedule, Solana positions itself as a leader in sustainable blockchain economics. The success of this Solana inflation reduction strategy could set new standards for cryptocurrency monetary policy and governance. As the community debates and votes on SIMD-0411, the entire crypto industry watches closely, recognizing that the outcome could influence economic models across the blockchain space. Frequently Asked Questions What is SIMD-0411? SIMD-0411 is a governance proposal in the Solana ecosystem that aims to double the inflation reduction rate from 15% to 30%, accelerating the timeline to reach the target 1.5% inflation rate. When would the new inflation target be reached? If approved, Solana would reach its 1.5% inflation target by early 2029, three years earlier than the original 2032 schedule. How does this affect SOL staking rewards? Faster inflation reduction means staking rewards would decrease more rapidly, potentially encouraging different staking strategies and validator economics. What is the current Solana inflation rate? The current inflation rate follows a predetermined schedule that the proposal seeks to accelerate, though specific current rates vary based on network conditions. How can community members participate in the decision? Solana governance allows token holders to participate in voting through various platforms and mechanisms, giving the community direct influence over economic policy decisions. What happens if the proposal is rejected? If rejected, Solana would continue with the original inflation reduction schedule, reaching the 1.5% target around 2032 instead of 2029.

The company’s latest move—purchasing 28,625 ETH worth approximately $82.11 million—represents one of the most significant institutional Ethereum acquisitions this quarter. This strategic investment not only demonstrates Bitmine’s bullish outlook on Ethereum but also highlights the growing institutional adoption of major cryptocurrencies. What Makes This Ethereum Acquisition So Significant? This substantial Ethereum acquisition comes at a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. According to data from Lookonchain, Bitmine’s purchase represents a major vote of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential. The timing of this Ethereum acquisition suggests the company sees current market conditions as optimal for accumulating substantial positions. Moreover, this move follows a pattern of increasing institutional interest in Ethereum, particularly as the network continues to evolve with upgrades and growing decentralized application ecosystems. The scale of this Ethereum acquisition positions Bitmine among the more active institutional players in the crypto space.

Key Takeaways: Strike CEO Jack Mallers says JPMorgan closed his accounts without explanation. Chase cited unspecified “concerning activity” under the Bank Secrecy Act. The incident has reignited debate over “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” “Last month, J.P. Morgan Chase threw me out of the bank. It was bizarre. My dad has been a private client there for 30+ years. Every time I asked them why, they said the same thing: ‘We aren’t allowed to tell you,’” Mallers wrote on X . Chase Cites “Concerning Activity” in Strike CEO Account Closure He shared a letter from the bank citing unspecified “concerning activity” detected during routine monitoring. The notice pointed to obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act and warned the bank “may not be able to open new accounts” for him in the future. The incident comes just weeks after former President Donald Trump signed an executive order prohibiting financial institutions from debanking individuals or companies solely for engaging in crypto-related activity. JPMorgan’s actions have led some industry figures to question whether what many dubbed “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” an alleged Biden-era effort to isolate crypto firms from the banking system — has actually ended. Bo Hines, formerly head of Trump’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets and now a strategic advisor to Tether, was quick to criticize the bank. “Hey Chase… you guys know Operation Choke Point is over, right? Just checking,” he wrote on X. Hey @Chase … you guys know Operation Choke Point is over, right? Just checking. https://t.co/W6yVnoCbXk — Bo Hines (@BoHines) November 24, 2025 Mallers has a history of public clashes with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has frequently criticized Bitcoin. In a Yahoo Finance interview last year, Mallers brushed off Dimon’s comments , saying, “What do I think about Jeffrey Epstein’s banker being concerned that a distributed, decentralized, open public money could potentially be used for bad things, sitting on a ski resort in Davos? I don’t really care.” For years, crypto companies have alleged informal pressure from US regulators pushing banks to avoid digital-asset clients, a claim the Biden administration has denied. The term Operation Chokepoint 2.0 references the Obama-era Department of Justice initiative that pushed banks to restrict services to “high-risk” industries such as payday lenders and firearms dealers. Banks Cite Risk, AML Rules in Defense This issue of “de-banking” has been a longstanding complaint among conservative groups, which argue that their accounts and donations are often restricted or terminated without clear justification. Crypto firms have also raised alarm over what they see as unofficial pressure from regulators that has pushed banks to quietly cut ties with blockchain startups, particularly since the collapse of crypto-friendly institutions like Silvergate and Signature Bank. Banks, meanwhile, have defended these decisions as risk-based, citing compliance with anti-money-laundering regulations and federal scrutiny of emerging sectors like digital assets. They have pointed to existing regulatory frameworks that make onboarding crypto clients especially difficult, with heightened know-your-customer and transaction monitoring expectations.

There’s encouraging news emerging from market analysts that suggests the intense Bitcoin selling pressure we’ve witnessed might finally be easing. This development could signal the beginning of a much-anticipated market turnaround that cryptocurrency investors have been waiting for. What Does Decreasing Bitcoin Selling Pressure Mean for Investors? Crypto analytics firm Swissblock recently identified a significant shift in market dynamics. Their analysis reveals that a key risk-off indicator has shown a sharp decline, suggesting that the worst of the Bitcoin selling pressure may be behind us. The market appears to have moved past its capitulation phase, which typically occurs when fearful investors exit their positions en masse. However, the firm cautions that we might see one more wave of selling, though it’s expected to be relatively weaker than previous declines. This pattern often indicates seller exhaustion, which historically paves the way for bullish market reversals. When selling pressure diminishes, it creates space for buyers to step in and drive prices upward. How Could Federal Reserve Policies Impact Bitcoin’s Recovery? Beyond technical indicators, fundamental factors also support a potential rebound. The potential U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut and liquidity injection expected in December could significantly benefit risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Here’s why this matters: Lower interest rates make traditional savings less attractive Increased liquidity often flows into higher-risk investments Cryptocurrencies typically perform well in easy monetary policy environments Institutional investors may increase their Bitcoin allocations These macroeconomic conditions, combined with reduced Bitcoin selling pressure, create a favorable environment for price recovery. The convergence of technical and fundamental factors suggests we might be at a turning point. What Should Investors Watch For Next? While the signs are encouraging, market participants should remain vigilant. Monitor these key developments: Volume patterns – Increasing buying volume confirms recovery Market sentiment indicators – Watch for shifts in investor confidence Federal Reserve announcements – December policy decisions will be crucial Institutional activity – Large investor movements often lead retail trends The current reduction in Bitcoin selling pressure doesn’t guarantee an immediate surge, but it does suggest the foundation for recovery is strengthening. Historical patterns show that after extended periods of selling pressure, markets often experience significant rebounds. Conclusion: A Promising Shift in Market Dynamics The combination of technical indicators pointing to decreased Bitcoin selling pressure and supportive macroeconomic policies creates an optimistic outlook for cryptocurrency investors. While caution remains necessary, the evidence suggests we’re moving toward a more favorable market environment. The potential for a bullish reversal appears to be building as sellers exhaust their positions and fundamental factors align. Frequently Asked Questions What causes Bitcoin selling pressure to decrease? Bitcoin selling pressure typically decreases when most willing sellers have exited their positions, creating seller exhaustion. This often happens after extended price declines when fearful investors have already sold their holdings. How long does it take for markets to rebound after selling pressure eases? Market rebounds can occur within weeks or months after selling pressure subsides. The timing depends on various factors including market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and new catalyst events. Should I invest when Bitcoin selling pressure decreases? While decreasing selling pressure often signals better entry points, always conduct personal research and consider your risk tolerance. Many investors use dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risks. What other indicators confirm reduced selling pressure? Look for increasing trading volume, positive funding rates in derivatives markets, improving sentiment metrics, and stabilization at key support levels to confirm reduced selling pressure. Can Federal Reserve policies really affect Bitcoin prices? Yes, Federal Reserve policies significantly impact all risk assets, including Bitcoin. Interest rate decisions and liquidity injections influence investor behavior across financial markets. What’s the difference between normal volatility and genuine selling pressure? Normal volatility involves balanced buying and selling, while genuine selling pressure features sustained downward momentum with high volume and consistently lower lows. Found this analysis helpful?

54832624,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=867107,1763968867,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54832624.jpeg,America adds $6.5B daily despite DOGE rollout,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-debt-rises-6-5b-a-day-since-doge-launch/,"The United States has added $2.1 trillion in new debt since the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was formed on January 20, according to analysis circulating in the latest Kobessi Letter. The figure translates into a staggering $6.5 billion of debt every single day for 326 consecutive days. The Kobeissi Letter reported the big debt increase and said DOGE was shut down in a controversial move DOGE cut only small parts of the budget The Department of Government Efficiency promised to cut spending and save the United States between $1 trillion and $2 trillion when it first came to the federal government. The department gained significant popularity among the people after it announced its mission to reduce waste , eliminate unnecessary programs, and make the government run more efficiently. However, officials confirmed that the savings were smaller than initially promised. DOGE only saved $160 billion to $214 billion, but this represents only a small portion of the federal budget. The department focused on cutting discretionary spending to make the changes appear significant, when in reality, they only affected a very small part of the budget. DOGE claimed it saved over $60 billion by terminating more than 13,000 government contracts, including IT projects, consulting work, and some large defense projects that had cost the government a significant amount of money. The department also stated that it canceled 15,000 grants to save $49 billion, terminated hundreds of office leases to add another $100 million in savings, and reduced hiring in some agencies, as well as halted certain DEI programs, which resulted in an additional $1 billion in savings. Experts say the savings were often exaggerated, counted more than once, or not fully justified. DOGE did not address the largest spending programs, which account for more than half of the government’s total spending, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest payments on the national debt, so any changes didn’t significantly slow down the debt. The work that the department did had a minimal effect on the overall debt, as the U.S. continued to borrow billions of dollars every day. This proved that stopping the national debt from growing cannot be achieved with such small efforts. DOGE’s efforts were visible and garnered a lot of attention, but they were mostly symbolic because the outcome differed from what everyone expected. Mandatory programs and interest rates grow the debt Analysts predict that the U.S. federal budget for 2025 could reach $7 trillion, primarily due to the government’s obligation to fund mandatory programs. Social Security pays retired people, survivors of deceased workers, and people who cannot work because of disabilities, while Medicare and Medicaid pay for healthcare for elderly people, low-income families, and individuals with disabilities. The government must also pay billions of dollars in interest on the money it owes to individuals and institutions that have lent it money through treasury bills, treasury notes, treasury bonds , savings bonds, and government-backed securities. The interest on these loans accumulates annually, and combined with mandatory spending programs, these payments account for more than half of the government’s annual expenditures. Social Security accounts for approximately 23% of the total budget ($1.6 trillion), Medicare and Medicaid comprise 28% ($2 trillion), and interest payments make up about 14% ($1 trillion). The remaining 35% of the budget is allocated to defense, discretionary programs, and other operations, which is the focus of DOGE. So, even if the cuts in this 35% of the budget were huge, they could not have as significant an effect on the national debt and on the daily increase, which is approximately $6.5 billion every day. The aging population in the U.S. continues to grow, which in turn increases the number of people receiving Social Security and Medicare benefits. The cost of healthcare is also going up every year, so Medicare and Medicaid are becoming more expensive. Finally, the interest rates set by the Federal Reserve increase the costs of paying interest on debt, so even a department like DOGE could not have a significant impact. President Donald Trump confirmed that DOGE has been shut down, so we now know that if the government wants to make changes to the national debt, it needs to focus on mandatory programs and interest rates.

The token is currently valued only at $0.035 and more than 90% of this phase is already utilised, so early investors are becoming inclined to ask the question: is it the next 20x DeFi crypto under $0.05? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is constructing a decentralized lending and borrowing platform that is based on two frameworks: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Both sides provide their users with varying methods to accrue yield or achieve access to capital and retain possession of their properties. P2C: mtTokens and Passive APY Under the P2C market, lenders put assets in a liquidity pool and are issued with mtTokens which works as interest bearing receipts. These increase with time according to the activity of the borrowers. Indicatively, when a user provides ETH of $1,000 in the form of loans, the number of their mtTokens grows after loans are paid and interest is charged. It is an unmanaged, automatic, and easy way to earn some money. The rate at which borrowers are charged is subject to the rate of utilisation. A high level of idle liquidity in the pool means low rates to promote borrowing, whereas a tightening liquidity market will see an increase in the rate which will result in repayments and an influx of more deposits. This forms a natural feedback mechanism that aims at keeping the pool balanced in the long run. P2P: Borrow Rates, LTV Regulations and Liquidation Mutuum Finance also offers a P2P market to those users who would like to have a direct loan agreement. Collateral is locked in place by a fixed Loan-to-Value(LTV). To illustrate, with 75% LTV, an individual with a collateral worth $1,000 will be able to borrow up to $750. In the event that the collateral declines too much in value and passes the liquidation threshold, liquidators are able to intervene and use a portion of the debt to obtain discounted collateral. This liquidation bonus assists in keeping the system afloat and leaves the jobs tidied within a short space of time when times are volatile. Presale Momentum Presale MUTM is one of the biggest fundraisers of 2025. It has previously drawn approximately $18.85M capital, received in excess of 18,100 holders and sold off approximately 805M tokens. The presale began in early 2025 at $0.01. The token has since soared 250% to the present level of $0.035. The official launch price is set at $0.06, the early buyers that entered the game at Phase 1 are aimed to see about 500% token appreciation especially to those that entered the game in Phase 1. The demand is persistent and Phase 6 is over 90% crowded. Successful sale of stage leads to second stage selling at greater price. This is the reason why people are attempting to bag MUTM before the next crypto leap. The 24-hour board is also an attention-grabber, the best contributor on a daily basis wins $500 in MUTM and so the participation is even more participatory. Security and Analyst Outlook Mutuum Finance officially stated on its account X that V1 will go to the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The initial prototype will envisage a pool of liquidity, mtTokens, a token tracking debt and a liquidation agent, where ETH and USDT will be supported at its launch. Security is also a good strength. The project passed the CertiK audit of a 90/100 Token Scan rating, which strengthened investor confidence. It equally has a $50k bug bounty to identify any vulnerabilities in its code, prior to mainnet. Other observers reckon that the upside on MUTM may be excellent shortly after its launch. They refer to the buy-and-redistribute model – in which MUTM buys in the open market and redistributes to users that stake in the safety module with the mtTokens – which generates constant buying pressure. Others point out that the beta version of the platform will be launched about the same time the token will be available to possible top-tier exchanges. Based on this schedule, commentators to the market posit, there is likelihood of listing to the prime stock exchanges a move that may produce much more buyers. Layer-2 Growth Mutuum Finance also intends to introduce an on-demand stable minting and burning of the liquidity of the protocol. A stablecoin will confer significant utility to the platform that will assist in obtaining more borrowing and lending capital. The other component of the roadmap is layer-2 expansion. Reduced rates on gas charges and reduced homage speed enhance the borrowing experience as well as the activities of the liquidation. In the case of a lending protocol, it has a direct impact on performance and retention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at the eve of one of the most critical echelons of its presale. As Phase 6 progressed to sell out, demand increased, the security was optimistic, and the V1 testnet is soon, the urgency is growing. The token remains below the $0.05 mark, but there is anticipation early investor hopes suggest that it will not remain there many days.

Here's the Latest Data,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/us-spot-bitcoin-etfs-continue-weekly-negative-streak-heres-the-latest-data/,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs traded in the US continued their negative flow trend, recording net outflows for the fourth week. Four Weeks of Outflows in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Total $1.2 Billion According to SoSoValue data, total outflow reached $1.22 billion in the week ending November 21. This brings the total outflow for the last four weeks to $4.34 billion. While inflows were seen on some days during the week, they weren't enough to change the picture. ETFs saw inflows of $238.47 million on Friday and $75.47 million on Wednesday. However, outflows on other trading days of the week overwhelmed these positive movements. The biggest outflow was seen in BlackRock's IBIT fund. The fund experienced a net outflow of $1.09 billion for the week, marking its second-largest weekly loss in its history. The largest daily outflow in IBIT was $523.15 million on Tuesday. This surge coincided with a market correction that same week. Bitcoin fell from $95,600 on Monday to $82,200 on Friday. Currently, the price is at $87,348, a 1.2% increase over the past 24 hours. Analysts note that Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery, but the market structure remains fragile. Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu expects BTC to consolidate in the $85,000-$90,000 range in the short term. The outlook for Ethereum is also weak. Spot ETH ETFs closed negative for the third consecutive week, with $500.25 million in outflows last week. In contrast, $55.71 million in inflows were recorded on Friday. Solana ETFs closed the week with $128.2 million in inflows, nearly triple the previous week's figure. XRP ETFs, on the other hand, reported a total of $179.6 million in inflows, but this figure fell short only of the massive $243.05 million inflows XRPC saw in a single day on November 14. *This is not investment advice.

54832574,632962,1763969439,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54832574.jpeg,"Cardano Attack Sparks Clash: Hoskinson Invokes Feds, Solana Chief Objects",https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-hoskinson-feds-solana-chief-objects/,"Cardano’s mainnet experienced a rare chain partition on November 21, 2025 after a malformed staking-delegation transaction exploited a long-standing deserialization bug, briefly producing a “poisoned” branch containing the transaction and a parallel healthy branch that rejected it. The network continued producing blocks on both sides until emergency node upgrades restored convergence later that day; Intersect said no user funds were lost and that a CIP-135 disaster-recovery playbook was prepared but ultimately not needed. Should Cardano’s Attacker Face The Feds? What turned a technical postmortem into an industry flashpoint was the public fallout between Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson and Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko over whether the incident should be treated as a federal crime. Yakovenko opened by praising the protocol behavior rather than the politics: “I am gonna go out on a limb and actually say this is pretty cool. Nakamoto style consensus without proof of work is extremely hard to build. The protocol functioned as designed in the presence of bugs.” He was reacting to Berry Ales’ observation that Cardano “recovered from a minority chain and got rid of the symptom while preserving most of the history and progress since the incident.” Hoskinson replied tersely: “Thanks man. It was a wild day.” The exchange sharpened when Yakovenko framed exploit traffic as inherent to permissionless networks and warned against involving law enforcement. “Communicating arbitrary bits is fundamentally speech, even if they break the receiver,” he wrote. “The fact that it’s not always the case in the US is lame. Don’t send the feds after the poor guy who f’d up vulnerability disclosure.” Hoskinson’s counterclaim was that this was not disclosure at all. “It was a premeditated attack by a disgruntled SPO with extensive knowledge of Cardano and who had already observed the testnet fork, the patch efforts, and was in direct contact with the core devs ,” he said. According to Hoskinson, the attacker watched the Preview testnet incident, waited through patching efforts, then reproduced it on mainnet. “We spent hours studying it, reconstructing for mainnet, and then delegating to my personal pool Rats as a message. He only admitted this act after I doxed him in a video then claiming it was a terrible mistake, but somehow neglected to mention it during the entire day while we were fixing it.” He then argued that intentional exploitation of public infrastructure crosses into criminal territory: “Blackhats exploiting bugs to cause harm to public infrastructure is not a new thing. Its a federal crime because of the catastrophic harm to society such acts could carry. Cardano is a large network and many people derive their entire livelihood from the network’s operation. He hurt every single person in our ecosystem.” Yakovenko accepted the ugliness of blackhat behavior but maintained that legal escalation is strategically risky in open systems. “Yea. I get it. We have had shitheads that watch public branches for any bug fixes and try to exploit them immediately. It’s a huge pia. Any potential bugs have to be fixed in private and rolled out p2p patches first. It has a chilling effect on the industry if you call in the Feds.” In his “mental model,” if operators run “a system that accepts arbitrary public messages, they are taking on the risk of what happens with any message they receive,” and only permissioned systems with explicit liability framing should be regulated as such. Hoskinson pressed that model against the realities of regulated finance and cross-chain norms. “Furthermore, are you going to tell all the regulated financial entities that are building on Solana that if they lose money from hackers while using Solana, they shouldn’t file a criminal complaint?” He followed with a direct hypothetical: “So if a blackhat found an exploit in solana and it forked the network resulting in huge losses for your defi community, they should accept its a risk of solana and the blackhat did nothing wrong? What is the remedy?” Yakovenko’s answer separated moral blame from deterrence. “The blackhat is an absolute piece of shit. The remedy is that we need multiple implementations and formal verification to minimize the risk of that happening… We have to make it impossible.” In his view, prosecution is not a reliable control because serious attackers do not expect to be caught, so resilience must come from engineering redundancy and verification, not the threat of the state. Intersect’s incident report says the wallet responsible for the malformed transaction has been identified and that authorities including the FBI are being engaged. The immediate Cardano story is a fast-patched validation mismatch that re-converged without rollback. The bigger story is a live, founder-to-founder clash over whether permissionless security failures are primarily a matter for protocol design or criminal law—and what precedent the answer sets for every PoS network, Solana included.

US AI and tech stocks tanked in tandem with crypto markets. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been shut down and “no longer exists,” according to officials. “As the US government reopens, tons of backlogged economic data is being rolled out,” said the Kobeissi Letter. Economic Events Nov. 24 to 28 November wraps up with a holiday-shortened week due to Thanksgiving on Thursday and Black Friday. This week, the US government will continue to work through a data backlog following the resolution of the shutdown earlier this month. A delayed September Producer Price Index (PPI) report is due on Tuesday. The data provides input costs for producers and manufacturers, which relate to the costs of consumer goods and retail prices. It is a leading inflation indicator that is keenly watched by investors and analysts. Tuesday will also see September retail sales data, November CB consumer confidence data, and October pending home sales data. Third-quarter GDP data is due on Wednesday, alongside September’s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report. This data reflects the average amount of money consumers spend monthly and is used by Fed policymakers as a primary gauge of inflation. Key Events This Week: 1.

Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets have “become such a proxy for speculation,” and last week’s sell-off can’t be viewed in isolation, wrote Interactive Brokers’ chief strategist Steve Sosnick. Total market capitalization had reclaimed the key $3 trillion level during early trading in Asia on Monday morning. However, markets remain down 32% from their October peak. Bitcoin briefly tapped $88,000, showing a steady weekend recovery from its dump to $82,000 on Friday, but the asset remains down 30% from its all-time high. Most of those losses have come over the past fortnight. Ethereum’s recovery has been weaker, with the asset failing to make any progress above $2,850, while the altcoins remain mostly battered.

Grayscale boosts Dogecoin exposure First and foremost, Grayscale’s GDOG won’t be the first ETF linked to the meme assets in the United States. Osprey Funds and REX Shares won authorization of their respective Dogecoin exchange-traded funds in September, fueled by the new SEC generic listing terms. Now, Grayscale has joined the race. The company has been expanding its product suite, and the GDOG ETF represents its latest move into single-asset offerings suitable for investors who prefer compliant investments. Grayscale has confirmed that its new ETF “offers investors direct exposure to DOGE.” That means retailers and institutions can tap into Dogecoin’s potential without holding or directly managing the asset. Meanwhile, the product remains paramount in helping Dogecoin shed its meme image. The digital token has struggled to attract solid investments due to a lack of utility. DOGE is now transitioning into a serious and regulated financial product. Individuals who have been skeptical about interacting with the token on cryptocurrency exchanges can now tap into GDOG for a compliant-friendly entry. DOGE price analysis The meme token soared from $0.1421 to an intraday peak of $0.1489, a 4.786% increase, over the past 24 hours. Chart by Coinmarketcap Meanwhile, Dogecoin has seen notable selling pressure since topping $0.32 early last month, in October. Its current price is testing the vital $0.135 – $0.140 level. This region often attracts substantial buying activity, and history might rhyme amidst triggers like the DOGE ETF debut, especially if it sees the forecasted demand. Bullish actions will drive DOGE toward the next supply zone at $0.155 – $0.160. Magnified trading volumes could propel the token past $0.172, then $0.19, and reclaim the crucial $0.2 support barrier. Nevertheless, prevailing broader uncertainty could see Dogecoin underperforming in the near term. Failure to stabilize beyond $0.135 can catalyze deeper slides to $0.118.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-prepare-xrp-is-poised-for-price-explosion-heres-why/,"Some analysts have begun presenting unusually accelerated timelines for XRP’s potential growth. A new post from Crypto analyst and social media commentator CryptoSensei has added a fresh set of predictions to the ongoing conversation, outlining specific price targets and the conditions he believes could support them. His video message focuses on market dynamics, institutional behavior, and expanding utility, offering a structured argument for why XRP could experience significant upward movement in a short period. PREPARE! #XRP PRICE MAY SKYROCKET!!! pic.twitter.com/hLVAtvkrw1 — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) November 20, 2025 CryptoSensei’s Price Predictions In the video shared with the post, CryptoSensei presented layered price expectations for XRP over three time intervals, stating that a 30-day period could see a move to $150 , followed by $295 within 60 days, and $442 by the 90-day mark. He acknowledged that such projections rely on a set of assumptions and that not every ETF participating in the market will attract the level of demand required to reach these figures. Despite this, he maintained that the underlying reasoning remains coherent if supply conditions tighten. He explained that if the available supply on exchanges remains limited and ETF inflows continue to rely on that same pool of tokens, upward pressure on the asset could develop. He pointed out that the outcome may depend on whether large holders or institutions choose to sell at intermediate price levels such as $25 or $50. In his view, if those participants withhold supply, rapid appreciation becomes more plausible. According to him, many in the market are anticipating that scenario. Factors Supporting His Argument CryptoSensei expanded beyond price targets by listing several areas he believes could add additional demand pressure. He emphasized the introduction and expansion of XRP ETFs, followed by increasing activity in treasury operations, regulatory developments, and the growth of the stablecoin sector. He also noted that banks and financial institutions have become more engaged in exploring or adopting XRP-related solutions. Beyond institutional interest, he referenced technical considerations, including the EVM sidechain and emerging DeFi layers, suggesting that these elements collectively contribute to heightened demand at a time when circulating supply on exchanges appears insufficient. His central point was that simultaneous developments across these sectors may create an environment that produces notable price volatility, reinforced by the limited liquidity he believes currently exists. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Community Reaction Under the post, reactions varied. One user, XRPmate, rejected the projections entirely, describing the numbers as unrealistic and arguing that higher prices would naturally trigger selling that increases available supply. Another user, Alew, pointed to the broader market downturn, noting personal losses on a recent purchase at $2.11 but expressing continued interest in accumulating XRP even if the asset were to remain between $1 and $1.50 for an extended period. The exchange highlighted a range of responses, from skepticism to long-term optimism, as CryptoSensei’s projections introduced another viewpoint into ongoing discussions about XRP’s future trajectory.

Is Litecoin a good investment? Litecoin is an alternative to Bitcoin, making it an appealing choice for everyday transactions worldwide. Additionally, with a finite cap of 84 million coins, LTC presents itself as a potential investment for value preservation, akin to Bitcoin’s role as a digital asset. Why is the LTC price up today?

According to our Litecoin price prediction, the LTC price might hit the $500 mark in 2028. However, this rally depends on the future buying interest in the altcoin market. Does LTC have a good long-term future? Despite the recent adjustments and potential peak formation, Litecoin exhibits a robust long-term price trajectory and outlook, indicating a high potential for future growth. If the network continues to witness robust activities and growth, the price might reach $1000 in no time. Recent news/opinion on Litecoin Canary Capital’s proposed spot Litecoin ETF remains in limbo after the SEC took no action by its Thursday deadline, leaving the crypto industry uncertain amid a looming government shutdown. Analysts say the regulator’s new approach may render old ETF filing deadlines obsolete, as applicants are now being asked to rely solely on S-1 registration approvals. As I understand it, the shutdown could affect the $LTC ETF approval because the @SECGov still needs to sign off on the S-1 and the agency is operating on a skeleton crew. It’s unclear what remaining staff is working/what their priorities are at the moment.

According to information shared by on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, a wallet linked to BitMine acquired 21,537 ETH on November 23 from FalconX, a digital asset prime brokerage that the company has employed on multiple occasions to execute its ETH buys. Lookonchain @lookonchain · Follow Tom Lee( @fundstrat )’s #Bitmine is still buying $ETH .A new wallet 0x5664 — likely linked to #Bitmine — just received 21,537 $ETH ($59.17M) from the #FalconX 8 hours ago. intel.arkm.com/explorer/addre… 7:30 AM · Nov 23, 2025 868 Reply Copy link Read 47 replies At the time, the transaction was estimated to be valued at roughly $60 million based on market prices. With this, BitMine’s total ETH holdings now exceed 3.6 million coins, valued at over $10 billion as of press time. As the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, BitMine now controls nearly 3% of the total ETH supply and has cemented its lead in the market. The next closest competitor, SharpLink, holds a little over 859,000 ETH. BitMine buys ETH dip as shares remain under pressure Ethereum has dropped nearly 30% in the past month, but the continued weak price performance has not deterred BitMine from consistently buying into the dip. The latest acquisition follows a string of other large ETH purchases made in November alone. The firm bought 82,353 ETH on November 3, then added over 54,000 ETH around mid-month, before executing the latest buy on November 23. While BitMine has remained focused on expanding its Ethereum strategy, the asset’s underperformance has triggered a steep rise in unrealized losses for the company. Latest estimates suggest the Thomas Lee-led firm could be sitting on over $4 billion in unrealized losses, a figure that is significantly impacting investor sentiment and shareholder returns. BitMine’s stock has plunged more than 80% since Ethereum’s August all-time high near $5000. When BitMine released its annual report at the time, its financial situation was quite in contrast to the current downturn, with the company posting strong earnings and a far more optimistic outlook. For that period, BitMine posted a net income of $328 million, while earnings per share came in at $13.39. It also declared a nominal dividend of $0.01 per share, marking its first capital return to shareholders. According to analysts, Ethereum’s falling price is not the only concern. The staking yield on the flagship altcoin, which is a key revenue source for BitMine, is currently at just 2.9%, well below the yield offered by traditional US dollar money market funds. “No serious institutional allocator will accept” that yield, 10x Research founder Markus Thielen warned investors in recent comments, especially when ETH’s price volatility “puts the underlying collateral at constant risk.” BitMine doubles down on ETH staking Nevertheless, BitMine has continued to execute on its long-term strategy and has launched the Made-in-America Validator Network to transition from passive holding to active staking. Abbreviated as MAVAN, the initiative is part of BitMine’s broader plan to generate income from its ETH holdings through proof-of-stake rewards. Currently in its pilot phase with three partners, the MAVAN network is expected to launch in the first quarter of 2026.

The feature, which displays the country or region where accounts are based, rolled out globally on November 22 through the platform’s “ About This Account ” section, accessible by tapping the signup date on user profiles. Buterin’s critique centers on the feature’s vulnerability to manipulation, predicting that within six months, foreign political troll accounts will successfully spoof their locations to appear as though they operate from the United States or the United Kingdom. He argued that while obtaining fake locations for a million accounts might prove moderately difficult, creating a single account with a fraudulent location and growing it to a million followers would be straightforward through methods such as renting passports, phone numbers, and IP addresses. Prediction about this ""show which country the account is from"" thing: In the short term it will have lots of positive effects. In the medium term, the sophisticated actors will find ways to pretend to be from countries that they are not. Lots of ways to rent individual people's… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 23, 2025 Privacy Concerns Overshadow Security Benefits The location feature has sparked immediate backlash from the crypto community, with figures like Uniswap founder Hayden Adams calling it “psychotic” and questioning its mandatory nature. Adams distinguished between voluntary and compulsory information sharing, stating, “opt-in doxxing is fine, mandatory doxxing is psychotic.” Thanks, I hate it Opt-in doxxing is fine, mandatory doxxing is psychotic https://t.co/KvFIGy1VCc — Hayden Adams (@haydenzadams) November 23, 2025 The feature’s implementation appears particularly concerning for crypto users, given the industry’s history of targeted attacks and kidnappings related to digital asset holdings. Buterin later clarified his position following community feedback, acknowledging that revealing location data without consent or an opt-out option violates user privacy. “ There are some people for whom even a few bits of leakage are risky, and they should not have their privacy retroactively rugpulled with no recourse, ” he wrote. While X product director Nikita Bier announced privacy toggles for users in countries where speech carries penalties, critics argue this doesn’t address the fundamental privacy invasion for the broader user base. The controversy appears particularly stark when contrasted with platform owner Elon Musk’s March 2022 statement promising that X would “ do whatever it takes to protect the rights of users to remain anonymous, as they would otherwise face persecution from employers or risk of physical harm. “ This platform will do whatever it takes to protect the rights of users to remain anonymous, as they would otherwise face persecution from employers (as many have) or risk of physical harm — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 22, 2024 That commitment came when the platform updated its privacy policy to ban publishing the real names of people behind anonymous accounts. Industry Experts Debate Long-Term Implications Finance professor Maxim Mironov from IE Business School suggested the feature could function similarly to spam prevention mechanisms, arguing that introducing extra costs for faking country information would reduce bot activity. However, Buterin countered that the current system requires individual users to manually check each account’s location, negating any mass-scale verification benefits and proving useful only for high-profile accounts worth explicitly investigating. Think about spam: if you introduced a one-cent cost for sending every email, the amount of spam would drop significantly. Similarly, if you introduced extra costs for faking the country you are writing from, the number of bots pretending to be from specific countries would… — Maxim Mironov (@mironov_fm) November 23, 2025 Cryptoanalyst Nic Carter offered a contrasting perspective, framing the location disclosure as recognition that unrestricted access to Western communication infrastructure has enabled widespread abuse. “ Why should we continue to grant scammers direct access to our phones, inboxes, and DMs? ” Carter wrote, comparing the approach to China’s long-standing restrictions on foreign participation in domestic platforms. He characterized the human cost of open access as “ astronomical ,” citing seniors’ inability to use the internet safely and the constant SIM-farm spam. Several users highlighted practical workarounds and concerns about the feature’s implementation. Web3 attorney Langerius instructed followers to disable country visibility through settings or switch from country-level to region-level display. Developer Mayowa warned the feature could encourage discrimination against users from certain regions, noting that “ innocent users will be abused or thrown under the bus simply because of where they’re chatting from. ” Tech investor Jason Calacanis quipped , “ Long VPN stocks ,” suggesting virtual private networks would see increased adoption as users seek to mask their true locations. Long VPN stocks https://t.co/Yc5nLP0UDZ — @jason (@Jason) November 23, 2025 The feature represents X’s stated effort to secure what it calls the “ global town square ,” with Bier promising additional authenticity verification methods in development.

Among those market leaders, Solana (SOL) continues its impressive ecosystem expansion at groundbreaking speeds, Shiba Inu (SHIB) maintains its beloved role as a community favorite and expansion powerhouse, keeping its focus driven towards ever-more diverse and viable uses, and then, of course, there's Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which has been making waves and penetrating its presale's 6th stage with over 95% already sold out and over $19 million secured. And with SOL offering ecosystem support, SHIB offering unparalleled mainstream market appeal, and MUTM offering significant early movement potential, this not only represents one of the market's most exciting combinations, but one of its most effective, particularly for market participants seeking to get in early and ride next probable breakout cycle. Mutuum Finance has quickly become the top crypto for investors seeking early access, and a clear choice among the best cryptos to buy. Solana Faces Resistance Despite Significant ETF Flows Solana's (SOL) struggles on the charts persist, even with institutional buying streaming in via its spot ETF instruments, which has marked its 17th consecutive day with inflows of $476 million, with Bitwise's BSOL index having hit an incredible 89% of those flows. But despite all this newfound buying pressure, price movement has barely budged, frequently stalling at, and then failing to adequately overcome, its robust $140 resistance level, all while selling pressure continues to build. Without at least an effective reclamation of $140, market observers suggest that things may be in store to take a bit of a hit, pulling back towards $120, calling into question at least this ETF demand's potency overall. All this has led some market participants to expand their search parameters, specifically seeking early-stage investments with better immediacy, and has lately found focus drawn to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), now regarded as a top crypto to watch in 2025. Shiba Inu Tests Key Support Level Within Descending Triangle Shiba Inu (SHIB) is presently at a crucial point, testing the lower edge of its descending triangle after weeks of sustained price compression along a wide, overarching downward-pointing pattern. Technical analysis observers identify an initial bear market rally, indicating potential support at or near the $0.0000080 level, but overall, market participants are waiting for a definitive breakout before becoming more optimistic. Meanwhile, as market participants scan SHIB charts searching for signals of stabilization or reacceleration, interest is increasingly shifting towards new, rapidly gaining projects such as high-potential DeFi coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM), recognized as a top crypto for immediate growth and one of the best cryptos to buy for early movers. MUTM Presale Stage 6: Leveraging Market Momentum Mutuum Finance is quickly rising through the DeFi cryptocurrency world with Phase 6 of its presale nearing full capacity. The MUTM token price is set at $0.035, which represents the last stage before entering Phase 7, in which it will increase by 20% to $0.04. Mutuum Finance has established itself as one of the most eagerly awaited projects of 2025 after reaching phase 6 and raising over $19 million from more than 18,140 participants. Its presale momentum makes MUTM not just one of the best cryptos to buy, but a top crypto for investors seeking early exposure. Full-scale Security Audit Begins For Mutuum Contracts The lending and borrowing contracts of Mutuum are now at an independent audit stage, and their security and functioning are to be analyzed. Halborn Security is conducting an exhaustive examination of the final code as part of this analysis. The effort aims to ensure that all the contracts are running as intended and providing sufficient security to users' assets. Updates regarding this analysis are expected, and then the testnet launch date will be announced. One of the most significant developments awaiting Mutuum Finance is its entry into the market with its collateralized and USD-pegged stablecoin, which forms the basis of its lending and borrowing protocol . This serves to make Mutuum Finance's ecosystem even safer and more reliable by providing value certainty. The integration of such a stable asset will enable Mutuum Finance to offer return-on-investment with minimal risks to retail and institutional investors, while at the same time enhancing market liquidity, scalability, and security. This move will further solidify MUTM's position as a next-generation DeFi platform with actual uses, confirming its status as one of the best cryptos to buy and the top crypto to watch prior to December 2025. Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as one of the most exciting cryptos to invest in, with over 95% of Phase 6 already sold and over $19 million raised from more than 18,180 unique individuals. The token price has been set at $0.035, with an impending rise to $0.04 in Phase 7, leaving only a narrow window open. Mutuum Finance offers not only security and usability but also giant growth potential with its collateralized stablecoin and auditor-reviewed lending and borrowing functions. As such, MUTM stands as the top crypto and one of the best cryptos to buy for investors seeking real utility and early-stage growth.

Short-Term Holders Capitulated as BTC Hit $80K,https://cryptopotato.com/is-this-the-cycle-bottom-short-term-holders-capitulated-as-btc-hit-80k/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is testing the $80,000 support level, a price point not seen in six months, following a steep 36% drop from its October all-time high. This downturn has triggered a massive wave of capitulation from short-term investors, a potential sign that a local bottom is forming, even as long-term holders begin to distribute their BTC at a historic rate. Market Sentiment and On-Chain Signals Point to a Crossroads The mood across social media and on-chain data platforms is one of heightened caution. According to an analysis by Crypto Dan, investors who have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days have officially capitulated . This group, often driven by emotion, has seen its sentiment flip from positive to negative, with the market watcher noting that similar behavior was observed at the lows of previous corrections within this bull cycle, suggesting a potential rebound is likely. However, he warned that if Bitcoin fails to hold the $80,000 level, the market could be in for a much more difficult period. “If the current zone is a correction phase → this is the bottom,” he wrote, adding “If the current zone is a bear cycle → the end of the decline is still far away” Adding to the narrative, data shared by another analyst, CryptoOnchain, revealed a historic transfer of wealth. Their metrics show a massive outflow of 63,000 BTC from long-term holder wallets, a classic sign of distribution near market tops. At the same time, short-term holders are accumulating that supply, buying the dip at prices around $87,000. This dynamic is creating a fragile balance where, if new demand cannot absorb this selling pressure, it could lead to a deeper correction. There were more bearish signals from GugaOnChain, who highlighted that a key on-chain metric, the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), triggered a sell signal on November 23. This, according to them, has happened four previous times in this cycle, and a price correction followed each instance. The current signal, with a CDD value of over 25 million, indicates a significant reactivation of old BTC, typically for the purpose of selling. A Broader Look at Demand and Price Trajectory The sell-off highlighted by CryptoDan is happening against a backdrop of fading institutional demand. As earlier reported by CryptoQuant, the growth in spot Bitcoin ETF holdings has slowed to one of its weakest paces since launch. Furthermore, public companies that were once major buyers have seen their purchasing power evaporate, with Strategy reducing its annual acquisitions from 171,000 BTC to just 9,600 BTC. Meanwhile, at the market, the flagship cryptocurrency managed to pull together a recovery to its current level of about $87,000 after hitting a low near $82,000 in the past week. Still, it remains down about 22% in the last 30 days and nearly 12% year-on-year. The breach of the $90,000 support level, a key psychological barrier, has now shifted analyst focus toward the next major support zone between $70,000 and $73,000. This area is critical as it matches the average purchase price of major holders of the asset, who may step in to defend their positions. Even prominent investors are adjusting their strategies. Author Robert Kiyosaki recently revealed that he sold $2.25 million worth of BTC at around $90,000, though he stated he remains bullish and plans to reinvest his profits.

This has seen many investors want to invest in this cryptocurrency as it is today believed to be one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest before 2026. The sense of rush is becoming stronger each day and the time to purchase with this price is lessening. Soaring Demand Mutuum Finance went on its presale in early 2025 at the price of $0.01. This means that the price has since gone up to the current level of $0.035 which represents a 250% increase. The amount of money raised through the project is currently at approximately $18.85million. Over 18,100 holders have joined and approximately 805 million of the tokens have been sold. Formal introduction of MUTM will be at $0.06. To those investors who invest at $0.035, there is an evident avenue of significant token appreciation. In a positive situation, analysts reckon that the token might trade significantly above its listing range after the launch of the platform. That is why Phase 6 is passing very fast. Each new distribution decreases the remaining quantity at this price and consumers are well aware that after this stage is completed, they will be joining a more costly phase. The vision of what Mutuum Finance is trying to create Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending protocol that is aimed at users seeking to have control over their assets. Lending, interest growth and borrowing processes are handled using smart contracts on the platform. Its system is backed up by the use of mtTokens which grow in value as the system gains interest on the loan that is being taken. This construction allows people to make passive income without complicated techniques and external devices. The other force of the ecosystem is its buy-and-distribute model. Based on the design, MUTM is bought in the open market and redistributed to the users who post mtTokens in the safety module. This links token demand and actual action on the platform. The more lending is done, the more purchasing pressure on MUTM, there will be. Security provides a significant degree of trust. Mutuum Finance received a 90 out of 100 CertiK audit score which is a good score by standards given that the project is in the presale stage. New buyers are also convinced by the audit that the protocol is being ready to be used on a long-lasting basis. Oracles and Stablecoin Mutuum Finance also intends to drop on demand stablecoin pegged to their lending engine. The lending protocols that use stablecoins are likely to get large amounts of borrowing and this may boost the revenue of the platforms. An increase in revenue will result in increased buybacks, and this will increase the value of MUTM in the long-term. The other component of the roadmap is oracles. The protocol intends to use the accurate pricing systems, fallback data and aggregated feeds such that the values of collateral are kept up to date. Such systems contribute significantly towards the safety of the user in turbulent times and ensuring that liquidations are not discriminatory. These characteristics have added to the increasing investor confidence. Other analysts have even opined that the MUTM would reach the levels of $0.12-$0.15 in the near future of listing, or, in other words, growth by approximately 200% to 300% of the listing price. In a better market, there are even higher valuation projections. Why Phase 6 Is Becoming Critical The next biggest factor contributing to the increased attention is the established schedule of the initial version of the protocol. As stated in the official X announcement of the project, the V1 release will happen in the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This version will entail the liquidity pool and the addition of the mtTokens, the debt token system and the automated liquidator bot. The first supported asset will be ETH and USDT. The fact that states that Mutuum Finance has a working product near the listing date will create an upper hand compared to several new cryptocurrency projects that take off without having a working protocol. Large buyers have also been attracted because of phase selling out this fast. Allocation of whales is more frequent in the later phase of presale since that is an indicator of stability, improvement and high demand. Once the whales come in, the other supply is lost at a very high rate. This reduces the turnaround period and raises the entry cost. Phase 6 is already at 90%, so investors considering the possibility of a new crypto purchase now know the next phase might not remain open long.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Goes Wall Street: Grayscale Confirms Nov. 24 ETF Launch The firm’s head of research says a large liquidation in early October flipped spot ETF flows, pushed digital asset treasury (DAT) premiums lower, and coincided with a drop in stablecoin supply — a mix that points to liquidity leaving the system. ETF And Treasury Reversals Reports have disclosed that spot Bitcoin ETFs, once steady buyers, shifted from steady inflows into a meaningful headwind, while DAT premiums compressed across the market and stablecoin balances ticked down. That combination reduced the steady pool of buy-side demand that had been supporting prices. The change is what NYDIG and other market watchers call a break in the feedback loop that previously amplified gains. Bitcoin Dominance Creeps Higher As Risk Assets Unwind According to crypto market data, Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market climbed back above 60% in early November before settling around 58% as of Monday, a sign that traders are moving out of smaller, more speculative coins and into the largest, most liquid asset. That shift often happens when money tightens: capital consolidates into the biggest name as smaller positions are cut. DATs Show Cooling Demand, But No Broken Balance Sheets Based on NYDIG’s note, the DAT sector has not shown signs of insolvency. Issuers still face modest obligations and many structures allow payments to be suspended if needed. In short: demand has cooled significantly, but the frameworks that underpin many of these funds haven’t collapsed. That means the current stress is on flows and liquidity rather than on solvency. CME Gap Targeted Then A Possible Bounce Crypto analysts are watching technical levels for short-term direction. Michael van de Poppe flagged a CME gap at $85,200 as a likely downside magnet after a recent roughly 10% rise from lows, and suggested Bitcoin could then retest between $90,000 and $96,000 to form a new base. Traders watch these gaps because futures markets close over weekends while spot markets do not, creating price gaps that often get revisited.

54837107,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=27187,1763977097,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,How is Zcash Mitigating the Risks of Quantum Computing?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/how-is-zcash-mitigating-the-risks-of-quantum-computing/,"Zcash faces the same long-term cryptographic pressures as other blockchain networks, but its design gives it a distinct position in the wider quantum-risk landscape. Quantum computing threatens systems that expose public keys or rely heavily on elliptic-curve assumptions, and many blockchains fall into this category. Zcash’s shielded architecture reduces this exposure by keeping key transactional details off-chain, which limits how much a quantum adversary could reconstruct from historical data. Even so, Zcash is not immune: components such as signatures, proof verification, and note encryption still depend on pre-quantum primitives that could eventually be broken. Developers are addressing these weaknesses through projects like Tachyon, which removes secret-sharing methods vulnerable to harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks, and by researching post-quantum alternatives for proofs and key exchange. Complementing this work is “quantum recoverability,” a mechanism intended to let users re-secure their funds under stronger cryptographic conditions if quantum threats arrive unexpectedly early. Together, these efforts illustrate a deliberate, staged approach to quantum preparedness, positioning Zcash ahead of many networks while acknowledging that substantial work remains to reach full post-quantum security. Can Zcash Hold Up Under a Potential Quantum Computing Attack? In our recent article about the threat to digital assets posed by quantum computing, we took a general look at some of the risks and possible mitigations digital assets could employ to become “quantum resistant”. This week we’re taking a look at Zcash’s quantum risk profile and potential mitigations. A quick recap: Quantum computing poses a long-term challenge to most blockchain systems because many depend on public-key cryptography that quantum algorithms such as Shor’s could eventually break. If a sufficiently powerful quantum computer emerges, it could derive private keys from exposed public keys, forge signatures, or undermine proof systems that rely on elliptic curve assumptions. This creates both forward-looking risks and retroactive ones, since blockchains store all historical data openly; attackers can harvest encrypted material today and decrypt it later when hardware improves. For most networks, this risk spans both integrity and confidentiality, particularly for chains in which public keys or other sensitive metadata appear on-chain. While credible quantum attacks are not expected in the immediate future, the uncertainty around timelines has pushed many projects to evaluate their exposure and prepare for post-quantum transitions. Within this broader purvey, Zcash occupies a somewhat unusual position. Its shielded transaction design already limits the exposure of public keys and metadata, meaning that in many common cases an attacker, even with powerful quantum hardware, cannot retroactively reconstruct sender–receiver relationships from the ledger alone. This offers a degree of present-day resilience that chains like Bitcoin or Ethereum do not have, since their public keys become visible once coins are spent. However, Zcash is not fully insulated from quantum threats. Key components of its protocol, including elliptic curve–based signature schemes , proof verification , and note-encryption mechanisms , ultimately rely on assumptions that a future quantum machine could compromise. The practical level of protection also depends on real-world user behaviour. If users employ transparent addresses, leak metadata, or rely on third-party infrastructure, quantum risks re-enter through these channels even if the shielded pool itself remains structurally difficult to deanonymise. The primary quantum risks for Zcash fall into two categories, which are, privacy erosion through “ harvest now, decrypt later ” attacks, and the potential loss of soundness if elliptic-curve assumptions are broken. The former concerns note encryption and other secrets that might one day be decrypted if quantum machines reach scale and the latter concerns counterfeiting or theft if the protocol’s soundness-critical components become vulnerable. Zcash developers acknowledge these risks but distinguish between areas needing immediate attention and those that can be handled through well-timed upgrades. Privacy protections are viewed as the higher priority, since confidentiality compromised after the fact cannot be restored. Soundness risks, while serious, can be mitigated with protocol migrations once clearer quantum timelines emerge, and the Zcash ecosystem has already demonstrated an ability to perform significant upgrades, such as the transition to Halo 2 , without disrupting the network. Current Zcash mitigation strategies centre on reducing dependence on elliptic-curve assumptions, preparing migration paths to post-quantum cryptography, and introducing mechanisms that allow users to recover or secure funds if quantum capabilities advance faster than expected. Zcash developers are working on “quantum recoverability” techniques for Orchard that would allow users to re-secure their assets under post-quantum conditions without exposing privacy. Project Tachyon aims to eliminate in-band secret distribution in shielded transactions, closing a key avenue for harvest-and-decrypt attacks. Longer-term directions include exploring hash-based proof systems such as STARKs , investigating lattice-based key-exchange replacements like Kyber , and designing cold-storage protocols for users who need long-term resilience. While the transition is complex and still unfolding, Zcash’s architecture and ongoing research provide a clearer pathway to post-quantum adaptation than many other blockchain systems, even as significant work remains to ensure its privacy and soundness endure against future quantum threats. A Look at How Zcash Developers are Addressing Quantum Computing Risks Zcash developers are tackling quantum computing risk on several fronts, starting with how the protocol is architected today. From its earliest designs, Zcash tried to avoid tying privacy directly to the strongest and most fragile cryptographic assumptions. Shielded transactions use zero-knowledge proofs , hiding commitments , and symmetric primitives in a way that limits what a future attacker can learn from the chain itself, even if some components are weakened. The team has been careful to isolate elliptic-curve dependencies so that privacy does not collapse the moment one assumption fails. This compartmentalisation shows up in work like ZIP 212 , which removed a scenario where breaking SNARK soundness could have leaked information in edge cases, and in the broader design philosophy of keeping privacy as independent as possible from any single cryptographic building block. On top of this foundation, developers are now actively upgrading the protocol to handle “harvest now, decrypt later” threats and to prepare for a post-quantum world. A major focus is Project Tachyon, which aims to remove in-band secret distribution from shielded transactions. Today, some transaction details that are encrypted under elliptic-curve–based schemes could, in theory, be stored and decrypted decades later by a powerful quantum computer. By restructuring how secrets are shared and eliminating this dependency, Tachyon is intended to make on-chain shielded privacy robust even against retrospective quantum attacks. The long-term goal is that an adversary, no matter how advanced, will not be able to reconstruct sender, receiver, or amount information from the ledger alone, because that data simply never appears in a decryptable form on-chain. Developers are also working on what they describe as “quantum recoverability” for Zcash funds, particularly within the Orchard shielded pool. “Quantum recoverability” for Zcash refers to a planned mechanism that would let users safely migrate or reclaim their funds under stronger, post-quantum security conditions if large-scale quantum computers emerge, preventing attackers from exploiting older, vulnerable cryptographic keys. The idea is to give users a way to migrate or “rescue” their assets if credible quantum threats emerge sooner than expected, without handing an advantage to attackers. This involves changing how wallets manage keys and how spending conditions are expressed, so that if the community needs to tighten security, by switching to post-quantum conditions or additional checks, honest users can move their funds safely while quantum adversaries cannot easily front-run them. In parallel, the team is considering a dedicated long-term storage mechanism for users holding large balances or very long-horizon savings, allowing them to opt into stronger, more conservative cryptographic protections before quantum hardware matures. Zcash developers are exploring full post-quantum transitions for the pieces that remain vulnerable: signatures, proof systems, and encryption. On the proving side, that likely means investigating hash-based or STARK-style systems that avoid elliptic curves altogether, while maintaining the performance and succinctness that Zcash relies on. For key agreement and note encryption, lattice-based key encapsulation mechanisms like those standardised by the National Institute of Standards and Technology are natural candidates, though integrating them into mobile wallets and existing circuits is non-trivial. All of this has to be done without breaking auditability or fragmenting the user base, so the team is treating quantum migration as a staged process: harden privacy first, provide recovery paths for funds, and then progressively swap out pre-quantum primitives as mature post-quantum alternatives become practical. The result is not instant “quantum-proofing,” but a roadmap that makes Zcash progressively less dependent on cryptography that quantum computers are expected to weaken. How Does Zcash Stack Up For Quantum Resistance Against Other Chains? Zcash compares favourably to many major blockchains in the context of quantum resistance, largely because its shielded pool avoids exposing critical transaction data on-chain. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most legacy networks rely on elliptic-curve signatures that reveal public keys once a transaction is broadcast. A future quantum machine running Shor’s algorithm could derive the corresponding private keys, making historic funds vulnerable. By contrast, Zcash’s fully shielded transactions do not place sender or receiver public keys on the ledger at all. This structural difference reduces the exposure window for quantum adversaries and provides stronger baseline protection today, even though the underlying cryptography still uses elliptic-curve assumptions. Compared with other privacy-focused chains, Zcash also holds a distinct position. Monero, for example, uses ring signatures, stealth addresses, and RingCT to obscure transaction flows, but these mechanisms still depend on elliptic-curve cryptography that quantum computers are expected to break. Once elliptic curve cryptography becomes vulnerable, Monero’s anonymity set can be unwound retroactively because ring members and stealth address derivations ultimately rely on discrete-log hardness. That being said, Monero, like Zcash, has a development community already discussing and planning solutions for potential quantum vulnerabilities. Zcash’s shielded pool, by contrast, hides far more information by default. Under careful operational use, meaning only shielded transactions and no metadata leakage, Zcash provides a level of forward confidentiality that many other privacy coins cannot match under the same threat model. That said, Zcash is not yet fully quantum-resistant. Its zk-SNARK proofs, note encryption, and Orchard circuits still rely on elliptic-curve primitives that would lose soundness once quantum hardware becomes powerful enough. Similarly, transparent Zcash addresses face the same risks as Bitcoin and Ethereum, because their public keys are visible upon use. In this respect, Zcash shares many of the long-term vulnerabilities seen across the industry. What distinguishes it is the narrower attack surface inside the shielded pool and the work already underway to migrate sensitive components to post-quantum alternatives. In terms of preparation, Zcash is further along than many networks. Its developers have spent years designing the protocol to compartmentalise cryptographic assumptions and to allow components to be swapped out with post-quantum equivalents. Research into “quantum recoverability,” hash-based proof systems, and lattice-based encryption for note confidentiality shows a deliberate strategy to ensure upgrades can be adopted without overhauling the entire architecture. While no public blockchain is fully safe from a future, fault-tolerant quantum computer, Zcash’s design choices and ongoing development roadmap place it among the projects most actively preparing for that transition, and potentially more resilient than chains that rely heavily on exposed public keys and slower governance mechanisms.

This marks the seventh consecutive month of maintaining reserves significantly above industry norms, reinforcing the exchange’s emphasis on user protection and financial transparency. The latest audit highlights robust reserve coverage across major assets: Bitcoin (BTC): 162% Ethereum (ETH): 165% Tether (USDT): 160% Cardano (ADA): 150% USD Coin (USDC): 133% Ripple (XRP): 124% BTCC's reserve ratio has steadily increased over recent months, up from 132% in July to 141% in August, 143% in September, and 152% in October. The November report continues this trend, reflecting a consistent surplus of reserves over user deposits. ""We've maintained our reserve ratio well above 100% since May 2025,"" said Marcus Chen, Product Manager at BTCC. ""Strong reserves matter most during market turbulence; they ensure user assets remain fully protected regardless of conditions."" BTCC verifies its reserves through monthly Merkle Tree audits, ensuring complete transparency and real-time solvency validation. The practice has become a core part of BTCC’s operational standard as the industry shifts toward greater accountability following years of scrutiny.

The program offers tiered Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) ranging from 8% to 18% on deposits starting from 1,000 USDT. Multiple assets are supported, and rewards are automatically compounded.

The cryptocurrency market just witnessed a significant shakeup as Bitcoin price tumbles below the crucial $86,000 mark. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $85,978.68 on the Binance USDT market, sending ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem. This sudden drop has left many investors wondering about the future trajectory of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Why Did Bitcoin Price Drop Below $86,000? Several factors contributed to this recent Bitcoin price correction. Market analysts point to increased selling pressure from institutional investors and concerns about regulatory developments. Moreover, technical indicators suggested the market was overbought, making this correction somewhat expected. The current Bitcoin price movement reflects typical market cycles where periods of rapid growth often follow with healthy pullbacks. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? For current Bitcoin holders, this price drop presents both challenges and opportunities. Here are key considerations: Short-term volatility may continue as the market finds new support levels Long-term investors might see this as a buying opportunity Technical analysis suggests watching the $85,000 support level closely Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic despite the current Bitcoin price decline How Does This Bitcoin Price Movement Compare to Historical Patterns? Historical data shows that Bitcoin price corrections of 10-20% are common during bull markets. The current pullback from recent highs aligns with typical market behavior. Previous cycles demonstrate that such corrections often precede stronger rallies. Therefore, while the current Bitcoin price may concern some investors, experienced traders recognize this as normal market dynamics. What Are Experts Saying About the Future Bitcoin Price? Market analysts remain divided on immediate Bitcoin price predictions. Some experts believe this correction could extend further, while others see strong fundamental support at current levels. The overall consensus maintains that Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains positive due to: Increasing institutional adoption Growing mainstream acceptance Limited supply mechanics Continued network development Should You Worry About This Bitcoin Price Drop? For most investors, this Bitcoin price movement shouldn’t trigger panic. Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and price fluctuations are expected. However, it’s crucial to: Review your investment strategy Consider your risk tolerance Diversify your portfolio Stay informed about market developments The recent Bitcoin price action below $86,000 serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency investing requires both patience and perspective. While short-term movements can be dramatic, the fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong. Market corrections often create opportunities for strategic investors to enter or increase positions at more favorable price points. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to fall below $86,000? The drop resulted from combination of profit-taking, technical corrections, and broader market sentiment shifts affecting the Bitcoin price. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Many analysts consider price corrections as potential buying opportunities, but always conduct your own research and consider your financial situation. How low could Bitcoin price go? While predictions vary, technical analysts are watching the $85,000 and $83,000 levels as potential support zones for Bitcoin price. Will Bitcoin recover from this drop? Historical patterns suggest Bitcoin has consistently recovered from similar corrections, though past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Should I sell my Bitcoin now?

Bitmine is among the few DAT companies to continue with sporadic and sizable ETH orders. Bitmine has not given up on ETH, adding another transaction to a newly created wallet. Another 28,625 flowed into a custom wallet from the FalconX hot wallet, the preferred counterparty for Bitmine. The wallet is also linked to Tom Lee, the founder of Bitmine and a strong ETH proponent. Bitmine added over $82M worth of ETH just days following another purchase of 21K ETH. Bitmine also remained one of the last ETH buyers among DAT companies, expanding its treasury by 10% in the last month. During that period, ETH broke down below the $4,000 and later below the $3,000 mark, allowing Bitmine to buy the dip. Even after the latest purchases, however, the average price for Bitmine’s treasury is above $4,000 per ETH, putting pressure on the company with unrealized losses. BMNR shares trade near one-month low BMNR shares dipped to $26, down from a peak above $135 in July. Bitmine’s mNAV value is at 0.72, suggesting the shares do not command a premium to the treasury. A low mNAV does not mean BMNR is a bargain, but signals a loss of confidence in the DAT playbook. BMNR shares continued to slide, down 80% from their peak in July. Bitmine has not stopped buying ETH in the meantime, aiming to lock in gains from staking. | Source: Google Finance . The recent purchases show Bitmine still has resources to buy ETH even in its distressed state. The company already holds 2.94% of the ETH supply, aiming for a total of 5%. Despite its drop, BMNR has support from over 31% in institutional ownership. A total of 353 holders increased their positions, buying in at the end of September, a period of much higher optimism for ETH. For now, there are no signs of institutional capitulation, as only a handful of smaller backers decreased their holdings. Among the most active sellers was Sassicaia Capital Advisers, which sold 38,000 shares in September, cutting its exposure by 82%. Bitmine bets on Ethereum staking While the ETH price slid, Bitmine is making its long-term bet on Ethereum staking. The company’s goal is to stake its treasury, earning long-term passive income. Bitmine recently announced MAVAN, or Made in America Validator Network. The company aims to position itself as a secure, known validator for institutional clients. While Ethereum staking is permissionless, securing more significant funds with a known validator is more reliable. The work of a large-scale validator may bring $400 to $500M a year in block rewards and fees. However, realizing those earnings may come at a cost, as the rewards are in the form of ETH tokens. Bitmine plans to pay out $0.01 dividend per share, based on its revenues for 2025. The company considers its playbook superior to Strategy’s approach, as ETH can be used for staking, along with the issuance of liquid staking tokens.

Analysts are monitoring both the price and whale behavior as DOGE tries to hold above a key support level following sharp declines. 7 Billion DOGE Moved in 30 Days Between September 19 and November 23, on-chain data shared by Ali Martinez shows that wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE “sold or redistributed” nearly 7 billion coins. These wallets dropped from over 24 billion DOGE to about 17.17 billion in just one month. This period also saw DOGE’s price fall from $0.27 to $0.143.

Addresses holding between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE accumulated 4.72 billion tokens recently, valued at roughly $770 million. This behavior may reflect different strategies among holders at scale. Technical Setup Hints at Short-Term Bounce Dogecoin has shown signs of a short-term recovery. On the 4-hour chart, analyst Trader Tardigrade pointed out that it has formed a bullish crossover on the MACD indicator. The move suggests rising momentum as the price pushes toward a descending trendline. The trader also highlighted an ascending triangle breakout, a breakout on the RSI trendline, and oversold RSI conditions. They wrote that DOGE is “ nearing the end of the downtrend ,” but the price must move through resistance before confirming a shift. In addition to these signals, the TD Sequential indicator has printed a fresh buy signal. This tool is designed to identify points of exhaustion in a trend. The last time this signal appeared, DOGE posted a rapid rally of more than 100%, according to analysts tracking the setup. DOGE ETFs Add to Market Focus DOGE has gained attention following announcements about new exchange-traded products. Grayscale is preparing to launch the GDOG ETF, while Bitwise is reportedly planning a similar product under review. These developments have added a short-term boost to sentiment. As of press time, DOGE is trading near $0.146 after bouncing from last week’s lows. Traders are watching the $0.1468 support area to see if the price can hold and start a move toward the next resistance levels.

Ripple’s $202M Transfer Sparks Wave-2 Thriller,https://coinpaper.com/12568/is-2-03-xrp-s-final-low-ripple-s-202-m-transfer-sparks-wave-2-thriller,"XRP Eyes $2.03 as Potential Final Low, Setting Stage for Wave 3 Surge According to renowned market analyst CasiTrades, XRP could be nearing the end of its wave 2 correction, with $2.03 emerging as a potential final low. The analyst highlights that the ongoing price chop is playing a critical role in maintaining a bullish RSI divergence, a technical signal that often precedes strong upward movements. CasiTrades emphasizes that if XRP touches $2.03 concurrently with Bitcoin testing its $88,000 support level, the market alignment, or confluence, becomes particularly significant. Such synchronization between XRP and Bitcoin would not only reinforce the likelihood of a macro bottom but also create ideal conditions for the launch of a new macro Wave 3. Presently, XRP and Bitcoin are trading at $2.05 and $85,922, respectively. What does this mean? Well the next wave could potentially propel XRP toward new all-time highs above the present one of $3.65, according to CasiTrades analysis. Wave theory is key to this outlook. Wave 2 corrections often retrace the initial surge before a stronger Wave 3 push. In this context, $2.03 isn’t just support, it’s a strategic pivot where long-term buyers may enter to maximize risk-to-reward potential. Furthermore, Technical indicators support this scenario. The RSI shows bullish divergence, signaling weakening downward pressure and a potential market reversal. According to CasiTrades, XRP’s ongoing price “chop” is sustaining this divergence, boosting the likelihood that $2.03 could mark the final low. The XRP-Bitcoin correlation remains pivotal. A strong rebound of Bitcoin from $88,000 could trigger XRP’s next major upward wave, potentially setting the stage for Wave 3 and record-breaking gains. CasiTrades’ analysis highlights $2.03 as a potential floor for XRP’s current correction, offering a high-probability entry point for traders tracking wave patterns and technical indicators. Ripple Moves Massive 102 Million XRP to Dormant Wallet, Sparking Market Buzz In a striking move that has caught the attention of traders and crypto enthusiasts, Ripple has transferred an astonishing 102 million XRP, worth over $202 million, to an unknown wallet, according to renowned market analyst Xaif Crypto. The sheer scale of the transaction has set off speculation across social media and trading forums, highlighting the ongoing influence of large holders in the XRP ecosystem. What makes this transaction particularly intriguing is the history of the receiving wallet. Activated four years ago, the wallet originally held a modest 6,000 XRP. For years, it remained largely inactive, drawing little attention from the market. But now, with a sudden influx of 102 million XRP, it has transformed into a whale-sized holding, prompting questions about the intentions behind such a move. Massive transfers like this often signal strategic moves by institutions or high-net-worth investors. While the intent is unclear, such activity can indicate accumulation, future trading plans, or the lead-up to major market events. Historically, reactivated dormant wallets with large sums have preceded notable price swings, fueling speculation and volatility. Xaif Crypto emphasizes that massive XRP movements reflect the growing influence of whales on market sentiment. Such transactions signal strategic shifts that affect supply, liquidity, and price dynamics, making these wallets key indicators for Ripple’s next moves. Notably, moving 102 million XRP is a powerful signal. It underscores Ripple’s strong institutional involvement and highlights how whale activity can sway market sentiment. For traders watching blockchain flows, this transaction is a stark reminder of the scale, influence, and unpredictability of the crypto market. Conclusion XRP’s $2.03 level could mark a critical turning point. If it coincides with Bitcoin holding $88,000 support, the setup for a macro bottom becomes strong, potentially igniting the long-awaited Wave 3 surge. Meanwhile, the transfer of 102 million XRP highlights the immense influence of whales in the crypto market. While the wallet’s intentions remain unknown, such moves emphasize the need to track dormant wallets and blockchain activity, offering traders and investors key insights into potential XRP price shifts and the unpredictable dynamics of the crypto ecosystem.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-24 09:47:04

Tether CEO Ardoino: “Bitcoin Will Stand the Test of Time” Ardoino stated that Bitcoin will survive all the challenges and will be positioned as a much stronger asset in the future. Ardoino wrote in his post, “Bitcoin will stand the test of time. Institutions that attempt to destroy it will ultimately fail and will fade into the dusty abyss of history.” According to the CEO, the main reason for this is that no organization can hinder people's free will and right to choose in the long run. While the cryptocurrency market has occasionally faced intense regulatory pressure, political controversies, and allegations of market manipulation, Ardoino argues that Bitcoin is resilient to such pressures. The statements came at a time when global regulatory debates and criticism of Bitcoin from some government institutions are on the agenda. Experts interpret the Tether CEO's statement as a stance emphasizing Bitcoin's core values of “freedom,” “decentralization,” and “user sovereignty.” Despite market uncertainty, belief in Bitcoin's resilience remains strong among long-term investors. Ardoino's message resonated widely within the crypto community and reignited discussions about the future of Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

The investment giant predicts a remarkably flat path for the Euro against Norwegian Krone, defying expectations of significant movement. This EUR/NOK forecast comes at a critical time when global economic factors are creating waves across forex markets. Understanding Morgan Stanley’s EUR/NOK Analysis Morgan Stanley’s comprehensive research team has identified several key factors contributing to their stable EUR/NOK forecast. The analysis combines macroeconomic indicators, central bank policies, and commodity price movements to paint a clear picture of what lies ahead for this currency pair. Their Morgan Stanley analysis suggests that opposing forces are creating a perfect balance, preventing significant directional movement in either direction. Norwegian Krone Outlook: The Balancing Act The Norwegian krone faces multiple competing influences that Morgan Stanley believes will maintain equilibrium. On one hand, Norway’s strong economic fundamentals and oil-dependent economy provide underlying strength. On the other, global risk sentiment and interest rate differentials create headwinds. This creates what analysts describe as ‘currency stability’ – a rare phenomenon in today’s turbulent markets. Key Factors Driving the Flat Forex Outlook Morgan Stanley’s research highlights several critical elements shaping their conservative forex outlook: Oil price stability and Norway’s petroleum revenue management European Central Bank and Norges Bank policy alignment Global risk sentiment and safe-haven flows Economic growth differentials between Eurozone and Norway What This EUR/NOK Forecast Means for Traders The flat trajectory predicted in this EUR/NOK forecast presents both challenges and opportunities. Range-bound trading conditions require different strategies than trending markets. Morgan Stanley analysis suggests that traders should focus on shorter timeframes and be prepared for potential breakouts when fundamental conditions shift. Comparing Current Market Conditions to Historical Patterns Period Average EUR/NOK Movement Key Drivers 2020-2021 High Volatility Pandemic Response, Oil Crash 2022-2023 Moderate Movement Inflation Concerns, Rate Hikes Current Forecast Flat/Low Volatility Balanced Forces, Policy Stability Actionable Insights from Morgan Stanley’s Research Based on their comprehensive Morgan Stanley analysis, here are key takeaways for market participants: Monitor oil price developments closely for early warning signals Watch for divergence in ECB and Norges Bank policy statements Consider options strategies that benefit from low volatility Prepare contingency plans for unexpected market-moving events Frequently Asked Questions What is Morgan Stanley’s track record with currency forecasts? Morgan Stanley has established credibility in financial markets with their research division consistently producing well-regarded analysis across multiple asset classes. How does oil price affect the Norwegian krone outlook? Norway’s economy remains heavily dependent on petroleum exports, making the Norwegian krone particularly sensitive to energy price movements and global demand patterns. What central bank policies influence the EUR/NOK forecast? Both the European Central Bank and Norges Bank play crucial roles in determining interest rate differentials and monetary policy directions that affect currency valuations. Are there any geopolitical risks to this stable forecast? While Morgan Stanley’s base case suggests stability, unexpected geopolitical events or major economic shifts could disrupt the current equilibrium and alter the forex outlook significantly. How should traders position themselves given this analysis? Traders might consider strategies that benefit from range-bound conditions while maintaining flexibility to adapt if the currency stability scenario changes. Conclusion: Navigating Currency Stability in Uncertain Times Morgan Stanley’s EUR/NOK forecast provides valuable guidance in a complex market environment. The predicted flat path represents a rare moment of equilibrium amid global economic crosscurrents. While currency stability might seem uneventful, it offers unique opportunities for disciplined traders who understand how to navigate range-bound conditions. The key insight from this Morgan Stanley analysis is that sometimes, the most profitable strategy is recognizing when markets are likely to go nowhere fast.

The dog-themed token marked a daily gain of over 3%, ahead of newly approved spot ETFs listings on NYSE Arca. DOGE’s optimism arises as the memecoin is gearing up for the launch of its DOGE ETF product later today. The New York Stock Exchange approved the trading of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust ETF Shares last Friday.

ETF analyst Nate Geraci called the launch “as highly symbolic” and “monumental crypto regulatory shift over the past year.” “GDOG might already be top 10 ticker symbol for me,” he wrote on X. Launching tomorrow… Grayscale Dogecoin ETF. First ‘33 Act doge ETF. Some (many) might laugh, but I actually view this as a highly symbolic launch. IMO, best example of *monumental* crypto regulatory shift over past yr.

The native token DOGE rose nearly 3% over the last 24 hours, outperforming Bitcoin (-1.4%) and Ethereum (-0.8%). Further, DOGE’s ETF news amplified its status as the “blue-chip” memecoin, attracting sidelined capital. The memecoin is trading at $0.146 at press time, per CoinMarketCap data . However, per Coinglass , whales have sold 200 million DOGE, worth $29 million, during the rally, capping gains. The brief rally, stemming from the upcoming ETF launch, is also historically attributed to Elon Musk’s mentions on X. The White House confirmed that the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) has quietly ceased to function despite having eight months left on its mandate’s expiry. Though the news is unrelated to the token, the mere mention of DOGE has triggered the token’s price surge. Analysts note that though the Dogecoin ETF launch marks a milestone, broader crypto headwinds and whale selling suggest cautious optimism.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a purpose-driven DeFi platform with the potential to rival even Dogecoin (DOGE) in influence and adoption. Currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM has already raised over $18.85 million and secured 18,120+ investors, signaling unprecedented early-stage interest. Beyond the numbers, its decentralized lending-and-borrowing protocol, launching V1 on the Sepolia testnet, combines capital efficiency, strong security, 90/100 CertiK score, and community incentives, positioning it as a DeFi powerhouse. For those seeking the next crypto to explode, Mutuum Finance represents a rare convergence of innovative utility, rapid adoption, and strategic design, qualities that could see it outshine even legendary tokens like Dogecoin. Dogecoin Struggles to Recover Amid Persistent Downtrend Dogecoin (DOGE) has been trending downward for some time, punctuated by repeated corrections and short periods of consolidation that have failed to sustain upward momentum. After the most recent drop, the price is attempting a rebound, but analysts note that a stronger recovery will only be confirmed if DOGE can break above the nearby resistance zone, which has consistently capped gains in recent weeks. As this top-tier meme token faces ongoing volatility and uncertain short-term momentum, investors are increasingly evaluating Mutuum Finance, a project with clearer growth potential and utility and the next big crypto that could lead in 2025. MUTM Presale Phase 6: A Time-Sensitive Window for Maximum Returns In Phase 6 of the MUTM presale, tokens are priced at $0.035, with the price set to rise to $0.04 in Phase 7. With over 95% of Phase 6 already sold, the limited availability reflects strong market confidence in the project’s future growth potential. Early investors in this phase are well-positioned to capitalize on substantial returns as MUTM gains traction, demonstrating why it’s considered the next crypto to explode in DeFi markets. With increasing attention and adoption, the platform shows significant potential to become a breakout performer, offering investors a better opportunity to get in at an early, high-potential stage. Mutuum Introduces Dynamic Leaderboard to Reward Top Investors Mutuum Finance is launching an innovative dashboard designed to increase user engagement by featuring a dynamic leaderboard of the top 50 token holders. This interactive tool allows users to track their rankings and compare their holdings against other participants, adding an element of gamified competition. Currently, the top-ranking investors hold tokens valued at $1,758, $1,370, $1,283, and $1,128, reflecting the significant commitment of the platform’s leading participants. Beyond recognition, the leaderboard provides tangible rewards: investors who maintain a top position receive bonus tokens, offering an additional incentive to remain active in the ecosystem. By combining friendly competition with meaningful rewards, Mutuum Finance encourages a more engaged, motivated, and loyal community of token holders while further reinforcing its standing as the next big crypto. Security and Transparency: The Pillars of Mutuum Finance At the core of Mutuum Finance are security and transparency, ensuring investor confidence and platform reliability. The project’s smart contract underwent a comprehensive audit by CertiK, earning a Token Scan score of 90/100, which reflects its high quality and robustness. To further enhance security, Mutuum Finance has introduced a $50,000 bug bounty program, proactively identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities. These measures demonstrate the team’s commitment to rigorous risk management, providing assurance to investors that the platform operates safely and reliably in the highly dynamic DeFi ecosystem. With all these fundamentals, MUTM is well-positioned as the next crypto to explode in 2025. Early Entry into the Next Big Crypto Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $18.85 million with more than 18,120 investors, and Phase 6 is now over 90% sold at $0.035 per token. Phase 7 will increase the price to $0.04, creating a limited window for early-stage participation. With its upcoming V1 Sepolia testnet, CertiK-audited smart contracts scoring 90/100, a dynamic leaderboard rewarding top investors, and a purpose-driven DeFi lending-and-borrowing protocol, MUTM combines real utility, strong security, and rapid adoption.

Arthur Hayes’ $BTC $250K Call, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and the Next Crypto to Explode November 24, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Arthur Hayes now talks about $BTC accelerating toward $250,000 by December , only months after the latest halving, arguing that a post-halving supply squeeze plus renewed liquidity could drive fresh all-time highs. That kind of move from roughly the high-$80,000 zone would more than double Bitcoin’s market cap and push base-layer blockspace back into permanent scarcity. When that happens, value tends to flow into infrastructure that helps Bitcoin handle higher throughput without sacrificing settlement guarantees. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) builds exactly for that moment by launching a Bitcoin Layer-2 on the Solana Virtual Machine, using a canonical bridge so you move $BTC onto faster rails for DeFi, NFTs, and payments while final value still settles back to Bitcoin. $HYPER powers transaction fees and staking in that ecosystem, so adoption of the network directly feeds token demand. With $28.37M already raised at $0.013325, you step into a play that is tied to $BTC’s upside but adds scaling and yield on top. Read our $HYPER price prediction to see what the future holds. Satoshi’s ‘Gift’ of Volatility, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) and the Next Crypto to Explode November 24, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Michael Saylor now frames $BTC’s wild price swings as ‘Satoshi’s gift’ , pointing out that even after a steep year-to-date drawdown in $MSTR, his treasury still sits on billions in unrealized profit on 649,870 $BTC. He argues that volatility is the price of high performance, rewarding anyone who can hold for four-year cycles instead of trading noise. That logic only really works if you keep assets self-custodied, liquid, and ready to deploy whenever the next impulse move starts. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) plugs into that need as the utility asset behind a non-custodial wallet designed to hold and swap crypto across multiple chains while giving you direct access to curated presales from a built-in launchpad. Inside the app, $BEST unlocks reduced fees, higher staking rewards, and governance over future upgrades, so your activity turns into tangible upside rather than just gas spend. With $17.39M already raised at $0.025995, you position yourself inside infra that benefits every time volatility returns. More importantly, the presale ends in 4 days, so there’s no time to lose. Here’s how to buy $BEST now.

This move marks JD.com’s supply chain arm’s significant step towards finalizing its more than two-year effort to go public. According to the information provided in the terms, Jingdong Industrials Inc., a leading industrial supply chain technology and service provider in China, operating as a business-to-business (B2B) platform under its parent company, JD.com, began its investor education meetings on Monday, November 24. Sources close to the situation highlighted that the IPO could yield about $500 million in the next few weeks. Due to the confidential nature of the deal, the sources wished to maintain their anonymity. JD.com seeks to go public in Hong Kong Reports indicate that JD.com’s IPO filing was initially submitted in 2023, but it wasn’t until this September that China’s securities regulator completed its review and gave the green light. In a statement, the team mentioned that they plan to use the funds raised from this offering to enhance the unit’s industrial supply chain capabilities. This includes enhancing AI technologies and seeking investments and acquisitions, according to the recent listing documents of JD.com’s supply chain arm. When reporters reached out to JD.com for comments on its IPO plan, the company declined to respond. Regarding this new offering, analysts conducted research and discovered that the offering contributes to a series of deals in Hong Kong. As Hong Kong establishes itself as a hub for companies seeking to go public, listings in the region are projected to exceed $40 billion by 2025. Their findings also highlighted that JD.com faces significant challenges in a market that is becoming increasingly uncertain following a strong previous year, as many of the recently introduced products have not performed well. In the meantime, reports dated 2023 noted that JD.com mentioned that Jingdong Industrials would have a more precise value with a carve-out listing, which would allow it to access equity and debt capital markets directly. At this time, the company also aimed to list its property unit, but this has yet to get the green light from the China Securities Regulatory Commission. So far this year, JD.com’s shares have drastically decreased by about 18% in Hong Kong, while the city’s stock benchmark, the Hang Seng Index, has surged by 27%. Notably, Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Haitong International, and UBS Group AG are acting as joint sponsors for the offering. Several AI firms seeking to go public While many listings carried out in Hong Kong have primarily resulted from firms currently operating in mainland China , September reports mentioned that the region started to observe new companies selling shares for the first time. An example is Zijin Gold, which reportedly encountered a delay due to Super Typhoon Ragasa, the most intense tropical storm so far in the 2025 Pacific typhoon season. It was set to begin trading on September 30. These new listings, according to sources, are intended to help assess the market’s strength, particularly since investors are less familiar with them. “The real challenge will be next year — whether the market can find true prices and connect buyers and sellers to finalize deals,” said James Wang, who leads ECM for Asia ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. As AI becomes increasingly adopted among companies in their operations, some of the Chinese-based firms planning to go public include MiniMax, known as one of the country’s AI “Dragons” or “Tigers,” and Zhipu, which competes with OpenAI.

He stated that the correct range, when adjusted to a logarithmic scale, should fall between $1.63 and $1.88. This correction aligns with material he previously shared for subscribers on 12 October, where he detailed what he called the “golden pocket” zone. The adjustment appears intended to maintain technical accuracy and continuity with earlier work rather than to revise his broader outlook. The charts attached in his latest update reference that same structural area, suggesting that the overall framework he has been tracking remains unchanged. JD’s commentary also made it clear that he is continuing to view XRP’s market behavior through strict chart analysis, reaffirming his preference for technical indicators over external narratives. Projection of a Final Move Before a Major Decline JD’s central message concerns what he interprets as an impending final upward move before a significant decline. He stated that he expects one more rise in price before what he referred to as a “rug pull crash,” indicating that, in his view, the upcoming upward movement is not the start of a prolonged trend but rather the concluding phase of the current formation. He contrasted this view with what he considers misplaced optimism driven by discussions surrounding exchange-traded fund expectations , partnerships, and other utility-based claims. According to him, such narratives have led many traders into unfavorable positions. His update reiterates that his projections are rooted solely in structural chart data.

He urged XRP holders to be aware of what he believes is a high-risk setup masked by short-term upward movement. The objective of his communication is to bring attention to the technical structure rather than sentiment-driven expectations. By outlining both the corrected range and his expectation of a final rise before a steep decline, JD provides a clear and structured interpretation of where he believes XRP currently stands within its broader pattern. His warning is consistent with his previous technical posts, and his latest update serves as an advisory for traders who prioritize disciplined market analysis.

The investment giant warns that sterling’s remarkable outperformance against the US dollar is set to fade dramatically in the coming year, sending ripples through global currency markets and forcing traders to reconsider their positions. What Does Morgan Stanley’s GBP/USD Forecast Really Mean? Morgan Stanley’s analysis suggests that the current sterling performance against the dollar represents a temporary peak rather than a sustainable trend. The bank points to several fundamental factors that will likely reverse the pound’s recent gains, creating significant opportunities and risks for forex traders. This GBP/USD forecast comes at a time when currency markets are particularly sensitive to central bank policies and economic data surprises. The Driving Forces Behind Sterling’s Current Strength Understanding why the pound has outperformed requires examining recent economic developments: Bank of England’s relatively hawkish stance compared to other central banks Better-than-expected UK economic data in recent quarters Political stability following recent elections Stronger inflation persistence in the UK economy Why Morgan Stanley Believes the Tide Will Turn The investment bank’s Morgan Stanley analysis identifies several key factors that will likely pressure sterling in 2025. Their research team emphasizes that current market expectations may be overly optimistic about the UK’s economic resilience and the Bank of England’s ability to maintain higher interest rates compared to other major economies. Factor Current Impact Expected 2025 Impact Interest Rate Differentials Supports GBP Likely to Narrow Economic Growth Relatively Strong Expected to Slow Inflation Dynamics Persistent Converging with Peers Navigating the Changing Currency Markets Landscape For active participants in currency markets , Morgan Stanley’s warning signals a need to reassess trading strategies. The bank suggests that the current alignment of factors supporting sterling is unlikely to persist, creating potential for significant repricing in GBP/USD positions. This shift could have cascading effects across other major currency pairs and global asset classes. Actionable Insights for Your Forex Outlook Building a robust forex outlook requires considering multiple scenarios. While Morgan Stanley presents a bearish case for sterling, traders should monitor several key indicators that could validate or contradict this view: UK inflation data relative to expectations Bank of England communication and voting patterns US Federal Reserve policy trajectory Global risk sentiment and capital flows Frequently Asked Questions What specific GBP/USD levels does Morgan Stanley target? While exact targets may evolve with market conditions, Morgan Stanley typically provides specific technical and fundamental levels in their client research. How does this analysis affect other currency pairs? Sterling’s performance often correlates with EUR/GBP and GBP/JPY, creating potential spillover effects across major pairs. What time frame does this forecast cover? Morgan Stanley’s analysis primarily focuses on the 2025 outlook, though near-term catalysts could accelerate or delay expected moves. Where can I find Morgan Stanley’s original research? The original analysis is available through Morgan Stanley’s research portal for institutional clients and through their published market commentary. How does the Bank of England’s policy affect this forecast? The Bank of England’s interest rate decisions and forward guidance are critical factors in Morgan Stanley’s assessment. The Bottom Line: Preparing for Sterling’s Shift The warning from Morgan Stanley serves as a crucial reminder that currency trends rarely move in straight lines indefinitely. While sterling has enjoyed a period of remarkable strength, the fundamental drivers appear poised for reversal. Traders who position themselves for this potential shift could capture significant opportunities, while those caught unprepared may face substantial losses. The coming months will test whether Morgan Stanley’s critical forecast proves accurate or if sterling can defy expectations once again.

54837457,633125,1763978898,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54837457.jpeg,XRP Reclaims $2: Best Altcoins To Buy As Capital Rotates,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-as-xrp-recovers-2/,"Quick Facts: $XRP’s move back above $2, with its price reclaiming the middle Bollinger Band, points to a renewed bullish structure rather than a failed cycle. Higher-timeframe Bollinger Bands on $XRP still trend upward, suggesting room toward $2.5–$3.5 if key mid-bands and supports continue to hold. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) both pair strong narratives with sizable presales, offering higher-beta exposure versus $XRP’s more limited upside profile. Allocating core capital to $XRP while using $HYPER and $BEST for targeted, thesis-driven risk can balance liquidity, yield, and long-term growth potential. $XRP has finally clawed its way back above the $2 mark after a rough week, and the charts just flipped from stress to opportunity. On the daily timeframe, price is back above the middle Bollinger Band near $2.04, turning what looked like a breakdown into a fresh bullish setup with the upper band sitting around $2.5 as the next big test. Zooming out, $XRP is still holding key weekly and monthly mid-bands around $2.2 and $1.7. That tells a different story than the intraday noise: the structural uptrend is intact, and the recent flush looks more like a volatility reset than the end of the cycle. The catch is simple. With $XRP’s market cap now north of $123B and trading around $2.04 at the time of writing, a move higher is absolutely on the table. Traders who rode the dip are already thinking about what to rotate into next, hunting for the best altcoins to buy while liquidity is still hot. That’s where upcoming infrastructure plays, like Bitcoin Hyper and Best Wallet Token, step in. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Layer-2 Speed With Asymmetric Upside Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) functions around a straightforward promise: keep Bitcoin’s security, ditch its slowness. Bitcoin Hyper uses a modular Layer 2 anchored to Bitcoin, but executes transactions on a Solana-style virtual machine (SVM), allowing them to settle in seconds with significantly lower fees. Users lock $BTC on Layer-1, mint wrapped $BTC on Bitcoin Hyper, then use that capital for DeFi, payments, and dApps at high throughput. That narrative is hitting at the right time. While spot Bitcoin chops around and fees remain unpredictable, the Bitcoin Hyper presale has already cleared more than $28M, with the current presale price of $0.013325 and staking yields around 41% APY for early participants. Those numbers show real conviction from whales and retail alike, not just meme-driven speculation. Indeed, recent whale buys of $500K and $379.9K tell the story. On the upside modeling side, our price prediction for $HYPER shows a 2026 high of $0.20 and a 2030 price point of $1.50 or higher if the roadmap lands and liquidity arrives on major exchanges. Measured from today’s presale price, this hints at a return rate of 1,400% for 2026 and over 11,155% for 2030 on paper. The hype is real and explains how $HYPER managed to become one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025. If you’re interested, it’s best to move fast, as Bitcoin Hyper targets a release window between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. Read our guide on how to buy $HYPER now. Visit the presale page and buy your $HYPER while you still can. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Multi-Chain Wallet Token with Launchpad Perks If Bitcoin Hyper is the rails, Best Wallet is the front-end that everyday users actually touch. The Best Wallet app is a live, non-custodial, multi-chain wallet that allows you to buy, store, swap, stake, and soon spend crypto via an upcoming debit card. It already supports major chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, and Base, with portfolio tracking, cross-chain swaps routed through 300+ DEXs and 30 bridges, and no-seed-phrase MPC security under the hood. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers that ecosystem. Holding it brings reduced swap and on-ramp fees, launchpad access to upcoming tokens inside the app, and governance. Recent figures show the presale has raised more than $17.39M with tokens priced at $0.025995 and staking APYs sitting at 75% for early participants. For a product with hundreds of thousands of active wallet users, that’s a meaningful alignment between live adoption and token economics. On the price-target front, our price prediction for $BEST suggests a price point of $0.62 in 2026 and $0.82 or higher by 2030, assuming exchange listings, 60+ chain support, and the Best Card rollout all materialize as planned. Relative to today’s presale price, that’s roughly a 2,285% move to the 2025 high and about 3,054%to the 2026 high on paper. It’s not a guarantee, but it shows why rotating a slice of capital from slower large-caps into a wallet-infrastructure token with sticky users isn’t just degen behavior – it’s a calculated bet on the tools people actually use. If you want in, read our guide on how to buy $BEST. Buy $BEST on the official presale page today. 3. XRP ($XRP) – Large-Cap Liquidity Play in a Breakout Setup Back to the headline act. XRP ($XRP) is trading at $2.04, firmly back above the key daily middle Bollinger Band after briefly flirting with the lower band and triggering panic. The upper band around $2.52 is the next obvious technical magnet, and if that breaks, the door opens toward the higher timeframe bands that sit closer to $3.5 and beyond. The weekly and monthly structures still appear remarkably constructive: $XRP continues to respect deeper mid-bands, confirming that the multi-month trend remains intact, even after sharp pullbacks. That’s exactly the kind of setup where large-cap money flows first – ETFs, structured products, and conservative capital tend to prefer names where liquidity is deep and the trend is visible on a monthly chart, not just a meme-driven 4-hour spike. The trade-off is that $XRP is unlikely to deliver the 20x+ style returns people chase in presales. It’s better thought of as the liquidity anchor in a rotation strategy: ride the potential breakout back toward and potentially beyond the prior all-time high near $3.84, then shave profits into higher-beta names like $HYPER and $BEST if the cycle continues to mature. You can find $XRP on major centralized exchanges, including Binance , making it relatively straightforward to execute such a rotation in practice. You can buy your $XRP on Binance today. Recap: XRP’s push above $2 with bullish signals shows large-cap alt momentum is alive. Traders are eying $HYPER for scalability, $BEST for utility, while $XRP continues to anchor liquidity. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR and manage risks wisely before investing.

The timing is interesting because DOGE enters a major catalyst window as Grayscale prepares to launch the GDOG ETF on the New York Stock Exchange. ETFs often shift market psychology fast, and traders are watching to see whether DOGE reacts like Bitcoin did during its ETF debut or takes a more gradual path. The setup raises a simple question: Is DOGE preparing for its next major trend? ETF Debuts Reshape Market Expectations Grayscale’s new DOGE and XRP ETFs arrive at a time when the market is warming up to regulated crypto products. GDOG will become one of the first Dogecoin-linked ETFs available to U.S. investors, and the fund uses spot DOGE as its underlying asset. Some elements in this launch stand out: GDOG converts from an existing private trust Coinbase handles custody NYSE Arca provides the listing venue This combo signals strong compliance alignment. It also gives DOGE a direct pipeline into traditional portfolios. Many observers expect GDOG to attract meaningful attention, especially with analyst Eric Balchunas projecting up to $11 million in first-day volume. It’s rare for a meme coin to gain institutional framing like this. DOGE now stands beside BTC, ETH, and XRP in ETF-ready status. Regulatory Climate Improves A key driver of these ETF approvals comes from SEC Chairman Paul Atkins. He shifted the agency’s stance from restrictive enforcement to transparency-based oversight. His “Project Crypto” approach encourages compliant issuers to enter regulated markets. This creates a healthier environment for DOGE. Even better, GDOG arrives alongside GXRP, forming a broader wave of non-BTC, non-ETH ETFs. If institutions diversify into alternative assets, DOGE may benefit more than expected. Institutional and Retail Dynamics Strengthen DOGE’s Case ETF inflows often behave as accelerators. If GDOG follows historical patterns, traders may see an influx of both institutional flows and retail interest. Consider why this matters: Retail participation rises when access becomes easier Institutions prefer regulated, custodied exposure Meme-driven assets benefit from momentum cycles DOGE has always thrived on narrative shifts. With ETF approval, the narrative gains a new angle: “compliance premium.” Leverage Adds Volatility Through TXXD Source: X The launch of the 21Shares 2x Long DOGE ETF (TXXD) introduces a high-intensity product built for short-term traders. The leveraged nature makes DOGE more visible to traders seeking amplified exposure. It also hints at increased intraday volatility. This fund tracks DOGE’s daily performance with double sensitivity, which raises an interesting question: Will this increase market depth or exaggerate short-term liquidation events? Or should we treat TXXD with caution due to its compounding effects. Technical Outlook: Reaction Zone Ahead DOGE trades around $0.1466, holding a mid-range position. The structure shows consolidation and weakness, with room for a dip toward $0.09270, a strong historical support area. Many watch that zone closely, if the current one breaks, since it marks a key reaction area. Source: X If buyers defend current levels, price may push toward resistance at $0.30 and $0.48. A break and close above those levels would signal a stronger shift toward bullish territory. For now, DOGE remains in a neutral-to-bearish setup while holding potential for a sharp recovery if ETF momentum supports inflows. Dogecoin Price Prediction Table: 2025 Period Minimum Average maximum 2025 $0.11 $0.19 $0.42 November 2025 $0.12 $0.15 $0.21 December 2025 $0.13 $0.17 $0.24 Conclusion DOGE’s ecosystem enters a new phase as ETF products strengthen its legitimacy and broaden investor access. The combination of GDOG, TXXD, and improved regulatory clarity gives DOGE fresh catalysts heading into the final months of 2025. While risks exist, the landscape now favors structured institutional participation. DOGE’s 2025 outlook hinges on whether buyers defend key levels and whether ETF inflows activate the next bullish cycle.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-24 10:08:49

At the same time, fresh on-chain and chart signals point to conditions that historically formed near major cycle peaks. Coinbase Premium Stays Negative as U.S. Demand Weakens Bitcoin’s latest slide comes as the Coinbase Premium Index drops deeper into negative territory, signaling soft U.S. spot demand during a broader market drawdown. The metric, tracked by CryptoQuant, measures whether Bitcoin trades at a higher or lower price on Coinbase compared with global exchanges. It often reflects the sentiment of U.S. institutional and high-net-worth buyers. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index. Source: CryptoQuant / X The chart shows Bitcoin moving toward the mid-80,000 dollar zone while the hourly premium stays below zero. This negative reading means BTC is trading cheaper on Coinbase than on offshore venues, which usually indicates selling pressure or weaker bid activity from U.S. participants. At the same time, the green and red bands in the data highlight how consistently the index has remained below neutral since early November. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, noted that it still feels early to declare a full recovery in institutional sentiment. He pointed out that the hourly premium remains negative even as other regions show signs of accumulation. His comment underscores the divergence between U.S. flows and global markets, especially during episodes of elevated volatility. The declining premium also follows a series of rapid price drops, suggesting that U.S. traders may be offloading positions or reducing exposure as Bitcoin approaches support zones. Meanwhile, global exchanges show steadier pricing, which implies that offshore buying is absorbing part of the sell-side pressure. This dynamic often appears during heavy corrections, when liquidity concentrates in specific regions. The latest premium levels align with broader on-chain behavior. Coinbase-linked wallets have not shown large inflows that typically mark aggressive buying, while offshore venues continue to post more balanced flows. As long as the premium stays below zero, analysts say it reflects cautious conditions among U.S. investors during the current downturn. Traders Dynamic Index Signals Possible Bitcoin Cycle Peak Meanwhile, Bitcoin’ s two-month Traders Dynamic Index now flashes a classic late-cycle warning as the green line crosses below the red line. On Man of Bitcoin’s chart, the slow moving average (green) has slipped under the fast moving average (red) while BTC trades near the upper boundary of a long-term rising channel that connects the 2017 and 2021 tops. Bitcoin 2 Month TDI Channel. Source: Man of Bitcoin This crossover on the TDI has often appeared close to major bull-cycle peaks in past cycles. In both 2017 and 2021, similar two-month crossovers developed after extended rallies, when price already sat near the upper band of the channel and momentum began to cool. The current structure echoes that pattern, with BTC still elevated after a strong multi-year advance. At the same time, the broader TDI bands on the chart show the green and red lines rolling over from relatively high levels instead of recovering from oversold territory. That configuration points to fading upside momentum rather than early-cycle accumulation. As long as the crossover holds on the higher time frame, it suggests traders may treat the recent move as a maturing phase of the bull cycle, even if short-term rebounds remain possible within the channel.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-24 10:16:24
54840355,https://finbold.com/?p=258050,1763983842,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,AI predicts Dogecoin price by the end of 2025 as DOGE disbanded,https://finbold.com/ai-predicts-dogecoin-price-by-the-end-of-2025-as-doge-disbanded/,"Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has kicked off the week on a positive note, climbing as much as 1.5% on Monday, November 24. The uptick appears to be the result of the upcoming Grayscale DOGE ETF set to go live on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) later today. While there is no guarantee the fund will attract substantial inflows, the recently launched Rex-Osprey fund (DOJE) hit six times the average day-one volume. In other words, short-term price movements and rally-conducive hype are possible. Furthermore, the optimism has been sufficient to negate any negative sentiment generated by the news that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was reportedly disbanded. While the department and the crypto were only associated coincidentally, via their names, both have a strong connection with Elon Musk, Dogecoin’s biggest supporter. To see how the ongoing political developments and new institutional moves might affect the original meme coin, Finbold asked OpenAI’s most powerful chatbot, ChatGPT-5 , where Dogecoin might stand price-wise by the end of 2025. ChatGPT predicts Dogecoin price for the end of 2025 Synthesizing the competing forecasts and analyzing the meme coin’s current price action, the artificial intelligence ( AI ) places Dogecoin’s most realistic 2025 year-end price in the $0.20–$0.30 range. DOGE price prediction for December 31. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT According to the AI’s reasoning, the base-case scenario assumes the broader crypto market is gearing up for a moderate rally in the next few weeks. That is, Dogecoin is not likely to witness a rally based purely on hype if the industry proves weak as a whole. A stronger-than-expected crypto cycle, a scenario that requires both crypto market tailwinds and meme-driven hype, could lift the token toward $0.35–$0.50. Conversely, a downturn caused by low institutional demand, ETF stagnation, and an overall cryptocurrency slump could push it into the $0.05–$0.10 zone. Dogecoin price action At press time, Dogecoin was trading at $0.14, having gained 1% over the previous 24 hours ahead of the Grayscale ETF launch set to give retail investors access to 11.1 million DOGE, worth roughly $1.5 million. DOGE 24-hour price. Source: Finbold As was the case with the Rex-Osprey fund in September, traders see the ETF as a major step in legitimizing the asset. The ETF analyst Nate Geraci, for instance, called the approval a “monumental crypto regulatory shift.” “Some (many) might laugh, but I actually view this as a highly symbolic launch. IMO, best example of *monumental* crypto regulatory shift over past yr,” wrote Geraci on X. Nonetheless, the bullish narrative is not without its obstacles. Namely, DOGE posted a bounce off the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.1502, supported by a Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) reading of 35.09, nearing “Oversold” territory. Likewise, the token continues to trade below both its 30-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $0.171 and its 200-day SMA of $0.208. At the same time, the MACD histogram reads -0.000975, showing momentum remains negative. In sum, the rally seems to be powered primarily by ETF optimism, but the somewhat weak technicals cast doubt on whether the momentum can hold.

You Need to See This,https://timestabloid.com/40-200-xrp-price-multiplier-scenario/,"Crypto analyst Zach Rector has released a new breakdown of what he describes as a possible long-term multiplier range for XRP. His latest presentation focuses heavily on numerical scenarios rather than speculation, which has garnered interest due to the precision with which he outlines inflows, market-cap expansion, and multiplier ratios. The discussion has also drawn contrasting reactions from market participants who argue that the modelling requires additional context. Zach Rector’s Multiplier Argument In the video attached to his post , Rector examines what he considers a relevant comparison point: the period of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. He points to approximately $62 billion entering Bitcoin ETFs, while centralized exchanges recorded roughly $24 billion in outflows over the same interval. Based on his calculations, this amounted to an estimated 37 billion USD of net inflow. Rector notes that Bitcoin’s price moved from around 38,000 USD to about 126,000 USD during that period, which he states corresponded to a market-cap increase of roughly 1.76 trillion USD. From this, he derives what he calls a market-cap multiplier of 46. He then applies this analytical structure to XRP . Rector frames his approach around what he labels conservative assumptions, ranging from $5 billion to $50 billion of potential inflows into XRP over the next five years. To these projected inflow ranges, he applies multiplier ratios of 50x, 100x, and 200x. $40-$200 XRP Multiplier Scenario pic.twitter.com/aXcP47EGuH — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) November 22, 2025 According to his base-case view, this modeling produces a possible price range of $40 to $200 for XRP over a five-year horizon. Rector emphasizes that the figures are entirely rooted in the numerical method he outlines and describes the scenario as conservative within the parameters he selected. Community Responses and Counterarguments Reactions to the analysis included direct challenges to both the timeframe and the methodology. One user, identified as Jim59804514, questioned whether discussions about multi-year multiplier scenarios were appropriate when previous short-term projections remain unfulfilled. He argued that targets within the 4 to 6 range, which he associates with earlier expectations surrounding potential ETF-related developments , should take precedence before longer-range modeling is presented. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another user, known as DARKHORSE, argued that using net inflow as a standalone modelling input is insufficient for deriving price targets. He stated that inflow and outflow data require evaluation within broader liquidity conditions. His view is that positive net inflow does not automatically correspond to upward price movement without accounting for liquidity depth, supply flexibility, and market-structure behaviour. He maintained that extrapolating XRP projections using Bitcoin ETF inflow ratios does not represent a comparable data set and therefore should not be used to back-solve high-range multiplier outcomes. Rector’s analysis remains grounded in the numerical framework he outlined, aiming to provide a structured long-term view of XRP’s potential valuation trajectory. The reactions show that market participants continue to evaluate whether multiplier-based modelling can appropriately account for liquidity dynamics, asset-specific behaviour, and shorter-term performance benchmarks.

The asset is trading near $86,000, following a sharp drop below $81,000 last week and a modest recovery. Consequently, this move has raised questions across the market about whether a deeper correction may follow. Price Rejected at Major Resistance Bitcoin recently tested the 50-week Exponential Moving Average and the long-term descending trendline, both acting as resistance. It failed to stay above these levels and was pushed back down. Analyst Rekt Capital noted that the 50-week EMA and the Macro Downtrend are aligned, making this a tough zone for the price to break through. The rejection at this confluence and the formation of a lower high have added to market caution. These patterns have marked the start of longer downtrends in past cycles. Source: Rekt Capital/X Moreover, on the weekly chart, Bitcoin dropped into a demand zone around $85,000–$86,000. This level supported a price bounce earlier in the year. After dipping below it, Bitcoin recovered and is now trading slightly above. Rekt Capital explained that a weekly close above $86,000 could open the way for a move toward $93,000. “If price rejects at $93k then that could be the start of a weekly range between $86k and $93k.” This area has few barriers, so the price may move between these two levels in the short term if momentum stalls. Monthly MACD Turns Bearish Again Another point being tracked is the monthly MACD, which has just crossed into a bearish setup. Analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that “ the last three times the monthly MACD turned bearish, Bitcoin dropped about 60% on average .” If the pattern repeats, BTC could fall as low as $40,000 based on the previous peak around $110,000. The last three times the monthly MACD turned bearish, Bitcoin $BTC dropped about 60% on average. If that repeats, the chart points to $40,000. pic.twitter.com/yu7Sm2MBvb — Ali (@ali_charts) November 24, 2025 The MACD crossover in previous cycles has lined up with major corrections. Traders are watching this indicator to see if momentum continues to shift lower. In addition, some longer-term Bitcoin holders have recently moved large volumes of coins. Several whale wallets have reduced holdings, including some early adopters. This behavior adds pressure on the market during periods of weakness. Meanwhile, expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts are rising again. Some traders believe this could support asset prices in the near term. However, unless Bitcoin reclaims resistance above $93,000, concerns about a larger correction are likely to remain.

This strategic allocation represents a significant shift in how traditional institutions approach digital asset exposure. Why Is This Bitcoin Investment So Important? The $16 million Bitcoin investment by New Jersey’s pension fund demonstrates how mainstream financial institutions are embracing cryptocurrency exposure. This move follows MicroStrategy’s well-known strategy of converting substantial portions of its treasury into Bitcoin. The pension fund’s decision therefore represents an indirect but significant Bitcoin investment that could influence other institutional players. This Bitcoin investment comes at a time when institutional adoption is accelerating. Traditional pension funds typically maintain conservative portfolios, making this allocation particularly noteworthy. The decision suggests that institutional investors are becoming more comfortable with Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. How Does This Bitcoin Investment Strategy Work? Rather than purchasing Bitcoin directly, the pension fund acquired shares of MicroStrategy, a company known for its aggressive Bitcoin investment strategy. This approach offers several advantages: Regulatory comfort – Investing in a publicly traded company is more familiar to traditional institutions Indirect exposure – Gains exposure to Bitcoin’s potential upside without direct custody concerns Company performance – Benefits from MicroStrategy’s overall business performance alongside Bitcoin exposure This Bitcoin investment method has become increasingly popular among institutions seeking cryptocurrency exposure while maintaining traditional investment frameworks. The strategy allows pension funds to participate in Bitcoin’s potential growth while working within established regulatory parameters. What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Investment Trends? The New Jersey pension fund’s Bitcoin investment could signal a broader trend in institutional adoption. Other state pension funds and institutional investors often follow early movers, making this allocation potentially influential. This Bitcoin investment demonstrates that large, conservative institutions are warming to digital assets as part of diversified portfolios. Moreover, this Bitcoin investment validates the treasury reserve strategy pioneered by MicroStrategy. The company’s approach of holding Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset has attracted both criticism and admiration. However, institutional adoption through share purchases suggests growing acceptance of this Bitcoin investment methodology. What Challenges Might This Bitcoin Investment Face? While this Bitcoin investment represents progress for institutional adoption, several challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainty continues to create headwinds for direct cryptocurrency investments. However, the indirect approach through MicroStrategy shares helps mitigate some regulatory concerns. Market volatility also presents challenges for any Bitcoin investment. The cryptocurrency’s price fluctuations can significantly impact the value of MicroStrategy shares. Nevertheless, institutions appear increasingly willing to accept this volatility in pursuit of potential returns. Conclusion: A Transformative Bitcoin Investment Moment The New Jersey pension fund’s $16 million Bitcoin investment marks a pivotal moment in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. This allocation demonstrates that traditional financial institutions are finding innovative ways to gain Bitcoin exposure. As more institutions follow this path, we may see accelerated mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This Bitcoin investment could inspire similar moves from other pension funds and institutional investors. The decision validates both MicroStrategy’s strategy and Bitcoin’s growing role in institutional portfolios. While challenges remain, this allocation represents significant progress toward broader cryptocurrency adoption. Frequently Asked Questions Why did New Jersey’s pension fund choose MicroStrategy for Bitcoin exposure? The fund likely chose this approach because investing in a publicly traded company is more familiar and potentially less complex than direct Bitcoin purchases from a regulatory perspective. How much Bitcoin does this $16 million investment represent? While the exact Bitcoin equivalent depends on MicroStrategy’s holdings and share price, the investment provides indirect exposure to the company’s substantial Bitcoin treasury. Is this the first pension fund Bitcoin investment? While not the first, it’s among the most significant public pension fund allocations to Bitcoin through public company shares, signaling growing institutional comfort. What risks does this Bitcoin investment approach mitigate? This method helps address regulatory concerns, custody issues, and operational complexities associated with direct Bitcoin ownership while still providing exposure. Could other pension funds make similar Bitcoin investments? Yes, this move could encourage other institutional investors to consider similar strategies for gaining cryptocurrency exposure within traditional frameworks. How does this affect MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy? Increased institutional investment validates MicroStrategy’s approach and could support the company’s ability to continue accumulating Bitcoin.

The current market conditions are seeing ETF outflows skyrocket, high-beta AI names gap down on earnings, and traders ask themselves if a new bear market has already begun. In this type of environment, only fundamentals and real value creation can thrive. DeepSnitch AI is riding the AI-agent tooling narrative while Digitap ($TAP) rides the banking tailwind. This live omni-bank is wiring stablecoins and crypto into the real economy with Visa cards and a multi-rail payments engine. The decision is easy when it comes to choosing which altcoins to buy in Q4. Banking crypto presales are crushing more speculative AI-driven raises, and $TAP is outclassing DSNT as the best crypto to buy now in a stressed, fundamentals-driven market. Banking Crypto Presale Tokens vs AI Agents: The Market’s 2025 Mood The macro backdrop is simple: Bitcoin has lost its up-only momentum, and AI has shifted from infinite demand to investors asking for proof of demand. Earnings reports for big AI infrastructure names still print monster revenue numbers, but traders are now fading the numbers, worried about how crowded the trade has become. And each dip in majors triggering flashbacks to previous cycle tops. Investors are asking which projects sit atop real, growing flows. Payments and stablecoins are the clearest example. Cross-border payments already move close to $200 trillion annually and are projected to exceed $290 trillion by 2030 as real-time rails, digital wallets, and tokenized value go mainstream.This creates massive opportunity tokens in the payment narrative. AI still exists in a hype-driven and momentum cycle phase. And it is much more sensitive and prone to sentiment reversals. That’s why Digitap and other banking crypto presales are crushing AI agents in the final part of 2025. DeepSnitch AI: AI-Powered On-Chain Alpha DeepSnitch AI aims to build a suite of AI agents that monitor on-chain activity, detect risk, and provide actionable signals for traders. The core product includes SnitchFeed as a real-time market radar, SnitchScan as a “gem hunter” for new tokens, AuditSnitch as a contract-scanning bodyguard, SnitchGPT to turn raw on-chain data into natural-language insight, and SnitchCast for curated alpha streams.The idea is solid, and although the presale has shown some solid momentum with $550,000 raised, this crypto presale faces obvious structural limits. DeepSnitch AI’s market is traders, and when trading volume goes down, so does demand for trading tools. If spot and derivatives volumes continue to compress in a prolonged drawdown, demand for alpha tools will dry up. While DeepSnitch has promised to build something interesting, the biggest risk is how tightly coupled this project is to AI sentiment and trading cycles. Digitap: The Omni-Bank Climbing Shortlists of Altcoins to Buy Digitap is the world’s first omni-bank. A new global money app anyone can download, where fiat, stablecoins, and crypto sit side by side and can be swapped, sent, or spent as one balance. The design is deliberately familiar and aimed at both crypto and non-crypto users. The dashboard features multi-currency fiat balances and on-chain holdings across multiple networks. Importantly, the complexity of moving between rails is hidden behind the interface. Underneath all this slick UX is Digitap’s multi-rail engine. It can send payments on-chain or on legacy banking rails, depending on which is faster when the user wants to move money. The Visa card program has been a huge success with thousands already using non-KYC virtual cards and Apple Pay and Google Pay support from day one, which means users can tap with their phone and spend crypto with millions of merchants. One of the most notable design choices, and a large driver of why $TAP ranks among the best cryptos to buy now, is the value-capture flywheel. The token supply is fixed at 2 billion tokens, with 50% of profits earmarked for large-scale burns and staking rewards. This mechanism turns adoption and growth into sustained buy pressure, and the current price of $0.0326 is still heavily discounted from the confirmed listing price of $0.14. All of this together is why Digitap is a leading altcoin to buy, especially for investors bullish on payments. While markets burn, $TAP has raised $2.1 million and looks like equity in a fintech built for the stablecoin era. $TAP vs DSNT: Which Crypto to Buy Now in a Defensive Market? Which is the best crypto to buy now? $TAP or DSNT, does either have a chance of hitting a 50X next year? One project aims at payment flows measured in the hundreds of trillions of dollars over the coming decade, while the other aims at on-chain memecoin traders. The difference in target markets is what truly separates these projects, and most don’t appreciate how large cross-border partnerships are. Roughly $190 trillion was processed in 2023, and this figure is only increasing as stablecoins become core infrastructure for fintechs like Digitap. The reality is that the ceiling for a consumer-facing omni-bank is much higher than for trading tools aimed at crypto traders. Additionally, Digitap’s value capture design puts it in its own league, especially among crypto presales. Among the current crop of altcoins to buy, Digitap’s banking stack looks better positioned than most, and with favorable macro tailwinds, this could become one of 2026’s fastest-growing success stories.

The presale has raised almost $17.4M so far, and is currently selling for $0.025995 per token, with dynamic staking APYs around 75% for presale participants before Friday’s close. Bullish forecasts see $BEST reaching $0.072 in 2025 and up to $0.62 in 2026, if the underlying project continues to expand its user base. Self-custody has become one of the biggest narratives in this cycle. After a string of exchange blow-ups and exploit scares, more traders want control of their keys, not just another CEX login. At the same time, non-custodial wallets are turning into full crypto super-apps with swaps, yield, cards, and presale access all under one roof. Forecasts even put the non-custodial wallet market on track for multi-billion-dollar growth over the next decade, which puts real infrastructure projects firmly back in the spotlight. Sitting right in the middle of that shift is Best Wallet – a mobile-first, non-custodial app that already counts hundreds of thousands of users and supports top blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Base. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is its official token, and it’s already one of the best crypto presales of 2025. Put differently, the hunt for the next 1000x crypto isn’t limited to meme coins and degen microcaps. In a market tilting back toward real utility, a wallet token plugged into a live, audited ecosystem with Fireblocks security, presale access, and a planned debit card is exactly the kind of story some investors want exposure to before the presale doors close on Friday. Best Wallet: The Everyday, Self-Custodial Crypto Wallet Best Wallet’s pitch is simple: take what people already do every day in crypto – buying, swapping, staking, chasing new launches – and compress it into a single non-custodial app that actually rewards active users. The wallet supports top blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and BNB Chain today with a roadmap to 60+, and lets you hold and swap major crypto assets. More importantly, security is a key part of the story. Best Wallet is one of the first consumer wallet to integrate Fireblocks MPC-CMP technology, bringing institutional-grade key management into a retail-friendly app. Smart contract risk is mitigated through integrated checks and scam-filtering features that flag suspicious tokens and permissions before you sign, a useful safeguard when you’re connecting to new dApps or freshly launched coins. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) fuels the entire ecosystem, giving holders: Reduced swap and on-ramp fees inside the app, Boosted staking yields via a dedicated staking aggregator, Governance over future features and chain integrations, And priority access to curated presales through the in-app Upcoming Tokens portal. In other words, $BEST is wired directly into how the wallet actually works day to day. So it doesn’t come as a surprise that it’s one of the best cryptos to buy this season. Several whales have made sizeable buys, snapping up tokens worth $70.2K , $50.9K , and $49.5K in single transactions. As the presale nears its sell-out, both whales and retail investors are accelerating their accumulation. Just this Friday, one whale invested $13.8K into the project. The tokenomics allocate 10B total supply, with 8% reserved for staking rewards, 10% for airdrops and 7% for other community incentives, designed to nudge users toward long-term engagement rather than quick dumps at listing. Get detailed presale instructions in our ‘ How to Buy Best Wallet Token ’ guide. Final Hours As $BEST Presale Targets Big Multiples On the numbers side, the $BEST presale now sits at almost $17.4M raised with the token priced at $0.025995. Using the current presale price as a base, our $BEST price prediction estimates a move to $0.072 in 2025, which would translate to roughly a 2.8x gain on paper. Stretch that to the optimistic 2026 target of $0.62 and you’re looking at around a 24x move from today’s level, assuming the team executes on its roadmap, major CEX listings materialize, and the broader altcoin cycle cooperates. Given that self-custody super-apps will be some of the big winners in the next cycle, this is very much the ‘last call’ phase. The presale closes in 4 days, on Friday, and price discovery shifts to the open market, where listing timing, liquidity and sentiment will do most of the talking.

Google Finance data shows Strategy’s stock has dropped nearly 60% over the past year and more than 40% year-to-date. The stock was trading near $300 in October but has since fallen to around $170. Despite Declines, Bitcoin Holdings Still in Profit Some investors have interpreted the slump as evidence that Strategy’s approach has been “exposed.” However, BitcoinTreasuries.NET data shows the company acquired its Bitcoin at an average cost of $74,430. With Bitcoin trading near $86,000, Strategy remains up about 16% on its overall Bitcoin purchases. The company’s long-term stock performance also paints a different picture. Over the past five years, Strategy shares have climbed more than 500%. For comparison, Apple gained 130% over the same period, while Microsoft increased by 120%. Even over two years, Strategy’s stock rose 226%, outperforming Apple’s 43% and Microsoft’s 25%. Why Investors Are Shorting Strategy The recent price decline may have less to do with Bitcoin’s fundamentals and more to do with how institutional investors hedge their crypto exposure. In a CNBC interview, BitMine chairman Tom Lee said Strategy has become the most convenient vehicle for hedging Bitcoin. “Someone can use MicroStrategy’s options chain, which is so liquid, to hedge all of their crypto,” he said. “The only convenient way to hedge someone’s long is to short MicroStrategy or buy puts.” This dynamic has effectively turned Strategy into a pressure valve for the broader crypto market, absorbing volatility, hedges and short positions that may not reflect its underlying business strategy. Strategy Expands Its Bitcoin Holdings Despite the turbulent market, Strategy continues building its Bitcoin treasury. Chairman Michael Saylor reaffirmed his commitment to the company’s approach, writing on X that he “won’t back down.” On Nov. 17, the company announced the purchase of 8,178 BTC for $835.6 million. The acquisition — significantly larger than its typical weekly purchases — brought Strategy’s total holdings to 649,870 BTC, valued at nearly $56 billion. Liquidity Slowdown Adds to Market Pressure On Nov. 6, crypto market-maker Wintermute attributed recent market weakness to slowing liquidity flows across stablecoins, exchange-traded funds and digital asset treasuries. The firm said inflows in all three areas had flattened, contributing to widespread price pressure. Data from DefiLlama shows digital asset treasury inflows fell from almost $11 billion in September to just $2 billion in October — an 80% decline following the liquidation of around $20 billion in crypto positions. Inflows decreased further in November, reaching about $500 million as of Monday, marking a 75% drop from October. Despite these conditions, Strategy’s long-term performance continues to outpace major tech benchmarks, underscoring the company’s conviction in Bitcoin even amid near-term turbulence.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-24 11:43:05

Digital asset funds just witnessed a staggering $1.94 billion in net outflows, marking the fourth straight week of withdrawals according to CoinShares data. This massive movement of capital raises crucial questions about investor sentiment and market stability. Why Are Digital Asset Funds Bleeding Capital? The recent exodus from digital asset funds represents one of the most significant withdrawal periods in recent memory. Investors appear to be reacting to multiple market pressures, including regulatory uncertainty and macroeconomic factors. However, this trend doesn’t necessarily signal the end of cryptocurrency adoption. Let’s break down the numbers by specific assets: Bitcoin investment products: $1.27 billion in outflows Ethereum products: $589 million in outflows Solana products: $156.2 million in outflows What’s Driving the Massive Withdrawals? Several factors contribute to this dramatic shift in digital asset funds. First, institutional investors often rebalance portfolios during market uncertainty. Second, recent regulatory developments have created temporary hesitation among traditional finance participants. Third, macroeconomic conditions influence all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Despite these challenges, the underlying technology continues to develop. Blockchain networks maintain their operational integrity, and developer activity remains strong across major protocols. How Do These Outflows Impact Crypto Markets? When digital asset funds experience significant outflows, the immediate effect includes increased selling pressure on underlying assets. This can create short-term price volatility and affect market sentiment. However, historical patterns show that such periods often precede market consolidation and eventual recovery. Consider these key points about market cycles: Outflows typically follow extended periods of growth Institutional participation remains higher than previous cycles Infrastructure development continues despite price movements What Does the Future Hold for Digital Asset Funds? The current situation with digital asset funds reflects normal market cycles rather than fundamental breakdowns. As regulatory clarity improves and institutional frameworks mature, we can expect renewed interest in cryptocurrency investment products. The long-term trajectory for blockchain adoption remains positive across multiple sectors. For investors, this period offers valuable lessons about risk management and portfolio diversification. Understanding the dynamics of digital asset funds helps make informed decisions during both bullish and bearish market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the $1.94 billion in digital asset fund outflows? Multiple factors contributed, including regulatory uncertainty, macroeconomic pressures, and institutional portfolio rebalancing during market volatility. How long have these outflows been occurring? This marks the fourth consecutive week of net outflows from digital asset funds, indicating a sustained trend rather than a one-time event. Which cryptocurrency suffered the largest outflows? Bitcoin investment products experienced the biggest outflows at $1.27 billion, followed by Ethereum at $589 million. Should investors be concerned about these outflows? While significant, these outflows represent normal market cycles. Historical patterns show that such periods often precede market consolidation and recovery. Will these outflows affect cryptocurrency prices? Short-term price volatility is possible due to increased selling pressure, but long-term fundamentals remain unchanged. Are institutional investors leaving cryptocurrency permanently? Current data suggests temporary repositioning rather than permanent exit, as institutional infrastructure continues to develop.

But One Last…""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/two-analysis-firms-issue-bottom-line-bitcoins-downturn-ends-but-one-last/,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell to the $80,000 mark last week amid the ongoing downtrend. However, BTC started the new week with a recovery and rose to the level of $86,000. Analysts said this indicated that selling pressure was easing. Bitcoin Bottom Signals! At this point, CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost first said that there has been a sharp decline in BTC open interest and that it may indicate a bottom in the market. CryptoQuant analyst noted that BTC open interest fell to 1.3 million BTC on November 23, marking the sharpest 30-day decline of the current cycle. He reported that a sharp decline in Bitcoin open interest could be an indication that the market is forming a bottom. This trend suggests that investors are closing futures positions to mitigate risk due to ongoing forced liquidations caused by recent price declines. At this point, the analyst also noted that sharp declines in open interest usually occur during bottoming periods, and therefore this deleveraging could also be a precursor to a new bull run. “The current situation is a phase where open positions are liquidated and market balance is achieved by reducing speculative bets. Such a 'cleansing process' has historically been repeated just before returns to an uptrend. The last similar 30-day decline occurred during the 2022 bear market. Bitcoin May Experience Another Downward Wave! Finally, cryptocurrency analysis company Swissblock analyzed that the market has experienced a sharp decline in the risk aversion indicator, indicating that the selling pressure on BTC has eased and the market has left the capitulation phase behind. However, the analyst firm noted that another relatively weaker sell-off is likely, which is typically a sign of sellers exhaustion and paves the way for the start of a rally. “Early signs have emerged that Bitcoin has formed a bottom. Selling pressure has eased significantly as risk aversion indicators have declined. However, the initial recovery is usually followed by a weak second selling wave; if the bottom holds at that moment, this can be interpreted as a bottoming signal. *This is not investment advice.

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes just dropped a bombshell Bitcoin price prediction that has the crypto community buzzing. The renowned trader believes BTC could soon test the low $80,000 range, sending shockwaves through the market. This crucial Bitcoin price prediction comes at a time when investors are seeking clarity amid ongoing consolidation. What Does Arthur Hayes’ Bitcoin Price Prediction Mean for Investors? Arthur Hayes recently shared his latest Bitcoin price prediction, stating that Bitcoin is currently consolidating below the $90,000 mark. According to his analysis, while further decline could push BTC to test the low-$80,000s, he expects the $80,000 support level to hold strong. This Bitcoin price prediction suggests we might see some short-term volatility before stabilization. Hayes emphasized that he’s taking a cautious approach to buying. He revealed he’s only making small, incremental purchases for now. His major buying spree is postponed until early next year. This strategic timing in his Bitcoin price prediction indicates he expects better entry points ahead. Why This Bitcoin Price Prediction Matters Now The current market conditions make this Bitcoin price prediction particularly relevant. Several factors are influencing this outlook: Market consolidation below key resistance levels Institutional interest continuing to grow Global economic factors affecting risk assets Technical indicators showing mixed signals This Bitcoin price prediction aligns with broader market sentiment that we’re in a period of price discovery. However, Hayes remains optimistic about long-term prospects despite short-term fluctuations. How to Navigate This Bitcoin Price Prediction If Hayes’ Bitcoin price prediction proves accurate, what should investors do? First, understand that market predictions are just that—predictions. They should inform your strategy rather than dictate it completely. This specific Bitcoin price prediction suggests: Consider dollar-cost averaging into positions Maintain adequate cash reserves for potential dips Focus on long-term fundamentals over short-term price movements Set clear entry and exit strategies Remember that successful cryptocurrency investing requires patience and discipline, especially when acting on any Bitcoin price prediction. The Bigger Picture Behind This Bitcoin Price Prediction While this Bitcoin price prediction focuses on short-term price action, it’s crucial to consider the broader context. Bitcoin continues to demonstrate resilience amid global economic uncertainty. The fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong, with: Increasing adoption by institutions Growing recognition as digital gold Ongoing technological developments Expanding regulatory clarity This Bitcoin price prediction should be viewed as part of a larger market cycle rather than an isolated event. Final Thoughts on This Bitcoin Price Prediction Arthur Hayes’ latest Bitcoin price prediction provides valuable insight from one of crypto’s most experienced voices. While suggesting potential short-term downside to the low $80,000s, his outlook remains fundamentally bullish. The key takeaway? Market veterans see current levels as consolidation rather than reversal. Successful investors will use this Bitcoin price prediction to refine their strategies rather than make panic decisions. The coming months will reveal whether this Bitcoin price prediction accurately forecasts market direction. Frequently Asked Questions What is Arthur Hayes’ exact Bitcoin price prediction?

At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $144 billion. TLDR: The crypto market capitalisation rose on Monday morning (UTC) back above $3 trillion; 80 of the top 100 coins and all top 10 coins have gone up today; BTC increased by 1.3% to $86,899, and ETH rose by 1% to $2,822; The ultimate bottom may form over the next 5-7 months; NYDIG’s Greg Cipolaro noted a reversal in key trends; ‘We may be approaching the late stages of the current growth cycle;’ US indices stabilising ‘would likely support Bitcoin and help prevent the current consolidation from turning into something more severe’; ‘A growing share of investors is choosing to lock in profits and move to the sidelines’; US BTC and ETH spot ETFs saw inflows on Friday of $238.47 million and $55.71 million, respectively; BlackRock’s Robbie Mitchnick said large asset managers’ clients are interested in BTC as a store of value, not a payments rail; Crypto market sentiment reached another lowest point in years. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have seen their prices appreciate over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) has risen by 1.3% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $86,899. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is up by 1%, now changing hands at $2,822. This is the lowest increase in the category, shared by two other coins. This includes Solana (SOL) , which is now trading at $130.1. The biggest gainer in this category is Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 2%, rising to the price of $0.1459. It’s followed by Binance Coin (BNB) , which appreciated by 1.3% to $853. When it comes to the top 100 coins, 80 recorded increases, with one of these seeing a double-digit rise. Canton (CC) is up by 13.1%, now trading at $0.08507. The second-highest gainer is Hedera (HBAR) , with a rise of 8.3% to the price of $0.1465. On the other hand, the highest drop is Aster (ASTER)’s 6.3% to $1.12. It’s followed by Zcash (ZEC) , which is down 4.4%, changing hands at $546.8. Meanwhile, head of research at NYDIG Greg Cipolaro argued that the reflexive loop that powered BTC’s run, ETF inflows, digital asset treasury (DAT) demand, and growing stablecoin liquidity, has now reversed . This, he said, doesn’t signal only sour sentiment, but also an “actual capital flight.” ‘Late Stages of Current Growth Cycle’ In an email commentary, John Glover, Chief Investment Officer of Ledn , said that “panic selling is usually a sign of weak longs finally capitulating and trying to preserve what small profits they may still have in their position.” Notably, “it is also often a good place to begin accumulating, depending on where we are in the cycle.” Glover expects that the ultimate bottom will form over the coming 5-7 months. However, “it will be the launch pad for Wave V up to $150-170k in 2027/28,” he argues. Source: Ledn Moreover, Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler , said that macro-driven factors have been the primary source of market pressure recently. Broadly across asset classes, risk sentiment has weakened. Equity markets in the US have “already been under notable strain, with headline indices masking the underlying softness in the broader market. Most of the upward momentum in major indices has been concentrated in a very narrow group of AI-related mega-cap stocks. At the same time, the majority of equities have shown signs of fatigue.” Therefore, this dynamic suggests that “we may be approaching the late stages of the current growth cycle.” “As uncertainty around interest rates, inflation dynamics, and liquidity conditions increases, a growing share of investors is choosing to lock in profits and move to the sidelines,” Lienkha says. Moreover, BTC price action is still heavily influenced by broader macro conditions, especially the US equity market. If indices stabilize and move higher, “it would likely support Bitcoin and help prevent the current consolidation from turning into something more severe.” However, if US stock indices see a sustained trend reversal rather than a routine correction, BTC “could face significantly stronger downside pressure,” and “the current consolidation could evolve into a more profound structural decline, with BTC potentially retracing to much lower levels,” Lienkha concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Monday morning, BTC stood at $86,899. The coin has seen quite a choppy trading day, moving in a tight range between $85,822 and $87,995. Moreover, BTC’s intraweek low stands at $82,175, while the intraday high is at $95,591. Overall, it’s down 9.2% in a week, as well as 22% in a month and 31.1% since the all-time high of $126,080 seen in October. Investors are now looking to see if the coin will stay above $86,500. This could open doors for $88,500, followed by $97,000 and even $111,000. If it drops below that level, it could move towards $83,000. Ethereum is currently changing hands at $2,822. It initially plunged from $2,838 to the intraday low of $2,770, and then it jumped to $2,881 before correcting to the current price. ETH is down 11.6% in a week, moving between $2,680 and $3,203. It also fell 28% in a month and 42.8% from the August ATH of $4,946. Should it defend the $2,780 level, the price could target $3,060, followed by $3,214 and $3,653. Conversely, a fall below $2,700 could lead to further decreases to the $2,630 and $2,580 levels. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment keeps falling within the extreme fear zone, reaching on Saturday another lowest level since CoinMarketCap began measuring this index in July 2023. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 10 today , for the third day in a row, falling from Friday’s 11. The participants remain worried and pessimistic amidst the doubt-driven market. The selling pressure is high, but so are the purchase opportunities for the long-term holders. ETFs Turn Green On Friday, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded inflows, following a day of major outflows on Thursday. On 21 November, these took in $238.47 million combined. Therefore, the total net inflow rose slightly to $57.64 billion. Seven of the 12 BTC ETFs recorded inflows, while one saw outflows. Fidelity was at the top of the green list, with $108.02 million in positive flows. It’s flowed by Grayscale’s $84.93 million. At the same time, BlackRock let go of $122.01 million. Moreover, the US ETH ETFs broke their 10-day outflow streak with $55.71 million in inflows on 21 November. The total net inflow increased to $12.63 billion. Three of the nine funds recorded inflows, and one again saw outflows. Fidelity leads with $95.4 million in positive flows, while BlackRock was responsible for the entirety of negative flows with $53.68 million. Meanwhile, Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, argued that clients of large asset managers are far more interested in BTC as a store of value than as a payments rail. “For us, and most of our clients today, they’re not really underwriting to that global payment network case,” he said. The payments thesis is viewed as “out-of-the-money option value” rather than a core investment rationale. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The stock market closed higher on Friday, its previous day of trading. By the closing time on 21 November, the S&P 500 was up by 0.98%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.77%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 1.08%. At the same time, on Friday (UTC), the crypto market was significantly lower compared to the day prior. Major stock indexes nonetheless posted weekly losses on apprehensions related to AI spending and tech firms’ valuations. Is this rally sustainable? The crypto market has seen a green reversal today. However, it remains red across other key timeframes. Further positive signals are needed to either prolong this reversal and turn it into a longer bullish move. Otherwise, the situation overall may remain bearish. “Overall, the short-term outlook depends primarily on whether the equity market confirms a continuation of the broader bullish trend or transitions into a more prolonged downturn,” says YouHodler’s Ruslan Lienkha.

The European Central Bank has issued a stark warning that these popular digital assets could trigger systemic risks that threaten global financial stability. This alarming revelation comes as stablecoins continue to gain mainstream adoption. Why Stablecoins Financial Crisis Fears Are Growing The ECB’s recent report highlights a critical vulnerability in our financial system. Stablecoins could absorb retail deposits from traditional banks, potentially creating a dangerous scenario. When deposits leave banks, these institutions lose their stable funding sources. This situation could escalate quickly into a full-blown stablecoins financial crisis. How Stablecoins Could Trigger Bank Runs Imagine what happens when large amounts of money suddenly move from bank accounts to stablecoins. Banks would face immediate liquidity pressures. Moreover, they might need to sell government bonds to meet withdrawal demands. This creates a domino effect that could spark the very stablecoins financial crisis regulators fear. The ECB specifically warned about these key risks: Deposit flight from traditional banking systems Reduced stable funding for eurozone banks Selling pressure on government bonds Contagion risk across financial markets What Makes This Stablecoins Financial Crisis Different? Traditional financial crises typically start within banking systems. However, a stablecoins financial crisis could originate outside traditional finance. Digital assets move faster than traditional money, meaning problems could spread rapidly. The November 24th ECB report emphasizes that regulators need new tools to address these emerging threats. Are Regulators Prepared for Stablecoins Financial Crisis Scenarios? Current regulatory frameworks may not adequately address stablecoins financial crisis risks. The ECB’s warning suggests urgent action is needed. Central banks worldwide are studying how to integrate digital assets without compromising financial stability. The potential for a stablecoins financial crisis requires coordinated global response. Key regulatory challenges include: Monitoring stablecoin growth and adoption rates Developing emergency response protocols Creating international cooperation frameworks Establishing reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers Protecting Against Potential Stablecoins Financial Crisis While the stablecoins financial crisis warning sounds alarming, understanding the risks helps everyone make better decisions. Investors should diversify their holdings and understand the underlying assets backing their stablecoins. Financial institutions need to develop contingency plans for rapid digital asset movements. The ECB’s stablecoins financial crisis alert serves as an important wake-up call. By addressing these concerns proactively, we can harness blockchain technology’s benefits while minimizing systemic risks. The goal isn’t to stop innovation but to ensure it develops safely. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain stable value, typically pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar or euro. Why does the ECB worry about stablecoins causing a financial crisis? The ECB fears massive movement of deposits from banks to stablecoins could reduce banks’ stable funding and trigger bond market sell-offs. How likely is a stablecoins financial crisis according to the ECB? While not imminent, the ECB considers the risk significant enough to warrant immediate regulatory attention and preventive measures. What can prevent a stablecoins financial crisis? Proper regulation, transparency in reserve backing, and coordination between traditional finance and crypto sectors can help prevent crises. Should I avoid using stablecoins because of this warning? Not necessarily, but be aware of the risks and use reputable, well-regulated stablecoins with transparent reserve practices. How are other central banks responding to stablecoins risks? Major central banks worldwide are developing regulatory frameworks and studying central bank digital currencies as alternatives.

That downturn didn’t just spook traders, it wiped a staggering $41 billion from the estimated wealth of Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Data from Arkham Intelligence shows Satoshi’s 1.096 million BTC, valued at over $137 billion last month, is now worth roughly $95 billion, placing the iconic figure temporarily below names like Bill Gates in global wealth rankings. Source: Arkm The market setback, however, hasn’t weakened long-term conviction. Bitcoin’s circulating supply now stands at 19.95 million, with its market cap holding above $1.71 trillion, reinforcing its position as the world’s dominant cryptocurrency. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Stabilizes as Downtrend Faces Exhaustion Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as BTC’s recent price action suggests sellers are fatigued. The daily chart shows repeated long downside wicks and consecutive spinning tops, both common signals that selling pressure is slowing near the $85,500–$86,800 support area. BTC is still moving inside a descending channel that has guided the correction since early November. Yet price is holding above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $86,878, a level where early trend reversals often begin. Momentum indicators are also shifting. The RSI has formed a bullish divergence, a higher low on the indicator while price printed a lower low last week. This historically marks the early stages of a trend reversal, especially when combined with a flattening 20-day EMA, which shows bearish pressure is easing. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A move above $90,774 would be the first meaningful confirmation that buyers are stepping in. From there, BTC could target: $90,798 (38.2% Fibonacci level) $93,966 (50% retracement) $97,135 (61.8% retracement) A break of $97K would likely propel Bitcoin toward the $102,000–$104,000 zone near the upper channel boundary. Risk Below $85K, but Breakout Path Is Setting Up If Bitcoin fails to reclaim the mid-channel, a retest of $85,500 becomes more likely. Losing that level exposes $80,542, a long-term support aligned with deeper Fibonacci projections. But so far, buyers continue to defend the region aggressively. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Trade Setup & Forward Outlook Traders watching for directional clarity may assess a simple structure: A break and retest of $90,774. A bullish engulfing candle above this level could signal the start of a recovery. A common roadmap includes: Entry: Above $90,800 on confirmed breakout Targets: $94,400 and $97,100 Stop: Below $86,500 to avoid false moves The broader structure still demands caution, but the technical foundation for a relief rally is firming. If BTC climbs back into its mid-channel range, it could mirror previous cycle rebounds, often the early chapters of major bullish expansions and presale-driven momentum waves.

Those who held on to memecoins saw their positions devalue 70%, 80%, and even more than 90%. Are a lot of the memecoins going to zero now, or is there one more round left in the chamber for some of them? $PEPE, $BONK and $WIF are analysed. $PEPE on the brink - bulls need to come in here Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $PEPE looks fairly miserable. What was reasonably strong horizontal support down to $0.00000530 has failed to hold. While the price is currently at some kind of support at $0.00000432, this is quite tenuous, and the merest hint of more selling could easily take the price down to what is the last proper horizontal support at $0.00000157. All this said, if Bitcoin does turn things around and a decent rally takes shape, traders will want some leverage and they will jump onto the memecoins again. With $PEPE it will be a case of monitoring the descending trendline. If the price is able to confirm above, that would be a possible entry point. Rock bottom for $BONK Source: TradingView While $BONK is probably the undisputed top memecoin for the Solana network, it is practically at absolute rock bottom as far as price goes. If it’s a comfort to the bulls, this is a strong horizontal support, although for a memecoin, how strong can support lines really be? That said, it is holding so far. Also, if it continues to hold through this next 2 week period, the descending trendline will be breached. The last time this happened, it led to a 359% rally. The Stochastic RSI indicators have all but dropped to the bottom. Therefore the upside price momentum needed for another huge rally may not be too far off. Assuming a breakout does take place, putting a tight stop loss below the descending trendline would help to protect from a fake-out. Caution: stop losses for memecoins may not trigger. Is a 4x still a possibility for $WIF? Source: TradingView The $WIF price looks to be in last-chance saloon. This last horizontal support level has to hold at 0.34. If this fails, zero would definitely be on the table as a target. That said, where there’s life there’s hope. An imminent cross-up for the Stochastic RSI indicators could signal an end to the misery. If the price does rise from here, and is able to break the downtrend, $0.85 and $1.38 are targets. This could mean a possible 4x from here. Anyone brave enough to take a punt?

How Does Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Impact Markets? Institutional Bitcoin adoption brings both stability and credibility to the cryptocurrency market. When companies allocate portions of their treasury to Bitcoin, they typically take a long-term perspective, reducing volatility and creating stronger price support levels. However, this growing Bitcoin adoption also presents challenges. Companies must navigate regulatory requirements, implement secure storage solutions, and manage public perception. Despite these hurdles, the trend toward corporate Bitcoin adoption continues gaining momentum as more organizations recognize the strategic advantages. What Can We Learn From This Bitcoin Adoption Trend? Hyperscale Data’s expanding Bitcoin position offers valuable insights for investors and market observers. The company’s consistent approach to Bitcoin adoption suggests they’ve developed a clear strategy for digital asset allocation rather than making impulsive decisions. This measured approach to Bitcoin adoption reflects careful consideration of risk management, regulatory compliance, and long-term value preservation. Other companies considering similar moves can look to this example of systematic Bitcoin adoption as a model for their own digital asset strategies. Looking Ahead: The Future of Bitcoin Adoption The ongoing Bitcoin adoption by institutions like Hyperscale Data points toward a future where digital assets become standard components of corporate treasuries. As regulatory frameworks mature and infrastructure improves, we can expect this Bitcoin adoption trend to accelerate across various industries. This progressive Bitcoin adoption signals a fundamental shift in how companies view asset preservation and growth in the digital age. The movement toward mainstream Bitcoin adoption appears unstoppable as more organizations recognize the unique value proposition of limited-supply digital assets.

However, despite the volatility, Hayes believes the $80,000 level will hold, supported by improving dollar liquidity and shifting macro signals. minor improvements in $ liq: – fed qt stops dec 1, this wed will prob be last fall in b/s – us banks increased lending in nov we chop below $90k, maybe one more stab down into low $80k's but i think $80k holds. might start nibbling, but leave the bazooka until the new year — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) November 24, 2025 In a post on X, Hayes pointed to “minor improvements in $ liquidity”, noting two key developments: the U.S. Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening program is expected to stop on December 1, and U.S. banks increased lending in November, easing some of the liquidity pressure that weighed on risk assets through early Q4. “With QT ending and bank lending ticking up, we may get some breathing room,” Hayes wrote. He added that while Bitcoin could see another dip into the low $80Ks, he expects the level to hold and is considering “nibbling” at current levels — though he plans to “leave the bazooka until the new year,” signalling a cautious approach to deploying larger capital. ETF Inflows Return, Retail Selling Cools Market analysts also see signs that Bitcoin’s recent price action may be more than just technical noise. Jamie Elkaleh, CMO at Bitget Wallet, said over the weekend that a broader stabilization pattern may be forming underneath the volatility. “Elkaleh noted that ETF inflows are returning, retail selling pressure is cooling, and Ethereum is regaining key ground — all despite an uncertain macro backdrop.” According to Elkaleh, the rebound in Bitcoin and major altcoins “suggests early signs of stabilization rather than a brief technical bounce.” She pointed to historical seasonality, noting that November is typically one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, and added that easing retail capitulation often coincides with local bottom formation. Bitcoin’s ability to hold the mid-$80K range in the face of interest-rate uncertainty “reflects underlying resilience,” Elkaleh said, supported by renewed institutional activity — including MicroStrategy’s continued accumulation and net inflows into both BTC and ETH ETFs late last week after a stretch of persistent outflows. Ethereum Reclaims Momentum Elkaleh also highlighted Ethereum’s recovery above the $2,800 level, arguing that anticipation around upgrades such as Fusaka is reinforcing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term positioning across DeFi, scaling, and network infrastructure. “Volatility is likely to persist,” she said, “but the combination of reduced retail selling, returning institutional inflows, and strong network development suggests this recovery has credible footing.” Outlook: Stabilization With Volatility Both Hayes and Elkaleh agree: while Bitcoin may remain volatile into December, structural signals — improved liquidity, ETF inflows, and technical resets — point to gradual stabilization, not a fleeting bounce.

54841669,633027,1763985647,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54841669.jpeg,"Bitcoin Quantum-Break Catastrophe Is Pure FUD, Says Gabor Gurbacs",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-quantum-break-pure-fud-gabor-gurbacs/,"A heated debate erupted on X this weekend after Gabor Gurbacs, founder of Pointsville and strategic advisor to Tether, dismissed growing fears about Bitcoin’s vulnerability to quantum computing. In a series of posts, Gurbacs called the notion of a “ quantum doomsday ” for Bitcoin “pure FUD,” arguing that Bitcoin’s cryptographic foundations are already resilient and adaptable enough to survive future advances in quantum technology. “There’s a lot of FUD around Bitcoin’s quantum risk,” Gurbacs wrote . “The fact is that Bitcoin’s security is anchored in hash-based proof-of-work, which remains quantum-resistant. Quantum doesn’t break Bitcoin.” Bitcoin Is “Quantum-Resilient By Design” Gurbacs pointed to the distinction between Bitcoin’s hash-based consensus and its signature scheme, arguing that the consensus layer—secured by SHA-256—is already resistant to quantum attacks. Grover’s algorithm only provides a quadratic speed-up, he said, which does not undermine Bitcoin’s proof-of-work. The primary theoretical weakness, he acknowledged, lies in Bitcoin’s ECDSA signatures , which could be vulnerable if quantum computers reach the scale required to run Shor’s algorithm effectively. But according to Gurbacs, even that threat is mitigated by best practices and Bitcoin’s modular design. “The main quantum target (ECDSA public keys) is already mitigated by non-reuse of addresses and can be upgraded to post-quantum signatures,” he noted, referencing NIST’s newly standardized FIPS-205, which formalizes the Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA). “Bitcoin’s long-term security model was designed precisely for adversarial upgrades,” he added. “The consensus layer is hash-based and quantum-resilient, and the signature layer is modular, meaning post-quantum schemes like SLH-DSA/SPHINCS+ can be integrated without disrupting monetary integrity or supply rules.” That assertion drew immediate responses from crypto security veterans, including Messari co-founder Dan McArdle and Project Eleven’s Graeme Moore, who both warned that Gurbacs was underestimating the complexity and timeline of a network-wide post-quantum transition. McArdle agreed that mining and proof-of-work are not at immediate risk but outlined three structural issues Bitcoin must still face: legacy P2PK outputs with already-exposed public keys, the possibility of mempool sniping (quantum theft during transaction propagation), and the large size of post-quantum signatures, which could force a controversial blocksize increase. “Given all that,” McArdle said, “it’s best to get serious about quantum robustness now. It’s not an issue to kick down the road until the threat is imminent.” Gurbacs pushed back, calling those risks “real but remote.” The few P2PK addresses are “small and scattered,” and the kind of quantum computers required for mempool attacks are “unbelievably fast and stable—which we’re nowhere near.” He added that BTC could absorb larger signature schemes or even a blocksize upgrade “before any realistic threat shows up.” “I agree we should take quantum hardening seriously,” Gurbacs wrote. “I just don’t buy the idea that we’re close to a break—and scammers tend to abuse the quantum narrative. The bigger risk now is people panicking instead of looking at actual timelines.” The Open Questions For Bitcoin Devs Graeme Moore countered that complacency is the greater danger. Citing his firm’s research, he argued that a coordinated post-quantum migration could take six months or more even under ideal conditions and that “we could have a CRQC in a couple years.” He pressed Gurbacs on whether the Bitcoin community could realistically agree on adopting NIST-approved standards like SLH-DSA or ML-DSA—especially since Satoshi Nakamoto intentionally avoided NIST curves for distrust reasons. Moore also raised the thorny question of what happens to unmigrated or “lost” coins in a quantum transition, including Satoshi’s early holdings. “Are you in favor of freezing Satoshi’s coins?” he asked. “Why or why not?”Gurbacs replied that governance choices should apply equally to all unmigrated keys and rejected any “special rules.” He reiterated that the threat is not existential in the near term. “We’ll see weaker cryptosystems fall first,” he said. “That buys years of warning for picking schemes, implementing and testing, and allowing gradual opt-in rotation before the ‘oh shit’ moment.” While Moore insisted that “we’re already at the ‘oh shit’ moment,” Gurbacs disagreed. “If a real CRQC existed at the level needed to break secp256k1,” he argued, “the first signs wouldn’t show up in Bitcoin. They’d show up in TLS, PGP, government PKI, and weaker ECC systems long before. That simply hasn’t happened.” For now, Gurbacs’ position is clear: quantum computing represents a long-term coordination challenge, not an imminent collapse. “Quantum panic is misplaced,” he said. “Bitcoin’s architecture is adaptable, conservative, and mathematically robust. Quantum doesn’t break Bitcoin.” Gurbacs has also received independent approval from OG Adam Back. Via X, the legendary cypherpunk wrote: “Bitcoin can just add a new signature type, and make a “quantum ready” taproot leaf alternative spend method, under taproot/schnorr . In that way you can be ready without paying the cost of large signatures until it becomes relevant. NIST standardized SLH-DSA aug 2024 only.” He added: “If cryptographically relevant quantum computers are developed, then my guess is schnorr & ECDSA signature methods would be deprecated (become unspendable). IMO it’s a lot further away than 2030 so people should have time to migrate and be quantum ready long before.” At press time, BTC traded at $85,984.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Quantum Computing Threat|btc|BTC news|btc price,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-24 12:00:47

That is what happened on November 23, 2025, when a sharp move in Bitcoin dominance sparked intense discussions across the crypto community. Traders immediately questioned whether this decline signaled the long-awaited rotation into major altcoins. Many also wondered if XRP could finally break into double-digit territory during the next expansion phase. The debate gained traction after DROP shared a TradingView chart showing Bitcoin dominance dropping from 59.10% to 57.30% on November 23. The post quickly circulated among analysts who monitor dominance trends for early signs of altcoin rallies. The accompanying chart fueled renewed speculation about XRP’s next major move and the potential for a powerful upside shift once Bitcoin’s dominance weakens further. This is when $XRP runs to double digits. pic.twitter.com/M3BEqxulfV — $DROP (@DropCoinXRPL) November 23, 2025 Why Bitcoin Dominance Matters Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market. Traders use it to track where capital flows during market rotations. A falling dominance figure often means capital is moving into altcoins. Historical market cycles show that sharp dominance drops can precede strong altcoin rallies. The pattern does not always play out perfectly. However, Bitcoin dominance signals remain one of the most widely followed metrics in market analysis. A decline from the 59% region to the 57% zone is meaningful. Such a move suggests traders are positioning away from Bitcoin and exploring higher-beta assets. This shift also shows increasing market confidence, which usually benefits large-cap altcoins first. How Dominance Shifts Affect XRP XRP often reacts strongly during alt-focused rotations. It benefits from high liquidity and deep global market penetration. A sustained decline in Bitcoin dominance increases the probability of an XRP breakout. Analysts argue that XRP could climb quickly when liquidity expands across the broader market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s growing institutional presence adds further strength to this outlook. Demand from professional investors has expanded over the past year. Many long-term holders expect a supply shift as ecosystem usage increases. These factors make XRP one of the top assets to benefit from during a full altcoin rotation. What XRP Needs to Reach Double Digits A move to $10 or more requires several conditions. First, Bitcoin dominance must continue to weaken over time. Second, institutional demand must strengthen to support large inflows. Third, XRP needs a sustained trend of reduced sell pressure. Analysts agree that these combined drivers could push XRP into new valuation ranges. XRP has shown resilience during recent market corrections. The asset also maintains strong global liquidity. These factors create a solid foundation for a larger breakout. A confirmed altcoin season would amplify this effect. The Market Outlook $DROP’s chart highlights a critical shift in market structure. The decline in dominance signals rising interest in altcoins. XRP stands in a strong position to benefit if the trend continues. A clear and sustained rotation could create the conditions needed for a double-digit run. The coming weeks will reveal whether this dominance drop marks a temporary move or the start of a broader cycle. For now, analysts agree on one point. If Bitcoin dominance continues to fall, XRP’s probability of reaching double digits increases sharply. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Recent analysis suggests Bitcoin could face a significant downturn, with experts predicting the cryptocurrency might fall to $50,000 by 2026. This Bitcoin price prediction has sent shockwaves through the crypto community as investors assess the potential impact on their portfolios. Why Are Analysts Making This Bitcoin Price Prediction? Multiple market analysts have identified several concerning factors supporting this bearish Bitcoin price prediction. The market currently shows a sell-side dominant structure, meaning more investors are looking to sell than buy. This creates downward pressure on prices that could accelerate if conditions worsen. Market liquidity has become a major concern. Recent Bitcoin ETF outflows totaling $3.5 billion in November signal weakening institutional demand. When large investors pull their money out, it reduces market depth and makes prices more volatile. What Factors Could Drive Bitcoin Lower? Several external market pressures contribute to this cautious Bitcoin price prediction. The broader risk-asset market faces challenges from multiple directions: AI bubble concerns creating uncertainty in tech sectors Federal Reserve policy uncertainty affecting investor confidence U.S. Big Tech downturn impacting overall market sentiment Reduced institutional buying power from recent liquidations The October flash crash that triggered over $20 billion in liquidations demonstrated how quickly market conditions can deteriorate. Digital asset treasury firms suffered significant losses, further weakening their capacity to support prices. How Reliable Is This Bitcoin Price Prediction? While this Bitcoin price prediction seems alarming, it’s important to understand that cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Historical patterns show that Bitcoin has experienced similar corrections before recovering to new highs. However, the current combination of factors makes this prediction worth considering seriously. Analysts emphasize that this Bitcoin price prediction represents a worst-case scenario rather than a certainty. Market conditions can change rapidly based on regulatory developments, institutional adoption, or macroeconomic shifts. Therefore, investors should view this as one possible outcome among many. What Should Investors Do About This Bitcoin Price Prediction? This Bitcoin price prediction serves as a reminder about risk management in cryptocurrency investing. Consider these strategies: Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes Set stop-loss orders to protect against sudden drops Maintain a long-term perspective beyond short-term volatility Stay informed about market developments Remember that every Bitcoin price prediction comes with uncertainty. While analysts base their forecasts on current data, cryptocurrency markets can surprise both optimists and pessimists. Frequently Asked Questions What timeframe are analysts using for this Bitcoin price prediction? Analysts are looking at 2026 as the target year for this potential correction, based on current market cycles and technical analysis. Has Bitcoin ever dropped 60% before? Yes, Bitcoin has experienced several corrections of 60% or more throughout its history, including during the 2018 bear market and the 2020 COVID crash. What would need to happen to avoid this Bitcoin price prediction? Increased institutional adoption, favorable regulatory developments, or improved macroeconomic conditions could help Bitcoin avoid this predicted downturn. Should I sell my Bitcoin based on this prediction? Investment decisions should be based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall financial strategy rather than any single prediction. How accurate have previous Bitcoin price predictions been? Cryptocurrency price predictions have varied widely in accuracy, highlighting the importance of doing your own research and not relying solely on analyst forecasts. What other factors could affect Bitcoin’s price besides those mentioned? Regulatory changes, technological developments, adoption by major corporations, and global economic conditions all significantly influence Bitcoin’s price.

Deutsche Bank, one of the world’s most influential financial institutions, has issued a stark warning about significant dollar weakening that could reshape global markets by 2026. This forecast carries massive implications for your cryptocurrency portfolios and international investments. Why Deutsche Bank Sees Dollar Weakening Ahead The analysis from Deutsche Bank points to structural economic challenges that threaten the dollar’s dominance. Their research team has identified several key factors driving this USD outlook shift: Persistent US budget deficits exceeding 5% of GDP Growing national debt approaching $35 trillion Shifting global reserve currency allocations Federal Reserve policy normalization The 6% Decline: Understanding the USD Outlook What does a 6% dollar weakening actually mean for markets? This projection represents one of the most significant currency trends in recent years. The bank’s economic forecasts suggest the dollar index could fall from current levels around 104 to approximately 98 by late 2026. Year Projected Dollar Index Decline Percentage 2024 104 Base Level 2025 101 3% 2026 98 6% Key Drivers Behind These Currency Trends The Deutsche Bank analysis highlights three primary catalysts for these currency trends : Fiscal Concerns: Unsustainable US deficit spending Monetary Policy: Interest rate differentials narrowing Geopolitical Shifts: Dedollarization efforts accelerating How Accurate Are Economic Forecasts Like This? While economic forecasts always carry uncertainty, Deutsche Bank’s track record in currency prediction gives this USD outlook significant weight. Their previous major currency calls have proven approximately 70% accurate over multi-year horizons. What This Dollar Weakening Means for Your Investments This projected dollar weakening creates both risks and opportunities. For cryptocurrency investors, a weaker dollar typically supports higher bitcoin and altcoin prices. For forex traders, it suggests strategic short positions on USD pairs. Frequently Asked Questions What is Deutsche Bank’s credibility in currency forecasting? Deutsche Bank maintains one of the largest forex research teams globally and has consistently ranked among top currency forecasters. How does this USD outlook affect cryptocurrency markets? Historically, dollar weakness correlates with stronger cryptocurrency performance as investors seek alternative stores of value. What time frame does this dollar weakening cover? The 6% projection extends through end-2026, representing a gradual decline rather than sudden crash. Are other banks predicting similar currency trends? Several institutions including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have expressed concerns about dollar strength sustainability. What actions should investors take regarding this economic forecast? Diversification into non-USD assets and cryptocurrencies appears prudent given these projections. The Bottom Line: Prepare for Changing Currency Dynamics The Deutsche Bank warning about dollar weakening represents more than just another economic forecast – it’s a wake-up call about fundamental shifts in global currency trends . Their analysis suggests we’re approaching a tipping point in the USD outlook that could redefine investment strategies for years to come. The 6% decline projection serves as a crucial alert for anyone with exposure to dollar-denominated assets.

Yet lifetime net inflows still stand near 57.6 billion dollars as record trading volumes show investors rapidly rotating in and out of the once-hot products. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Reach $57.6 Billion Net Inflow as Flows Swing Sharply U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs now show a combined 57.6 billion dollars in net inflows, even as money continues to move in and out at a rapid pace, according to the latest Farside Investors flow table. BlackRock’s IBIT leads the pack with about 62.7 billion dollars of cumulative inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at roughly 11.8 billion dollars. By contrast, the converted GBTC vehicle still carries about 25.0 billion dollars in net outflows, which drags the complex’s overall total lower. Bitcoin ETF Flow Table. Source: Farside Investors In the most recent stretch of data, daily flows whipsawed investors. On 18 November, the group took in about 523.2 million dollars, helped by steady buying in the largest funds. However, just two days later, on 20 November, the complex recorded its worst session in the table, with net outflows of roughly 903.2 million dollars as several issuers, led by IBIT and FBTC, saw heavy redemptions. Then, on 21 November, flows flipped back to a positive 238.4 million dollars, signaling that demand quickly returned after the sharp one-day exit. Across the full sample, spot Bitcoin ETFs have averaged about 122.8 million dollars in net flows per day. The strongest single session brought in roughly 1.37 billion dollars, while the largest daily withdrawal reached about 1.11 billion dollars. These numbers show that, even after recent redemptions, the vehicles still channel sizable capital into Bitcoin, but they also underline how quickly sentiment can shift from strong buying to aggressive profit-taking. Bitcoin ETFs Face Deep Monthly Outflows as Trading Volume Hits Records Bitcoin spot ETFs are heading toward their worst monthly outflow on record as investors pull billions from the products, signaling a sharp reversal from the enthusiasm that fueled early-year gains. According to Bloomberg data, about 3.5 billion dollars has exited U.S. Bitcoin ETFs in November, nearly matching February’s previous record. BlackRock’s IBIT has seen about 2.2 billion dollars in redemptions, placing it on track for its weakest month since launch. The charts show cumulative ETF net flow sinking into negative territory while IBIT’s monthly bar drops below zero at a record pace. US Bitcoin ETFs Record Monthly Outflow. Source: Bloomberg / X At the same time, Bitcoin is navigating its harshest month in years. After sliding to 80,553 dollars on Friday, the token rebounded toward 87,000 dollars early Monday. Even so, it remains down roughly seven percent for the year, marking a sharp turn from the highs reached during the inflow-driven rally in early 2024. Bloomberg’s trading-volume chart shows ETF activity surging to a record 11.5 billion dollars on Friday, with IBIT handling about 8 billion dollars on its own. The spike highlights how aggressively investors are repositioning as sentiment shifts. Meanwhile, analysts say the outflow cycle now moves in lockstep with Bitcoin’s price. Since the ETFs launched in January 2024, flows have become the primary driver of upward or downward pressure. Citi Research estimates that every one billion dollars in ETF outflows cuts Bitcoin’s price by about 3.4 percent, a pattern that aligns with November’s drawdown. At the same time, broader risk appetite has weakened across markets. High-growth tech stocks, AI names, and meme assets have all slipped, and Bitcoin’s short-term correlation with tech reached a record earlier this month. As Wall Street de-risks, Bitcoin increasingly trades as part of the same risk basket rather than a separate macro narrative. Despite the turbulence, volume continues to rise. Yet the heavier trading has not produced a turn in sentiment, and analysts note that the same investor base that fueled the January–March rally is still exiting positions. Nick Ruck of LVRG Research said the earlier euphoria “has been exhausted,” adding that confidence has not fully returned even during brief periods of buying. US Bitcoin ETFs Record Trading Volume.

SHIB sits near the support level of its broad descending channel , a zone that triggered strong rebounds in past cycles. The real question now is whether the market is setting up for another sharp move. Does the recent shift in derivatives activity hint at something bigger? Coinbase’s announcement of major upgrades in December has already influenced sentiment. SHIB now has extended visibility across futures markets. This change brings liquidity and offers traders new flexibility in how they manage exposure. Also, Futures activity often acts as an early signal for volatile altcoins. SHIB is no exception. Open interest recently surged after billions in short positions were wiped out. That tells a story. Traders took aggressive bearish positions and paid the price when SHIB reversed. Such a reset can build the foundation for a strong upside attempt if momentum aligns. Source: Coinglass Coinbase Events Strengthen SHIB’s Global Standing Coinbase Derivatives will run 24/7 altcoin monthly futures from December 5, and SHIB sits among the supported assets. This update removes old trading-hour limits and opens the door for round-the-clock volatility. Some traders may find this thrilling while others may ask if nonstop derivatives exposure could increase future swings. On December 12, Coinbase brings perpetual-style futures for U.S. traders. SHIB joins Avalanche and Bitcoin Cash among the supported assets. Perpetual futures often attract speculative flow since they mimic spot markets without expiry. That can create rapid price reactions during news events. Also, Japan’s decision to classify SHIB with BTC and ETH under a flat tax structure strengthens its regulatory recognition. Gemini also added SHIB perpetual contracts for Europeans. These moves show growing international comfort with SHIB exposure. The memecoin narrative evolves when large institutions include it in product expansions. SHIB Market Sentiment and Structure The recent U-turn in price triggered an open interest flip back into positive territory. Liquidity entered the market and traders gained confidence in short-term setups. Strong buyers defended the weekly support zone. Will those reactions shape the next potential rally path? Price action sits at a critical zone. A descending channel support that continues to attract demand. A bounce from here may target higher areas. The structure looks fragile yet loaded with potential. Can SHIB reclaim strength before the year ends? Source: X Key bullish targets include: $0.00000840 $0.00001030 $0.00001160 $0.00001480 $0.00001670 Failure to hold support could create temporary consolidation. A confirmed bottom near $0.0000071 may form a base for the next major wave. One same question in most minds is: is this accumulation or distribution? Technical Outlook Weekly structure signals high volatility ahead. Support holds, but momentum remains fragile. Therefore, SHIB must regain its lost levels before a confident trend forms. Key factors to watch: Reaction at the descending channel floor Behavior of open interest during volatility spikes Strength of futures inflows after Coinbase launches Ability to hold above $0.0000071 during market stress Price respects structure well. Breakouts often begin when sentiment appears weak, and SHIB has done this before. Is the market preparing a repeat? Shiba Inu Price Prediction Table (2025) Period (2025) Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price November 2025 $0.0000075 $0.0000084 $0.0000103 December 2025 $0.0000071 $0.0000092 $0.0000116 Full Year 2025 $0.0000068 $0.0000108 $0.0000167 2025 Outlook SHIB holds potential for sharp bursts during market expansions.

Crypto analyst BareNakedCrypto has explained why this could be the catalyst that sends the foremost meme to a new all-time high (ATH) of $10. Grayscale Confirms Dogecoin ETF Launch In an X post , Grayscale confirmed that its Dogecoin ETF will launch on the NYSE Arca today. The fund will offer institutional investors direct exposure to the foremost meme coin. Bitcoinist had earlier reported that the NYSE Arca had certified the DOGE ETF for listing and registration, the final step before the fund’s launch. Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF will be the first to launch under the ‘33 Act. It will also be the first fund to offer institutional investors 100% spot exposure to DOGE. Bitwise and 21Shares are the other asset managers that filed for a DOGE ETF under the ‘33 Act. Bitwise is also expected to launch its fund this week after earlier filing an updated prospectus to remove the delaying amendment. In an X post , market expert Nate Geraci described the Grayscale Dogecoin ETF launch as being a “highly symbolic launch.” He opined that this is the best example of the monumental crypto regulatory shift over the past year. He added that the DOGE fund’s ticker, GDOG, might already be in his top 10 ticker list. Another ETF expert, Mike Akins, had questioned whether it wouldn’t have been better to serve the DOGE fund as a non-regulated instrument. He opined that the ETF wrapper may be giving credibility where it is not warranted. However, Geraci suggested that this was a free market and that institutional investors should be able to decide what they want to invest in. He reiterated that his major point is the regulatory progress made on crypto over the past year, which he described as a “huge” positive for the industry. Catalyst For DOGE Price Rally To $10 Ahead of the Grayscale Dogecoin ETF launch, crypto analyst BareNakedCrypto declared in an X post that this would spark a DOGE price rally to over $10. He noted how this fund would open institutional interest in the meme coin’s ecosystem . The fund could draw new capital into Dogecoin, sparking a potential price surge. BareNakedCrypto also mentioned that, with the Grayscale Dogecoin ETF, DOGE will no longer be burdened by lawsuits, threats, or lack of clarity. He added that the DOGE fund is the next ETF with over 100 billion tokens after XRP. The DOGE ETF is the seventh crypto fund to launch after the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Hedera, Litecoin, and XRP ETFs .

Despite subdued broader market sentiment, the on-site atmosphere remained pragmatic and steadfast. Attendees consistently highlighted that market drawdowns are when long-term value is built, and HTX DAO’s transparent and sustainable mechanisms offer a foundation for renewed confidence in the next phase of industry development. Beyond presenting a year of progress, the Guangzhou stop underscored HTX DAO’s core belief that community alignment is the engine of sustainable growth. As the DAO stated publicly , “Users are at the center of every innovation we pursue.” Going forward, HTX DAO will continue to build its ecosystem with professionalism, drive development through innovation, and connect with global users through sincerity. Enhanced governance mechanism upgrades, ecosystem development, and expanded global community outreach will drive the DAO’s future roadmap. Meanwhile, the platform will deepen its focus on the CeFi and DeFi integration, ultimately delivering a new financial order to the industry that is more transparent, efficient, and verifiable.

54844609,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=222560,1763991240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,WPAHash Becomes a New Yield-Generating Platform Attracting US Crypto Investors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wpahash-becomes-a-new-yield-generating-platform-attracting-us-crypto-investors/,"BitcoinWorld WPAHash Becomes a New Yield-Generating Platform Attracting US Crypto Investors More and more investors in the US crypto market are shifting from simply “holding coins and waiting for prices to rise” to more stable and sustainable yield models. WPAHash, a leading global mining platform, has rapidly risen to become the fastest-growing new yield-generating platform in terms of user attention and user growth among US crypto investors. Whether holding BTC, ETH, XRP, or mainstream assets like SOL and DOGE, all are looking for a way to “earn money every day regardless of market fluctuations,” and WPAHash perfectly fills this need. 1. Why Has WPAHash Suddenly Become So Popular in the US? The US market has always been quick to adopt crypto technology, and this year, multiple factors have led to a rapid increase in demand for mining: 1️⃣ Increased market volatility has driven investors to seek more stable yield methods. Relying solely on rising coin prices for returns has become extremely unstable, while WPAHash’s “daily automatic yield” is insensitive to market fluctuations, making it particularly attractive to long-term investors. 2️⃣ No equipment or technical barriers required, perfectly suited to the habits of ordinary US investors US users prefer investment methods that are time-saving, labor-saving, and secure. WPAHash model perfectly meets these requirements: No need to purchase mining machines No need to build a mining farm No maintenance or technical expertise required Purchase computing power to automatically generate daily returns This “financial productization” experience significantly lowers the barrier to entry. 3️⃣ Supports multiple currencies including USDT, USDC, BTC, ETH, and XRP for deposits Especially in the US, stablecoins are widely used, and WPAHash fully supports USDT and USDC, allowing investors to participate in mining with virtually “zero barriers.” 4️⃣ Real data centers worldwide, stable and reliable returns WPAHash has distributed mining farms in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, ensuring stable computing power and continuous returns, a key reason why US users choose it. 2. How can WPAHash become a new return engine for US investors? WPAHash’s core appeal lies in its simple, predictable, and consistently rewarding model: ① Instant access upon registration; new users can receive up to $15 in computing power rewards. US investors have a high acceptance of “low-barrier trials,” leading to a rapid influx of new users. ② Multiple flexible mining contracts to meet diverse investment goals. $100 New User Experience Contract Runs for 2 days and earns $3 per day. Total return: $106. $500 Basic Computing Power (No. 1652) Runs for 5 days and earns $6 per day. Total return: $530. $1,000 Intermediate Computing Power (No. 2538) Runs for 12 days and earns $13 per day. Total return: $1,156. $3,000 Intermediate Computing Power (No. 2741) Runs for 18 days and earns $42 per day. Total return: $3,756. $5,000 Intermediate Computing Power (No. 2933) Runs for 25 days and earns $75 per day. Total return: $6,875. $8,000 Advanced Hashrate (No. 3239) Runs for 30 days and earns $128 per day. Total return: $11,840. [Click to view the full contract] ③ Daily automatic earnings, withdrawable or reinvestable at any time. Unlike traditional mining, WPAHash completely hides the technical complexity; users only need to focus on earnings growth. ④ Not dependent on coin price fluctuations; profits can still be made even when the market is down. This is the feature most valued by US investors. Compared to “betting on coin prices,” mining offers a more stable passive income model. 3. US Crypto Community’s Assessment of WPAHash: The Most Promising Income Stream for the Next Three Years Several US industry analysts point out: ” mining is becoming a standard component of new crypto investment portfolios, especially suitable for those seeking stable returns in volatile markets.” Meanwhile, many US users are sharing their experiences on social media: “For the first time, I felt that crypto investment could be as stable as bank interest.” “Making money even when coin prices drop—that’s true passive income.” “After putting a portion of my BTC and XRP into WPAHash, I have daily cash flow, which greatly reduces the pressure.” With the market’s general trend towards stable returns, WPAHash is gradually becoming a “must-have tool” for US crypto investment. 4. Conclusion: WPAHash is Becoming the Next Stable Growth Curve for US Investors As the crypto market matures, investors are increasingly focusing on: Return Stability Ease of Use Long-Term Sustainability WPAHash has rapidly become a sought-after yield platform for US investors because it offers a solution that provides stable daily passive income regardless of coin price fluctuations or the need for specialized knowledge. Over the next three years, mining will continue to be a crucial component of mainstream crypto investor portfolios. And WPAHash has already secured a leading position in this sector.

Key Takeaways: Japan’s top asset managers are preparing crypto investment trusts ahead of expected 2026 regulatory changes. The FSA plans to reclassify crypto under financial securities law, allowing investment trusts and lowering taxes. SBI Global is leading the push, targeting ¥5 trillion in crypto AUM with new ETFs and multi-asset trusts. A survey by Nikkei found that six major players, including Daiwa Asset Management, Asset Management One, Amova, and Mitsubishi UFJ, are now exploring crypto trust products ahead of an anticipated regulatory shift by the Financial Services Agency (FSA). Japan Plans 2026 Rule Change to Allow Crypto in Investment Trusts Under current rules, cryptocurrencies cannot be included in investment trusts, largely due to restrictions in the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. The FSA, however, aims to reclassify crypto under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act by 2026, granting the asset class the same investor protections as stocks and bonds. The regulator is also weighing a tax overhaul that would apply a 20% financial income tax to crypto gains, replacing the current rate that can climb as high as 55%. If the legislation passes, the FSA is expected to amend the Investment Trust Act soon afterward, a move that would formally open the door for cryptocurrency investment trusts in Japan. JUST IN: Japan’s largest asset managers including Nomura are planning to launch #Bitcoin and crypto investment products. Asia is coming pic.twitter.com/5pbsYbNjol — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 24, 2025 The US has already set a precedent with BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF reaching $90 billion in assets by September, while Japan now counts roughly 13 million crypto accounts held through local exchanges. SBI Global Asset Management is positioning itself aggressively. The firm plans to launch Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, as well as multi-asset crypto trusts, targeting ¥5 trillion ($32 billion) in assets under management within three years of rollout. President Tomoya Asakura said crypto products could become a key vehicle “to move money from savings to investments,” aligning with Japan’s long-standing policy push to activate household capital. Japanese Asset Managers Build Crypto Fund Teams Ahead of Rule Shift Other firms are rapidly building internal capacity. Nomura Asset Management has formed a cross-division task force to prepare product strategies for a post-regulatory-change environment, while Daiwa Asset Management is coordinating closely with ETF specialist Global X Japan. Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management and Amova Asset Management are also evaluating fund lineups for both retail and institutional investors. Still, practical challenges remain. Asset managers must determine pricing benchmarks, ensure they can acquire crypto quickly enough to match investor flows, and put robust custody and security systems in place. The volatility of digital assets also looms large. “Bitcoin’s price swings are orders of magnitude larger than those seen in stocks, bonds and gold,” warned Daisuke Motori of Morningstar Japan, urging careful portfolio sizing. Despite the risks, optimism is high. As reported, Japan is preparing a major reset of its crypto rulebook, moving to treat digital assets as financial products subject to insider trading laws and to lower the tax burden on profits. The Financial Services Agency is drafting measures that would cover 105 cryptocurrencies listed domestically, including Bitcoin and Ethereum .

CryptoQuant analysis reveals familiar patterns from previous bull cycle corrections. However, the market now stands at a critical crossroads where the next move could determine whether this marks a temporary setback or the beginning of a prolonged downturn. While short-term technical signals suggest an imminent rebound, analysts warn that a break of the $80,000 support level would significantly increase the likelihood of a much tougher period. The current price action can be interpreted in two ways: Represents the bottom of a correction within the ongoing bull cycle. The end of the decline lies far ahead if a bear market has truly begun. Critical Support Level Holds Key to Market Direction Technical indicators point toward diverging scenarios based on Bitcoin’s ability to hold key price thresholds. CryptoQuant’s combined long- and short-term SOPR analysis shows that while a short-term rebound appears highly likely, failure to maintain the $80,000 level would open the door to extended weakness. Source: CryptoQuant However, analysts note that a drop exceeding 70% from the all-time high, characteristic of previous bear cycles, appears unlikely this time around. Meanwhile, on-chain metrics suggest potential undervaluation at current levels. The BTC NVT Golden Cross indicator fell below -1.6, historically indicating that Bitcoin’s market cap is undervalued relative to its on-chain activity and is likely to revert toward its mean. Source: X/@Darkfost_Coc This technical signal has previously identified favorable entry points for long positions, though analysts caution against using leverage in the current volatile environment. Bitcoin dominance surged above 60% in early November before stabilizing around 59% as capital consolidated into BTC during broader market drawdowns, according to NYDIG. Source: NYDIG The weekend showed the second-strongest recovery in four months following a difficult week of selling pressure. Index Classification Fears Amplify October Crash Notably, new analysis reveals that MSCI’s October 10 consultation on potentially excluding companies holding over 50% of assets in Bitcoin from global indexes contributed to the dramatic market crash that liquidated $19 billion in 24 hours. The proposal puts Bitcoin-heavy firms like MicroStrategy at risk of forced selling by index funds tracking MSCI benchmarks, creating structural uncertainty that hits an already fragile market dealing with Trump tariffs, weak Nasdaq performance, and heavy leverage. Michael Saylor responded directly to MSCI concerns, clarifying that MicroStrategy operates as a publicly traded company with $500 million in ongoing software revenue and Bitcoin-backed credit products, not as a passive fund or holding company. Response to MSCI Index Matter Strategy is not a fund, not a trust, and not a holding company. We’re a publicly traded operating company with a $500 million software business and a unique treasury strategy that uses Bitcoin as productive capital. This year alone, we’ve completed… — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 21, 2025 Saylor highlighted five new digital credit instruments totaling $7.7 billion in notional value issued this year, positioning the company as an active innovator rather than merely a treasury operator. JPMorgan amplified bearish sentiment days after the initial crash with a report emphasizing MSCI risks. However, the bank’s timing drew criticism from traders familiar with its historical pattern of publishing bearish notes during market weakness. MSCI’s final decision is scheduled for January 15, 2026, with any policy changes taking effect the following month. While some analysts argue the October crash resulted primarily from tariff announcements and derivatives liquidations rather than index classification fears, the consultation created additional structural uncertainty that may persist through the decision date. This MSCI story is not the cause of the Oct 10 crash. Why? Because the timeline doesn’t match the market behavior: • The Oct 10 liquidation cascade began within minutes of Trump’s tariff escalation. • $19B liquidated in 24 hours is not caused by an obscure… https://t.co/pPulxFQFpg — SightBringer (@_The_Prophet__) November 23, 2025 Long-Term Bulls Dismiss Four-Year Cycle Concerns Despite recent weakness, prominent analysts maintain bullish long-term outlooks. PlanB reiterated his 2019 forecast projecting Bitcoin’s market cap reaching $10 trillion, equivalent to $500,000 per coin, by 2028 following the current halving cycle. His model previously predicted that the 2020-2024 period would take Bitcoin from a $100 billion market cap to $1 trillion, and it materialized as forecast. My view has not changed since 2019. In 2019 btc market cap was $100B ($5k btc). This chart said btc mcap would grow to $1T ($50k btc) in 2020-2024 halving period (blue arrow). It did. The same chart shows $10T mcap / $500k btc for 2028 (red arrow). That is still my view. pic.twitter.com/J8e2YqmMQa — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) November 23, 2025 However, technical analysts note Bitcoin closed its second consecutive weekly candle below the 50-week EMA, a pattern that preceded 50% drawdowns in both 2018 and 2022. Critics of the four-year cycle theory argue that this framework may no longer apply as Bitcoin matures and institutional adoption accelerates. Analyst Ted Pillows suggested the cycle could be “dead,” while others maintain that Bitcoin’s fundamental adoption trajectory remains unchanged regardless of short-term volatility or index classification debates. Recovery above $90,000 and eventual breakout past $100,000 would likely trigger significant FOMO among traders who sold, expecting deeper lows around $75,000.

54845248,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=867278,1763991636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54845248.jpeg,China now controls 14% of global Bitcoin mining despite 2021 ban,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-14-of-global-bitcoin-mining-hashrate/,"China is pulling in 14% of global Bitcoin mining power, despite its own ban still being on paper. That’s what’s playing out right now across places like Xinjiang and Sichuan, where miners are lighting up machines in energy-heavy regions while authorities mostly look the other way. China had completely dropped off the mining map in 2021, when the government banned all crypto trading and mining, calling it a threat to financial stability and energy policy. But now, China sits at number three globally, behind only the U.S. and Kazakhstan . That’s after four years of supposed zero tolerance. Mining activity grows as cheap electricity flows Local miners say it’s about the power, specifically, power that nobody else is using. Wang, who runs a private mining operation in Xinjiang, said he got back into it late last year. “A lot of energy cannot be transmitted out of Xinjiang, so you consume it in the form of crypto mining,” Wang said. “New mining projects are under construction. What I can say is that people mine where electricity is cheap.” There’s no public comment from China’s National Development and Reform Commission or the Xinjiang government, both of which were contacted by Reuters. But the lack of enforcement is helping mining operations grow fast. One anonymous source at a major rig maker allegedly said some Chinese cities overbuilt data centers during the last tech push, and now those idle resources are being rerouted to mining. Patrick Gruhn, who runs the crypto infrastructure firm Perpetuals.com, said the sudden return to mining in China signals something deeper. “Chinese policy flexibility emerges when economic incentives are strong in specific regions,” Patrick said. “The resurgence of mining activity in China is one of the most important signals the market has seen in years.” Duke Huang, a former miner based in Sichuan, said the activity never really stopped. “It’s a sensitive area,” Duke said. “But people who get cheap electricity are still mining.” He said some of his former partners have already gone back in. The Bitcoin price jump in October, driven in part by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies, also gave the industry a lift. While Bitcoin is now down about one-third from that recent peak, the mining payoff in China is still high, especially with local energy prices far below international rates. Sales surge shows companies chasing demand Hardware sales show just how strong the demand is. Canaan, the world’s second-largest Bitcoin mining rig maker, saw 30.3% of its global revenue come from China last year. That’s up from just 2.8% in 2022. And in Q2 this year, over half of the company’s revenue came from China, according to someone familiar with the numbers. Canaan wouldn’t confirm that percentage but did say the spike was due to rising Bitcoin prices, U.S. tariff issues messing with American buyers, and a growing shift in how China views crypto. In a statement, the company said, “In China, the R&D, manufacturing, and sale of mining machines are permitted.” They wouldn’t say anything about mining policy itself. Julio Moreno, who leads research at CryptoQuant, put the real hashrate inside China even higher, between 15% and 20% of global capacity. He said, “Bitcoin mining is still officially banned in China. However, there continues to be significant capacity operating.” And while officials aren’t speaking up, financial moves hint at a softening stance. Hong Kong introduced a stablecoin law in August, letting the city regulate crypto tied to fiat currencies. At the same time, Beijing was looking into yuan-backed stablecoins as a tool to promote China’s currency globally. That effort was seen as part of a response to U.S. stablecoin expansion. Liu Honglin, who runs the Man Kun Law Firm, said what most people are thinking but won’t say out loud. “I personally think government policies against mining will be gradually loosened, because you simply cannot stop such activities completely.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The flagship cryptocurrency has lost roughly 20% over the past month and more than 30% since hitting a record above $126,000 in early October, trading at around $86,100 at press time. Weeks of declining prices have, in turn, triggered waves of Bitcoin liquidations, forcing traders to double down or recalibrate their positions. At the same time, sentiment appears to be shifting, with many investors now stepping back from futures markets to limit risk. Bitcoin open interest. Source: CryptoQuant Will Bitcoin recover? The shift, driven largely by Binance , has led to roughly 1.3 million BTC in open positions being shed. A similar figure has not been seen since the 2022 bear market, according to cryptocurrency market analyst Darkfost , which further underscores the scale of the current cleanup. Historically, phases like these have played a crucial role in establishing durable market bottoms, but this cycle, the analyst argued, has been particularly leverage-heavy. Namely, the total open interest recently hit a record of about $47.5 billion, highlighting just how aggressively traders were positioned in futures markets. This is not likely to signal a healthy backdrop, being rather more likely to lead to instability and abrupt corrections when liquidity shifts. MN Fund founder and analyst Michaël van de Poppe said the coming week will be “decisive” for “digital gold”, arguing that a move back into the $90,000–$96,000 range would sharply improve the odds of a fresh all-time high. He appears bullish, even suggesting the current state of the market is comparable to some of the “best opportunities.” “Upcoming week is going to be decisive for Bitcoin. If this can rally back to $90-96K and it’s able to stay at those levels, then the chances of a revival towards a new ATH have significantly increased. Fear and panic are max during the past days. Those are the best opportunities in the markets,” van de Poppe wrote on X. Upcoming week is going to be decisive for #Bitcoin .

The weakening momentum has naturally added a lot of additional pressure to an already fatigued crypto market. For instance, investors have withdrawn roughly $3.5 billion from Bitcoin ETFs so far in November, nearly matching the record $3.6 billion pulled in February. BlackRock , which controls about 60% of all assets in the category, has seen $2.2 billion in redemptions alone. Further institutional strain was added by JPMorgan’s push for MSCI to exclude Bitcoin-heavy firms such as Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) from equity indices, which has fueled fears of debanking and index-eligibility risks.

Totally normal timing, right? pic.twitter.com/ms8T4UGQET — Simply Bitcoin (@SimplyBitcoin) November 23, 2025 Bitcoin’s downturn thus appears to reflect a combination of institutional retreat, technical deterioration, and broader macro uncertainty. While deeply oversold metrics could fuel a short-term bounce, as argued by van de Poppe, reclaiming the $90,000 mark will likely require renewed ETF inflows and a change in investor sentiment.

We’re committed to providing traders with greater flexibility and control, and are excited to announce a significant expansion in our collateral opportunities for Kraken Pro traders. Margin trading is now available for a new trading pair: Start margin trading on Kraken Pro What is a collateral currency? A collateral currency can be fiat, crypto or stablecoin you can use for trading on margin. Unlike standard spot trading, margin trading allows you to open long or short positions by borrowing funds directly from Kraken. When you trade on margin, Kraken’s margin pool is used for the purchase or sale of the cryptocurrency, while your collateral secures the extensions of margin. The collateral currency you use does not need to match the trading pair of the order book you’re trading on, allowing for greater flexibility to go long or short in any margin enabled trading pair . Note: Both unstaked and Kraken Rewards assets can be used as margin collateral. However, assets held in Kraken Pro on-chain staking are ineligible to use as margin collateral. Maximizing the benefits of margin trading Expanding the range of collateral currencies may empower s traders in several ways: Tax advantages In some jurisdictions, using digital assets as collateral rather than selling them outright can defer taxable events. By leveraging collateral currencies for margin trading, traders can potentially reduce immediate tax liabilities while maintaining exposure to their holdings. Diversification of collateral By using multiple collateral currencies, you can better manage risk and reduce exposure to volatility in any single asset. This is particularly valuable for traders seeking to safeguard their positions in unpredictable markets. Improved liquidity With more assets eligible as collateral, you can free up funds for other trading opportunities while maintaining robust positions on margin. This ensures your portfolio remains active and responsive to market changes. Strategic flexibility The ability to combine assets with different haircuts enables fine-tuned margin strategies tailored to your risk tolerance and market outlook. Whether you prefer conservative or aggressive trading, expanded collateral options provide the adaptability you need. Hedging and short selling opportunities With access to margin trading and a diverse range of collateral currencies, traders can hedge their existing positions or take advantage of downward market movements through short selling. This opens up opportunities for profit regardless of market direction. Leverage and capital efficiency Margin trading can amplify your buying power, allowing you to take larger positions than your available capital. This capital efficiency is further enhanced by the ability to use a broader range of collateral currencies, enabling you to maximize potential returns while optimizing resource allocation. New collateral currency choice Here’s the new asset being added to Kraken’s margin collateral lineup, bringing the total to 54 options. Asset Haircut Euro Finance (EURC) 1% Trade with caution There is no guarantee that a limit order will execute. There is no guarantee of margin pool availability at all times.

BMNR's launch of the MAVAN staking network in Q1 2026 will turn its Ethereum holdings into yield-generating assets, enhancing long-term shareholder value. Despite recent crypto volatility and a 50% share price drop, I remain bullish on BMNR, dollar cost averaging, and viewing it as a leveraged play on Ethereum's future. BMNR trades at a discount to its net asset value, pays a symbolic dividend, and offers high-risk but significant upside for long-term Ethereum believers. BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. ( BMNR ) has made the transformation from a tiny immersion miner to one of the most followed companies in the crypto segment due to Tom Lee. BMNR is no longer just a miner, as it has positioned itself as a massive Ethereum (ETH-USD) treasury company with a goal of owning 5% of the total Ethereum market. BMNR just released its first earnings report as a public company, and if you’re an Ethereum bull, it is very enticing. BMNR generated $328.16 million in net income for the 2025 fiscal year, and on a fully diluted level, BMNR produced $13.39 of EPS per share. My biggest question was answered about staking, as BMNR will launch the Made-in-America Validator Network ((MAVAN)) which will be dedicated staking infrastructure for BMNR assets in Q1 2026. BMNR also launched a dividend, and while the dividend amount is only $0.01 it sets the stage for future income being paid out to shareholders. I was skeptical about Ethereum until the GENIUS Act was signed into law by President Trump, which provides a regulatory framework for U.S. stablecoins. From when I turned bullish on Ethereum and BMNR I had indicated that I had no idea which direction these assets would go, as crypto has been historically volatile and there are no cash flow statements to dissect. Despite the massive volatility and people having their positions liquidated due to the use of leverage in the recent crypto meltdown, my investment thesis has not changed. I don’t know where the bottom is, and I have no idea when the selloff will end, but I am a believer in Ethereum’s long-term utility and that BMNR will be a massive beneficiary. I recently added to my position and will continue to dollar cost average into my position as I expect that Ethereum will rebound in the future and BMNR will follow it higher. Seeking Alpha Following up on my previous article about BMNR I previously wrote an article on BMNR in the middle of August after the GENIUS Act was signed into law ( can be read here ). For a while BMNR was doing great as Ethereum was rebounding to its all-time highs, and then the crypto market came under pressure. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum both imploded as Bitcoin has fallen -22.18% over the past month while Ethereum has retraced by -28.73%. I had discussed how BMNR’s pivot to an Ethereum treasury model offered leveraged upside as they worked toward their goal of obtaining 5% of all Ethereum. I discussed how BMNR’s funding strategy excluded tapping the debt markets so they weren’t paying out massive amounts of interest to fuel their Ethereum purchases and why I felt that was bullish. I am following up with a new article now that we have their first official earnings report to discuss why I am still bullish even though shares of BMNR are down over -50% since the middle of August. I have been scaling my way into this position with my latest transaction on Friday, 11/21 and I plan on buying more BMNR as time progresses. Seeking Alpha How I mitigate risk when it comes to BMNR Over the past several weeks I have seen a lot of people complaining about the crypto markets falling and the potential for a crypto winter. Over the past 5 years, Ethereum has made 6 major retracements before the most recent crash, and some of them have been more severe than what we are currently experiencing. Ethereum has fallen from $4,954.56 to $2,767.65 in a short period of time, which is a retracement of roughly -44%. In 2021, Ethereum fell by around -56%, then after rebounding, it fell again by around -49% from the end of 2021 into 2022. At the end of 2024, Ethereum was trading around the $4,000 level and fell over -60% during the spring. Anyone who invests in crypto must be ready for extreme volatility, and I think margin makes it worse because there are probably a lot of people getting called out of positions and being forced to sell into weakness because they don’t have the cash to cover the margin calls. I don’t have a crystal ball, just an investment thesis on Ethereum and BMNR. I fully expect large swings over the next 5 years the same way we have seen large swings over the past 5 years. Since I have no idea where these assets will be tomorrow or in a month from now or even in a year from now, I have scaled into these positions to average out my cost basis. I know there is a low percentage chance I will get in at the bottom and that things could go well for a while and then go upside down overnight. I am only putting money into BMNR and Ethereum that I can afford to lose, and while I don’t want to lose money, that is the risk of any investment. Dollar cost averaging has allowed me to mitigate my risk to a degree because I have bought blocks of shares over $50 and blocks of shares under $30. Since I am not on margin, I am the controller of my own destiny, and I can keep buying as long as my investment thesis remains intact. Eventually I believe that BMNR will be above $50 again, and all the shares I am able to purchase under $50 will help increase the alpha I plan on capturing. This strategy works for me, and I accept the fact that BMNR is a play on Ethereum that comes with many risks and extreme volatility. Seeking Alpha Why I am bullish on Ethereum In order to be bullish on BMNR I must have a strong investment thesis on Ethereum ; otherwise, investing in BMNR would not make sense. My investment thesis around Ethereum revolves around network effects, monetary dynamics, and staking. Ethereum is the leading smart contract platform for decentralized finance, stablecoins, tokenized assets, and NFTs. It processes billions of dollars of value in on-chain transactions and secures an expansive ecosystem of protocols and applications. As more value and applications migrate on-chain, demand for credible settlement increases, and it looks like Ethereum Layer 2 has become the largest base layer for that activity. Since the transition to proof-of-stake and the implementation of EIP-1559 Ethereum’s supply dynamics have changed. The base issuance has fallen, and a portion of transaction fees is burned, which can create a deflationary asset at times. Within the protocol, Ethereum can only issue 1.51% more Ethereum on an annual basis, so if there are large amounts of activity, more Ethereum could be burned off through transactions than the Ethereum that is being issued. This can provide Ethereum with some of the characteristics of a scarce digital asset rather than a utility token that is inflationary. Holders of Ethereum tokens are able to stake them to secure the network and earn staking rewards. Typically, this will be in the low- to mid-single-digit yield. I am looking at Ethereum as digital oil, as the token is positioned to power a new financial system. The Ethereum token serves as collateral that secures billions in stablecoins, real-world assets, and financial applications in the smart contract economy. I believe that the GENIUS Act has expanded the use cases for Ethereum, as it can provide the ability for peer-to-peer payments and asset transfers, which allows users to send and receive digital cash, stablecoins, and other digital assets globally within seconds. Ethereum had roughly 70% of the stablecoin market on its network in the middle of September. Ethereum is already a leading blockchain for institutional activity, and as this trend continues, it will solidify its role as a global ledger of record. I believe that stablecoin adoption is going to be extreme considering SoFi Technologies ( SOFI ) is launching their own stablecoin in Q1 2026 and they are a nationally chartered bank. If the utilization rates increase and stablecoin adoption becomes the new standard in the financial markets, it could drive the price of Ethereum much higher and have a dramatic impact on BMNR’s share price. CoinLaw Despite the share price, I felt FY 25 earnings were meaningful, and I am bullish on BMNR On Friday, 11/21 BMNR released their FY 2025 earnings report, and it answered the questions I was looking for answers to. BMNR generated $328.2 million in net income and $13.39 of diluted GAAP EPS. BMNR announced a dividend of $0.01 per share, which will be paid on 12/29 and go ex-dividend on 12/5. The dividend makes BMNR the first large-cap crypto company to declare an annual cash dividend, which is symbolic because it opens the door for future returns from the Ethereum it stakes. BMNR has 3,559,879 of Ethereum, 192 Bitcoin, a $37 million stake in ORBS, and unencumbered cash of $607 million with 384,067,823 shares outstanding. This puts BMNR’s assets at $10.54 billion with a market cap of $9.99 billion. BMNR is currently trading at an mNAV of 0.95x, which is a discount of -5.24%. Based on the current metrics, BMNR looks very enticing as an investment vehicle in the Ethereum space, and we haven’t even felt the impacts of staking yet. TrackBMNR What I was most excited about from BMNR is that the shareholder base got clarity around staking. BMNR announced MAVAN and staking, which will turn its Ethereum treasury into a yield-producing machine. MAVAN will be launched in Q1 2026 as a dedicated Ethereum staking infrastructure for BMNR assets. BMNR will work with three top institutional staking providers in a pilot program to test security, performance, and yield, then scale into a proprietary validator network. This will allow them to leverage best-in-class infrastructure and partners, which will benefit shareholders. BMNR’s Ethereum assets, which are currently idle, will now generate staking rewards. By building an institutional-grade validator network rather than relying solely on an off-the-shelf approach, BMNR can achieve superior uptime, security, and economics. This could create larger, more sustainable yields and deepen its reputation as the leading Ethereum treasury. BMNR would become a major staker of Ethereum, which could be attractive to institutional investors looking for investments in the digital space. If Ethereum continues to mature as a global settlement layer, MAVAN could give BMNR the ability to generate a large amount of on-chain income that can support operations, future ETH purchases, and potentially higher dividends or buybacks. BMNR Risks to investing in BMNR BMNR is a highly volatile asset that is tied to the success of Ethereum. If we experience a prolonged Ethereum bear market or get an adverse policy stance on staking, it could negatively impact BMNR’s mNAV and cause the share price to sell off further. BMNR was aggressively buying Ethereum at higher prices and is now sitting on billions of dollars of unrealized losses, which helps fuel the bears narrative. Everyone should do their due diligence, as BMNR could continue much lower, and there is no way to know how low Ethereum will go or if its price will reverse to the upside. If for some reason the Clarity Act isn’t signed and the narrative around stablecoins is impacted, I fully expect both Ethereum and BMNR to go much lower. Proceed with caution, as BMNR is extremely speculative. Conclusion Regardless of the short-term volatility in BMNR’s share price, I am optimistically bullish on its future after its FY 25 report. BMNR’s introduction of MAVAN should be very powerful, as it will be able to generate yield through staking and restaking through DEFI. As more assets go digital, Ethereum could be the bridge to tokenizing asset markets and stablecoin issuance, which could make it a deflationary asset and drive the share price higher. My investment thesis revolves around widespread adoption and increased utilization of Ethereum, as BMNR offers a uniquely aggressive way to gain exposure to Ethereum. Currently BMNR trades at a discount to its mNAV, and I have been dollar cost averaging my way into this position. BMNR is volatile and risky, but it could become a strong investment for long-term investors.",ETH-USD|BMNR,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-24 13:45:00

In this regard, one of the asset’s most coveted market-cap targets remains the $3 trillion mark, which could easily push Bitcoin to a new all-time high, surpassing the previous record of $126,000. By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $86,462, having made a slight gain of less than 0.1% in the last 24 hours, while on the weekly chart, the asset remains down almost 8% controlling a market cap of about $1.7 trillion. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Bitcoin’s path to $3 trillion market cap Based on its current price and market capitalization, Bitcoin’s circulating supply is implied to be about 20.35 million coins. Using this figure, it becomes possible to estimate the cryptocurrency’s price at a larger market cap, where the calculation involves dividing the target market cap by the circulating supply. Applying this method, a $3 trillion Bitcoin market cap would translate to an estimated price of approximately $147,500 per coin. Achieving this level means Bitcoin would need to grow by about 70% from its current price. What next for Bitcoin price This projection comes at a time when market attention is focused on Bitcoin reclaiming the crucial $90,000 resistance zone, which could make the $100,000 target increasingly realistic. In this regard, analysis by Michaël van de Poppe in an X post on November 24 indicates that Bitcoin appears poised to stabilize after its sharp pullback, with market structure and key technical levels suggesting consolidation in the near term. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView According to the outlook, the region between $87,000 and $82,000 is viewed as the area Bitcoin must hold to maintain a short-term bullish structure. A deeper support lies near $74,500, which would only come into play if the current level fails. The analysis noted that there is also a likelihood of a retest around $85,500, a move that would close the existing CME futures gap, a phenomenon Bitcoin historically tends to revisit. A successful test of this level could act as a springboard for a relief move toward the 20-day moving average near $95,000, identified as the next logical upside target on the chart. The volume profile and steep decline from recent highs indicate that sellers have exhausted momentum, increasing the probability of a consolidation phase before the next directional move.

It was a technical panic created by unexpected index risk in a stressed market. “ Investment banker Simon Dixon accused JPMorgan of using “ vassalization tactics ” to control Saylor’s Strategy.

In a surprising market move, MicroStrategy has temporarily halted its aggressive Bitcoin buying streak that captivated crypto investors for six consecutive weeks. This strategic pause comes at a crucial time when institutional Bitcoin accumulation has been driving significant market momentum. Why Did MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Buying Streak Suddenly Stop? The company’s consistent Bitcoin accumulation pattern broke last week when CEO Michael Saylor failed to post his usual Sunday purchase update on X. This deviation from routine signals a potential shift in MicroStrategy’s acquisition strategy. The pause follows an intensive six-week Bitcoin buying streak that began on October 6th. MicroStrategy currently maintains an impressive Bitcoin portfolio of 649,870 BTC, acquired at an average price of $74,433 per coin. This substantial holding positions the company as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders globally. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Market? The interruption in MicroStrategy’s consistent Bitcoin buying streak raises important questions about market dynamics. Here are key implications: Market Sentiment Impact: Institutional buying patterns significantly influence Bitcoin price action Strategic Timing: The pause may indicate waiting for optimal entry points Portfolio Management: MicroStrategy could be reassessing its accumulation strategy Industry Signal: Other corporations watch MicroStrategy’s moves closely This development in the Bitcoin buying streak comes when many investors look to corporate adoption as a key market indicator. The company’s previous consistent purchases had become a reliable signal for institutional confidence. Understanding the Six-Week Accumulation Pattern Before this pause, MicroStrategy maintained one of the most aggressive corporate Bitcoin buying streaks in recent history. The company demonstrated remarkable consistency in its acquisition strategy, with weekly purchases becoming almost predictable. This disciplined approach to Bitcoin accumulation helped establish MicroStrategy as a leader in corporate cryptocurrency adoption. However, the current interruption suggests the company might be implementing a more nuanced investment approach. What’s Next for Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? The temporary halt in MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying streak doesn’t necessarily indicate a long-term strategy change. Several factors could influence this decision: Price Considerations: Waiting for more favorable Bitcoin prices Regulatory Environment: Assessing upcoming cryptocurrency regulations Market Conditions: Evaluating overall crypto market stability Corporate Strategy: Potential shift in treasury management approach This pause in the Bitcoin buying streak provides an opportunity to analyze how corporate cryptocurrency strategies evolve in response to market conditions. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors MicroStrategy’s decision to interrupt its Bitcoin buying streak offers valuable insights for the broader cryptocurrency community. The move highlights the importance of strategic timing in digital asset accumulation and demonstrates that even the most committed institutional buyers practice measured approaches. The company’s substantial Bitcoin holdings continue to represent a significant vote of confidence in cryptocurrency’s long-term value proposition, even with this temporary pause in accumulation. Frequently Asked Questions How long was MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying streak? MicroStrategy maintained a six-week Bitcoin buying streak that began on October 6th before pausing purchases last week. How much Bitcoin does MicroStrategy currently hold? The company holds 649,870 BTC acquired at an average price of $74,433 per Bitcoin. Why did MicroStrategy pause its Bitcoin purchases? While the company hasn’t provided official reasons, potential factors include price considerations, market conditions, and strategic portfolio management decisions. Does this mean MicroStrategy is abandoning its Bitcoin strategy? No, this appears to be a temporary pause rather than a strategic abandonment. The company remains one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders. How does this affect Bitcoin’s price? While institutional buying patterns influence market sentiment, Bitcoin’s price depends on multiple factors including retail demand, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory developments. Should individual investors follow MicroStrategy’s lead? Individual investors should consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals rather than blindly following corporate strategies.

However, after the lockdown ended and expectations for a FED interest rate cut increased, the market started the new week with recovery. Bitcoin, which fell to $80,000 on Friday, rose above $86,000, while altcoins also experienced small recoveries. While wondering whether the rise will continue, Coinshares published its weekly cryptocurrency report and stated that there was an outflow of $1.94 billion last week. “Cryptocurrency investment products saw $1.94 billion in outflows last week, bringing the four-week total to $4.92 billion. This was the third-largest outflow since 2018.” Outflows Concentrate on Bitcoin and Ethereum! When looking at individual crypto funds, it was seen that the majority of outflows were in Bitcoin. While Bitcoin experienced an outflow of $1.26 billion, Ethereum (ETH) experienced an outflow of $589 million. When we look at other altcoins, Solana (SOL) continued to rise for the second week, while XRP experienced inflows due to ETF influence. While XRP saw an inflow of $89.3 million and Litecoin (LTC) $3.3 million, Solana saw an outflow of $156.2 million and Sui (SUI) $5 million. “Bitcoin saw most of the outflows last week, totaling $1.27 billion, but also experienced the biggest recovery on Friday with inflows totaling $225 million. Ethereum saw a total of $589 million in outflows. Ethereum experienced a small recovery on Friday with $57.5 million in inflows. Solana saw $156 million in outflows, while XRP bucked the trend with $89.3 million in inflows last week. When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, the USA ranked first with an outflow of $1.68 billion. Following the USA, Germany experienced an outflow of $118.2 million and Switzerland $79.7 million. In the face of these outflows, Australia experienced a small inflow of $2 million and Brazil $3.5 million. *This is not investment advice.

The deal represents a major boost for the French gaming giant, whose blockbuster franchises include Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six. The cash injection will support Ubisoft in paying down debt and bolstering its balance sheet, while providing Vantage Studios with the resources it needs to develop into Ubisoft’s most valuable franchises. The investment in Vantage Studios values the company at a pre-money enterprise value of €3.8 billion, giving Tencent a 26% economic interest in the company. Set up as a dedicated entity for Ubisoft’s highest-profile franchises, Vantage Studios will reportedly give teams more creative latitude and expedite decision-making. The studio opened its doors on October 1, 2025, with co-CEOs Charlie Guillemot and Christophe Derennes, along with a board-level advisory committee. Tencent must hold onto its shares for at least five years, and Ubisoft must maintain a majority of control for at least two years. The deal also includes provisions that allow the companies to repurchase shares or force the sale of shares in the event of ownership changes, thereby providing stability for both parties. Ubisoft boosts finances and reorganizes operations With the $1.3 billion that Tencent has invested in Ubisoft, the company can now pay off its current loans early and reduce its level of debt —a strategy that analysts say will make Ubisoft’s finances more stable. The French gaming company has been under pressure in recent months after an auditor forced it to restate revenue according to international accounting standards, making Ubisoft temporarily in violation of a loan agreement. The recent financing by Tencent specifically addresses this latter issue, which was badly hurting investor sentiment and liquidity. At the same time, the publisher is continuing work on its “Creative Houses” operating model, in which it plans to reduce costs and accelerate the game’s development process. This structure is designed to enable more nimble decisions and targeted innovation by granting individual creative teams greater autonomy over a project’s fate, from inception through execution. The new Vantage Studios, a subsidiary of Tencent, will spearhead this change and lead Ubisoft’s top-performing franchises. As it shapes up its business, Ubisoft is targeting €100 million in fixed cost reductions by fiscal 2026–27, primarily through simplified processes and more flexible resource allocation. The company says that this will enable them to gauge the potential of their smash-hit IPs, making targeted investments in game development, marketing, and global distribution. Investors rally as Tencent deal boosts Ubisoft’s growth prospects Investors welcomed the news as a signal that the company’s financial footing is steadying, occurring amid mounting concerns over debt and revenue restatements. By establishing Vantage Studios with Tencent, analysts said Ubisoft could increase the value of its intellectual properties over time and better monetize and leverage the creative power of its blockbuster franchises. The market also liked the deal, as it provided strategic clarity. Financial analysts believe it may pay off with improved franchise performance and profitability in a competitive global gaming industry. Tencent, meanwhile, plants a strategic foothold in Europe’s gaming market. By investing in Vantage, the Chinese tech giant gains influence over some of Ubisoft’s biggest IPs as it participates in their growing long-term monetization opportunity. The partnership is geared toward everything, from financial exposure to creative partnerships, according to industry analysts, dovetailing with its overall global expansion strategy for the game and digital entertainment industry.

According to market commentator CryptoHarmony, XRP has once again demonstrated remarkable resilience by tapping the same weekly demand zone for the third time, forming a powerful triple bottom, one of the most reliable high-timeframe reversal patterns in technical analysis. Therefore, this repeated support test signals a clear shift in market dynamics, as buyers increasingly assert dominance over sellers. XRP continues to hold the $2.10–$2.15 demand zone with increasing strength. Each retest sparks stronger buying, signaling weakening sell pressure and growing market confidence. A triple bottom on a weekly chart is a powerful bullish signal. It forms as price repeatedly holds a key support, weakening sellers’ control. For XRP, this pattern points to a potential sustained upward move once confirmed. Against the broader market backdrop, momentum is clearly shifting toward buyers. A breakout from this triple bottom could trigger a mid-term rally toward the psychological price of $3, with high-timeframe reversal patterns offering both technical validation and trader confidence. Well, XRP’s steadfast support at the $2.10–$2.15 zone signals strong institutional interest. Each retest absorbs selling pressure while drawing new buyers, indicating bulls are steadily seizing control and setting the stage for potential upside. Therefore, XRP’s consistent support at the $2.10–$2.15 weekly zone and the emerging triple bottom indicate a shift in market control. Sellers are waning, buyers are gaining strength, and a mid-term rally toward $3+ is increasingly likely. XRP Overtakes Bitcoin on Upbit: Korean Traders Spark Major Shakeup On Korea’s largest exchange Upbit, XRP has overtaken Bitcoin in 24-hour trading volume, a rare milestone Xaif Crypto calls “XRP sitting at 1, officially leaving Bitcoin behind.” Therefore, the surge highlights a clear shift in Korean trader preference and has analysts watching closely. Notably, XRP’s 24-hour volume on Upbit surged to $315M, outpacing Bitcoin’s $218M. On a major, high-liquidity exchange serving millions of Korean traders, this rare shift signals changing trader preference, and potentially broader market sentiment, in a key crypto hub. Korean traders, known for early altcoin adoption, are driving XRP’s latest surge, signaling rising confidence in its use cases, institutional support, and upcoming tech. While Bitcoin grabs headlines, XRP’s momentum shows traders now favor short-term liquidity and price action over BTC’s traditional store-of-value narrative. Market watchers highlight an unusual surge in XRP-to-BTC volume on Upbit, a rare anomaly in recent years. Xaif Crypto suggests this isn’t a fleeting spike but a potential regional trend, with Korean traders flocking to high-momentum assets promising faster gains. What does this mean? Well, XRP is shaking up Korea’s crypto scene, drawing traders who traditionally favored Bitcoin. If momentum holds, it could reshape regional trading trends and signal wider portfolio diversification, with Upbit now firmly in XRP’s spotlight. Conclusion XRP’s triple bottom at the $2.10–$2.15 weekly demand zone signals a clear shift in market sentiment. With sellers weakening and buyers taking control, the path is set for a potential mid-term rally toward $3 and beyond, presenting a high-probability bullish opportunity for traders and investors. On the other hand, XRP’s surge past Bitcoin on Upbit signals a potential shift in Korea’s crypto market.

Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas just dropped a bombshell prediction that could transform how we access cryptocurrency markets. He forecasts over 100 new crypto ETFs hitting the market within the next six months, starting with five major spot crypto ETFs launching this week. What Are Crypto ETFs and Why Do They Matter? Crypto ETFs represent a revolutionary way for investors to gain exposure to digital assets without directly holding cryptocurrencies. These exchange-traded funds track the price of underlying crypto assets, making them accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. The upcoming wave of crypto ETFs includes funds for popular tokens like DOGE, LINK, and XRP, scheduled to launch within the next six days. This massive expansion of crypto ETFs signals growing institutional acceptance of digital assets. Traditional investors who were hesitant about crypto wallets and exchanges can now participate through familiar investment vehicles. The sequential rollout of these funds over the next six months will create unprecedented access to diverse cryptocurrency exposure. How Will These New Crypto ETFs Benefit Investors? The explosion of crypto ETFs brings multiple advantages for both new and experienced investors: Simplified access to cryptocurrency markets through traditional brokers Enhanced regulatory protection compared to direct crypto ownership Diversification opportunities across multiple digital assets Reduced technical barriers for mainstream investors However, investors should remain cautious about market volatility and conduct proper due diligence. While crypto ETFs provide easier entry, they still carry the inherent risks of cryptocurrency markets. The sequential launch approach allows investors to evaluate each new crypto ETF as it becomes available. What Challenges Might These Crypto ETFs Face? Despite the optimistic forecast, the rapid expansion of crypto ETFs faces several potential hurdles. Regulatory approval processes remain stringent, and market conditions can change quickly. The success of these new crypto ETFs will depend on sustained investor interest and stable market performance. Moreover, the specific schedule beyond the initial five funds remains unclear. Balchunas emphasized that while he expects more than 100 additional spot crypto ETFs, the exact timing and composition depend on regulatory approvals and market demand. This uncertainty means investors should stay informed about developments in the crypto ETF space. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Investment The predicted launch of over 100 crypto ETFs within six months represents a watershed moment for digital asset adoption. This massive institutional embrace could drive mainstream cryptocurrency acceptance to unprecedented levels. As these crypto ETFs become available, they’ll likely attract significant capital from both retail and institutional investors seeking diversified crypto exposure. Frequently Asked Questions What are the first five crypto ETFs launching? The initial wave includes spot crypto ETFs for DOGE, LINK, and XRP, with two additional funds yet to be specified. How can I invest in these new crypto ETFs? You can purchase crypto ETFs through traditional brokerage accounts once they become publicly available. Are crypto ETFs safer than buying cryptocurrency directly? While crypto ETFs offer regulatory protections, they still carry market risks similar to direct cryptocurrency ownership. When will all 100+ crypto ETFs be available? The full rollout is expected to occur sequentially over the next six months, though specific timing may vary. Do I need special knowledge to invest in crypto ETFs? Basic understanding of ETFs and cryptocurrency markets is helpful, but these funds are designed for mainstream investors. Will these crypto ETFs be available internationally? Availability may vary by region, depending on local regulatory approvals and market access. Found this insight valuable?

With the price losing key support levels and sentiment growing increasingly cautious, all eyes are on whether ETH can stabilize above major zones, or if another leg down is coming. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, ETH has fallen below both its 100-day and 200-day moving averages, currently hovering around $2,800. This breakdown came after several days of consolidation near the $3,000 level, which acted as a weak support before the market finally cracked. The RSI also sits deep near the oversold territory around 30, reflecting strong bearish momentum. If the asset fails to reclaim the $3,000–$3,100 zone soon, the next significant support lies around $2,500, a previous demand zone that could act as a potential bounce area. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4-hour chart, ETH has formed a bearish rising wedge pattern during its recent relief move, typically a continuation setup in downtrends. The price is now on the verge of breaking below the wedge, indicating sellers are still in control. If this breakdown is confirmed, another test of the $2,500 support area will be very likely. The RSI on this timeframe is also trending downward, failing to break above 50, which shows momentum is still favoring the sellers. As a result, it might all come down to the $2,500 level: whether it can hold the price or break down and pave the way for a much deeper retracement. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Netflows On Sunday, November 23rd, Ethereum saw a sharp spike in outflows from exchanges, resulting in one of the largest negative netflows of recent years. This means a significant amount of ETH was withdrawn from centralized exchanges. There are a few possible interpretations: whales or institutions could be moving funds to cold wallets amid price weakness, anticipating accumulation opportunities, or long-term holding. Alternatively, it could indicate users avoiding custodial risk in fear of further selloffs. Either way, this kind of behavior typically reduces immediate selling pressure on exchanges but doesn’t guarantee a bottom unless accompanied by bullish price action or strong inflows to DeFi and staking platforms. For now, this netflow data shows some signs of cautious accumulation but not full-blown reversal optimism.

54845425,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=857135,1763992833,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54845425.jpeg,A Quiet Move In Bitcoin Options Is Starting To Raise Big Questions,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/quiet-move-bitcoin-options-big-questions/,"Bitcoin’s six-week collapse has erased over $40,000 from its price, yet—according to Jeff Park, CIO at ProCap BTC and Bitwise advisor—the more important story may lie not in spot markets but in volatility. In his November 22 Substack post “Where Does Bitcoin Go From Here?”, Park argues that “market structure has flipped sharply negative,” citing ETF outflows, the Coinbase discount, structural selling, and liquidations of over-levered longs. But beneath that surface stress, he says, “something in the structure of Bitcoin’s volatility markets is stirring again—something that looks more like the old Bitcoin, not the new one.” Sudden Twist In Bitcoin Skew Has Expert On High Alert For nearly two years, the consensus has been that the ETF era “tamed Bitcoin” and “crushed volatility.” Spot ETFs channeled institutional flows into volatility-muting structures, dampening the wild swings that once defined BTC. Yet Park notes that over the last 60 days, implied volatility (IV) has trended higher for the first time in 2025. Even more telling: IV kept rising while spot fell—an uncommon dynamic since ETFs launched. That, he says, “might be the first signal of a regime shift” back toward pre-ETF market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin Local Bottom To Fall Between These Two Levels – Analyst Historical context sharpens his point. Between 2021 and 2022, IV spiked repeatedly—156% during China’s mining ban, 114% in the Luna/UST collapse, and again in the 3AC and FTX crises. Since FTX, volatility “has never traded above 80%,” and vol-of-vol (the “velocity” of volatility itself) has remained below 100, a post-ETF pattern of subdued convexity. But the latest upward drift, Park argues, suggests that the “convex, breakaway vol behavior” that once defined Bitcoin could be re-emerging. That shift carries structural implications. During past crises, put skew widened sharply, reaching –25%. But Park highlights an opposite kind of stress test—January 2021—when call skew surged above +50% and triggered Bitcoin’s last “mega-gamma squeeze.” Dealers short call gamma were forced to buy spot into a rising market, pushing BTC from $20,000 to $40,000 in weeks. It was, he recalls, “the first time Deribit saw record retail flows as traders discovered the power of OTM calls.” Today’s skew data looks different but potentially telling. “The 30-day put skew is the lowest it has been all year,” Park writes, suggesting defensive premiums are elevated and “further volatility to the downside is not unwarranted.” Yet Deribit’s open interest shows a market still leaning bullish in notional terms. Related Reading: Only An Asteroid Can Sink MSTR’s Bitcoin Bet, CryptoQuant CEO Says As of November 22, the largest positions include roughly $1 billion in Dec 26 $85k puts, $950 million in $140k calls, and $720 million in $200k calls—more upside than downside exposure overall. Similarly, the largest IBIT options are “more calls than puts, and the range of strikes are more OTM than the puts.” Park’s broader thesis is that volatility itself may again become Bitcoin’s catalyst. He draws parallels to February–March 2024, when sustained ETF inflows and a steady vol bid preceded a dramatic melt-up. “Wall Street needs high volatility for Bitcoin to be interesting,” he writes, noting that institutional desks chase trend P&L into year-end, and “volatility is a reflexive machine.” Whether that machine is restarting remains uncertain. Park concludes that if spot continues to fall while IV climbs, “the case strengthens that a sharp upside reversal could materialize.” But if vol stalls or slips as price declines—“classic sticky-delta behavior”—then the drawdown may harden into “the early contours of a potential bear trend.” In essence, Park’s message is that Bitcoin’s most revealing signal isn’t price but structure. After two years of ETF-driven calm, volatility is moving again—and in Bitcoin’s history, when vol wakes up, price rarely stays still for long. At press time, BTC traded at $85,912.

The company plans a US-based MAVAN validator network to generate staking revenue and turn its massive Ethereum stack into active infrastructure. SUBBD is building an AI-powered creator content platform on Ethereum, using $SUBBD for payments, rewards, and access to automated content tools. The $SUBBD presale combines fixed 20% staking rewards with multi-x upside forecasts, but remains a high-risk early-stage Ethereum ecosystem play. BitMine has just grabbed another 21,537 Ethereum tokens for around $60M, even though it is already sitting on roughly $4B in unrealized losses on its $ETH stack. The company now controls more than 3% of the entire Ethereum supply, making it one of the most important non-foundation players anchoring the network. That is not what capitulation looks like. This fresh buy comes after Ethereum slid more than 25% in a month, putting digital asset treasuries under heavy scrutiny. $ETH is currently below $3K – hovering around $2.8K. Yet BitMine keeps saying the drawdown is a liquidity shock, not a signal that Ethereum’s fundamentals are breaking. Instead of trimming risk, it is doubling down and preparing to turn its holdings into an active business line. The firm has outlined plans for a US-based validator network called MAVAN (Made in America Validator Network), expected to go live next year and focused on staking Ethereum in a fully regulated model. The idea is simple: if you already own billions in $ETH, you might as well earn yield and become part of the network’s security backbone, rather than just watching price candles. For smaller investors who cannot spin up an industrial validator farm, this kind of move still matters. If a major treasury is willing to absorb eye-watering paper losses while building out Ethereum infrastructure, it is a strong vote of confidence in the chain that underpins most of DeFi, NFTs and, increasingly, AI-focused tokens. 💡 That is where SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) comes in, positioning itself as an AI creator platform native to Ethereum at the very moment large players are reinforcing the base layer. SUBBD Token Powers AI Creator Utilities on Ethereum SUBBD is built around a straightforward idea: creators spend far too much time on admin work and not enough time actually creating. Plus they are charged management fees that eat away at any profit they make. That’s why this project uses AI agents and automation to handle tasks like scheduling, tier management, personalized responses and analytics so that creators can focus on content while fans get a smoother experience. ⚙️ The $SUBBD token sits at the center of this ecosystem. It is used for subscription payments, tips, access to exclusive content and early access to new AI features. Holders also tap into perks such as loyalty rewards and platform benefits that are designed to keep the most engaged fans inside the ecosystem instead of bouncing between centralized platforms with high fees and opaque rules. The project’s ecosystem potentially reaches millions of followers across roughly 2K top influencers plugged into the broader SUBBD brand. That scale matters. If even a small percentage of those fans migrate to on-chain subscriptions and rewards, on-chain activity can build up quickly, especially on an Layer-1 like Ethereum, where BitMine and other big treasuries are reinforcing security via staking. The project whitepaper frames SUBBD as part of the wider creator economy, which already sits around the tens of billions of dollars in annual value. By moving fan payments, perks and AI tools on-chain, the project is trying to turn a Web2-style subscription model into a tokenized system where value accrues not just to a platform, but also to token holders and active participants. 💡 In other words, while BitMine is building ‘physical’ Ethereum infrastructure through MAVAN, SUBBD is aiming to build the application layer where human and AI ‘digital labor’ actually earns revenue. If Ethereum’s long-term story plays out the way BitMine is betting, creator platforms that live directly on the network are positioned to benefit from that same recovery. SUBBD Presale, Staking Rewards And Upside Potential The SUBBD Token presale is still live, with more than $1.36M already committed and the current token price at $0.057025. The sale uses incremental price steps, with a final presale rate above current levels, so early buyers effectively lock in a small discount before any exchange listings. Learn how to buy $SUBBD now to get in early. On top of that, the team is offering a fixed 20% staking reward during the presale phase. The goal here is not only to give holders passive income in $SUBBD, but also to reduce immediate sell pressure by rewarding those who lock their tokens rather than flipping them at the first listing. 💰Our $SUBBD price prediction maps a potential high of around $0.668 by the end of 2026. From the current presale level of $0.057025, that implies roughly a 12x upside. Compared with BitMine’s strategy of squeezing mid-single digit staking yields from a massive Ethereum position, smaller investors are clearly hunting for higher-gear exposure. A focused application token like $SUBBD links directly to a specific use case in the AI creator economy, while still inheriting the macro thesis that Ethereum remains the settlement layer of choice. Join the SUBBD Token presale before the next price hike.

The asset remains inside the broader bullish order-flow zone, but the overall trend is still decisively bearish, with reclaims required before any meaningful reversal can develop. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin has retraced back toward the major bullish order-flow zone after failing to reclaim any high-timeframe structure. The death-cross between the 100-day and 200-day moving averages has now materialized, confirming a shift toward sustained bearish momentum as long as the price remains below the $100K–$104K region. The latest wick toward $80K shows that liquidity beneath the prior macro low has been harvested. Buyers reacted aggressively at the lower boundary of the green accumulation zone, but the recovery remains corrective. As long as the market trades below the $92K–$96K supply cluster, this bounce should be treated as a relief move inside a broader downtrend. If buyers establish stability above the $96K pivot, a mid-range retest of $100K–$104K becomes possible. Failure to reclaim that area leaves the door open for another deeper sweep toward the lower accumulation band between $80K and $83K. The 4-Hour Chart Short-term structure remains aligned to the downside, with the price respecting the descending trendline and each rally shutting down at lower supply levels. The most recent pullback stalled precisely at the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci pocket, highlighting compression against the trendline. Until the descending trendline is cleanly reclaimed, upside remains limited. A confirmed break above $90K–$92K would signal that momentum is rotating upward, opening a path toward the $96K–$98K inefficiency zone. Rejection from the current trendline, however, would likely send the asset back into the $83K–$86K support range, where the next volatility cluster sits. On-chain Analysis By Shayan Bitcoin’s Binary CDD reveals a notable behavioral shift among long-term, smart-money holders. The three upward spikes marked on the chart clearly align with cycle highs, suggesting that experienced holders chose to quietly offload BTC into strength while retail participation was accelerating. Each spike coincided with a local or macro top, confirming that dormant supply was being reactivated at premium prices. This pattern indicates that profit-taking from long-term holders began well before the market sold off, a classic hallmark of distribution phases. At the same time, short-term holders have been capitulating aggressively. SOPR metrics show that STHs have spent weeks selling at losses, producing a deep capitulation band below 1.0. This combination, smart-money distribution at the top and reactive selling at the bottom, typically marks the later stages of a correction, not the early ones. Although this does not imply an immediate reversal, the cleansing of weak hands and the absorption seen around the lower accumulation zone suggest that the market is transitioning into a potential accumulation phase. Sustained defense of the $80K–$83K realized-demand area would reinforce this scenario. A clean breakdown below that region, however, would signal that the final washout has not yet completed.

The drop has pushed many traders into defensive positions. Yet hidden under the visible weakness is a different story. Silent accumulation is unfolding in real time, and it is attracting serious attention. The discussion gained traction after a post on X by STEPH IS CRYPTO, who highlighted unusual whale activity during the recent decline. After this first mention, he will be referred to as Steph. His alert pointed toward a growing mismatch between price action and large-holder behavior. That mismatch has become one of the most important developments in the current XRP landscape. Rising Accumulation From Large Wallets Fresh on-chain readings show increased activity from major XRP addresses. Several whale wallets expanded their holdings while the price dipped. These wallets moved significant amounts of XRP away from exchanges . That pattern usually indicates accumulation rather than short-term speculation. BREAKING: WHALES ARE QUIETLY SOAKING UP $XRP WHILE PRICE BLEEDS. MEGA BULLISH! pic.twitter.com/RVQhfOFS6b — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 23, 2025 Exchange balances linked to large holders have trended downward this week. That trend suggests reduced sell pressure as whales continue to reposition. The actions of these wallets stand in contrast to broader retail sentiment. Many smaller traders have exited positions out of fear and frustration. Understanding the Quiet Buying Phase Whales often use market weakness as a strategic entry point. Their moves can appear slow, but they usually create strong supply shifts. When whales accumulate during a bleeding market, they reduce the amount of liquid XRP available for trading. This reduction creates conditions that support a potential future supply squeeze. The timing and scale of accumulation can influence momentum in later price cycles. Steph noted this same behavior in his alert. His analysis aligns with the on-chain data recorded across several monitoring platforms. Together, they outline the same trend: strong hands are absorbing XRP from weaker hands. Price Weakness and Market Structure XRP’s decline has produced lower daily levels and forced many traders into losses. This visible weakness masks a very different structural change. Whale accumulation during aggressive selling creates a clearer foundation for recovery. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The contrast between price action and wallet behavior has become sharper in recent days. If accumulation continues, the market could transition into a strong reversal environment. Traders often miss this transition because the price remains weak during early accumulation phases. Implications for the Coming Weeks A key factor is the behavior of exchange-based whale balances. If these balances continue to fall, supply pressure will shrink. Shrinking supply paired with returning demand often fuels strong upside moves. Traders should also watch for large transfers to cold wallets. These transfers usually reflect long-term positioning rather than short-term trading. XRP now sits at a crucial point in its current market cycle. The next phase will depend on continued accumulation and returning demand. Whales are accumulating XRP while the market bleeds, and the evidence is clear. Steph’s alert captured this shift early, and the data now confirms it. Price weakness has dominated headlines, but quiet accumulation is shaping a different story. That story points toward tightening supply and a potential future reversal. XRP’s next major move may be forming beneath the surface, far from the panic of the retail market.

Wallet in Telegram , a digital asset solution natively embedded into Telegram’s interface, today announced a listing partnership and full token listing with Monad , the high-performance EVM Layer-1 inaugurating Coinbase’s new ICO platform. The partnership and listing will be available through the custodial Crypto Wallet, enabling users to discuss trading opportunities directly in Telegram and execute TGE trades natively within the app – keeping conversation and execution in one unified place. From launch day, Wallet in Telegram users will be able to deposit, withdraw and trade MON directly within the app. The listing will be accompanied by a dedicated native MON staking functionality as well as incentive programs for traders designed to introduce Monad to Telegram’s audience across established and emerging crypto markets. Regarded as one of 2025’s most consequential blockchain debuts, Monad sets a new performance standard for EVM-compatible networks. Its parallel and asynchronous execution model enables Ethereum-style smart contracts to operate at significantly higher throughput, targeting 10,000 transactions per second, sub-second latency, and low fees while preserving full bytecode-level EVM compatibility and decentralization. Monad’s development has attracted extensive institutional support, with more than $225 million raised from investors including Paradigm, Dragonfly and Electric Capital. As the first project to launch through Coinbase’s new ICO platform, Monad has conducted a $188 million public sale following a testnet that processed over 5 billion transactions. The network will also distribute an airdrop to more than 230,000 eligible users. “Monad represents a defining moment for next-generation blockchain infrastructure – combining breakthrough performance with full EVM compatibility,” said Halil Mirakhmed, Chief Strategy Officer at Wallet in Telegram. “Our mission is to ensure that users everywhere can participate in the most important moments in crypto from day one. By partnering with Monad at launch, we’re opening this milestone to millions of people around the world and supporting the growth of what we believe will be a foundational network for years to come.” Wallet in Telegram is expanding its role as a universal gateway to digital assets for everyone. Alongside leading cryptocurrencies, it now offers xStocks for selected NASDAQ equities and will join blue-chip token generation events such as the Monad (MON) TGE, giving users curated access to top-tier crypto, public stocks and early-stage blockchain networks in one easy-to-use interface. “Wallet in Telegram makes Monad uniquely accessible to a broad retail audience at launch,” said Keone Hon, Co-founder of Monad. “Starting from the launch, Telegram users around the world can engage with Monad’s technology through a familiar interface — advancing our goal to build fast, simple and scalable blockchain systems.” Expanding access to Monad through Wallet in Telegram supports both teams’ efforts to make high-profile crypto launches more accessible to everyday users worldwide. With a deeply global user base and a presence in regions where early participation in major crypto events has often been limited, Wallet in Telegram offers a meaningful expansion of Monad’s retail footprint.

Coinglass data , cited by analyst Xaif Crypto, shows $1.94B in digital asset outflows last week, underscoring XRP’s resilience. Bitcoin, the market’s long-standing benchmark, bore the brunt with $1.27 billion in outflows, while Ethereum saw $589 million exit its ecosystem. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Solana and multi-asset products, also remained firmly in the red, reflecting a broad-based retreat by investors in the face of heightened market uncertainty. Amid market turbulence, XRP bucked the trend with $89.3M in inflows, the only major crypto to attract fresh capital last week, signaling growing investor confidence in its near- and mid-term prospects. Notably, XRP’s momentum extends well beyond this week. Month-to-date inflows hit $351M, while year-to-date totals $2.32B into XRP-linked products. These figures highlight XRP’s rising appeal as a high-liquidity alternative, attracting investors seeking stability amid broader market volatility. XRP’s resilience is driven by growing institutional interest, advancements in cross-border payment use cases, and perceived undervaluation versus peers. Strong trading volumes in key Asian markets further attract both retail and professional investors seeking strategic exposure. Amid widespread crypto outflows, XRP stands out, attracting fresh capital and signaling a potential shift in investor preference. Its resilience highlights a high-probability opportunity for short-term gains and medium-term market positioning. Conclusion As the broader crypto market bled capital, XRP drew $89.3M in weekly inflows, $351M month-to-date and $2.32B year-to-date. This steady demand marks XRP not just as a survivor in volatile conditions but as a strategically attractive, high-liquidity vehicle for investors looking to capitalize on shifting market dynamics.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-24 15:18:44

The latest withdrawals, coming amid intensified crypto sell-off, have pushed the rolling four-week outflows total to nearly $5 billion. Per the latest report outlining the global cryptocurrency exchange-traded outflows, this capital exit marks one of the most severe outflow streaks in the sector’s history. Bitcoin, as has happened over recent months, led the weekly outflows. Crypto outflows have hit $4.9 billion in four weeks According to the latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly report from CoinShares, the market saw over $1.94 billion exit digital asset investment products last week. CoinShares head of research James Butterfill said the outflows account for one of the biggest so far. Cumulatively, the past four weeks have seen outflows jump to $4.92 billion, equivalent to 2.9% of total assets under management. “Proportionally this represents the 3rd largest run of outflows since 2018, beaten only by March 2025 and February 2018,” Butterfill noted. The sustained withdrawals have coincided with a steep correction in cryptocurrency prices. Although digital asset investment products saw outflows of $1.94 billion, the total was slightly below the $2 billion seen in the previous week. “We believe the combination of monetary policy uncertainty and crypto-native whale sellers are the main reasons for this most recent negative funk,” Butterfill said at the time. Bitcoin leads outflows Recent weeks have seen a surge in net outflows, with Bitcoin-focused products bearing the brunt of the exodus. BTC ETF products registered a total of $1.27 billion in outflows for the week. Nevertheless, Bitcoin also led the slight uptick on November 21, 2025, with inflows of $225 million. Elsewhere, Ethereum products suffered outflows of $589 million. Like Bitcoin, however, Ethereum saw a partial rebound on Friday, with $57.5 million flowing back into ETH-focused funds. Among major altcoins, Solana recorded outflows of $156 million. In contrast, XRP products bucked the broader trend, attracting $89.3 million in inflows. The launch of spot XRP ETFs in the week helped. BTC price sell-off Bitcoin, which briefly dipped to the psychologically important $80,000 level last week, led the sell-off. The top coin currently trades around $85k, but the combined effect of BTC’s dip and overall risk asset market weakness means redemptions could intensify further. Notably, the negative price movement has driven a 36% decline in total AUM over the past month. However, despite the recent pain, the broader picture remains robust. Year-to-date inflows into digital asset investment products remain a significant $44.4 billion.

ETH has broken below the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement near $2,974 and fallen well under its 200-day simple moving average around $3,505, underscoring the strength of the current downtrend. Outset PR , a crypto-native firm that blends data analysis with communication strategy, powers this piece. With a sharp eye on trends and timing, Outset PR helps blockchain projects convert critical moments into enduring visibility. Technical picture: oversold, but no reversal yet Source: coinmarketcap ETH’s RSI-14 sits near 30, signaling oversold conditions, but chart watchers note the absence of bullish divergence — meaning momentum has weakened, yet buyers haven’t shown enough force to suggest a durable bottom. With price below major trend markers, systematic and technically driven traders are largely on the sidelines until ETH can reclaim lost ground. The next major downside checkpoint is $2,626, Ethereum’s yearly low and the nearest meaningful support. As long as ETH remains below $2,974, the path of least resistance stays lower, and any rebound risks being treated as a relief move rather than a trend change. Fusaka upgrade: a structural catalyst markets may be ignoring Attention is now shifting toward Fusaka, Ethereum’s next hard fork scheduled for Q4 2025, with mainnet activation targeted for December 3. Fusaka bundles the Fulu (consensus layer) and Osaka (execution layer) upgrades and is designed to push Ethereum’s scaling roadmap forward through higher blob throughput and PeerDAS, a major data-availability improvement aimed at making Layer-2 posting cheaper and more efficient. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has called Fusaka an “underappreciated catalyst,” arguing that L2 fee reforms could dramatically expand Ethereum’s blockchain revenue once live. The market, however, appears reluctant to price in that upside ahead of implementation. Recent price action suggests investors remain unconvinced that near-term fundamentals — including weak activity, cautious institutional positioning, and lower fee capture — will improve quickly enough to halt the decline. Outset PR Helps Web3 Projects Stay Visible When Markets Turn Risk-Off When price action is this fragile, perception can move as quickly as liquidity. Projects tied to Ethereum’s ecosystem — from DeFi protocols to Layer-2 networks — often need to communicate progress and resilience without burning through budgets at the worst possible moment. Outset PR positions itself around this problem: how to stay visible and credible in down markets with spend that’s tied to measurable reach. Instead of pursuing volume placements with uncertain payoff, Outset PR uses Syndication Map, a proprietary analytics tool that shows which outlets are most likely to deliver meaningful traffic and syndication lift. That allows campaigns to be built around impact, not noise. The result is leaner campaigns with higher signal. By focusing on high-discovery surfaces, Outset PR cuts low-impact spend and increases the chance that a story travels further through republishing. The agency’s Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , leans heavily on long-term editorial relationships to keep placement quality high even when markets are risk-off. That syndication effect can multiply reach well beyond the original buy. In a recent StealthEX campaign, tier-1 pitching produced 92 republications across major aggregators and platforms including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating an estimated 3 billion total outreach . In volatile conditions like the current ETH downturn, that kind of efficiency matters: narrative pressure eases when visibility is broad, consistent, and backed by metrics.

Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR ETH Price Outlook Ethereum’s weakness reflects a mix of technical breakdowns, institutional de-risking, and delayed optimism around December’s upgrade. While oversold conditions could spark intermittent bounces, traders say stabilization depends on two things: Reclaiming $2,974–$3,000 to pull technical buyers back in Improving sentiment and ETF flow stability, reducing forced selling pressure Until then, ETH remains vulnerable to retesting $2,626, with the market treating Fusaka more as a long-term structural tailwind than an immediate rescue line.

The cryptocurrency’s significant price drop has caught everyone’s attention, but what’s really happening beneath the surface? Deutsche Bank’s latest analysis reveals critical insights about the Bitcoin market structure that every investor should understand. What Exactly is Happening to Bitcoin’s Market Structure? Deutsche Bank’s research team has identified several key factors impacting Bitcoin’s recent performance. The bank points to a combination of risk-off sentiment among investors and hawkish signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve as primary drivers. Moreover, weakening regulatory momentum and institutional outflows have created additional pressure on the Bitcoin market structure. The situation becomes more complex when we consider long-term holders taking profits. This behavior, while natural in any market, has amplified the downward pressure. The result? A staggering $1 trillion drop in Bitcoin’s market capitalization that has exposed underlying vulnerabilities in the current Bitcoin market structure. Why Does This Bitcoin Market Structure Matter? Understanding the Bitcoin market structure is crucial because it reveals how resilient the cryptocurrency really is. Deutsche Bank’s analysis suggests we’re witnessing a critical test phase. The big question remains: Is this just a temporary correction or the beginning of a more significant downturn? The bank highlights three key amplifiers of the current decline: Market uncertainty creating hesitation among new investors High leverage positions being unwound rapidly Policy ambiguity affecting institutional participation Is the Long-Term Bitcoin Market Structure Still Intact? Despite the current challenges, Deutsche Bank maintains that Bitcoin’s long-term maturity remains fundamentally sound. The current stress test of the Bitcoin market structure could actually strengthen it in the long run. However, investors should pay close attention to how these vulnerabilities are addressed. The bank’s analysis suggests that the current Bitcoin market structure issues don’t necessarily indicate a fundamental breakdown. Instead, they reveal areas that need development and stabilization. This perspective is important for investors considering both short-term opportunities and long-term positions. What Can Investors Learn From This Bitcoin Market Structure Analysis? Deutsche Bank’s findings provide valuable lessons for anyone involved in cryptocurrency markets. The exposed vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin market structure highlight the importance of: Diversification across different asset classes Risk management strategies for volatile periods Long-term perspective when evaluating market movements Monitoring regulatory developments that impact market stability The current situation with the Bitcoin market structure serves as a reminder that even established cryptocurrencies face significant tests during market transitions. However, these challenges often lead to stronger, more resilient market frameworks in the long term. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin’s recent price decline according to Deutsche Bank? Deutsche Bank identified multiple factors including risk-off sentiment, Federal Reserve hawkishness, regulatory uncertainty, institutional outflows, and profit-taking by long-term holders. How much market capitalization did Bitcoin lose? Bitcoin experienced approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization loss during the recent decline, exposing vulnerabilities in its market structure. Is this a temporary correction or long-term downturn? Deutsche Bank views this as a test phase to determine whether current conditions represent a temporary correction or the beginning of a more sustained downturn. Does Deutsche Bank believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential? Yes, the bank maintains that Bitcoin’s long-term maturity remains intact despite current market structure challenges. What factors are amplifying the current decline? Uncertainty, leverage unwinding, and policy ambiguity are amplifying the effects of the current market movement. Should investors be concerned about Bitcoin’s market structure? While current vulnerabilities warrant attention, they also represent opportunities for market maturation and future stability improvements.

Price volatility across Bitcoin and other major assets added fuel to the drop, dragging XRP to lows around $1.92 and shaking the short-term sentiment of many traders. However, several XRP supporters are still of the notion that this move is far from a cause for concern. One of the most vocal is an analyst operating under the name @WillyWonkaXRP on the social media platform X, who insisted that the dip does not alter the long-term trajectory. From his perspective, the current environment is still laying the foundation for a far higher valuation due to institutional takeovers. Crash Below $2 Is Not A Problem The analyst’s evaluation is based on the outlook that XRP is transitioning into a more structurally mature phase, highlighted by regulation, banking partnerships, and expanding utility. He pointed to recent approvals that removed long-standing legal uncertainties and to the growth of Ripple’s enterprise network, which now boasts more than 300 banking partners in over 40 countries. Related Reading: XRP Price Has Surged 15% Anytime This Metric Appeared In The Past The analyst also highlighted the rollout of Ripple’s Liquidity Hub, the expansion of the RLUSD stablecoin, and the rising expectations for additional Spot XRP ETFs. In his view, these developments show that large-scale institutional integration is happening quietly beneath the short-term market noise, making the recent dip to $1.92 insignificant relative to a longer-term path he believes stretches well beyond $20. Speaking of price action, the XRP price fell to as low as $1.88 on November 21, according to CoinGecko. The chart accompanying the analyst’s post illustrates a long multi-year structure in which XRP repeatedly formed broad accumulation ranges before breaking above resistance. The pattern displayed across years shows several failed attempts at the same horizontal ceiling before eventually giving way. The current price action now puts XRP retesting from above. The pullback to the region around $2 corresponds almost exactly with this retest zone, which shows that the price is returning to confirm support rather than a breakdown of the larger trend. What Would It Take For XRP To Reach $20? An XRP price rally to $20 would require a combination of technical follow-through and continued institutional participation. With the current circulating supply hovering around 60 billion tokens, a clean run to $20 would lift XRP’s market capitalization to about US $1.2 trillion. Related Reading: Analyst Claims XRP Price Will Surge To $220 Due To ETFs, But Is This Possible? Technically, XRP would need to maintain its hold above $2.00, as this level now serves as the anchor for any long-term bullish trajectory. Fundamentally, increased ETF inflows, growth of RLUSD, and greater adoption of RippleNet by global financial institutions would strengthen demand for XRP and create the needed buying pressure. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.07, up by 2.4% in the past 24 hours.

The key question now is whether this forced-seller environment is bringing BTC closer to a local bottom — or if deeper volatility is still ahead. This piece is powered by Outset PR , a data-driven crypto PR agency using market intelligence to decode current trends. It analyzes on-chain and derivatives data daily to map market sentiment and guide timing and narrative strategy for its clients. Below is a breakdown of Bitcoin’s current state and price outlook, based on the market signals. BTC Price Drops 31% Paired With a 37% Open Interest Collapse Since early October, Bitcoin has fallen from around $123,000 to $85,839, breaking decisively below its medium-term trend structure. Over the same period, BTC futures open interest (OI) dropped from $46 billion to $29 billion — a steep 37% contraction as per the data from Cryptoquant . When price declines while open interest rises, it often signals the buildup of aggressive short positions. But in this case, both price and OI fell sharply, indicating widespread position unwinding, not an influx of new bearish leverage. In other words, traders didn’t “short the top” — they were forced out as volatility increased and risk appetite evaporated. Long-Term Trend Structure Breaks Down Bitcoin currently near $85,000 trades well below its major trend markers, as the 100-day SMA lies at 109,658, and the 100-day EMA is found at 105,980. Trading 20–28% under these moving averages shows that BTC broke below the trend floor that held for months. Market momentum is firmly bearish until BTC reclaims at least the 100-day EMA. A prolonged distance between price and these moving averages often reflects a market exiting a period of excessive risk-taking and recalibrating around lower volatility and reduced leverage. A Spike in Liquidations Signals Forced Sellers in Control The liquidation heatmap on Coinglass shows that over 110,000 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours. Total liquidations reached $219 million, and the largest single liquidation on BTCUSDT amounted to $1.75 million on Bybit. These figures are sizable but still below the $500M–$1B liquidation spikes seen during true capitulation events. This suggests a controlled but persistent flush of overleveraged positions. Instead of an aggressive wave of shorts, the market is experiencing deleveraging, where longs are liquidated and overall futures exposure declines. This aligns with the fall in open interest and the drop in price. Momentum Indicators Point to Exhaustion, Not Renewal While trend metrics remain bearish, momentum indicators suggest the downside might be entering its late phase. Bitcoin’s RSI (14) sits at 28, marking oversold conditions. Historically, RSI below 30 appears near the end of a strong selling wave. The Momentum (10) indicator at −8,661 reinforces this: sellers remain in control, but the intensity of the move suggests the decline is maturing rather than accelerating. The MACD (12/26) level at −5,942 shows a deeply negative trend, but MACD typically lags RSI. When RSI becomes oversold ahead of MACD flattening, markets often enter a stabilization zone before momentum eventually shifts. What a Late-Stage Deleveraging Phase Means for Bitcoin Taken together, the data describes a very specific market environment: Trend: firmly bearish Momentum: deeply oversold Open interest: wiped out Volume: spiking Liquidations: significant but not extreme This is the textbook profile of a late-stage deleveraging phase — one where forced sellers, not fresh bears, drive the move. Historically, these phases set the stage for stabilization and relief rallies, but rarely mark a final cyclical bottom. Instead, the market seeks equilibrium after leverage is flushed, then forms a base before attempting trend recovery. Where a Potential Bottom Could Form At the moment, Bitcoin has met the criteria for leverage exhaustion, but not yet for trend reversal. Support levels to watch are: 82K–85K: short-term liquidity zone 78K–80K: next structural support Resistance: 92K–95K, then the 100-day EMA near 106K Until BTC reclaims the EMA cluster around 105K, the broader trend remains under pressure.

BTC Price Outlook: Stabilization Likely, Trend Recovery Less Certain Bitcoin’s current condition suggests that: The fastest phase of the downtrend is likely behind A relief bounce becomes increasingly probable as momentum resets The macro trend remains bearish unless BTC reclaims its long-term averages Volatility will remain elevated due to thin liquidity and ongoing repositioning Markets driven by forced liquidations often overshoot on both sides — first down in deleveraging, then up in short-term retracements. For now, Bitcoin is in late-stage deleveraging. The next few days will determine whether BTC stabilizes into a base or whether another wave of volatility emerges before a bottom is found.

Key Takeaways: Bitkub is exploring a Hong Kong IPO after Thailand’s struggling stock market dampened prospects for a domestic listing. The exchange may seek to raise around $200 million, aligning with Hong Kong’s push to attract more global crypto and tech issuers. A move to Hong Kong could provide Bitkub a more supportive regulatory environment as Thailand tightens oversight of its crypto sector. The Bangkok-based exchange, founded in 2018 and one of Thailand’s most prominent crypto platforms, had previously explored listing on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. However, with the Thai market experiencing one of its worst years in recent memory, Bitkub is now looking abroad, according to a Monday report from Bloomberg . Bitkub Eyes $200M Hong Kong IPO as Thai Market Sinks The SET Index has dropped about 10% in 2025, while newly listed companies have delivered an average decline of more than 12%, dampening appetite for domestic IPOs. One source said Bitkub could pursue a Hong Kong listing as early as next year, targeting a raise of roughly $200 million. The discussions remain fluid, and the company has not publicly commented on the matter. Hong Kong has been working to revive its standing in global finance by opening the door to regulated crypto trading. The city has rolled out a formal licensing regime for digital-asset exchanges and is preparing additional rule changes aimed at attracting both retail and institutional players. Despite these efforts, trading volumes remain modest compared to major crypto hubs. New Listing: MON . @monad $MON .

Cryptocurrency and digital tokens involve high… pic.twitter.com/7XV9XCJcrX — Bitkub.com (@BitkubOfficial) November 24, 2025 A Bitkub listing would bolster Hong Kong’s broader campaign to diversify its IPO pipeline beyond Chinese firms. First-time share sales in the city are on track to reach their highest level in four years, with proceeds projected to surpass $40 billion in 2025, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. As regulatory scrutiny and market weakness weigh on crypto activity in Thailand, a Hong Kong IPO may offer Bitkub both a more favorable market environment and greater visibility among international investors. In July, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Bank of Thailand announced plans to launch a regulatory crypto sandbox that will enable foreign tourists to convert their crypto assets into baht for spending locally. Crypto IPOs Gain Momentum Last month, tZero Group, a New York–based blockchain infrastructure firm focused on tokenized securities and real-world assets, announced that it is preparing to go public in 2026 . Before that, BitGo officially filed for an initial public offering , becoming the first dedicated crypto custodian to pursue a listing on a US stock exchange. BitGo’s IPO filing came amid renewed momentum for crypto-related public offerings. The digital asset space has seen several notable public listings in 2025. Stablecoin issuer Circle made a splash with its IPO in June, surging more than sevenfold since going public. Online trading platform Etoro , which offers crypto trading among its services, debuted in May. In addition, Galaxy Digital, led by Mike Novogratz, moved its listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange to Nasdaq earlier this year. Gemini, the exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, filed confidentially for a U.S. IPO in June, signaling strong market confidence in crypto exchanges going public. More recently, Figure Technology Solutions Inc., a blockchain-focused lending platform, raised $787.5 million in its initial public offering .

Despite five years since the tax law’s initial approval in 2020 and three previous delays , authorities have failed to establish critical systems for transaction monitoring, income classification, and cross-border enforcement, raising serious doubts about whether the government can deliver on its latest implementation promise. According to a local report , Kim Kab-lae, a senior researcher at the Capital Market Research Institute, warned that core deficiencies in the taxation framework remain unresolved. “ If the government does nothing during the grace period and faces a fourth delay, trust in the tax system itself will collapse, ” he stated, noting that the possibility of another postponement cannot be ruled out given current conditions. Critical Infrastructure Gaps Threaten 2027 Tax Launch The current Income Tax Act stipulates that income from virtual asset transfers and rentals will be taxed starting in 2027, with a 22% rate applied to annual gains exceeding 2.5 million won. However, definitions and standards for various income sources remain fundamentally unclear, including tax criteria for airdrops , hard forks , mining , staking , and rental income . Eleven months after the last deferral, authorities have not formed public-private task forces, and virtual asset taxation remains absent from the national tax administration plan. Kim specifically highlighted the lack of taxation standards for transactions conducted outside domestic exchanges, encompassing overseas platforms, decentralized services, and peer-to-peer transfers. Regulations regarding non-resident taxation, acquisition price calculations, and tax timing are similarly undefined. The taxation system for rental income remains a blank slate, with no clear criteria for determining whether virtual asset lending and staking constitute taxable transactions. Under current conditions, starting taxation would create unfair enforcement, with domestic exchange users on platforms like Upbit and Bithumb subject to levies while overseas exchange users escape scrutiny. A Ministry of Strategy and Finance official acknowledged, “ Large-scale investments can be tracked, but small transactions by individual investors are still out of reach. ” The government believes proper taxation will only become possible once an international agreement requiring 48 countries to share virtual asset transaction information takes effect in 2027, following South Korea’s official signing of the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework . South Korea will share crypto transactions by non-residents on local exchanges such as Upbit and Bithumb, with countries worldwide. #SouthKorea #CryptoTransaction #SouthKoreaCrypto https://t.co/ZD56JHeM9H — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 2, 2025 Enforcement Actions Intensify Despite Tax Implementation Uncertainty While tax implementation stalls, enforcement around crypto compliance has sharply intensified. The National Tax Service has confiscated more than 146 billion won in crypto from over 14,000 delinquent taxpayers over the past four years, warning that officers can seize cold wallets through home visits if individuals fail to settle outstanding bills. “ We can now monitor a non-compliant taxpayer’s crypto transaction history using tracking programs, and if we suspect they are hiding their coins offline, we can conduct searches at their homes ,” an agency spokesperson explained. Local governments have launched parallel crackdowns, with Cheongju city announcing it seized crypto from 203 residents since 2021 and opened a trading account on a domestic exchange to liquidate confiscated assets directly. South Korea is set to hit major crypto exchanges with new penalties over anti-money laundering failures, signaling a tougher enforcement phase for the industry. #SouthKorea #CryptoAML https://t.co/9r42trYMmE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 24, 2025 Seoul’s Gangnam district has seized 340 million won since late last year, while the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit is preparing a fresh round of sanctions against major exchanges following anti-money laundering inspections at Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and GOPAX. Meanwhile, the Financial Services Commission reported that verified users eligible to trade on domestic exchanges reached 10.77 million in the first half of 2025, approaching the 14.23 million listed stock investors recorded at year-end. Data also shows 78.9 trillion won in crypto has been transferred from domestic exchanges to overseas platforms or individual wallets, suggesting traders may be positioning ahead of potential taxation. Recently, Park Joo-cheol of the Korea Institute of Public Finance also cautioned that lingering ambiguities could trigger legal challenges once taxation begins, urging policymakers to use remaining time to “ clarify key definitions and prepare for international data-sharing challenges .” The post South Korea May Postpone Crypto Tax Again – Here is Why appeared first on Cryptonews .",Crypto Regulation News|crypto tax|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-24 15:35:56

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $757.87, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,249.82 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the current Solana price within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors, driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price action, as indicated by the technical factors and technical analysis. In this article, we’ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230. In October, the decline increased sharply as SOL ended the month below $170.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-24 15:38:06

Available in your brokerage… pic.twitter.com/rAzGrm0M6P — Grayscale (@Grayscale) November 24, 2025 In a press release the firm said the GXRP is structured as an exchange-traded product rather than a 1940-Act ETF, meaning it does not fall under the regulatory requirements or protections offered to registered ETFs and mutual funds. As a result, the product carries substantial risk, including the potential loss of principal. While GXRP holds XRP, it does not provide investors with direct ownership of the token itself. Krista Lynch, Senior Vice President of ETF Capital Markets at Grayscale, describes the launch as a milestone for investors seeking simplified access to XRP. She notes that GXRP aims to provide efficient tracking and straightforward exposure to the asset while expanding investor reach to the wider XRP ecosystem. GXRP initially launched as a private placement in September 2024, and its graduation to public markets reflects increased institutional interest in mature blockchain networks. XRP Ledger Reaches Major Milestone The debut of GXRP comes as the XRP Ledger (XRPL) surpasses 4 billion processed transactions, a testament to the network’s durability and long-term operational reliability. Since its launch in 2012, XRPL has positioned itself as a specialized blockchain designed for cross-border payments and high-throughput financial activity. Although not built for general-purpose smart contract execution, XRPL incorporates several powerful native features, including token issuance capabilities, a built-in decentralized exchange, and support for non-fungible tokens. The Role of XRP in the Network XRP serves as the native digital asset of the XRP Ledger and plays an essential role in maintaining the network’s security and utility. It is required for all transaction fees on the ledger, ensuring spam resistance and predictable execution costs. XRP acts as a highly liquid bridge asset, enabling seamless movement between fiat currencies and facilitating instant settlement for financial institutions and fintech platforms building on XRPL. Its function in real-time liquidity provisioning supports the ledger’s vision of powering scalable global payments. Amplify Launches XRP-Based Option Income ETF Last week, Amplify ETFs has introduced the first XRP-based option income exchange-traded fund, the Amplify XRP 3% Monthly Premium Income ETF (XRPM). The new fund expands Amplify’s YieldSmart family—an options-focused ETF lineup designed to balance income generation with capital appreciation. XRPM offers exposure to XRP’s price dynamics while pursuing high, recurring income through an actively managed covered call strategy. Spot Crypto ETF Launches This Week This week marks one of the busiest periods yet for spot crypto ETF activity, with multiple products slated to debut across major U.S. exchanges. According to the latest filings highlighted by Bloomberg Intelligence, at least five spot ETFs are launching in the next six days, spanning assets such as XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin. There are 5 spot crypto ETFs launching over next 6 days. Beyond that we don't have exact but we expect a steady supply of them (likely over 100 in next six months).

These launches are part of a broader uptick in crypto ETF approvals as issuers push to bring mainstream on-ramps to a wider range of digital assets. Beyond this week’s launches, filings show a strong pipeline extending into early December. Grayscale’s Chainlink Trust (GLNK) is expected to hit the market on December 2, while additional Solana and XRP-related products from Bitwise and Canary continue advancing through the approval process.

This significant development demonstrates the project’s commitment to token value and investor confidence. But what does this Sky token buyback really mean for the ecosystem and token holders? Let’s explore the implications of this strategic decision. What Exactly is a Sky Token Buyback? A Sky token buyback occurs when the project uses its treasury funds to purchase tokens from the open market. This recent transaction involved spending 1.9 million USDS to acquire those 40.5 million SKY tokens. The mechanism works similarly to stock buybacks in traditional finance, but with some unique cryptocurrency characteristics. Essentially, the project is putting its money where its mouth is by investing directly in its own token. This Sky token buyback strategy serves multiple purposes. First, it reduces the circulating supply of tokens. Second, it demonstrates financial strength and confidence in the project’s future. Third, it can potentially increase the value of remaining tokens through basic supply and demand economics. Why is This Sky Token Buyback So Significant? The scale of this Sky token buyback makes it particularly noteworthy. With 40.5 million tokens repurchased in a single week, the project has made a substantial market impact. More importantly, this brings the total Sky token buyback value to an impressive 86 million USDS to date. This consistent buyback pattern suggests a well-planned, long-term strategy rather than a one-time event. Consider these key benefits of the Sky token buyback program: Supply reduction – Fewer tokens in circulation can increase scarcity Price support – Buybacks create consistent buying pressure Investor confidence – Shows management believes in the project’s value Value redistribution – Benefits all remaining token holders How Does This Sky Token Buyback Affect Investors? For current Sky token holders, this buyback represents a vote of confidence from the project itself. When a team commits significant resources to repurchase its own tokens, it signals strong belief in the project’s fundamentals and future growth potential. This Sky token buyback effectively aligns the interests of the development team with those of token holders. However, investors should also consider the broader context. While this Sky token buyback is positive news, it’s crucial to evaluate the project’s overall health, including: Development progress and roadmap execution Community engagement and adoption metrics Market conditions and competitive landscape Sustainability of the buyback program What’s Next After This Major Sky Token Buyback? The consistent pattern of Sky token buyback activity suggests this isn’t a one-off event. With 86 million USDS already deployed in buybacks, the project has established a clear track record of supporting token value. This latest Sky token buyback of 40.5 million tokens reinforces the commitment to this strategy. Looking forward, investors should monitor whether the Sky token buyback program continues at this pace. The project’s ability to sustain these buybacks while maintaining development and operations will be crucial. Additionally, how the market responds to reduced token supply over the long term will determine the ultimate success of this Sky token buyback strategy. The strategic Sky token buyback represents more than just numbers—it’s a statement about the project’s financial health and future direction. By actively managing token supply and demonstrating confidence through substantial financial commitments, Sky is positioning itself as a serious player in the competitive cryptocurrency landscape. This approach could set a precedent for how blockchain projects manage their token economies and build long-term value. Frequently Asked Questions What is a token buyback in cryptocurrency? A token buyback occurs when a project uses its funds to repurchase its own tokens from the market, reducing circulating supply and potentially increasing value for remaining holders. How does the Sky token buyback benefit investors? The Sky token buyback benefits investors by reducing token supply, creating buying pressure, and demonstrating the project’s confidence in its own value proposition. What was the total amount spent on the recent Sky token buyback? The project spent 1.9 million USDS to repurchase 40.5 million SKY tokens in last week’s buyback activity. How much has Sky spent on token buybacks overall? To date, Sky has spent 86 million USDS on token buybacks, showing a consistent commitment to this value-building strategy. Will Sky continue its token buyback program? While future plans depend on various factors, the consistent pattern suggests buybacks are part of Sky’s long-term token strategy. How does a token buyback affect token price? Token buybacks can positively impact price by reducing supply and creating consistent demand, though market conditions and other factors also play significant roles.

Details of ecosystem fund management and utilization will be released in the first transparency report following mainnet launch. The news comes after Pharos Network launched its second testnet, the AtlanticOcean testnet. Pharos Network has officially launched the Pharos Foundation on November 24, 2025, and the non-profit outfit is being positioned to oversee governance and provide stewardship for the upcoming layer 1 blockchain created specifically to deal with RWAs and open finance ecosystems. The foundation was founded by former engineers from Ant Group, is Asia-led, and already a VC sweetheart. The main focus of the Pharos Foundation would be to funnel resources towards the RWAfi initiative and broader open finance tools on Pharos Network, self-described as an inclusive financial layer that ensures accessibility to real value and institutional-grade assets. Pharos Foundation shares plans Pharos Foundation is touted as a support resource for developers building in the RWA space, while promoting the network’s tech stack. To keep things fair and carry members along, the foundation’s decisions will be community-driven with a focus on decentralization and compliance. The foundation will also cover an educational campaign that will feature boot camps and resources with the ultimate aim of strengthening collaboration with traditional financial institutions and expanding open finance research and industry knowledge. However, it stops short of offering investment advice, won’t comment on token prices, or favor any single protocol. Pharos also separated its foundation from its TGE launch campaign. Instead, it will be responsible for providing frameworks, documentation, and transparent processes needed for sustainable token governance and ecosystem development before and after TGE. Details regarding the management and utilization of the ecosystem fund won’t be released until the first transparency report, which is expected to come after the mainnet launch, and will cover grants issued, governance decisions, and fund deployment. Pharos Network’s second testnet is live Pharos Network’s second experimental network, AtlanticOcean Testnet was officially launched on October 21, 2025, marking a significant step in expanding access to real-world asset open finance. AtlanticOcean went live with partners like Morpho Labs, Bitverse, Euclid, and integrations with OKX Wallet, Bitget Wallet, Hemera Explorer, and Goldsky, and enables institutions, builders, and partners to test real-world asset flows across borders. It is the second testnet Pharos has launched so far. The first one went live in May. Since then, it has processed nearly 3 billion transactions across 23 million blocks with a 0.5-second block time, deploying a global validator network, achieving full Ethereum Dencun SPEC compatibility with reliable block replay, and implementing optimizations including parallel execution, enhanced caching, and low-memory node releases. The new testnet builds on those achievements, introducing major upgrades like the official PoS tokenomics model with 1 billion total supply aligned with mainnet, user-friendly staking and validator voting, and an expanded developer toolset for more composable and complex testing scenarios. The testnet activations are to be rolled out in several stages, and to ensure continuity and a smooth transition, the first Testnet will continue to co-exist alongside AtlanticOcean for several months, giving ecosystem partners all the time they need to migrate.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-24 15:48:00

As of the time of writing, the world’s largest fund manager commands $77.4 billion in cryptocurrencies, of which some 87% are in Bitcoin and 13% in Ethereum, according to data retrieved by Finbold from Arkham . BlackRock crypto moves. Source: Arkham The timing of the transfers is notable given that the U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs are witnessing some of the heaviest monthly outflows since their debut. Indeed, the funds have seen approximately $3.5 billion in withdrawals so far this month, the second-largest figure behind only the record $3.6 billion pulled in February this year. BlackRock, which accounts for about 60% of all assets in the category, has alone recorded $2.5 billion in redemptions with the last recorded move. Bitcoin and Ethereum on shaky ground Both Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to face heavy selling pressure as the broader cryptocurrency market extends its ongoing correction, both being in the red at the time of writing and trading at $86,100 and $2,820, respectively. BTC and ETH price. Source: Finbold At the current price, Ethereum is below both its 100-day and 200-day moving averages , currently trading near $2,800. The decline followed several days of consolidation around $3,000, which failed to provide strong support. Similarly, Bitcoin has broken below the critical $88,000–$90,000 support cluster, with a relative strength index ( RSI ) reading of 28 and suggesting the asset is in the “Oversold” territory. Ethereum’s RSI is hovering near oversold territory at around 30, signaling continued bearish momentum. Moreover, Bitcoin open interest has also plummeted to a six-month low, which likely signals upcoming instability and abrupt corrections. Accordingly, the consistent ETF outflows could reflect a shift in investor sentiment in the face of potential further selloffs.

Bitcoin, which fell to as low as $80,000 on Friday, rose above $86,000 today. However, this decline may be temporary, as some analysts have suggested that Bitcoin could correct to around $50,000 next year. Bloomberg Intelligence's senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone said on LinkedIn that Bitcoin's price could fall 60% from its record high of $126,000 next year. At this point, McGlone predicted that Bitcoin could face additional downward pressure next year due to macro uncertainty and rising risk-on asset sentiment, with the price falling to as low as $50,000. “Is Bitcoin $50,000 or $150,000 in 2026? My guess is $50,000, especially if the S&P 500 experiences its third year of decline since 2008. The analyst also added that there is a widespread view in the market that Bitcoin's direction will be redetermined by the year-end FOMC meeting and movements in the stock market. *This is not investment advice.

Investors must deal with the crypto market’s selective attention paradox – do they hold onto weakening legacy assets, or do they allocate capital towards new crypto projects gaining traction? Trading at $134, Solana (SOL) displays the market’s anxiety as it faces a pronounced price correction, while futures open interest is stagnant, testing key support levels. However, while this is the situation for Solana, on the other hand, Mutuum Finance is still in the middle of a successful Presale. This is a tremendous and unmitigated indicative of the type of growth and innovation that any crypto investor would seek. The question is whether to invest in a stalled big player or a smaller, unencumbered and more innovative foundational player? This disparity is the most current and most evident in the crypto market right now. Solana’s Pricing Correction and Broader Economic Factors Solana’s corrective phase when looking at its price shows a 22% fall over the last 2 weeks. This price correction is further impacted by macroeconomic factors such as labor market report delays and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s future interest rate policy. As a result, SOL futures open interest is stagnant around 7.3 billion, representing a major lack of speculation and trader conviction. The asset is now retesting a multi-year ascending trendline. A breach below this level of support may stimulate a deeper correction toward the $100 mark. This level should yield a bounce, and the derivative and sentiment data may dictate such. This situation is forcing investors to look for the best crypto to invest in as their stances change to accommodate the lack of momentum from the major-layer 1’s like Solana. Mutuum Finance Presale: Unmatched Demand While Solana deals with the pressures of the market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already secured its place of dominance, making a solid case of the most attractive crypto investment opportunity. Doing phenomenally well in presale and with a devoted community of over 18,140 holders, and raising over $18.9 million, the project has entered the last stretch of its Phase 6 with the tokens at $0.035. With over 95% of this phase filled, there is a shortage of supply for those looking to buy at $0.035. For these buyers, there is a sense of urgency and the upcoming Phase 7 will raise the price by 20% to $0.040. For investors looking to compare this opportunity with others in the market, the current presale is the most attractive by a large margin when compared to the stagnant or negative price action of large market assets making this undoubtedly the most attractive short-term crypto investment. Simplifying Access with Direct Card Purchases Mutuum Finance has now added the ability to purchase using a debit card with their most recent crypto presale. They now offer a seamless integration with fiat for the purchase of MUTM. Users who have no experience with the crypto swap processes can easily purchase these tokens. Investing has never been easier for everyone. Security as a Foundational Pillar Mutuum Finance has built a robust security infrastructure. Smart Contracts have been audited by the market leader CertiK, which specializes in Smart Contracts Security. With a quality score of 90/100, the external audit confirmed the security of the protocol, as well as a lack of critical weaknesses. Mutuum Finance has built the infrastructure to protect the protocol and users’ funds which allows for a peace of mind for a less risky investment for crypto users. There is significant peace of mind for the users with the operational safety and transparency, and these tools offer a significant risk reduction as opposed to untested and uninspected projects. The Answer Seems Obvious In the current environment, it is easy to see where the strategic allocation of capital should be directed. As Solana looks for a catalyst to change its downtrend, there is a positive growth story from Mutuum Finance with a closing opportunity. The combination of having a strong presale allocation, easy to purchase, and fully trustworthy is matched with a powerful investment thesis. Phase 6 tokens are the last opportunity before an increase in price to $0.04. Mutuum Finance is the best crypto to buy now. The decision is easy.

Buyers pushed the price up several times, but each rise was met with equally strong pullbacks. Overall, the market is lacking a clear trend, keeping DOGE stuck around the $0.145 area. DOGE Price Chart, Source: CoinMarketCap The data shows that Dogecoin whales holding 10 million to 100 million DOGE have significantly reduced their positions over the past month. According to analyst Ali Martinez, these large holders offloaded or redistributed around 7 billion DOGE, a move that aligns closely with the persistent decline in price during the same period. Whale behavior often acts as a leading indicator, and their steady reduction in holdings suggests diminishing confidence or a strategic repositioning ahead of expected market volatility. The chart illustrates how the distribution curve for these whale addresses has been trending downward while DOGE’s price followed a similar trajectory. This synchronized movement typically signals selling pressure coming from the largest wallets, which can weigh on market sentiment and accelerate a bearish trend. As whales reduce exposure, retail participants often react to the selling activity, amplifying downward momentum. Source: X Martinez highlights that such a sharp decline in whale-controlled supply can either indicate profit-taking, risk management, or anticipation of lower prices. While this trend reflects clear short-term weakness, it may also set the stage for a potential stabilization phase once whale distribution slows and new demand emerges. DOGE Shows Early Reversal Signs as MACD Flips Bullish The recent 4-hour Dogecoin price action shows a notable shift in momentum after a prolonged decline. Price had been trending lower under a descending resistance line, reflecting consistent selling pressure. However, DOGE has now begun to rebound from its recent lows, forming a sequence of higher candles that suggests early signs of renewed buyer interest. The short-term trajectory indicates a potential push toward the descending trendline, where the market may test whether sellers still dominate or if buyers can finally break through this structure. Source: X According to Trader Tardigrade, the MACD indicator adds a significant bullish signal to this picture. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line, forming a clear bullish crossover, a classic momentum reversal pattern. This crossover indicates that downward momentum has weakened and buyers are starting to regain control. The histogram shifting from red to green reinforces this improvement in sentiment, suggesting building bullish energy. If this momentum continues, the price could climb toward the highlighted resistance area, making this crossover a pivotal early signal for a potential trend change.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-24 16:01:23

Several chart signals, indicators, and price zones are now under close watch. As of press time, Ripple’s token is trading at $2.06, with a 24-hour trading volume of $4.13 billion. It is up almost 2% in the past 24 hours but down 9% over the past week. EMA Structure Still Intact Analyst Egrag Crypto has pointed out that XRP’s 50 EMA is nearing a cross with the 200 EMA on the 3-day chart. While such a move is often seen as bearish, he argued that conditions do not yet support that view. The asset remains above the 200 EMA, which is still rising. According to Egrag, “This does NOT match a classic bear-market setup.” He compared the current chart to past cycles in 2017 and early 2021, where a similar EMA compression led to a sharp rally. Back then, the price held above key support before strong upward moves followed. He noted that XRP may be in late-stage consolidation rather than a breakdown. Source: Egrag Crypto/X XRP/ETH Chart Builds Strength Furthermore, analyst JD shared a 2-week chart showing the XRP/ETH pair. The chart highlights that the Stochastic RSI is holding above 20 and the RSI line is above its moving average. These were the same conditions that preceded a 12x rally in a previous cycle. “Last time both confirmed, we went from 0.28 to $3.37,” JD wrote. Their chart also shows hidden bullish divergence: the price has formed a higher low while the oscillator shows a lower low. This suggests underlying strength. A horizontal support area remains intact, and the asset is currently holding above that zone. A similar breakout setup remains possible if these signals hold. As CryptoPotato recently reported , the TD Sequential indicator has just flashed a buy signal for XRP. This tool is designed to catch trend reversals or exhaustion. The signal has appeared following a sharp correction, suggesting selling pressure may be fading. In addition, Ali Martinez reports that 1.8 billion XRP were accumulated near the $1.75 zone. This area may now act as support in case of a pullback. On the upside, a large sell wall is located around $2.60, which could serve as a barrier in the near term. Daily and Intraday Action Focus on $2.08 CryptoWZRD noted that XRP’s daily candle closed bullish, with the price holding above $2.08. This level remains key. Holding above it keeps the next target around $2.277 in play. A clean move beyond that could open the path toward $2.75. The launch of Grayscale’s GXRP ETF on NYSE Arca has added new attention to XRP. The move could bring in more liquidity and institutional flow, which may influence future momentum.

54849496,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90537,1764000335,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Egrag Crypto Says XRP Death Cross Is Not a Panic Signal,https://timestabloid.com/egrag-crypto-says-xrp-death-cross-is-not-a-panic-signal/,"XRP’s recent 50/200 EMA cross has sparked alarm, but a closer look suggests this might be consolidation—not capitulation. Analyst Egrag Crypto argues that despite the classic “death cross” noise, the setup aligns more closely with past bullish compression phases than a terminal bear turn. Revisiting the Bear Market Argument Critics say that when the 50 EMA falls below the 200 EMA, it signals a major downturn. But Egrag points out that such a cross only confirms a bear market when the price is already below both EMAs, and momentum is clearly rolling over. That’s not what’s happening now. On the 3‑day chart, XRP remains above the rising 200 EMA. The long EMA is still trending upward, not tilting downward—undermining a traditional bear-market thesis. #XRP – 50/200 EMA Cross: The Real Signal The 3-Day chart shows the 50 EMA approaching the 200 EMA… and many are screaming “bear market.” But the structure tells a very different story 1⃣ Bear Market? Not Confirmed : A true bearish cross only matters when price is… pic.twitter.com/LjyJBdp7ai — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 24, 2025 Learning from Past Cycles: 2017 and Early 2021 Rather than invoking 2018—when the death cross followed a severe breakdown—Egrag draws parallels to 2017 and early 2021. In those phases, XRP displayed tight EMA compression, with the 50 and 200 lines converging while price hovered above the 200 EMA. That compression eventually exploded into massive upward moves. To Egrag, the current structure feels eerily similar: coiled energy rather than a broken-down trend. The Case for Late‑Cycle Consolidation Egrag frames the current price action as a late-cycle consolidation, not a completed top. Consolidation in crypto is a phase of reduced volatility where buyers and sellers reach a temporary equilibrium. During this stage, the price often trades within a confined range with low volume. In other words, the market is pausing to catch its breath before a potential continuation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This consolidation could be forming a neutral or even bullish continuation pattern, similar to a symmetrical triangle. Such patterns signal temporary indecision and often precede strong breakouts. Key Technical Levels to Watch According to Egrag Crypto, the $2.65 zone is critically important. It once acted as support but now serves as resistance. A decisive 3‑day close above that level could validate his bullish thesis. If that breakout occurs, his targets range between $2.85 and $3.44. Conversely, failure to reclaim $2.65 could stretch consolidation or bring renewed pressure. Why This Narrative Matters If Egrag is right, what many call a bearish doom signal may instead be a strategic setup. Rather than signaling capitulation, the 50/200 EMA cross could mark the midpoint of a defined consolidation phase. In that view, the cross is not the end of a cycle—but the calm before a potential final thrust higher. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to a San Francisco police report , the robbery took place around 6:45 a.m. Saturday near 18th and Dolores streets in the Mission Dolores neighborhood. Yesterday a thief posing as a delivery driver in San Francisco stole 11 million dollars in crypto. The fake delivery driver showed the victim a gun before tying them up with duct tape and stealing the crypto. Unclear whether the suspect has been caught yet. pic.twitter.com/UlWiHhrDaO — Beau (@beausecurity) November 23, 2025 Police have not confirmed whether the victim was injured, and no arrests have been announced. Attempts to contact the homeowner listed in public records were unsuccessful. Physical Attacks on Crypto Investors Hit Record Levels, Up 169% in 2025 The incident adds to what experts describe as a rapidly escalating wave of “wrench attacks,” a term used to describe physical assaults, kidnappings, and coercion aimed at forcing crypto holders to reveal passwords or transfer funds. The name comes from a well-known webcomic illustrating that even strong digital security can be defeated with a $5 wrench, as attackers shift from hacking wallets to targeting their owners directly. According to a CryptoNews report in September citing data compiled by Bitcoin security advocate Jameson Lopp, there has been a sharp rise in physical attacks targeting crypto holders, climbing 169% since February , with 48 cases logged in 2025. Physical attacks targeting Bitcoin and crypto holders are rising at an alarming rate, according to CASA co-founder Jameson Lopp. #Crypto #Attack https://t.co/d7lhF9bvvO — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 21, 2025 However, Lopp has now tracked more than 60 wrench-style incidents this year, already 33% higher than the total for 2024. France leads with 14 reported cases, but similar attacks have been documented across North America, Europe, and Australia, highlighting a growing global security concern. Security researchers say the rise coincides with ongoing market strength, which has pushed Bitcoin and other assets higher and made private holders more valuable targets. The attacks have grown more violent, with criminals often using fake delivery uniforms, social engineering, and pre-attack intelligence gathering to identify victims. In some cases, attackers study social media posts, public records, or conference appearances to estimate a person’s crypto wealth. French Police Warn of Coordinated Crime Rings Behind Crypto Kidnappings Similar patterns have emerged in U.S. cities. In New York, an Italian tourist was kidnapped and tortured for more than two weeks as captors attempted to extract his Bitcoin credentials, leading to an internal investigation involving two NYPD officers. Two NYPD officers are on modified duty after reports emerged the two detectives may have possible links to last week's crypto kidnapping. #NYPD #CryptoKidnapping https://t.co/bbUSkcge54 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 30, 2025 In Chicago, six men were charged after allegedly kidnapping four residents and coercing them into transferring $15 million in cryptocurrency. The violence has been most concentrated in France, where coordinated criminal networks repeatedly target entrepreneurs, traders, and their families. In August, a 35-year-old former trader was kidnapped and held captive between Paris and Saint-Germain-en-Laye after his captors failed to extract a €10,000 ransom. He was found wandering home with visible injuries after a call for help reached authorities abroad. Police say the case was the tenth crypto-related kidnapping reported in France in recent months. French crypto trader kidnapped near Paris, released after refusing €10K ransom amid surge in crypto kidnappings. #France #Crypto https://t.co/nQ23fWi6t7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 28, 2025 Beyond physical attacks, crypto holders have also faced a surge in digital theft. A report from security firm CertiK found that investors lost $2.47 billion to hacks, scams, and security breaches in the first half of 2025 alone. Analysts warn that as digital defenses improve, criminals often turn to physical coercion instead, contributing to the rise in wrench attacks. Lopp, who began tracking these incidents after a 2017 SWATing attack targeting him, said the spike is a sign of a shifting security landscape. He noted that rising asset values attract more criminals but added that self-custody tools and best practices have also evolved. He advised crypto users to avoid publicizing their holdings, understand basic operational security, and consider blending self-custody with custodial services depending on personal risk.

The deal, expected to be approved at board meetings on November 26, would mark one of the most significant corporate consolidations in Asia’s digital finance sector. Dunamu’s 10x Profit Advantage Drives New Terms in Naver’s $14.5B Merger Plan According to a local news source , the merger terms indicate that Naver Financial will absorb Dunamu in a KRW 20 trillion ($14.5 billion) equity exchange. Once completed, Upbit would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Naver, placing the country’s dominant crypto trading platform under the umbrella of Korea’s most internationally recognizable tech brand. Analysts say the shift could strengthen the road to a Nasdaq debut as early as 2026 if market conditions stabilize. In updated filings, executives from both firms agreed to raise the exchange ratio to roughly 1:3.3–3.4 in favor of Dunamu, reflecting the crypto company’s stronger financial performance. Dunamu posted KRW 1.186 trillion in operating profit at the end of 2024, nearly ten times Naver Financial’s 103.5 billion won. The revised ratio followed pushback from minority shareholders who argued that earlier proposals undervalued the Upbit operator. Sources familiar with the negotiations described the adjusted terms as necessary to “ensure a smooth integration” and secure approval from all major stakeholder groups. A successful merger would give Naver control of more than 70% of domestic crypto trading volume . Upbit’s grip on the local market has remained firm through 2024 and 2025, reaching as high as 80% during certain months. Data from the Financial Supervisory Service showed that the exchange handled 833 trillion won ($642 billion) in transactions in the first half of 2025 alone, far outpacing rivals Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and GOPAX. Upbit Aligns With 2025’s Crypto IPO Boom With Strong Earnings and Naver Support Despite the dominance, Upbit has previously faced regulatory scrutiny over KYC procedures and broader compliance issues. @Official_Upbit faces billions in fines for over 700,000 KYC violations as South Korea tightens its crypto regulations. #Upbit #FSC https://t.co/SZzYlT4ted — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 18, 2025 A temporary court ruling lifted one of the onboarding restrictions earlier this year, but the exchange has continued to attract attention from Seoul’s financial committees .

The timing also aligns with a renewed wave of crypto companies entering public markets. 2025 produced a series of major IPOs, including Circle , Bullish, Figure Technologies , Gemini , and BitGo , all taking advantage of stronger digital-asset valuations and clearer US policy frameworks. @Grayscale Investments has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) of its Class A common stock with the SEC. #Grayscale #IPO https://t.co/fHITSOanIs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 13, 2025 Stablecoin issuers, custodians, and trading platforms have collectively raised billions as investors pivot toward firms with verifiable revenue and mature governance structures. Galaxy Digital also moved its listing to Nasdaq earlier this year, and Kraken confidentially filed for a 2026 IPO . At the same time, Upbit’s domestic rival Bithumb has accelerated its own path to public markets . The exchange spun off non-core operations in mid-2025 and hired Samsung Securities to lead its planned KOSDAQ listing while also exploring a possible dual listing on Nasdaq. The company’s progress has been aided by the acquittal of its former chairman, a long-running obstacle to its IPO efforts. Upbit’s parent company has posted consistent profitability throughout 2024 and 2025, with Dunamu reporting a $165 million net income in the third quarter of this year, a 300% year-over-year increase. Combined with strong cash flow, expanding user activity, and Naver’s global footprint, analysts say the conditions for a future US IPO are becoming more defined, even if the listing is not on next week’s board agenda.

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index now sits at 12 after reaching 10 on November 21, the lowest reading recorded since the measure was introduced, which underlines how fragile sentiment remains. Bitcoin is trading near recent lows in the mid $80,000 range after falling sharply from levels above 100,000. Liquidations, outflows from some spot products, and concern over global growth keep positioning defensively. Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Source: CoinMarketCap) Within that setting, most large altcoins stay under pressure, yet Canton, SPX6900, and Pump.fun have posted gains, offering a narrow view of where interest still appears during a stressed phase. Canton Tracks Early Dip Buying Interest Canton’s CC token is currently trading around $0.084 , up by about 10% in 24 hours, with stronger turnover than during the most volatile sessions last week. Data points to workable depth on active pairs and activity spread across more than one venue, which indicates the move is not tied to a single isolated trade. The move appears linked to rotation into smaller caps that retained visible communities through the slide. In that context, traders often revisit names that held steady volume during the decline and now trade around defined price zones, allowing participation without excessive slippage even while fear indicators remain elevated. SPX6900 Extends Meme Liquidity Pockets SPX6900 is now trading near $0.51, up by about 5.7% in the past 24 hours, after a week marked by sharp swings. The token stays closely associated with meme speculation and short-term trading flows, and today’s rise fits that pattern, with renewed attention from social feeds and momentum screens. SPX6900 Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Depth in SPX6900 remains thinner than in larger assets, yet volume exceeds that of many meme tokens that faded during the selloff. This suggests a segment of the market still treats SPX6900 as a liquid way to express risk appetite inside the meme space, even while overall conditions across altcoins stay cautious. Pump.fun Holds Bid On Platform Activity Pump.fun’s PUMP is trading near $0.0026 , up by about 3.3% over the past day. While the move appears modest, it stands out given the broader weakness across most coins. Recent session data show continued token launches and trading on the platform, and that activity supports baseline demand for PUMP even when sentiment remains fragile. The link between token movement and platform usage continues to shape how PUMP trades. Participants still engage with the platform to create and exchange meme assets, which gives PUMP a flow tied to ongoing activity rather than purely to short-term price swings. God if you can hear me please let this sunday pump carry into a monday pump and perhaps a monday pump into a tuesday pump and if you're really feeling generous… pic.twitter.com/jFAdi3UMVx — pump.fun (@Pumpfun) November 9, 2025 Reading The Current Environment The slight lift in the fear index from 10 to 12, combined with gains in altcoins like Canton, SPX6900, and Pump.fun, suggests selling pressure has eased marginally, although conditions still reflect strain. Bitcoin remains well below recent highs, liquidity clusters around major pairs, and many altcoins continue to hover near recent lows, which keeps the altcoin season distant. These moves instead show how capital behaves near possible turning points . Flows concentrate first in areas with visible trading venues, active communities, or clear use around specific platforms. If Bitcoin stabilises above its recent troughs and the fear index continues moving away from extreme lows, this pattern could slowly widen into a more balanced rotation across altcoins. If macro concerns deepen again or spot flows weaken, recent gains in Canton, SPX6900, and Pump.fun may represent only a pause within a longer corrective stretch rather than the start of a sustained shift in market tone.

While some users on social media have labeled this as “FUD,” the bank’s recent decisions have triggered a new “debanking” debate in the crypto community. Allegedly, a large number of users are flocking to the bank to close their accounts after JPMorgan's attitude towards the Bitcoin ecosystem, the attacks on Strategy, and the recent data leak. Strike CEO Jack Mallers announced last month that JPMorgan Chase had closed his personal bank accounts without providing any specific explanation. In a post on X, Mallers wrote, “Last month, JPMorgan Chase kicked me out of the bank. Even though my father was a private customer for over 30 years.” The only response given to Mallers was reportedly, “We're not allowed to tell you.” The CEO explained that the bank letter, which he shared and said he had framed, stated that “concerning activity” had been detected in his account. The letter also stated that the bank may not open new accounts in the future due to the security of the financial system and regulatory compliance. Following the post, allegations surfaced on social media that crypto-friendly CEOs and companies are being systematically excluded from banking services in the US. Some users argued that the so-called “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” is still ongoing despite the change in management. Related News: Bloomberg Analyst Mike McGlone Announces New Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction! “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” was the name given to allegations that Biden-era regulators were discouraging banks from working with crypto businesses. However, in August, President Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions on institutions that excluded crypto companies from the banking system. In July, Trump's Digital Asset Markets Task Force declared the operation “completely terminated.” Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino responded to Mallers by saying, “This is for the best in the long run.” He also added in a separate post, “Bitcoin will endure over time. Institutions that try to destroy it will crumble to dust.” Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis harshly criticized JPMorgan, saying, “Kicking out Bitcoin users from banks undermines trust in the traditional financial system. It's time to end Operation Chokepoint 2.0 for good. America should be the capital of digital assets.” The bank hasn't issued a comprehensive statement on the matter. JPMorgan has previously argued in similar cases that anti-money laundering and compliance requirements could impact customer account reviews. However, the cryptocurrency community claims this is a covert “political stance.” *This is not investment advice.

James Check, founder of Checkonchain, said on Monday that Bitcoin faces a consensus challenge that could ultimately determine the fate of millions of coins that have remained untouched for years. Analyst Warns Bitcoin’s Dormant Supply Faces Highest Risk in Quantum Era In a post on X, Check argued that there is “no chance” the Bitcoin community will reach an agreement to freeze coins that are not migrated to quantum-resistant addresses. You allow the old coins to come back to market. Since there is no chance we come to consensus to freeze them, focus on the tech side of quantum safe wallets, and let the market sort out the rest. https://t.co/7xOZRVYl5r — _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) November 23, 2025 He said development politics and the network’s decentralized governance structure make rapid coordination nearly impossible, leaving old coins vulnerable. According to BitBo data , 32.4% of all Bitcoin has not moved in the past five years, while 16.8% has remained dormant for more than a decade. Source: BitBo How much of this supply is lost, inaccessible, or simply being held long-term remains unresolved, but Check warned that these unmoved coins would be the first targets if quantum computers crack Bitcoin’s current signature schemes. Check’s comments were made in response to Delphi Digital’s Ceteris Paribus, who noted that Bitcoin’s quantum problem is “not technological” and that post-quantum versions of Bitcoin will be feasible. i think a lot of confusion on quantum and btc is that everyone frames it as a tech problem, but what makes the problem specifically unique to btc is that the tech problem is secondary quantum resistant bitcoin will be feasible but it doesn't solve what you do with the old coins — ceteris (@ceterispar1bus) November 23, 2025 The unresolved issue, he said, is what happens to the vast reserves kept in non-quantum-resistant formats. Bitcoin currently relies on elliptic curve cryptography via ECDSA and Schnorr signatures, both of which are vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm once a sufficiently advanced quantum machine is built. While the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology has already approved several quantum-resistant signature schemes, including those referenced in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 360, adopting such standards requires community-wide agreement. The underlying threat has been a point of growing discussion across the industry, fueled by concerns that emerging quantum hardware could rapidly narrow the timeline for a workable quantum attack. Quantum machines today have roughly 1,000 physical qubits, but major technology firms, including IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, have announced initiatives intended to reach hundreds of thousands or even millions of qubits within the next decade. Governments and Institutions Adjust Strategies as Quantum Threat Warnings Grow Some researchers now estimate that specialized machines with around 126,000 physical qubits could break the elliptic curve signatures that secure Bitcoin wallets. Others project that around 2,300 logical qubits could be enough to break Bitcoin’s encryption, potentially placing a workable attack window within the late 2020s or early 2030s. Cybersecurity specialists warn that adversaries may already be preparing for future breakthroughs using “harvest now, decrypt later” strategies, collecting data from public blockchains today in anticipation of later quantum advances. Naoris Protocol CEO David Carvalho said this risk makes older address formats especially vulnerable, noting that roughly 6–7 million BTC are stored in address types that expose public keys directly. Some governments and institutions have begun adjusting their practices in response to these warnings. In September, El Salvador split its 6,284 BTC national reserve across 14 addresses to reduce exposure to potential quantum attacks. Major financial firms have also acknowledged the risk. El Salvador fortified its treasury by splitting its $682M BTC holdings into 14 separate addresses to guard against quantum computing threats. #Bitcoin #ElSalvador https://t.co/pSeC02I2Fm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 1, 2025 BlackRock mentioned quantum threats in Bitcoin ETF filings, and Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino recently cautioned about long-inactive wallets . Despite the growing concerns, not all experts believe the threat is imminent. Blockstream CEO Adam Back said last week that quantum attacks are unlikely for at least two to four decades , arguing that today’s machines are far too noisy and require heavy error correction. Cryptographer Adam Back ( @adam3us ) says Bitcoin faces no quantum computing threat for 20–40 years, citing NIST post-quantum standards and current qubit limits. #Bitcoin #QuantumComputing https://t.co/in43NwGIb2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 17, 2025 He pointed out that Bitcoin could adopt post-quantum standards long before a machine capable of breaking SHA-256 becomes viable. The debate mirrors a broad divide in the industry over how quickly Bitcoin must act.

54851886,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90575,1764004845,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Godex.io and the No KYC Crypto Exchange Movement: Privacy Without the Pain,https://timestabloid.com/godex-io-and-the-no-kyc-crypto-exchange-movement-privacy/,"Over the last few years, crypto has split into two distinct experiences. On one side are heavyweight custodial platforms that behave like banks: you open an account, pass full KYC, and trust them with both your coins and your identity. On the other side is a quieter but rapidly growing ecosystem built around the no KYC crypto exchange model—wallet‑to‑wallet swaps, no accounts, and no paperwork. Godex.io sits firmly in this second camp. For traders who want to stay agile, anonymous, and in full control of their assets, Godex.io offers a simple answer: swap crypto without ever being asked who you are. What Defines a No KYC Crypto Exchange? A no KYC crypto exchange is a platform that lets you exchange one cryptocurrency for another without: Creating an account or password. Uploading ID documents or proof of address. Completing identity interviews or “source of funds” forms. Being split into tiers based on verification level. Instead, the platform interacts only with your wallets. You send coins from an address you own, and you receive coins at another address you own. In this model, the service is a routing engine—never a long‑term custodian or identity gatekeeper. Godex.io is designed exactly this way. The key interaction is a swap form, not a user profile. You choose a pair, specify your receiving address, send your input coins to a one‑time deposit address, and wait for the swap to complete. Once it does, your new coins arrive directly in your wallet. How Godex.io Works Under the Hood Although Godex.io keeps the user experience simple, there is a clear logic to the flow: Pair selection – You pick a “send” and “receive” asset from a large list of supported cryptocurrencies. Rate and amount – The platform shows you how much of the target asset you will receive, subject to a time‑limited quote. Receiving address – You enter the wallet address where you want to get your new coins. Deposit address – Godex.io generates a unique deposit address for your chosen pair and amount. On‑chain confirmation – You send your coins to that address. Once the transaction confirms on-chain, the service performs the swap and sends the output to your receiving wallet. At no point does the process require registration, logins, or identity checks. That’s what makes Godex.io a clean example of a no KYC crypto exchange. Why Traders Are Choosing Godex.io 1. Privacy as a Default Setting Every time you complete KYC on a traditional exchange, you create another copy of your identity data: ID scans, photos, signatures, and sometimes even bank statements. If that exchange is hacked or mishandles its security, you are the one who pays the long‑term price. Godex.io avoids this problem by never collecting such data. As a no KYC crypto exchange, it cannot leak what it never stores. Your activity is tied to wallet addresses and transaction hashes—not to a full personal dossier. 2. Non‑Custodial Security With custodial exchanges, you have to trust that the platform: Will not lose your coins. Will not freeze your withdrawals. Will not change rules overnight. Godex.io minimizes that trust requirement. Because it does not run user balance accounts, your funds remain in your custody except briefly during each swap. When the exchange is finished, everything is back in your wallets. This non‑custodial design lowers the systemic risk for anyone who has watched high‑profile exchange failures unfold. 3. Simplicity and Speed Time matters in crypto. Markets move, spreads change, and arbitrage windows open and close fast. A no KYC crypto exchange like Godex.io removes the onboarding delay entirely: No account to set up. No waiting for manual document review. No extra steps just to unlock higher limits. From first visit to initiating a swap, the only limitations are how quickly you confirm details and how fast your transaction is mined. 4. Broad Asset Coverage Many “instant” services that skip KYC support only a handful of currencies, forcing active users to juggle multiple platforms. Godex.io supports hundreds of cryptocurrencies and thousands of trading pairs, including majors, stablecoins, and numerous altcoins. That breadth allows you to: Rebalance a complex portfolio without bouncing between different exchanges. Move value across ecosystems in a few steps. Integrate Godex.io as a single routing layer in your tool stack. When a No KYC Crypto Exchange Makes Sense A service like Godex.io is especially useful when you: Already hold crypto in self‑custody and want to mix, hedge, or diversify without dragging funds through a new centralized account. Live in a region with restrictive banking or ID rules and need wallet‑based tools that don’t discriminate by passport. Care about operational security, preferring not to upload KYC documents to multiple third‑party databases. Need flexibility across chains and tokens for DeFi, payments, or tactical trading strategies. It is not a fiat on‑ramp or a tax solution, but it excels as the private middle layer between those edges. Best Practices for Using Godex.io Safely Even with a well‑designed no KYC crypto exchange, safety depends heavily on user actions: Verify addresses and networks carefully. Confirm both the deposit and receiving addresses, and ensure you’re on the correct chain. Use small test amounts first. On a new pair or network, start with a small swap to validate the route and timing. Keep your keys offline. Use hardware wallets where possible and never enter seed phrases into any browser or app. Observe the timing window. If you are given a fixed‑rate quote, send your deposit within the specified time to avoid re‑pricing. Stay compliant locally. Privacy at the exchange level doesn’t remove your obligation to follow tax and reporting rules in your jurisdiction. Godex.io in a Modern Crypto Toolkit For many users, the optimal setup looks like this: A regulated fiat gateway (with KYC) for moving between bank money and crypto when absolutely necessary. Secure self‑custody wallets for storing and spending coins. Godex.io as the no KYC crypto exchange in the middle, handling most asset‑to‑asset and chain‑to‑chain swaps privately and efficiently. In this configuration, your exposure to centralized data collection is minimized, while your ability to move, hedge, and rebalance on‑chain remains high. Closing Thoughts As regulators increase pressure on centralized platforms, privacy‑respecting infrastructure has become more than a “nice to have”—it is a strategic necessity for many crypto users. Godex.io, as a dedicated no KYC crypto exchange, provides a clear answer to that need: anonymous, non‑custodial swaps across a wide range of coins, delivered through a simple, wallet‑first interface. For anyone building a crypto stack around autonomy and low friction, Godex.io is a natural fit—restoring some of the original spirit of digital cash in an ecosystem that is otherwise looking more and more like traditional finance.

The Grayscale LINK ETF, officially designated as GLNK, is scheduled to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on December 2nd. This development represents a significant milestone for both Chainlink enthusiasts and the broader crypto market. Why Is the Grayscale LINK ETF Launch So Important? Chainlink community manager Zach Rynes confirmed the December 2nd listing date, sending waves of excitement through the crypto community. The Grayscale LINK ETF provides traditional investors with regulated exposure to LINK tokens without the technical complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. This eliminates several barriers that have previously kept institutional money on the sidelines. The timing couldn’t be more strategic. As regulatory clarity improves and institutional interest grows, the Grayscale LINK ETF arrives as a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized technology. Investors now have a familiar vehicle to participate in Chainlink’s oracle network growth. What Benefits Does the Grayscale LINK ETF Offer? The introduction of the Grayscale LINK ETF brings multiple advantages to different types of investors. For traditional institutions, it offers regulatory compliance and familiar trading mechanisms. Meanwhile, retail investors benefit from simplified access to Chainlink’s ecosystem. Regulatory compliance – Traded on established exchanges with full oversight Simplified access – No need for cryptocurrency wallets or private keys Liquidity advantages – Easy entry and exit through traditional brokerage accounts Tax reporting simplicity – Standard investment documentation Moreover, the Grayscale LINK ETF signals growing mainstream acceptance of oracle networks and their critical role in blockchain infrastructure. This validation could accelerate adoption across multiple industries. How Will This Impact the Broader Cryptocurrency Market? The successful launch of the Grayscale LINK ETF could pave the way for similar products tracking other prominent cryptocurrencies. Institutional investors often prefer regulated vehicles, and this ETF provides exactly that framework. As more traditional capital flows into the space through products like the Grayscale LINK ETF, we may see increased market stability and reduced volatility. Chainlink’s position as a critical blockchain infrastructure provider makes this development particularly significant. The network’s oracle services power countless DeFi applications and smart contracts, meaning institutional investment in LINK through the Grayscale LINK ETF indirectly supports the entire decentralized ecosystem. What Should Potential Investors Consider? Before diving into the Grayscale LINK ETF, investors should understand both the opportunities and considerations. While the ETF structure provides convenience, it also involves management fees that don’t apply to direct cryptocurrency ownership. Additionally, ETF performance may not perfectly mirror spot LINK prices due to various market factors. Management fees – Understand the cost structure compared to direct ownership Tracking difference – ETF price may deviate from underlying asset value Regulatory developments – Stay informed about changing cryptocurrency regulations Market timing – Consider dollar-cost averaging versus lump-sum investments The Grayscale LINK ETF represents more than just another investment product—it’s a validation of blockchain technology’s growing institutional relevance. As December 2nd approaches, market participants should monitor volume and price action closely for insights into broader cryptocurrency adoption trends. Frequently Asked Questions What is the ticker symbol for the Grayscale LINK ETF? The Grayscale LINK ETF will trade under the ticker symbol GLNK on the New York Stock Exchange. Can I buy the Grayscale LINK ETF through my regular brokerage account? Yes, once listed on December 2nd, you can purchase GLNK shares through any brokerage platform that offers NYSE trading. How does the Grayscale LINK ETF differ from buying LINK tokens directly? The ETF provides exposure to LINK price movements without requiring cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, or private key management, making it accessible to traditional investors. What are the management fees for the Grayscale LINK ETF? While exact fee structures haven’t been publicly detailed, Grayscale typically charges annual management fees between 1-3% for their cryptocurrency investment products. Will the Grayscale LINK ETF pay dividends? Cryptocurrency ETFs generally don’t pay dividends since the underlying assets don’t generate traditional income streams like dividend stocks. Is the Grayscale LINK ETF available to international investors? Initially, the ETF will likely be available primarily to U.S. investors, though international availability may expand over time through different share classes.

54852083,https://cryptonews.com/?p=455687,1764005220,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54852083.jpeg,ECB Warns Stablecoins Are Rising Fast With Spillover Risks,https://cryptonews.com/news/ecb-warns-stablecoins-are-rising-fast-with-spillover-risks/,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has warned that the rapid expansion of stablecoins—despite their still-limited footprint in the euro area—poses emerging financial-stability risks, especially as interlinkages with global markets deepen. Do stablecoins make Europe less financially stable? They can cause volatility if their values sharply deviate from underlying asset prices or if investors withdraw funds rapidly. Read our Financial Stability Review to find out how regulation can help. — European Central Bank (@ecb) November 24, 2025 The findings come from the ECB report Stablecoins on the rise: still small in the euro area, but spillover risks loom, prepared by Senne Aerts, Claudia Lambert, and Elisa Reinhold, which examines structural vulnerabilities, use cases, and cross-border risks tied to the accelerating stablecoin ecosystem. Stablecoin Market Hits $280 Billion, Dominated by USDT and USDC According to the authors, the combined market capitalisation of all stablecoins has surged past $280 billion, reaching an all-time high and accounting for roughly 8% of the total crypto-asset market. Two U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins dominate overwhelmingly: Tether (USDT) with $184 billion and USDC with $75 billion. By contrast, euro-denominated stablecoins remain negligible at only €395 million, showing the extreme currency imbalance in the market. The ECB attributes the demand surge partly to global regulatory clarity, including the EU’s recent implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the GENIUS Act. Crypto Trading Remains the Primary Use Case The ECB report stresses that today’s stablecoin market is overwhelmingly driven by trading activity rather than real-world payments. Around 80% of trading activity on centralised crypto exchanges involves stablecoins, showing their role as the core settlement asset in crypto finance. While stablecoins are often cited as tools for cross-border payments or stores of value in high-inflation economies, the ECB notes limited evidence of broad consumer use. Only 0.5% of stablecoin volumes appear to be organic retail transactions, suggesting real-world adoption remains minimal. De-Pegging, Runs, and Treasury-Market Spillovers Show Key Risks The authors warn that stablecoins face major structural vulnerabilities, with de-pegging events and redemption runs posing the most immediate threats. Because leading stablecoins are backed by large reserves of traditional financial assets—primarily U.S. Treasury bills—their growth has tied them directly to global financial markets. Both USDT and USDC now rank among the largest holders of U.S. Treasuries, with reserve portfolios comparable in scale to the world’s top 20 money market funds. A sudden run could trigger fire sales of U.S. treasuries, potentially disrupting the functioning of the world’s most important funding market. The report notes that if stablecoin supply continues growing at its current pace, market capitalisation could approach $2 trillion by 2028, amplifying spillover risks—especially given the extreme concentration, with just two issuers controlling about 90% of supply. Regulatory Arbitrage Remains a Major Concern Despite MiCA’s strict framework in the EU, global inconsistencies create opportunities for cross-border regulatory arbitrage. The ECB shows the risk of multi-jurisdiction issuance of fungible tokens, which could leave EU-regulated issuers under-reserved relative to global redemption demands. The authors conclude that while stablecoins remain small in the euro area, rapid international growth—and deepening ties to traditional markets—justify close monitoring. They call for global regulatory alignment, consistent with the G20 roadmap and Financial Stability Board recommendations, to mitigate cross-market contagion risks.

Founder, Firas Isa, and the company have pleaded not guilty. Crypto Dispensers and Its CEO Indicted in Alleged $10 Million Money-Laundering Conspiracy Chicago-based Bitcoin ATM operator Crypto Dispensers is considering a sale valued at approximately $100 million, days after federal prosecutors charged the firm and its founder, Firas Isa, in connection with an alleged $10 million money-laundering conspiracy. In a press release announcing the review, the company said that it is “evaluating a potential sale at approximately $100 million” and has “retained advisors to support the review as consolidation accelerates across the cash-to-crypto and digital asset infrastructure sector.” On November 18, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it filed an indictment against the company and Isa, alleging that he accepted at least $10 million in criminal proceeds and transferred the money into digital wallets to obscure their origins. Both the company and Isa face one count of money laundering conspiracy, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison. In a press release, the U.S Attorney’s Office, Northern District of Illinois, said: “An indictment unsealed in the Northern District of Illinois alleges that criminals and, in some instances, fraud victims, sent at least $10 million in proceeds from wire fraud and narcotics offenses to Crypto Dispensers, Isa, or a co-conspirator. After the proceeds were sent, Isa converted or caused to be converted the cryptocurrency and thereafter transferred the cryptocurrency to virtual wallets to disguise the true source and ownership of the proceeds.” The press release further alleges that Isa knew the funds were derived from fraudulent activity. Isa and Crypto Dispensers have pleaded not guilty to the charges, and a status hearing in federal court in Chicago is scheduled for January 30, 2026. The Future of Crypto Dispensers Founded in 2017, Crypto Dispensers initially deployed hardware-based Bitcoin ATMs in high-traffic retail locations. In 2020, the company shifted its focus to software infrastructure and became the first Bitcoin ATM operator in the U.S. “to secure partnerships with major regulated and publicly traded financial institutions that enable in-store cash deposits at retail registers.” The company has since expanded internationally and is preparing to provide cross-border cash-to-crypto access in Latin America through established agreements. In the press statement, Isa reflected on the company’s evolution and future direction: “From day one our mission was simple. Build a safer and more accessible way for ordinary people to get Bitcoin. Hardware showed us the ceiling. Software showed us the scale. We built the infrastructure, the compliance controls, and the partnerships that allow people to buy Bitcoin with the same payment methods they use in their daily lives. This review is about understanding the next stage of growth and determining which path creates the most value for the platform we have built.” Crypto Dispensers said its strategic review is underway, stating that it may operate independently depending on the outcome. It also emphasised that there is no guarantee that any transaction will result from the process. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Noting, however, that BTC has fallen below significant points of structure, market analysts recognize that this has created market uncertainty, influencing short-term plans by market participants, particularly with rising overall market volatility. But as Bitcoin readjusts and readapts to its new market, focus has quickly shifted towards new market contenders seeking to become leaders of the next overall market cycle. And at the forefront of all of this market activity is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is quickly reaching a significant milestone with its V1 protocol launch imminent, with its Phase 6 presale reaching 95% sold out, making it the top crypto to watch. Bitcoin Bounce Yet to Find Confirmation as Key Resistance Level Unbreached Bitcoin saw a small resurgence after falling below $90,000, with support emerging at $88,700 as a ripple of optimism created by Nvidia’s earnings statement gave markets a temporary boost. Although this resurgence may seem positive at first, it has been questioned by market analysts, with BTC having if not surpassed any crucial points of resistance, specifically $97,300, to solidify that such a change is in effect. This recent resurgence can be better characterized as a response to over-correction rather than an actual reversal, with market participants entering with caution and simultaneously conceding that there is as of yet no actual indication to support full-fledged belief. The markets’ momentum is inconclusive, and Bitcoin has not yet touched actual support points at $85,000, keeping potential pitfalls open. Mutuum Contracts Undergoing Independent Audit Currently, an independent audit is being conducted regarding Mutuum’s lending and borrowing contracts to check their security and integrity. The final code is thoroughly reviewed by Halborn Security as part of an audit process. This review is aimed at ensuring that all contracts are functioning as planned and with optimal system integrity and user asset security. Updates regarding the progress of this audit will be shared and arrangements regarding the testnet schedule will be confirmed after completing this review. Mutuum Finance continues to solidify its standing as a top crypto in the DeFi space. MUTM Presale Phase 6, A Critical Opportunity for Strategic Investors Mutuum Finance is quickly making its presence felt as one of the next big crypto projects in the DeFi sector, with its presale already in its 6th phase and reaching its end. No fewer than 95% of its tokens in Phase 6 have already been sold at $0.035, which is the last stage before entering Phase 7, with its price rising to $0.04. The presale has seen over 18,140 participants raise $19 million. Mutuum Finance, however, is not your run-of-the-mill cryptocurrency platform, and its application of advanced technology, together with its solid DeFi credit infrastructure, has made MUTM one of the top crypto projects with potential to hit above $1. For new market entrants, MUTM is one of those rare investments that present value potential at market entry, with its usage in DeFi making it one of the next big crypto to watch in 2025. Sepolia Testnet Launch: Full Lending and Borrowing Functionality One of the significant events awaiting the platform is the launching of Mutuum Finance’s lending and borrowing protocol at the Sepolia testnet, which will take place in Q4 of 2025. This marks the first full-scale operational test of this platform, allowing users to lock either collateral in ETH or in USD and borrow against it. The testnet will also enable optimal development of key features such as risk management systems, dynamic interest rate functions, and loan processing systems, allowing MUTM to be established on a secure, efficient, and reliable platform prior to launching mainnet. This move further cemented MUTM’s identity as a cryptocurrency with utility and a scalable DeFi ecosystem. While Bitcoin struggles at $90,000, Mutuum Finance, or MUTM, is making waves. Mutuum Finance has surpassed 95%+ sales in Phase 6, raising $18.9M with 18,140 supporters at $0.035, with Phase 7 pegged at $0.04. MUTM offers not only DeFi, with its heavily widely-used, audited lending protocol, but also all the right connections with its impending Sepolia testnet, solidifying its status as the top crypto and the next big crypto to watch.

According to today’s, November 24, official announcement, the investment will back Ondo’s OUSG tokenized fund and diversify yield sources backing it. Indeed, adding YLDS magnified OUSG’s yield base as the new stablecoin joins assets issued by leading managers, including BlackRock’s BUILD, WisdomTree’s WTGXX, and Fidelity’s FDIT. The X post reads: The addition of YLDS will enhance and diversify the yield source supporting OUSG, building on a portfolio invested in funds from leading asset managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, FundBridge Capital, and more.

The fund is currently managing more than $1.8 billion in TVL (total value locked). Notably, Ondo’s fund offers things hardly accessible in traditional finance, including daily interest accrual, instant redemptions and subscriptions, competitive fees, and multi-chain compatibility. Now, OUSG gains more stability with YLDS. The move represents a strategic move toward complementing (not replacing) traditional players with blockchain-based monetary tools that promise efficiency and top-notch speed. YLDS stablecoin represents a massive boost to OUSG’s status as the leading on-chain product for enterprise-grade investors Commenting on their latest allocation, Ondo Finance president Ian De Bode stated : Figure has built a robust infrastructure for tokenized lending, and integrating $YLDS into OUSG’s yield strategy further diversifies and institutionalizes the ecosystem supporting our products. We’re excited to deepen our partnership as we work together to expand our products and serve institutions on-chain. The broader picture The alliance merges two giants. Figure has attracted attention with its dominance on the Provenance blockchain, where it boasts $19 billion worth of on-chain lending. Meanwhile, Ondo Finance continues to rule real-world assets and tokenized treasuries, with its current TVL above $1.8 billion (DeFiLlama data ). Source – DeFiLlama Thus, the $25 million commitment is beyond a usual monetary move. It reflects a strategic connection that aims to revolutionize on-chain finance. The investment will enrich Figure’s ecosystem while enriching YLDS’s status as collateral in the Decentralized Prime lending marketplace. What’s more interesting is that the collaboration comes after Figure’s latest IPO, which marked a breakthrough in the firm’s vision to revolutionize capital markets. Figure Technology CEO Michael Tannenbaum says: As both a partner and investor, I see firsthand the authenticity and alignment driving this collaboration. Building on the momentum of our IPO, the exciting Ondo investment is another step toward delivering on that vision. ONDO price outlook The alt saw a minor uptick after the partnership announcement. ONDO is changing hands at $0.4853, with an over 2% increase on its 24-hour price chart.

Deutsche Bank Explains,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-did-bitcoin-actually-fall-deutsche-bank-explains/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen more than 30% from last month's peak, marking its worst week since February. Deutsche Bank analysts cite five key factors behind the decline. The first reason, according to analysts, is the “risk-off” trend in global markets. Bitcoin has been acting more like high-growth tech stocks in recent weeks than as a standalone store of value, and it's showing a strong correlation with the Nasdaq-100 index. The second factor is the Fed's monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell created hawkish market expectations by stating in December that a rate cut wasn't guaranteed. Although New York Fed President John Williams struck a more subdued tone, uncertainty persists. Related News: How Low Could Bitcoin Go? Analyst Lists the Possibilities A third factor is regulatory stagnation. Progress on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act has slowed in the US Senate, leading institutional investors to exercise caution. The fourth factor, according to Deutsche Bank, is institutional fund outflows. Large investors' position reductions are putting additional selling pressure on the market. Finally, the shift towards profit-taking by long-term Bitcoin holders is also among the primary drivers of the decline. Bitcoin traded around $86,000 today after a brief recovery over the weekend, closing at $84,535 on Friday. Analysts warn that volatility could persist in the short term. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Why Did Bitcoin Actually Fall?

According to SwanDesk reports, the Changpeng Zhao lawsuit claims he allegedly facilitated over $900 million in financing for Hamas and other terrorist organizations. This development sends shockwaves through the crypto industry and raises serious questions about regulatory compliance. What does the Changpeng Zhao lawsuit actually allege? The civil Changpeng Zhao lawsuit represents one of the most significant legal actions against a crypto industry leader. Court documents suggest that through Binance’s platform, substantial funds flowed to groups designated as terrorist organizations. However, it’s crucial to note this is a civil case rather than criminal prosecution. The distinction matters because civil cases have different burden of proof requirements and potential consequences. Legal experts highlight several key aspects of this Changpeng Zhao lawsuit : Civil nature means no immediate criminal charges $900 million figure represents alleged transaction volume Multiple terrorist organizations reportedly involved Potential implications for entire crypto industry How will this Changpeng Zhao lawsuit impact cryptocurrency regulation? This Changpeng Zhao lawsuit comes at a critical time for cryptocurrency regulation worldwide. Regulatory bodies have been increasing scrutiny on crypto exchanges, particularly regarding anti-money laundering protocols. The allegations, if proven, could accelerate regulatory crackdowns and stricter compliance requirements across the industry. The timing of this Changpeng Zhao lawsuit is particularly significant because: Global regulators are already examining crypto compliance Previous Binance settlements have set precedents Industry-wide KYC/AML practices face renewed scrutiny Investor confidence may be affected temporarily What are the potential consequences of this legal action? The Changpeng Zhao lawsuit could have far-reaching implications beyond just the individuals and organizations directly involved. Civil lawsuits of this magnitude often trigger regulatory reviews and can influence policy decisions. Moreover, the outcome could set important precedents for how cryptocurrency platforms are held accountable for transactions processed through their systems. Industry observers are watching several key areas: Potential financial penalties and settlements Impact on Binance’s operational capabilities Changes to industry-wide compliance standards Long-term effects on crypto adoption and trust Why should cryptocurrency users pay attention to this development? This Changpeng Zhao lawsuit matters to everyone in the cryptocurrency space, not just industry leaders. The case highlights the ongoing tension between crypto’s decentralized nature and regulatory requirements. As the industry matures, legal frameworks continue to evolve, and this case represents a significant milestone in that evolution. The broader implications include: Increased regulatory clarity for all market participants Potential changes to transaction monitoring requirements Enhanced security and compliance measures industry-wide Greater institutional confidence with proper oversight What’s next in the Changpeng Zhao lawsuit? As the Changpeng Zhao lawsuit progresses through the legal system, several developments are worth monitoring. Legal experts suggest the case could take months or even years to resolve, with potential for settlements, dismissals, or courtroom battles. The cryptocurrency community should prepare for ongoing news and analysis as facts emerge and legal strategies unfold. Looking ahead, the Changpeng Zhao lawsuit serves as a stark reminder that cryptocurrency operates within existing legal frameworks. While the technology promises innovation and financial freedom, it must still navigate complex regulatory landscapes. This case will likely influence how crypto businesses approach compliance and risk management for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions Is Changpeng Zhao facing criminal charges? No, the current lawsuit is civil in nature, meaning it involves financial damages rather than criminal penalties. However, civil cases can sometimes lead to criminal investigations. How does this affect Binance users? For most Binance users, daily operations continue normally. However, the case may lead to enhanced compliance measures and potentially affect the platform’s reputation. What organizations are involved in the allegations? The lawsuit specifically mentions Hamas among other designated terrorist organizations, though complete details may emerge as the case progresses. Has Changpeng Zhao responded to the allegations? As of publication, formal responses are likely being prepared by legal teams. Previous similar cases have seen vigorous defense from Zhao’s representatives. Could this lawsuit affect cryptocurrency prices? While major legal actions can cause market volatility, the long-term impact depends on the outcome and broader regulatory responses. What does this mean for crypto regulation? This case highlights increasing regulatory scrutiny and may accelerate the development of clearer compliance frameworks for cryptocurrency exchanges.

Many have weighed in, and a majority seem to be convinced that only one of two things will happen: BTC rebounds, or it continues to sink, both seemingly equal possibilities given current factors. Max pain under $80K Analysts and trading firms have tagged the $73,000 to $84,000 range a critical “max pain” band for near-term expiries. It is hard to dispute, especially since that zone marks the average entry cost for major players, including BlackRock and Strategy. If BTC should fall below the $80,000 mark, which is currently being treated like a psychological and technical support area, it could encourage more selling since it transforms the zone into a powerful resistance area that could send prices tumbling toward the $60,000 range and ultimately leave it consolidating between a $60,000–$80,000 range reminiscent of past mid-cycle corrections. Comparison of BTC price with short-term holders selling at a loss. Source: @JA_Maartun via X/Twitter Short-term holders have reportedly dumped -62,000 BTC to exchanges at a loss, with November 22’s exchange inflows reaching $81,000, the largest since mid-July, something analysts believe reflects “peak fear behaviour.” “Every past extreme like this marked seller exhaustion and a major bottom, supported by steady spot demand,” the analyst wrote . “Even if the full bottom isn’t in yet, a technical relief is getting close.” Another analyst talking about the same subject implied that the dumping from short-term holders is a “surrender phenomenon” that is proof that the powers that be have succeeded in shifting current sentiments of market participants from bullish to bearish. According to the analyst, “although the magnitude is different, the movement from the lows of the correction sections of this up cycle has been captured,” but that is not to say all hope is lost. Bitcoin short-term holder SOPR. Source: @DanCoinInvestor via X/Twitter “If the current section is a correction section, it is the bottom,” the analyst wrote . “If the current period is a down cycle, the end of the decline is still far away. Currently, we need to keep both of these cases open and respond accordingly.” He says a rebound could happen in the short term, but if that rebound is not sustained and it falls again to break under $80,000, tougher times could be ahead. It is a gloomy forecast, but the analyst says at least everyone can rest assured we won’t be seeing BTC fall by up to 70% from its peak as it did in past bear cycles. BTC is under mainstream media attack The surrender of short-term holders could herald a lower move or signal a bottom; however, investors seem to be preparing for the worst. The current price crash has also not gone unnoticed by mainstream media outlets. USA Today, while reporting about BTC, described November as a “terrible, horrible, no good, very bad month.” The Wall Street Journal implied that the industry is failing as it should be performing better under a pro-Bitcoin US president, growing institutional demand, and a maturing regulatory landscape. The article claims that “sky-high expectations of a golden age tumbling down to Earth” despite ETFs helping to make BTC less volatile, “Crypto continues to struggle to break free of its reputation as the deranged, foul-mouthed little sibling of Wall Street, too volatile to trust, too entertaining to look away,” the article reads. British newspaper The Guardian was less kind in a blistering editorial, resurrecting the crypto “generates no income, commands no productive capacity and pays no dividends” argument once more, while saying the rise of digital assets reflects a “one-shot society” where “millions are clutching at any chance, however illusory, to escape” an ailing economy.

This crucial inflation data, now scheduled for December 5, could significantly impact cryptocurrency valuations and Federal Reserve policy decisions in the coming weeks. Why Does the US September PCE Release Matter for Crypto? The Personal Consumption Expenditures report serves as the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge. When the US September PCE release finally arrives, it will provide critical insights into: Inflation trends and their impact on interest rate decisions Market sentiment toward risk assets like cryptocurrencies Federal Reserve policy direction for 2024 Investment flows between traditional and digital assets What Caused the US September PCE Release Delay? According to Walter Bloomberg, the Bureau of Economic Analysis postponed the US September PCE release due to data processing challenges. This delay creates an information vacuum that affects all markets, particularly cryptocurrencies which often react strongly to macroeconomic news. The postponement means investors must wait longer for clarity on: Current inflation trajectory Consumer spending patterns Economic growth indicators How Should Crypto Traders Prepare for the US September PCE Release? While waiting for the US September PCE release, smart cryptocurrency investors should monitor several key indicators. These include: Bitcoin dominance and altcoin performance Trading volumes across major exchanges Institutional flows into crypto ETFs and funds Technical analysis of major support and resistance levels Moreover, consider diversifying your portfolio to manage potential volatility when the US September PCE release finally occurs. What Historical Patterns Suggest About Delayed Economic Data Historical analysis shows that delayed economic reports often create: Increased market volatility before release dates Positioning adjustments by institutional investors Opportunities for strategic entry points Risk management challenges for short-term traders The US September PCE release delay follows this pattern, potentially setting up significant market moves once the data becomes available. Expert Insights: Navigating the US September PCE Release Uncertainty Market analysts suggest several strategies during this waiting period. First, maintain balanced exposure to both established cryptocurrencies and emerging projects. Second, use dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risks. Third, stay informed about other economic indicators that might hint at the US September PCE release contents. Remember that the US September PCE release represents just one piece of the macroeconomic puzzle. However, its impact on Federal Reserve policy makes it particularly relevant for cryptocurrency markets. Conclusion: Turning Data Delays into Strategic Advantages The postponed US September PCE release creates both challenges and opportunities for cryptocurrency investors. While the delay introduces short-term uncertainty, it also provides additional time for research and strategic planning. By understanding the potential implications of this key inflation data, investors can position themselves advantageously regardless of the final numbers. Frequently Asked Questions What is the PCE report and why is it important? The Personal Consumption Expenditures report measures inflation through consumer spending patterns. It’s the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, making it crucial for interest rate decisions that affect all financial markets. When will the US September PCE release now occur? The release has been rescheduled for December 5, according to the latest announcements from economic data sources. How does PCE data affect cryptocurrency prices? PCE data influences Federal Reserve policy, which affects interest rates and market liquidity. These factors directly impact cryptocurrency valuations as they change investor risk appetite and capital flows. Should I change my crypto investment strategy due to this delay? While you might adjust short-term tactics, long-term investment strategies should remain focused on fundamental analysis rather than reacting to single data point delays. What other economic indicators should I watch while waiting? Monitor CPI data, employment reports, GDP figures, and Federal Reserve meeting minutes for comprehensive economic insights. How reliable are economic data releases after delays? Delayed releases typically undergo additional verification, potentially making them more reliable, though the delay itself can create market uncertainty. Found this analysis helpful?

This marked the fourth straight week of heavy withdrawals and ranked as the third-largest outflow wave since 2018. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana carried most of the pressure. However, Solana’s price managed to stabilize at a major support area despite the broader flight from risk. Analysts noted that investors are reassessing positioning as major assets retest multi-month levels, while selective inflows continue into a few resilient tokens. Market Outflows Intensify Across Major Assets Bitcoin saw $1.27 billion in outflows, which reflected renewed caution around near-term momentum. Ethereum also lost $589 million, while Solana recorded $156 million in exits. Besides that, the total four-week figure climbed to $4.92 billion, underscoring a shift in sentiment after months of steady inflows. XRP stood out as the only major asset with positive flows. The token attracted $89.3 million, which contrasted sharply with the heavy selling across the rest of the market. This divergence suggested that investors rotated rather than exited entirely. Moreover, spot ETF activity remained strong, which offered a counterbalance to fund withdrawals. Analysts believe that institutional flows may recover once market volatility cools. Solana Holds the $125 Support Despite Recent Declines Solana traded near $133.77 as of press time, marking a modest 0.85% rebound over the past 24 hours. The asset remained down 4.60% for the week, yet the price continued to hold above the $125–$130 support band. This zone has acted as a critical base during previous market resets. Source: X TraderSZ noted that Solana sits at a decisive level where buyers attempt to build a foundation after several weeks of decline. A move above the descending trendline would confirm an early shift in momentum. Hence, reclaiming $130 remains essential for restoring confidence. Additionally, the chart shows a clear resistance path toward $163 as the first barrier. Breaking that level unlocks a wider move toward $195, then $227 and $243. Analysts stated that these levels align with previous rejection zones from earlier phases of the year. Outlook Strengthens if Solana Maintains Weekly Support curb.sol emphasized that $125 remains the level that defines the broader structure. Holding it keeps price action balanced within the multi-month range. Significantly, each retest has triggered strong reactions from buyers. Failure to defend $125 would expose support near $110. However, recent behavior shows consistent absorption around the current floor. Moreover, analysts believe that continued stability here could allow Solana to challenge the $150–$160 region soon.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-24 17:46:03

The floor is lava, but the mission stays the same: Upgrade those Nodes! https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/ianurLaX13 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 23, 2025 Its appeal resides with its plans to launch a mine-to-earn platform, which is going to be a first for crypto. Its platform enables users to build and run their own virtual mining rigs , giving them the opportunity to mine without having to invest in expensive mining hardware. Instead, users can grow their rigs by spending PEPENODE on new virtual nodes, with more nodes resulting in greater rewards. As an incentive, PEPENODE will pay out mining rewards in external coins, such as Pepe and Fartcoin, while more coins will come at later dates. What’s bullish about this is that it provides a strong motivation to buy more PEPENODE , so as to increase your node count and, by extension, your rewards. As such, we could see PEPENODE’s price rise steadily over time, while users will also have the option to sell their nodes on to other users. Staking will also play a role in this dynamic, given that holders of the new altcoin will be able to earn a passive income from it. In fact, it’s currently paying out a yield of 590% APY, making it one of the most lucrative staking coins around. How to Buy PEPENODE Before Its Presale Ends These features are the main reason why PEPENODE is the best altcoin coin to buy at the moment, particularly if traders want to make a quick profit during a bear market. It will list on exchanges once its presale ends, while newcomers can join this sale by going to the coin’s official website. There, they can connect a compatible wallet (e.g. Best Wallet) and buy their desired amount of PEPENODE, using ETH, USDT, BNB or fiat currency. The token is currently available at a price of $0.0011638, but this will rise again in two days. And it will continue to rise regularly until the sale ends, so interested investors should act quickly.

Ethereum (ETH) Price Dips to Ideal Buy Zone,https://cryptopotato.com/wave-3-setup-ethereum-eth-price-dips-to-ideal-buy-zone/,"Ethereum is trading at around $2,850 at the time of writing. Over the past 24 hours, the asset is up 1%. Over the last 7 days, though, it has lost 10%. Trading volume has reached $23.8 billion in the past day. Wave Structure Repeats Analyst Merlijn The Trader has pointed to a recurring price structure on Ethereum’s 2-week chart. The setup follows a sequence of three moves. The first is an impulsive rally. The second is a corrective drop. The third, often the largest, is a breakout leg. According to the chart, Ethereum is now in the second stage. ETHEREUM: THE PERFECT WAVE SETUP Wave 1: Ignition Wave 2: Correction (now) Wave 3: Expansion (next) This structure played out 3x before. And each time, $ETH pumped. You know what to do in the discount zone. pic.twitter.com/GSDsX3RxJ4 — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) November 23, 2025 Remarkably, this structure has formed three times since 2022. Each cycle moved inside an ascending channel. The current decline from $4,950 to the $2,600–$2,800 zone mirrors past corrections. Interestingly, this area is marked as a “ discount zone ” on the chart. The support trendline from previous lows remains in place. If the pattern continues, Ethereum could reach $9,000 in the next move. Traders Watch Support and Reversal Zones Lennaert Snyder noted that Ethereum failed to stay above $2,880, writing, “Our short scenario got triggered.” For long trades, he is watching the $2,680 level and a possible sweep of $2,620. He also pointed to a daily demand zone at $2,570. These are areas where reversal trades may form. As CryptoPotato reported , the $2,872 level aligns with realized price data. This level “ resembles a classic bottom ” based on on-chain behavior. Previous cycle lows also bounced near these conditions. Meanwhile, this area also matches realized price data from multiple wallet groups. That adds strength to this support level if it holds. ETH/BTC Ratio Near Buy Zone Ethereum’s performance against Bitcoin is also being watched. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted the ETH/BTC pair is trading at 0.0325. This level has acted as a base before. In the last bounce from this zone, the pair gained over 140%. Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Van de Poppe said, “If ETH finds support here, it could outperform BTC. If not, the entire market may move lower.” The pair has been consolidating in this range for several days. A bounce could set up a trend reversal. The post Wave 3 Setup?

The non-stop streak of buying at least a few hundred BTC stalled, causing fears that the market would test Strategy’s playbook again. Strategy skipped a week of buying BTC, even after adding more coins during the last month of sliding prices. Late on Sunday, the company’s executive chairman Michael Saylor posted his usual message in anticipation of Monday’s purchase. In hindsight, Saylor’s messaging was not really promising another orange dot on the chart. I Won’t ₿ack Down — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 23, 2025 The recent weekly purchases were fueled by new preferred share issues, loading the balance of Strategy with new obligations to pay out several types of dividends. During previous weekly purchases, Strategy did not spend all funds raised on BTC, instead retaining a part for operating expenses. Skipping a week of BTC purchases happened after the possibility of removing Strategy from the MSCI , along with other crypto companies. Strategy slowed down common stock issues in 2025 Instead of announcing a purchase, Strategy wrapped up its raises for 2025, for a total of over $21B. In 2025, the fundraising structure of Strategy became more complex in comparison with the simple model of 2024. During its initial takeoff stage, it was enough for Strategy to use common stock and one type of convertible debt. We have raised $21 billion in YTD 2025. $BTC pic.twitter.com/exxrDqTjMS — Strategy (@Strategy) November 24, 2025 In 2025 to date, Strategy has raised $11.9B in common stock at a much slower pace compared to 2024. The ability to raise funds through MSTR diminished over the course of 2025, due to dilution and a flagging market price. MSTR trades at around $173.12, well outside the range when Strategy can issue more common stock. While both the common and preferred shares of Strategy are down, BTC is still above Strategy’s average price. MSTR still trades near its yearly lows, with no signs of recovery, as funds shed shares in Q3. | Source: Google Finance The company still has more than 40% of its treasury underwater , and is only a 15% slide away from holding BTC with unrealized losses. Despite this, Saylor has hinted at becoming a holder, not giving up on the treasury. As 2025 nears its end, Strategy has poured more than $43B into BTC purchases, over the course of bearish periods and some of the biggest rallies. Smaller entities keep buying BTC Smaller treasuries are still used to boost company balances or give exposure to new buyers. As of November 24, the cut-off to enter the top 100 of treasury companies is at 135 BTC, rising from just 23 BTC earlier in 2025. Out of 18 playbook companies, just five trade with a positive mNAV, with a stock premium over their BTC purchases. Smaller entities are still unable to support BTC in the way Strategy’s playbook has expanded. Currently, Strategy tries to focus on its debt-financed purchases, showing enthusiasm for the yield-bearing products. However, not all of Strategy’s preferred shares are backed by BTC, or entitle holders to compensation in the case of insolvency. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

According to market expert Diana, this simultaneous launch marks a significant milestone, providing investors with direct exposure to XRP in a regulated and accessible exchange-traded format. The launch of these ETFs reflects rising institutional interest in digital assets and the push to mainstream cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional ETFs tracking crypto baskets or futures, these spot ETFs hold XRP directly, giving investors a transparent, straightforward way to access the asset without using crypto exchanges. Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ ETF is turning heads with its strategic liquidity approach, poised to attract institutional investors seeking straightforward XRP exposure. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GXRP ETF leverages its established crypto investor base, offering a trusted alternative. The simultaneous launch of these ETFs from two respected industry leaders gives investors diverse, high-confidence options in the XRP market. Market analysts expect the launch of these ETFs to boost XRP’s liquidity and price stability. By allowing trading through mainstream brokerage accounts, both retail and institutional investors can gain exposure without managing wallets or self-custody, lowering entry barriers and driving adoption. Diana adds that ETF activity on the NYSE could also signal broader crypto market sentiment amid ongoing digital asset volatility. Therefore, the launch of Franklin Templeton and Grayscale’s XRP spot ETFs marks a milestone in institutional crypto adoption, signaling rising confidence in XRP and a maturing market. As trading kicks off, the performance of XRPZ and GXRP will be closely watched to assess how spot ETFs shape investor behavior and the future trajectory of the XRP market. Franklin XRP ETF Surges in Early Trading, Leading the Pack Franklin’s XRP ETF has surged past expectations in its trading debut, leading all four newly launched XRP ETFs. Market analyst Chad Steingraber notes that its strong first 90 minutes signal robust investor interest and a potentially active trading day ahead. The Franklin XRP ETF is leading its peers, Canary Capital, Bitwise, and Grayscale, with 283,102 shares traded, valued at $6.47 million. Analyst Chad Steingraber notes that if momentum holds, trading could accelerate this afternoon, positioning Franklin XRP as a key focus for both retail and institutional investors. Well, the early surge underscores rising demand for XRP-based products. Unlike other cryptocurrencies facing volatile performance, XRP ETFs are drawing attention for their structured exposure and accessibility through regulated markets. Franklin’s strong debut signals growing investor confidence in XRP as a strategic alternative to Bitcoin- and Ethereum-focused assets. Notably, competition among the four XRP ETFs is heating up. While Canary Capital, Bitwise, and Grayscale are gaining traction, Franklin’s early lead highlights the impact of market timing and investor sentiment. Analysts will watch intraday trading closely to see if Franklin can hold its edge or if rivals will catch up. Additionally, the Franklin XRP ETF’s strong early performance highlights surging demand for XRP-focused investment products. As Steingraber notes, this initial trading surge may set the tone for the day and signal rising investor confidence in regulated crypto vehicles, positioning XRP ETFs as key players in the evolving digital asset market. Conclusion The debut of Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ and Grayscale’s GXRP spot ETFs marks a milestone for XRP and the broader crypto market. By offering regulated, transparent, and accessible exposure, they lower entry barriers and reflect rising institutional confidence. As NYSE trading gains momentum, these ETFs could reshape liquidity, adoption, and price dynamics, signaling a potential new era of mainstream crypto investment. Meanwhile, Franklin’s strong start in XRP ETF trading highlights rising investor confidence in regulated crypto products and underscores XRP’s strategic appeal. Early momentum positions Franklin, and its peers, as key indicators of market sentiment, potentially shaping the future of XRP-focused ETFs.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-24 17:52:48

Robert Kiyosaki, the Rich Dad, Poor Dad author whose unwavering support for Bitcoin has shaped conversations across the financial world, confirmed that he cashed out $2.25 million worth of BTC after holding it for years. Kiyosaki Dumps $2.25 Million In Bitcoin At Around $90,000 Bitcoin broke below the $90,000 level on November 20 after a wave of intensified selling, and new information indicates that one of the asset’s most outspoken believers played a part in that downward pressure. Taking to the social media platform X, Robert Kiyosaki explained that he sold $2.25 million worth of BTC, with the coins originally purchased at about $6,000 each years ago. The sale happened around the $90,000 price zone, meaning he profited about $84,000 on each coin. He framed the announcement as “practicing what I teach,” pointing out that the liquidation was not due to fear or market weakness but by a deliberate decision to redirect his crypto profits into ventures that generate predictable monthly income. What makes the announcement more noteworthy is that it came shortly after Kiyosaki declared he would not sell any of his Bitcoin during the recent correction. It also goes against the financial author’s history of telling investors to protect their wealth by accumulating Bitcoin and his calls for a $250,000 price target for the cryptocurrency. In a November 15 post on X titled “BITCOIN CRASHING,” he answered questions from followers by saying he was not selling and that he was waiting. According to him, markets were crashing because the world needed cash, but he personally did not need cash. Why Did Kiyosaki Sell His BTC? Kiyosaki said he used the proceeds from his Bitcoin sale to acquire two surgery centers and invest in a billboard business. According to his estimates, these new ventures will begin producing about $27,500 in tax-free monthly income by next February. Even with the sale, he noted that he is still very bullish and optimistic on BTC. He described the cryptocurrency as a pivotal asset for the future, adding that the sale simply allowed him to expand his cash-flow portfolio. He even stated that he intends to accumulate more BTC using income generated from the surgery centers and billboard business. This clarification places the sale in a different light, not as a complete loss of confidence in Bitcoin from Kiyosaki, but as a change in long-term strategy. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $86,720, up by 1% in the past 24 hours. However, the leading cryptocurrency is still down by 9.2% in the past seven days and 21% since the beginning of November.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Poor Dad|Robert Kiyosaki|the Rich Dad,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-24 18:00:01

That is exactly what Digitap ($TAP) offers as it nears its integration with Visa. Investors are served with an omni-bank ecosystem built to blend traditional finance and digital assets into one network. In a year where many crypto presales overpromise but under-deliver, Digitap stands out due to its real-world utility. The future of crypto depends on utility, and $TAP already delivers at an early stage. Utility vs. Promises: Digitap Sets a New Crypto Presale Standard Most of the active presales this year have marketed what they intend to do in the future before developing any tangible products. They launch websites, promise impressive AI or DeFi tools, and expect market excitement will make the tokens thrive. Their strategy works in the short term. However, the projects sink once the hype fades. In the meantime, Digitap has adopted a different strategy. Its omni-bank ecosystem makes crypto spendable in the real world. Hence, it is one of the best altcoins to buy this November. Previously, crypto worked online only. Users could trade it, stake it, and buy NFTs with it, but in the physical world, its utility disappeared. Digitap aims to bridge that gap with comprehensive financial functionality. It offers merchant payment rails, crypto wallets, card-based spending, and fiat on/off-ramps. Thus, users can pay for items from merchants using their crypto balance the same way they use cash. The “utility-first” approach is why $TAP is gaining momentum while the market slides and other presales fade. Investors are shifting from hype and speculation to projects that generate usage. Visa Integration Positions $TAP for Mass Adoption While most crypto projects promise future collaborations, Digitap is ready to deliver the milestone that could accelerate its mass adoption: Visa integration. The collaboration with this payments giant will enable Digitap users to spend their crypto balance at more than 130 million Visa-supported merchants globally. Users will enjoy instant conversions between assets, and cross-border spending will attract minimal fees. Furthermore, Digitap is the first crypto-native ecosystem, positioning itself as an alternative to traditional banking. It aims to change the way money moves, not work only as a complementary service in the banking sector. A Visa partnership is rare in the crypto space. Only a few projects have unlocked card-based utility at scale. No other project has developed an omni-bank ecosystem around card-based utility from scratch. Investors consider $TAP a good crypto to buy since it offers them the opportunity to invest in a project building real, functional financial infrastructure. Digitap Redefines Crypto Investing With Real Payment Utility 2025’s biggest investment trend has shifted from hype and speculation to payment-driven decentralized finance (PayFi) systems. These projects dominate the current market, making crypto usable in daily transactions for normal users. They offer instant settlements, global payments, and on/off-ramps, explaining their accelerated merchant adoption rate. Digitap has quickly become the leader in this category since it focuses on real utility that people use daily. The omni-bank ecosystem offers user-friendly exchange features, mobile app banking functions, instant spending through Visa networks, and one wallet for fiat and crypto. These features make $TAP a real-world payment asset. Additionally, Digitap is building a hybrid crypto–fiat banking model. The platform connects the reach of traditional banking systems with the speed and flexibility of Web3 assets. This enables users to enjoy the speed of blockchain and the trust of legacy finance at the convenience of everyday payments. While other coins rely on speculation, $TAP supports staking, in-app transaction fees, rewards, cashback programs, payment routing, and ecosystem governance. No other crypto presale offers such an advanced financial infrastructure. This ecosystem creates long-term demand. Smart Money Flows Into $TAP as Crypto Markets Mature Digitap’s presale momentum has grown since investors are seeking stable projects with utility-backed narratives. After unpredictable hype cycles and unstable AI-token booms, investors want projects whose value is connected to function. $TAP fits into this utility-based trend. Other projects have been struggling with reduced liquidity and increased volatility. Whales are investing in projects with strong fundamentals, such as Digitap. This makes $TAP the best crypto to buy this November due to its huge demand from smart money. The next bull market will reward those projects that link traditional finance with blockchain. Digitap is perfectly positioned at the epicenter of this development. USE THE CODE “DIGITAP20” FOR 20% OFF FIRST-TIME PURCHASES Digitap Turns Crypto Into a Practical Financial Tool for Daily Users Crypto emerged over a decade ago, promising to offer financial freedom to all users. It was not meant for speculation. Crypto was meant to offer users freedom to move money quickly, transact globally without incurring expensive fees, earn, spend, and save. Digitap is building the infrastructure that traditional banks should have built years ago. Its omni-bank ecosystem offers inclusive access for unbanked regions, instant payments, borderless finance, and smooth merchant interaction. Through this network, users fully own their digital assets. With the Visa collaboration coming up, Digitap is growing into a next-generation banking layer. Thus, it can operate beyond the restrictions affecting the traditional banking industry. These features and capabilities are fueling $TAP’s demand, explaining its status as a good crypto to buy today. Why Investors Call Digitap the Most Promising Financial System Digitap has a product that solves a real problem. As it prepares for a full-blown Visa integration, its many advantages make it the top crypto presale investment option in 2025. It has built an omni-bank ecosystem that merges fiat and crypto, explaining why its presale attracts long-term investors. Moreover, this project enjoys global merchant acceptance because it has a roadmap aligned with real adoption and already offers real-world payment utility. For investors, this is an early opportunity to invest in a lucrative financial system. They believe Digitap can redefine the future of the global finance industry. $TAP Presale Heats Up Amid 76% Discount Opportunity Digitap’s presale is one of the most popular in the market, with its Visa integration helping demand to grow rapidly. Investors are buying into the 76.71% discount opportunity, and analysts predict major exchange listings post-launch. Currently at $0.0326, $TAP’s entry price attracts most investors looking for high ROI while the general crypto market slides. More than 131 million $TAP tokens have been sold, raising at least $2.1 million. The price will rise to $0.0334 in the next stage.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/2025-2026-window-is-the-biggest-in-xrp-history-heres-why/,"The crypto world stands at a defining crossroads, and for XRP, the stakes have never been higher. What some dismiss as hype, others call a structural sea‑change. According to Ripple Bull Winkle, the 2025–2026 period is “the biggest moment in XRP history,” and he argues convincingly that this convergence of trends is deliberate — not random. Ripple, ISO Migration, and SWIFT Infrastructure At the heart of this claim is Ripple’s growing integration into legacy financial messaging systems. Through its strategic partnership with EastNets, Ripple is now embedded within platforms that serve hundreds of banks and connect directly to SWIFT and ISO 20022 messaging standards. As SWIFT mandates its global migration to ISO 20022 by November 2025, Ripple’s early alignment gives it a rare seat at the table in the evolving payments architecture. The 2025–2026 window is the biggest moment in XRP history. ISO migration, SWIFT integration, CBDC rollout, liquidity demand. The stars aren’t aligning… they're engineered. #XRP — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 24, 2025 On‑Demand Liquidity: XRP as the World’s Real‑Time Bridge Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product has matured significantly. Rather than relying on pre-funded accounts, financial institutions can convert currencies in real time using XRP. As Ripple scales this service, XRP demand rises not just from speculation but from real-world liquidity needs. This demand could redefine XRP’s utility: not as a speculative token, but as a core liquidity rail. CBDCs and the Role of XRP as a Bridge Asset Central banks are actively piloting digital currencies, and Ripple is positioning the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as a foundational issuance and settlement layer. Through RippleNet, central banks could tap into XRP to facilitate seamless conversion between tokenized currencies. That makes XRP a neutral bridge currency — giving it a deeply practical role in future CBDC ecosystems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Adoption and Regulatory Clarity Ripple’s institutional momentum accelerated in 2025, especially after greater legal clarity around XRP’s regulatory status. At the same time, the XRP Ledger is gaining trust among institutions: tokenized real-world assets such as U.S. treasuries and money market funds are now live on XRPL . This reinforces XRP’s role as not just a bridge for currency, but also a backbone for tokenized finance. Highly Engineered, Not Just Aligned Ripple Bull Winkle’s insight — that “the stars aren’t aligning … they’re engineered” — feels increasingly accurate. The rapid evolution of XRP demand, combined with Ripple’s deliberate infrastructure plays, suggests this is not a chance. Rather, it could be a carefully shaped inflection point: 2025–2026 may transform XRP from a niche crypto to a global liquidity engine. Risks in a Complex Landscape Despite the bullish picture, caution is warranted. SWIFT integration is indirect — via EastNets — not a formal “XRP‑SWIFT” partnership. And while CBDC pilots are promising, there’s no guarantee all will adopt XRPL. Moreover, competition from other bridge assets and stablecoins remains intense. A Pivotal Moment for XRP Still, the scale of what’s happening is hard to overstate. If Ripple’s infrastructure vision continues to unfold, XRP could shift from speculation to indispensable utility. For XRP believers — and even skeptics — this window may prove to be the most consequential chapter in its history yet.

At the same time, traders highlight a repeating wave pattern with a fresh “discount zone” on the chart, framing the current pullback as a potential launchpad for the next major move. Ethereum Network Sets New TPS Record as Layer 2s Lead Activity The Ethereum ecosystem has set a new record for daily average transactions per second, according to data cited by ChainCatcher from growthepie. Over the past 7 days, average daily TPS reached 364.52, while peak throughput hit 24,192 TPS, underscoring how much activity is now flowing through the network’s broader stack. Ethereum Daily TPS Chart. Source: Joseph Young/growthepie.com At the same time, Layer 2 solutions accounted for about 95.35 percent of total TPS, highlighting their growing role in handling user demand and scaling workloads off the main chain. In addition, the Perp DEX Lighter contributed a significant share of this traffic, further reinforcing the shift of trading and derivatives activity toward Ethereum’s Layer 2 market. Ethereum Supply Turns Net Positive Over the Past Week Ethereum’s supply has ticked higher over the last seven days, with net issuance rising by 18,019 ETH, according to data from Ultrasound.money . The increase lifts the total supply to 121,234,582 ETH and reflects an annualized growth rate of about 0.776 percent. At the same time, the figures show Ethereum running in a mildly inflationary mode after recent stretches of low on-chain fees and slower burn activity. The move contrasts with earlier periods when strong demand pushed more ETH to be burned than issued, briefly turning the asset deflationary. Ethereum Chart Highlights Repeating Wave Structure Meanwhile, Ethereum’s chart shows a recurring three-wave pattern that the analyst labels as ignition, correction and expansion. The structure appears across several points on the multi-year timeline, with each cycle forming inside a broad ascending channel. The latest swing sits in the second phase, where price has pulled back from recent highs and moved toward the analyst’s marked discount zone. Ethereum Discount Zone Wave Structure. Source: Merlijn The Trader/X At the same time, the chart places the current movement within the lower half of the channel, where previous retracements also stabilized before turning higher. The outlined support area between the mid-$2,000 region and the trendline reflects the zone where earlier corrections slowed, creating a base for the next major wave. This visual alignment underlines how the trader interprets the pullback as part of the same recurring structure rather than a break in trend. Furthermore, the projection on the right side of the chart maps a potential third wave that follows the prior pattern’s rhythm. While the dotted path illustrates an illustrative trajectory, the chart’s main point is the repetition of this three-stage wave sequence across 2022, 2023 and 2025. The recurring formations and consistent reaction zones form the basis for the trader’s interpretation of the ongoing movement as another correction inside a broader rising channel.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-24 18:07:02

Moreover, it demonstrates the importance of diversified analysis in cryptocurrency trading. What Are the Broader Implications for Markets? The cancellation of the US Q3 advance GDP estimate raises questions about data transparency and reliability. This development affects not just traditional markets but also the cryptocurrency ecosystem that increasingly mirrors macroeconomic trends.

This level has acted as a springboard for previous rallies and is now pivotal. Traders and investors are asking: will BONK bounce or break below and trigger further downside? Bitcoin Capital’s BONK ETP listing on the SIX Swiss Exchange brings a major regulated gateway. The ETP is physically backed, giving investors exposure to BONK without handling wallets or private keys. Institutional-grade custody ensures transparency and daily reporting of token holdings, net asset value, and cash positions. This launch positions BONK alongside traditional financial assets, offering predictable liquidity through market makers and tight spreads. Could this regulated environment attract a new wave of investors? Source: X How the BONK ETP Works Issuer: Bitcoin Capital AG Ticker: BONK Backing: 100% BONK Leverage: None Management Fee: 1.5% Issue Date: November 27, 2025 The ETP avoids derivatives or synthetic exposure, tracking BONK’s market performance directly. Daily transparency and Swiss regulatory oversight make it a unique offering for memecoin investors who previously hesitated to enter the crypto space. Institutional and Corporate Interest Rising Several firms have demonstrated growing BONK interest: Sharps Technology converted part of its 2 million SOL into BonkSOL. Tuttle Capital filed a Bonk Income Blast ETF with the SEC. Bonk Holdings Inc. bought $32 million worth of BONK, controlling nearly 3% of the total supply. The combination of corporate acquisitions and regulated products signals increasing legitimacy. Could this signal the start of a broader institutional adoption trend for BONK? Technical Outlook: Key Support and Resistance Zones BONK’s price is testing the crucial $0.00000800–$0.00000950 zone. Historical behavior shows: Above $0.00000950: Likely rebound and potential rally toward prior highs. Below $0.00000800: Bearish continuation may follow, triggering deeper price corrections. Technical patterns suggest a critical decision point. Will buyers defend this zone? Will previous bounce patterns repeat? Source: X Highlights: Prior support led to strong rallies. Current trading at the decision zone signals potential volatility. The next few days will reveal if bulls or bears dominate. Market Implications The BONK ETP marks a shift for memecoins. It provides a bridge between community-driven tokens and regulated financial markets. The growing interest from institutions and asset managers demonstrates that even speculative tokens can gain serious exposure through compliant channels. This launch could increase market confidence, attract additional liquidity, and stabilize BONK price. On the other hand, failure to hold support may trigger panic selling.

That depends on how the market reacts to the current decisional level and the ETP listings. Community Sentiment and Speculative Dynamics BONK’s retail community remains active, driving social media discussions and on-chain activity. Memecoin enthusiasts often create short-term spikes, and BONK has historically reacted to hype with sudden rallies. Could this ETP listing amplify community-driven momentum? If social sentiment aligns with institutional adoption, BONK might see a compounded effect, where retail excitement and regulated inflows converge. Traders should ask themselves: are we witnessing the start of a broader bullish cycle, or just another temporary pump?
