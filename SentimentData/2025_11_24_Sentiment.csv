The renowned market strategist appeared on CNBC's “The Exchange” program to assess the recent sharp declines in cryptocurrency markets. Lee stated that the market crashes were caused by a technical chain reaction that occurred around October 10th and led to the liquidation of approximately 2 million accounts. According to Lee, the crash was sparked by a pricing error on an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange. The price of a stablecoin, which would normally be $1, momentarily dropped to $0.65 due to a lack of liquidity on the exchange. According to Lee, the crash was sparked by a pricing error on an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange. The price of a stablecoin, which would normally be $1, momentarily dropped to $0.65 due to a lack of liquidity on the exchange. The error allegedly occurred on the Binance exchange, and the asset responsible was the USDe stablecoin issued by Ethena Labs. Binance's lack of liquidity in the USDe pair was the spark that set off this chain reaction. Related News: What Does the Future Hold for XRP in the Coming Days? Analysis Company Provides Critical Levels This price deviation triggered the exchange’s Automatic Deleveraging (ADL) mechanism. Lee explained that the system executed trades based on this erroneous internal price, resulting in a chain reaction in which approximately 2 million crypto accounts, including those that had been profitable just minutes before, were liquidated. Tom Lee argued that this incident had a devastating impact on market makers, who act as the crypto ecosystem's “central bank.” He noted that market makers were forced to reduce liquidity to cover the gaps in their balance sheets, saying, “As prices fell, they were forced to sell more. The gradual decline we've seen over the past few weeks reflects this 'crippling' state of market makers.” *This is not investment advice.

While the live price currently sits around $0.4057 , analysts are projecting a massive upward trajectory. Some models suggest ADA could reach anywhere from $1.20 to as high as $2.05 by year-end , rewarding those who have held through the volatility. Adding fuel to this fire is the highly anticipated Midnight launch roadmap , recently revealed by the Cardano founder. The timeline confirms that NIGHT claims and initial market trading will begin on December 8, 2025 , marking a pivotal moment for the network’s privacy-focused partner chain. As the Cardano ecosystem expands into privacy and enterprise solutions, the complexity of managing these diverse assets increases. Investors need a unified tool to navigate this growth, which is exactly why the GeeFi Team built GeeFi . The Command Center for Multichain Finance GeeFi is a high-performance, non-custodial mobile wallet designed to give you absolute sovereignty over your digital wealth. Since development began in 2023 , the priority has been engineering a secure environment for the modern investor. Publicly released in 2024 , the application supports a vast array of major networks, including Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more , ensuring you are never restricted to a single ecosystem as the market evolves. The platform functions as a comprehensive crypto hub. It features essential tools like built-in swaps , cross-chain bridging , and on/off-ramp services that allow for easy movement between fiat and digital currencies. Security is paramount, with integrated AML protocols and WalletConnect support for safe interaction with decentralized applications via the Web3 browser . The app is available now for Android , with an iOS version currently in development. Future-Proofing with the GEE Token The ecosystem is powered by the GEE token , an ERC-20 utility asset with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 . Holding GEE unlocks the full potential of the platform, including benefits within the upcoming HUB, DEX, and GeeFi Card which are currently in development. The tokenomics are designed to be deflationary, creating long-term value retention mechanisms for holders who participate in the ecosystem’s growth. The presale structure is designed to reward early conviction. There are 400 million tokens allocated for the public sale, distributed across 10 phases . The market has responded aggressively to this structure, as over $250,000 was raised in the first 24 hours of its presale launch . Early participants secure the best possible entry, as the token price will see an increment with each new phase. Capitalizing on the Early Window The window to secure GEE at this entry point is narrowing. Investors who act before the presale ends and the token launches on major exchanges position themselves for maximum upside. Token utility includes governance rights, fee reductions, and exclusive crypto card perks. Additionally, the referral program offers a 5% bonus in GEE on every purchase made via your personal link. Don’t let Cardano’s stagnation dictate your financial future, diversify into GeeFi today and start earning immediately.

The recently launched Granite upgrade is a major development, slashing transaction fees by an incredible 99.9%. This enhancement aims to make the blockchain more attractive for high-throughput applications and institutional adoption, reinforcing Avalanche’s focus on scalability and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. This push for technical excellence, however, highlights a fundamental disconnect in the crypto world. While network fees become negligible, the practical ability for a user to spend their AVAX on everyday goods remains a major obstacle. This is the exact usability problem that innovative platforms like GeeFi were designed to solve, bridging the gap between digital asset ownership and real-world commerce. A Tale of Two Worlds: Network Fees vs. Spending Friction The Granite upgrade is a huge step forward for Avalanche, enabling faster processing and dramatically lower costs for developers and users transacting on-chain. Yet, for the average person, this doesn’t change the complex process required to use their crypto in a store. The path from wallet to checkout typically involves sending funds to an exchange, converting them to fiat, and waiting for a bank transfer. This is the friction the GeeFi Team identified as a key barrier to mainstream crypto adoption. Development on their solution began in 2023, with a public launch in 2024 to introduce a platform that makes digital assets as spendable as cash. Their focus is on creating a direct link between your crypto wallet and the global economy. GeeFi: Self-Custody Meets Global Spending GeeFi delivers a powerful combination of a secure non-custodial wallet and the globally recognized GeeFi Card . With a non-custodial wallet, you retain complete control over your private keys and your funds. This upholds the core principle of self-sovereignty, ensuring your assets are always yours without relying on a third party. The GeeFi Card, powered by the VISA and Mastercard networks, connects directly to this wallet. This integration enables real-time spending at millions of locations worldwide, from online stores to local cafes. There is no need to pre-load a card or convert assets in advance. The entire experience is managed through the GeeFi app, which is live on Android and receives continuous updates, with an iOS version currently in development . An Invitation to Financial Innovation History shows that major technological shifts create valuable opportunities for early supporters who understand the long-term vision. We are at a similar moment in the evolution of digital finance, where projects delivering genuine utility will lead the next wave of growth. The GeeFi presale is an invitation to be part of this transformation. The project has already demonstrated strong market demand, having raised over $250,000 by selling more than 5.3 million tokens . This is more than just a token sale; it’s a chance to support the infrastructure that will make digital assets a practical tool for everyday life. The GEE Token: Your Gateway to Enhanced Utility The GEE token is the utility asset at the heart of the GeeFi ecosystem. By holding and staking GEE, users can access a tiered rewards program offering benefits like cashback on card purchases and reduced transaction fees. The platform also features a high-yield staking option with an APR between 45-55% , rewarding users for their active participation. The public presale for the GEE token is currently active, with a price of $0.05 . This price is scheduled to increase after the first phase of the presale concludes, presenting a time-sensitive opportunity for early participants. To foster community growth, GeeFi also features a referral program that gives you a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through your personal link.

From Tucson to New York, from one-man startups to sprawling corporations, devices that should’ve been retired years ago are still limping along, and it’s dragging down everything from workplace performance to national productivity. According to Reviews.org, the average smartphone in America is now held for 29 months, up from 22 months in 2016. That may not sound dramatic, but when multiplied by millions of consumers and thousands of companies, those extra months spell trouble. According to CNBC, people just aren’t swapping out devices like they used to, and the domino effect is becoming clearer by the year. Heather Mitchell, an American retiree living in Tucson, is one of many Americans stretching the life of their old tech. Her Samsung Galaxy A71 is six years old, and while she admits it’s “a jalopy,” she has no plans to trade it in. “I love Samsung phones, but can not afford a new one right now. A new phone would be a luxury,” Heather said. Aging gadgets, falling productivity, and a costly wait That kind of decision might make sense for someone on a tight budget, but when businesses start doing the same, the cost is much higher. A recent report from the Federal Reserve found that for every extra year companies delay tech upgrades, overall productivity falls by about a third of a percent. Stretch that across the entire economy and it’s a hit worth billions. America still leads when it comes to corporate reinvestment, but the impact is visible globally. If investment patterns in Europe had mirrored the U.S. since 2000, the productivity gap with the U.S. would’ve shrunk by 29% for the U.K., 35% for France, and an astonishing 101% for Germany. But while companies are somewhat faster than households at cycling out old hardware, they’re still not keeping up with the speed of innovation. Cassandra Cummings, who runs New Jersey’s Thomas Instrumentation, said outdated devices are throttling networks. “Older devices were built before 1GB speeds became normal. Now networks have to work around them, which means slowing everything down just to stay compatible,” Cassandra said. She doesn’t deny upgrades are expensive, especially for small businesses or individuals who are barely covering bills. But the alternative, holding on forever, comes with hidden costs. Cassandra says repairable or modular devices could help ease the transition, but “we’ve built a throw-away culture,” and that makes it hard for people to keep up without constantly buying new gear. Steven Athwal, who runs The Big Phone Store in the U.K., says the real issue is what people are expecting from them. “Trying to run modern workloads on ancient tech is a drain,” Steven said . Lagging processors, failing batteries, and outdated software are killing morale and wasting energy. Even worse, the booming repair and resale industry that could fill this gap is still ignored, underfunded, and unregulated in America. Workplaces suffer while employees cling to what’s familiar Jason Kornweiss, who leads advisory services at Diversified, says old devices aren’t just an annoyance, they’re also an operational nightmare. He cited internal workplace studies showing 24% of employees now work overtime due to outdated technology, and 88% feel innovation is stifled by it. Jason pointed to the disconnect between behavior and reality. “People know their tech is holding them back, but they’re still reluctant to trade it in,” he said. Familiarity with aging systems often wins over the hassle of learning a new device. Even when IT shows up with upgrades, employees groan. Slower systems mean more hours lost, less multitasking, and less creativity. Jason believes that “time is the most valuable thing a worker has,” and old devices are consuming too much of it. Najiba Benabess, dean of business at Neumann University, sees a growing problem. She says many small businesses are sinking hours into maintenance and repairs, all while productivity quietly erodes. “Keeping devices longer might look smart,” Najiba said, “but it chips away at our national competitiveness.” And back in Arizona, Heather isn’t planning to buy anything new unless absolutely necessary. “In 26 years, this is only my fifth phone,” she said.

The crypto expert points to a striking precedent from Q4 2016 when XRP dropped to $0.0054. Following this decline, the asset rallied massively beyond $3 in January 2018. The asset rose by 55,455% (554x), a remarkable climb. X Finance Bull believes the current decline is a deliberate shakeout and not a sign of weakness. Are you scared on $XRP price action right now? WATCH THIS! In Q4 2016, $XRP got crushed in a brutal shakeout. Price dropped to just $0.0054, then exploded to $3 in months. That’s a 55,455% gain or a 554x. Insane, right? It’s happening again.

His post began by asking whether investors were concerned about XRP’s recent price movement. He described the sharp decline as the result of market manipulation. He stressed that a similar pattern appeared before XRP’s long rally 8 years ago. His claim rests on the idea that deep pullbacks occur before large expansions. He presents the recent move as a setup, not a signal of exhaustion. New Activity Builds Behind XRP He also pointed to new activity around the asset. He cited the arrival of spot ETFs . He noted Ripple’s push into cross-border payments and early tokenization pilots. He claims that companies and countries now consider XRP for future reserves. Additionally, he mentioned a shift in U.S. policy toward digital assets. He included a reference to President Donald Trump’s position on crypto. He stated that Ripple’s CEO and legal counsel are in talks with the president , seeing this as confirmation of rising support.

He stated that “trillions are lining up behind XRP.” He framed this as a critical moment for holders. He asserted that a major expansion phase is just ahead. He based this view on rising infrastructure, institutional access, and political momentum. He argued that the current price zone creates opportunity. His position centers on conviction during high volatility. A Call for Resolution The post closed with a call for resolution. He wrote, “I know what I hold.” He compared the present chart structure with earlier cycles. He claimed that investors should treat the current period as an opportunity for long-term positioning . He urged market participants to stay focused on utility growth and rising institutional access.

According to trading data from Upbit and Bithumb, the country's two largest exchanges, many altcoins have seen notable jumps in volume. Korean investor interest is particularly strong in highly liquid assets like XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. When Upbit and Bithumb's 24-hour trading volumes were combined, the most prominent altcoins were listed as follows: XRP — $448 million Bitcoin — $354 million Tether (USDT) — $261 million Ethereum (ETH) — $178 million 0G — $124 million Intuition (TRUST) — $115 million Creditcoin (CTC) — $102 million Solana (SOL) — $100 million Toshi (TOSHI) — $60 million Momentum (MMT) — $53 million Dogecoin (DOGE) — $52 million Related News: Watch Out: Massive Token Unlocks Coming in 22 Altcoins Next Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Upbit is once again at the center of the volume boom in South Korea. The exchange alone reached $336 million in XRP and $268 million in Bitcoin trading volume. On the Bithumb side, Tether led the way with $136 million in volume, suggesting increased demand for stablecoins due to arbitrage and KRW migrations. The data also suggests that local investors aren't solely focused on major coins. On Upbit, volume growth in more niche projects like 0G ($110 million), Intuition ($97 million), and Creditcoin ($80 million) was notable. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin Slips, Solana Surges, and Apeing Claims the Early-Mover Throne",https://timestabloid.com/searching-for-the-best-altcoins-in-panic-season-bitcoin-slips-solana/,"Every crypto cycle delivers chaos first and profits later. The market loves to punish hesitation before rewarding conviction. Panic season is here again. Bitcoin slips below key support zones while traders panic over liquidations. Memes turn serious. Fear makes hands weak and portfolios shaky. Yet history keeps repeating the same lesson. When Bitcoin drops, the best altcoins sneak in and steal the show. Crypto traders have seen this pattern so many times that even mosquitoes are laughing at late buyers. The people who win are not the ones who wait for a perfect moment. They are the fast movers. They buy when others freeze. They chase opportunity before the world wakes up. That is exactly what is happening now. Bitcoin is cooling, but two breakout stories are heating the stage: Solana is absorbing institutional liquidity like a sponge at a soda spill, and Apeing is emerging with one of the fastest-growing whitelist demands of the year. Analysts say crypto responds to confidence. But degens know the truth. Crypto responds to energy, memes, and timing. That is why $APEING and Solana are showing strength even while the biggest markets tremble. The Best Altcoins are beginning their run, and those who hesitate might become the “I could have been rich” club once again. Apeing Claims the Early-Mover Throne Among Best Altcoins Apeing takes a completely different approach. It is not trying to be safe. It is not trying to be serious. It is unapologetically degen. Built for those who act fast when others freeze, Apeing is already gaining recognition as one of the Best Altcoins for pure upside potential. Its entire culture rewards aggression, instinct, and FOMO-master energy. Early access momentum around Apeing is growing rapidly. Traders are lining up because they know what happens when communities move early together. That is how power shifts. The whitelist gives first-in positioning at the lowest possible entry pricing, long before the hype machine turns the token into a rocket. Early participants are securing spots cheaper than everyone else will ever see again. Once the public frenzy begins, entries climb, and the moon tickets get expensive fast. Stage 1 for $APEING is expected to open at $0.0001, while projections suggest a $0.001 listing zone. That means a baseline 10x before the real chaos even starts. When the staking, hype, and social explosion hit together, the early buyers are looking at 10,000%+ potential returns. That does not mean guaranteed profit. It means those who choose to move early have math on their side. Allocation remains limited, and hesitation is the enemy in a fast-moving meme ecosystem. This is why so many investors already label Apeing as one of the Best Altcoins going into the next bull cycle. Early Access for Those Who Move First Crypto never rewards hesitation. Traders overthink. They refresh charts. They panic at every dip. Meanwhile, decisive players secure positions and lock in the ground floor entries the world will envy later. The Apeing whitelist is a chance to act before headlines take over. The instinctual degens know exactly what that means. Apeing culture is simple. Act fast. Trust your gut. Do not let hesitation rob opportunity. The Best Altcoins are not about waiting. They are about movement. That is why the ones who APE have historically earned the loudest celebrations when the market wakes up. Bitcoin Correction Creates a Vacuum Hungry Coins Will Fill Soon Bitcoin continues to struggle as Federal Reserve uncertainty shakes markets. When the world’s largest cryptocurrency bleeds, investors rush to hedge risk or rotate into faster opportunities. Data from multiple market trackers shows a clear rise in liquidation levels. Futures traders who used high leverage are now crying into their keyboards after getting wiped out in seconds. But this is crypto. Nothing stays down forever. Market cycles repeat like a viral meme. Bitcoin leads. It pumps. Everyone gets hyped. Then correction hits. The weak hands flee, and the strong hands begin looking for the Best Altcoins with more upside potential. This rotation is normal. Veteran traders see it as a discount season. Analysts from leading crypto research platforms note that early altcoin rotation historically precedes the next wave of bullish growth. Solana Surges While Bitcoin Sleeps, and Institutions Know Why Solana does not wait politely for Bitcoin to recover. It acts. It wins on speed and adoption. The network traffic remains packed with active users, NFTs, liquid staking, and booming meme coins. But what is turning Solana into one of the Best Altcoins right now is not just the community, it is the big money flooding in. Traditional finance sees Solana as a rare combination of scalability and user growth. As major ETFs tracking Solana gain exposure and liquidity, institutions with billions in dry powder finally have a doorway into the chain. When big bags move, charts stop joking and start sprinting. Solana’s role in payments, gaming, and decentralized exchanges keeps expanding, creating a path that is far from a meme. Analysts on social platforms keep highlighting Solana as one of the Best Altcoins with long runway ahead. Conclusion Crypto markets test patience before they reward courage. Bitcoin slipping does not mean doom. It means the spotlight is shifting. The Best Altcoins rise during panic because early movers position for maximum upside. Solana continues to gain institutional adoption and strong technical growth. Apeing accelerates retail energy with a lightning-fast whitelist and unmatched entry pricing. Winners in crypto are not the ones who wait. They are the ones who decide before the rest of the world thinks it is safe. Right now, the Best Altcoins are not asking for permission. They are already preparing for the next breakout chapter. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apeing Website Telegram: Join the Apeing Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apeing ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions About the Best Altcoins What are the key factors that make a crypto project one of the Best Altcoins? Projects considered the Best Altcoins usually show strong demand, high trading volume, active communities, and clear real-world or ecosystem utility. Investors also look for catalysts such as exchange listings, institutional support, or early-access opportunities that can accelerate market growth. Why is Apeing seen as a major contender among the Best Altcoins right now? Apeing stands out because its whitelist gives early movers access at the lowest pricing before larger demand pushes the chart higher. The project embraces fast-paced meme culture and rewards instinctive decision-makers, making $APEING attractive to traders seeking major upside potential during the next crypto rotation. Is Bitcoin still relevant if traders are focused on the Best Altcoins? Yes. Bitcoin remains the foundation of the crypto market. However, when Bitcoin consolidates or dips, money often rotates into high-energy altcoins with greater room to grow. The Best Altcoins tend to outperform during these transition phases when investors chase faster returns. What makes Solana one of the Best Altcoins in this market cycle? Solana continues to gain adoption from institutions, developers, and users thanks to fast scaling, low fees, and its expanding NFT and DeFi ecosystem. ETF exposure and high network activity suggest long-term confidence, positioning Solana as a top growth asset in the Best Altcoins category. Summary This editorial analyzes the shift in crypto market leadership during Bitcoin weakness. Falling prices and rising fear lead investors toward faster-growing opportunities also known as the Best Altcoins. The article highlights Solana’s institutional growth and Apeing’s early-access momentum as the main narratives shaping current rotation. Solana benefits from adoption, scalability, and ETF expansion. Apeing delivers high-risk, high-reward culture and ultra-low whitelist entry pricing that can produce large returns if market conditions turn bullish. The analysis stresses that decisive timing, not hesitation, drives success in crypto cycles. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

At just $0.035 to enter, MUTM is making headlines fast due to its quickly accelerating presale success and its genuine DeFi use case, as well as its growth development already being established to rival and potentially outperform many big altcoins at this point and beyond. In contrast, Solana (SOL) is struggling to maintain any serious momentum at all. The market favors new crypto development at any cost now much higher than before. MUTM is drawing attention as the top crypto that could redefine early-stage DeFi opportunities this cycle. Solana Faces Serious Breakdown Risk as Price Hangs on to Last Support Levels Solana (SOL) is on the brink of a major technical breakdown and may quickly enter the $85 to $55 region if it fails to show signs of bouncing back beyond key support at $130. Until Solana shows significant signs of bouncing back, selling pressure is expected to continue. As market players continue to monitor this development and begin to hunt for new crypto projects displaying initial growth momentum to join or invest in, opportunities presented by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have already presented explosive growth rates at the presale stage. MUTM is now being seen as a top crypto for investors seeking early adoption in DeFi. MUTM Presale: Taking Advantage of the Movement Before Phase 7 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is causing significant market hype as it is nearing the end of Phase 6 for its presale. The current price of its tokens is $0.035, marking a 250% jump from its initial price at Phase 1. It is notable that it has received contributions of over 18,140 individuals worth $18.9 million. As the project embarks on Phase 7, the cost will increase to $0.04, getting closer to the expected market listing price of $0.06. This kind of growth makes MUTM one of the most promising top crypto options for investors to invest in for its high returns within the DeFi market at such an early stage. Phase 2 Roadmap: Showcase Product Maturity As Phase 6 is soon to be completed, Mutuum Finance is moving into Phase 2 of its development roadmap, which involves product validation and readiness for operational success. This development phase completes the smart contract infrastructure and also finishes the development of the DApp user interface. The activation of V1 Protocol is expected to constitute the first operational test for this platform to demonstrate its primary functionality. Phase 2 bridges the gap between initial investors and usability to further establish MUTM as having strong fundamentals for being a cryptocurrency and having utility use cases. To encourage active participation in the program, Mutuum Finance is launching a reward dashboard displaying the top 50 token holders. Users can track their rankings in real-time and adjust their position relative to others to create a sense of competition and engagement. This reward system not only inspires engagement but also inspires loyalty for being rewarded for being part of MUTM’s community-driven growth and now being cemented as the new crypto holding real DeFi utility and value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Poised to Outperform Solana This Cycle Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most promising DeFi projects around at the moment, having succeeded in presale Phase 6 with over 95% of its sales completed among 18,140 investors to raise more than $18.9 million at just $0.035 per token. This is expected to go higher to $0.04 in presale Phase 7 before being listed at $0.06 on markets. With real utility and fast adoption during its initial stages because of its complete DeFi ecosystem offering lending and borrowing services, interest-bearing mtTokens, and even Gamification features for its leaderboard, MUTM is one top crypto you should lock down for potentially high percentage returns before the market’s next boom.

Traders warn that recent moves by long-term holders are changing how the market reacts to stress. Liquidity has thinned, and that makes price swings larger than usual. Related Reading: Dogecoin Goes Wall Street: Grayscale Confirms Nov. 24 ETF Launch Schiff Issues A Stark Warning According to gold investor Peter Schiff, Bitcoin is “finally having its IPO moment.” He said that when veteran holders turn into sellers, supply at the top of the market rises and future selloffs can become deeper. “This much Bitcoin moving from strong to weak hands not only increases the float, but also means future selloffs will be bigger,” Schiff said on Saturday. His view has been repeated by bearish voices for years, but this time the comment lands against clear on-chain moves and big ETF outflows. Traders note that when confident, long-term holders prune positions near local peaks; when many do it at once, price action often becomes more violent. Some argue that after all these years Bitcoin is finally having its IPO moment now that there’s enough liquidity for the OGs to cash out. I agree, but this much Bitcoin moving from strong to weak hands not only increases the float, but also means future selloffs will be bigger. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 22, 2025 Whale Moves And Major Sales Based on reports, whales and early wallets moved over 400,000 BTC in October, activity linked with large selling pressure. One early investor, Owen Gunden, reportedly liquidated his entire 11,000 BTC stake across October and November. High-profile retail figures also sold: Robert Kiyosaki announced a sale worth roughly $2.25 million, saying he bought when BTC was about $6,000 and sold near $90,000, and that he plans to redeploy proceeds into income businesses. Analysts at Bitfinex point to two key drivers of the recent drop: long-term holder sales and leveraged liquidations in derivatives markets. When margin positions unwind, prices can cascade lower before the market finds support. ETF Flows And Retail Sentiment According to Bloomberg and fund filings, investors pulled nearly $1 billion from Bitcoin ETFs in a single session, the second-largest daily outflow among the group of 12 funds. BlackRock’s IBIT led with $355 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC and Fidelity’s FBTC each saw about $200 million leave. Over the past month, ETF products have recorded roughly $4 billion in net outflows. Citi Research figures cited by market watchers place every $1 billion withdrawn at roughly a 3.4% negative swing in Bitcoin’s price. Still, there was a counter-move: reports show ETFs posted $238 million of inflows yesterday, underlining how flows can reverse quickly.

People watching the market will likely pay close attention to what these veteran holders do, because their actions could decide how steep the next crash might be.

According to NYDIG’s latest analysis, the very factors that powered Bitcoin’s impressive 2024-2025 rally have now reversed direction, creating significant headwinds for the cryptocurrency market. This surprising turn of events highlights how market dynamics can shift rapidly, catching even experienced investors off guard. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Decline? The current Bitcoin price decline stems from multiple factors that previously supported growth. NYDIG’s research reveals that market mechanics, rather than investor sentiment alone, are primarily responsible for the downturn. The firm emphasizes that understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the current market environment effectively. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded five consecutive trading days of net outflows, marking a dramatic reversal from the massive inflows witnessed earlier this year. This shift represents one of the most significant contributors to the ongoing Bitcoin price decline. Meanwhile, stablecoin supply has decreased for the first time in months, indicating reduced liquidity in the crypto ecosystem. How Have Market Fundamentals Shifted? The analysis points to several key changes in market fundamentals: ETF outflows: Consistent selling pressure from institutional products Stablecoin contraction: Reduced market liquidity affecting trading volumes Capital flight: Rapid exit of funds following recent market events Corporate strategy changes: Slowing adoption in treasury management Ethena’s USDe stablecoin has been particularly affected, losing nearly half of its circulating supply since the October 10th liquidation event. This rapid capital exit suggests deeper market concerns beyond simple price corrections. The Bitcoin price decline reflects these fundamental shifts in capital allocation and risk appetite. Why Are Corporate Strategies Losing Momentum? Corporate Digital Asset Treasury strategies have recently lost their earlier momentum, according to NYDIG’s findings. Many companies that previously embraced Bitcoin as a treasury asset are now reconsidering their positions amid market volatility. This hesitation contributes to the current Bitcoin price decline by reducing institutional buying pressure. The reversal in corporate enthusiasm represents a significant change from earlier trends. During the rally, companies actively accumulated Bitcoin as part of their treasury management strategies. Now, with market conditions shifting, many are adopting a more cautious approach, waiting for clearer signals before making additional commitments. What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Price Action? Understanding the current Bitcoin price decline requires recognizing that markets move in cycles. The factors driving today’s downturn were yesterday’s growth engines. This cyclical nature means investors should focus on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price movements. NYDIG’s analysis suggests that market participants should monitor several key indicators: ETF flow data: Watch for reversal in outflow trends Stablecoin supply: Monitor for stabilization or growth Institutional activity: Track corporate adoption patterns Market sentiment: Observe shifts in investor confidence The current Bitcoin price decline, while concerning, represents a natural market correction rather than a fundamental breakdown. Historical patterns show that such corrections often create buying opportunities for patient investors who understand the underlying technology and adoption trends. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to drop to $84,000? The drop resulted from multiple factors including ETF outflows, stablecoin supply contraction, and reduced corporate treasury activity, all contributing to the Bitcoin price decline. How long might this Bitcoin price decline last? Market corrections vary in duration, but historical patterns suggest they typically last until fundamental factors like ETF flows and stablecoin supply stabilize. Should investors be worried about the current Bitcoin price decline? While concerning, this represents a normal market correction. Long-term investors should focus on fundamentals rather than short-term price movements. What signs should I watch for recovery? Key recovery indicators include reversal in ETF outflows, stablecoin supply growth, and renewed corporate treasury activity. How does NYDIG’s analysis differ from other market views? NYDIG emphasizes market dynamics over sentiment, providing data-driven insights into the structural factors behind the Bitcoin price decline. Are stablecoin issues affecting the entire crypto market? Yes, stablecoin supply contractions reduce market liquidity, affecting trading across multiple cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin. Share Your Thoughts Found this analysis helpful?

DeFi Lending Explodes to Record Highs Galaxy Research, in its latest report, attributed the continued expansion of DeFi lending to several factors. This includes the growth of “points farming” and airdrop incentive programs, which encourage users to keep loans open even under market stress. Increasing use of improved collateral assets such as Pendle PTs, which allow users to loop stablecoin strategies at favorable loan-to-value ratios, is also another factor, in addition to rising crypto asset prices, which increase borrowing capacity as collateral values appreciate. The report, however, warned that there is potential for double-counting in the combined CeFi and DeFi lending totals, as some CeFi entities borrow through DeFi protocols before lending those assets to off-chain clients, which makes it difficult to separate on-chain and off-chain exposures. With the increase in DeFi activity, this sector’s lending dominance over CeFi venues climbed to a new all-time high of 62.71% at the end of Q3 2025, up from 59.83% in Q2 2025 and higher than the previous peak of 61.99% in Q4 2024. Meanwhile, the crypto-collateralized portion of collateral debt position (CDP) stablecoin supply fell by $658 million, or 7.4%, quarter-over-quarter, though the report again noted possible double-counting involving CeFi entities that mint CDP stablecoins to fund loans to off-chain borrowers. Overall, total crypto-collateralized lending expanded by $20.46 billion in Q3, reaching a new all-time high of $73.59 billion. By quarter’s end, DeFi lending applications accounted for 55.7% of the market, up 588 basis points from Q2 2025. During the same period, CeFi venues held 33.12%, down 36 basis points, while CDP-backed stablecoin supply represented 11.18%, down 547 basis points. Combined, DeFi lending apps and CDP stablecoins gave on-chain lending venues a 66.88% market share, slightly above the prior all-time high of 66.86% set in Q4 2024. The report also highlighted that DeFi lending remained resilient despite volatile market conditions, as outstanding borrows hit a daily record of $43.82 billion on October 7 before easing by only 11.55% to $38.76 billion by October 31. Key Industry Moves In Q4, however, major players invested in strengthening the lending ecosystem. For instance, in October, Ripple partnered with Immunefi to boost the security of the proposed XRPL Lending Protocol and launched a global “Attackathon” that invited elite Web3 security researchers to stress-test the system ahead of an upcoming validator vote. By November, ecosystem expansion continued as leading stablecoin issuer Tether made a strategic investment in Ledn, a Bitcoin-backed lending platform, in a bid to strengthen self-custody, financial resilience, and broader institutional adoption.

This serious security event has raised important questions about blockchain safety and protocol testing procedures. The Cardano chain split represents one of the most significant security incidents in recent blockchain history, drawing federal attention to cryptocurrency infrastructure vulnerabilities. What Caused the Cardano Chain Split? The Cardano chain split occurred when developers conducted what they described as a security test that went terribly wrong. During routine protocol testing, a transaction exploited a deserialization bug in the system. This technical vulnerability caused the blockchain to temporarily divide into separate chains before developers could implement an emergency patch. Four Cardano developers involved in the incident have publicly acknowledged their careless actions. They explained they were attempting to determine if malicious transactions could be submitted to the network. However, they made a critical error by failing to properly test the transaction on the testnet first. How Did the FBI Get Involved in the Investigation? The Federal Bureau of Investigation entered the picture after the Cardano Foundation formally referred the matter to law enforcement. This move demonstrates the seriousness with which blockchain organizations treat security breaches, even when they appear to be accidental. Key aspects of the FBI investigation include: Examining the technical details of the deserialization bug Reviewing communication and documentation around the security test Assessing potential damage to network integrity Evaluating whether proper protocols were followed What Were the Developers Trying to Accomplish? The developers stated they were conducting legitimate security research to strengthen the Cardano network. Their goal was to identify potential vulnerabilities before malicious actors could exploit them. However, their methodology proved flawed when they used AI assistance to directly block traffic on a Linux server without adequate safeguards. This approach bypassed standard testing procedures and created the perfect conditions for the Cardano chain split to occur. The incident highlights the delicate balance between rigorous security testing and maintaining network stability. What Does This Mean for Cardano’s Future? The Cardano chain split and subsequent FBI investigation have significant implications for the blockchain’s reputation and security protocols. While the developers claim the incident was unintentional, the federal probe underscores the importance of proper testing methodologies in decentralized systems. Positive outcomes from this situation include: Increased awareness of testing protocol importance Potential for improved security standards across the industry Demonstration of accountability through law enforcement involvement Opportunity for enhanced developer training and procedures Conclusion: Lessons from the Cardano Chain Split The FBI investigation into the Cardano chain split serves as a crucial reminder that blockchain security requires meticulous attention to detail and proper testing protocols. While the developers’ intentions may have been positive, their execution created significant network instability. This incident will likely lead to improved security practices across the cryptocurrency industry and demonstrates that even well-intentioned actions can have serious consequences when proper procedures aren’t followed. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly happened during the Cardano chain split? The Cardano chain split occurred when developers testing security protocols accidentally triggered a deserialization bug through a malicious transaction, causing the blockchain to temporarily divide before being merged with an emergency patch. Why is the FBI investigating this incident? The FBI became involved after the Cardano Foundation referred the matter to law enforcement, treating it as a significant security incident that potentially compromised blockchain integrity. Was the Cardano chain split intentional? Developers claim the incident was unintentional and occurred during security testing when they failed to properly check a transaction on the testnet before implementation. How long did the chain split last? The chain division was relatively brief as developers quickly implemented an emergency patch to merge the split chains and restore network stability. What is a deserialization bug? A deserialization bug is a software vulnerability that occurs when data is converted from a storage format back into an object, potentially allowing malicious code execution if not properly handled. Will this affect ADA’s price or network usage? While short-term price fluctuations are possible, the long-term impact depends on how effectively Cardano addresses security concerns and restores investor confidence through improved protocols.

He stated that holders with under 500 XRP are in a group with millions of other accounts. The XRP Rich List in his video confirms this. The table shows over 2.5 million accounts with balances between 20 and 500 XRP, while more than 3.4 million hold 0 to 20 XRP. These ranges grab the bulk of the network and set the stage for the steep decline in account numbers as balances rise. Rietveld called attention to this shift by noting the massive drop in wallets holding 500 to 1,000 XRP. The Rich List shows 252,365 accounts in that range. Balances Rise While Account Counts Shrink The next group tightens further. Balances from 1,000 to 5,000 XRP cover 593,297 accounts. The data then moves through smaller segments, such as 176,631 accounts holding 5,000 to 10,000 XRP and 180,723 accounts in the 10,000 to 25,000 range.

At 25,000 to 50,000 XRP, the number drops to 69,262 accounts. At 50,000 to 75,000 XRP, it reaches 28,174. These numbers demonstrate the narrowing path toward the upper levels of XRP ownership, as retail investors get priced out . The Exact Threshold for the Top 1% Rietveld used the Rich List data to provide insight into the top 1% of token holders. In the video, he stated that to reach the top 1%, a holder must have 50,637 XRP. The table shows that 73,143 accounts hold balances equal to or greater than that amount. This value represents the cutoff that separates the top 1% holders from others. It also highlights how quickly the numbers can move, as larger wallet balances are rising .

This crucial market sentiment indicator just made a surprising move, climbing six points to reach 19. However, before you get too excited, understand that we’re still firmly planted in ‘extreme fear’ territory. Let’s explore what this means for your crypto investments and why this reading matters more than you might think. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as the market’s emotional thermometer. It measures investor sentiment on a scale from 0 to 100, where zero represents extreme fear and 100 indicates extreme greed. Think of it as the pulse of market psychology – when fear dominates, opportunities often emerge for savvy investors. This powerful tool doesn’t rely on guesswork. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculation combines multiple data sources: Market volatility (25% weighting) Trading volume (25% weighting) Social media mentions (15% weighting) Market surveys (15% weighting) Bitcoin’s market dominance (10% weighting) Google search trends (10% weighting) Why Does the Current Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reading Matter? At 19 points, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests that investors remain deeply cautious. This extreme fear reading typically occurs during market bottoms or significant corrections. Historically, buying during extreme fear periods has often rewarded patient investors, though timing remains challenging. Consider this perspective: when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hits extreme lows, it often signals that weak hands have already sold. The remaining holders tend to be more committed, potentially setting the stage for a recovery once sentiment improves. How Can You Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in Your Strategy? The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 19 provides valuable context for your investment decisions. Many experienced traders view extreme fear periods as potential accumulation opportunities. However, always combine this data with fundamental analysis and proper risk management. Remember these key points when interpreting the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Extreme fear often precedes market rebounds Combine sentiment data with technical analysis Never invest more than you can afford to lose Consider dollar-cost averaging during fear periods What’s Next for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? While the six-point improvement in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows some sentiment recovery, we need sustained movement above 25 to exit extreme fear territory. Watch for consistent improvements across all the index components, particularly trading volume and social media sentiment. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has proven remarkably accurate at identifying market extremes. As we monitor its movement from the current 19 reading, remember that sentiment shifts can happen quickly in cryptocurrency markets. Final Thoughts on Today’s Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reading The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 19 tells a clear story: fear continues to dominate, but subtle improvements are emerging. This creates a fascinating environment where cautious optimism meets persistent worry.

These token unlocks represent critical moments for investors and traders alike, potentially creating both opportunities and challenges in the cryptocurrency space. What Are Token Unlocks and Why Do They Matter? Token unlocks occur when previously locked or vested cryptocurrency tokens become available for trading. These events can significantly impact market dynamics by increasing circulating supply. Understanding these scheduled token unlocks helps investors make informed decisions and anticipate potential price volatility. According to data from Tokenomist, this week’s schedule includes multiple substantial token unlocks across various projects. Each unlock represents a different percentage of circulating supply, which determines its potential market impact. Larger percentage unlocks typically create more significant price pressure. This Week’s Major Token Unlocks Schedule The period from November 24-30 features several important token unlocks that market participants should monitor closely. Here’s the complete breakdown of scheduled releases: XPL : 88.89 million tokens ($17.3 million) on November 25 HUMA : 168 million tokens ($4.32 million) on November 26 JUP : 53.47 million tokens ($12.6 million) on November 28 HYPE : 9.92 million tokens ($314 million) on November 29 OP : 31.34 million tokens ($9.42 million) on November 30 ZORA : 166 million tokens ($8.6 million) on November 30 KMNO : 229 million tokens ($11.76 million) on November 30 How Do These Token Unlocks Affect Market Dynamics? The HYPE token unlock stands out with its massive $314 million value, representing 2.66% of circulating supply. Such substantial token unlocks often lead to increased selling pressure as early investors and team members gain access to their tokens. However, the actual market impact depends on various factors including project fundamentals and overall market sentiment. Market analysts closely watch these token unlocks because they can signal both risk and opportunity. While increased supply typically puts downward pressure on prices, well-managed projects often see these events as milestones rather than setbacks. The key is understanding each project’s tokenomics and unlock schedule. What Should Investors Consider During Token Unlock Events? Investors facing these token unlocks should evaluate several factors before making decisions. Consider the percentage of circulating supply being unlocked, the project’s historical performance during previous token unlocks, and current market conditions. Additionally, research whether the project has mechanisms to mitigate unlock impacts. Successful navigation of token unlock periods requires strategic thinking. Some traders use these events as buying opportunities if they believe the market has overreacted. Others prefer to reduce exposure before major token unlocks and re-enter positions once the dust settles. Key Takeaways From This Week’s Token Unlock Schedule This week’s token unlocks present a mixed picture with varying impacts across different projects. The HYPE token unlock dominates in dollar value, while other projects show higher percentage unlocks relative to circulating supply. Investors should approach each token unlock individually rather than applying blanket strategies. Remember that token unlocks are normal events in cryptocurrency project lifecycles. Well-established projects with strong fundamentals often weather these events successfully. The most important factor remains the underlying value and utility of each project beyond the temporary supply increases from token unlocks. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are token unlocks? Token unlocks refer to the release of previously locked or vested cryptocurrency tokens into circulating supply, typically following predetermined schedules outlined in project tokenomics. Why do token unlocks often cause price drops? Token unlocks increase circulating supply, which can create selling pressure if recipients choose to sell their newly accessible tokens, potentially driving prices downward. How can investors prepare for token unlock events? Investors can monitor unlock schedules, research project fundamentals, assess historical price patterns during previous unlocks, and consider adjusting positions accordingly. Are all token unlocks negative for prices? Not necessarily. Some projects experience minimal price impact if the unlock was anticipated or if the project has strong ongoing demand that absorbs the additional supply. What percentage of circulating supply is considered significant for token unlocks? Generally, unlocks representing more than 2-3% of circulating supply warrant close attention, though the specific impact varies by project and market conditions. Where can I find reliable token unlock schedules? Platforms like Tokenomist, CoinMarketCap, and project official documentation provide reliable token unlock schedules and related data.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $85,976.32 on the Binance USDT market, marking a significant downturn that has investors scrambling for answers. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Decline? The sudden Bitcoin price movement below $86,000 represents one of the most notable corrections in recent weeks. Market analysts point to several factors contributing to this downward trend. First, increased regulatory uncertainty has created hesitation among institutional investors. Second, profit-taking from recent gains has accelerated the selling pressure. Moreover, broader market conditions and macroeconomic factors are influencing cryptocurrency valuations across the board. How Significant Is This Bitcoin Price Movement? Understanding the context of this Bitcoin price drop requires looking at key market indicators: Trading volume has increased by 35% during the decline The $86,000 level previously served as strong support Market sentiment has shifted from bullish to cautious Long-term holders appear to be holding positions despite volatility This Bitcoin price movement reflects typical market cycles where periods of rapid growth are often followed by corrections. However, the speed of this particular decline has caught many traders off guard. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors?

The candles are hugging the lower Bollinger Band, signaling persistent sell-side pressure. The RSI sits near oversold levels around the low 30s, showing weakness but not yet a confirmed reversal. MACD remains deeply bearish with widening negative momentum. Unless buyers step in, Sonic may retest the $0.10–$0.095 support zone.

The candles continue to form lower highs and lower lows, while the Bollinger Bands show price hugging the lower band, signaling persistent selling momentum. The MACD remains in negative territory with no bullish crossover in sight, and the Balance of Power stays weak, indicating sellers remain dominant. Unless SONIC reclaims the $0.115–$0.120 resistance zone with strong volume, further downside toward $0.102–$0.098 is likely. A bounce is possible but not yet confirmed.

The Bollinger Bands are widening slightly, suggesting rising volatility as sellers remain in control.

Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.5123 price by 2025 and $3.72 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and assessing personal risk tolerance are essential for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity. Why is Sonic (Prev FTM) down today? Sonic (S) is down today because both the 1-day and 4-hour charts show strong bearish momentum, with price repeatedly rejecting the mid-Bollinger Band and trending along the lower band. The 50-day and 50-period moving averages are sloping downward, confirming sustained selling pressure. RSI remains weak on both charts, sitting near or below 40, signaling lack of buying strength. MACD also shows bearish continuation, with the signal line above the MACD line and red histogram bars growing. Together, these indicators show sellers firmly in control, driving Sonic lower. Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $3.11 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $3.72. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic will not approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $5.53. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good, long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast prices could reach between $3.11 and $3.72, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

The plan includes updated tokenomics with stronger token burning to cut inflation and fix distribution issues inherited from the Fantom era.

Among the top coins, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is attracting dip-buyers thanks to growing ecosystem activity, Solana (SOL) is also maintaining investor confidence because of its robust high-performance network even amidst its volatility fluctuations for now. But among all cryptos that are being hotly pursued at this point is none other than Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is rapidly growing to become one of the most front-running DeFi cryptos at just $0.035 and already deep into Phase 6 of its presale stage. MUTM is already beyond 95% of Phase 6 being sold out because of its explosive market interest even at such an early stage and because analysts are increasingly recommending it as the next crypto to explode very soon. Shiba Inu Shows Early Signs of Strength as Buyers Attempt Breakout At the moment, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is range-bound within a strong accumulation range, where buyers are making efforts to overcome weak momentum. One of the most crucial indicators to focus on is when it cleanly breaches above the median Band’s middle region of Bollinger Bands, marking the very first sign of strength to catalyze its mild reversal. When SHIB Moss handles this crucial move to its favor, its enormous task for now is to breach its 200 EMA to validate its significant reversal. Until this is achieved, traders take their time to carefully observe SHIB’s markets. This is also causing investors to probe Mutuum Finance, making it a top candidate for the best cryptos to buy this cycle. Solana Nears its Most Crucial Support Point for This Month Solana (SOL) is now poised to enter a crucial phase because market indicators begin to suggest growing fatigue among buyers as prices remain perilously close to testing the $126 level of support, which is now the last major hurdle before potentially falling to $95. Traders are awaiting developments cautiously because failure at this point may lead to prices falling significantly, but getting past the 20 EMA may just bring prices back to $183, emphasizing just how critical this point is for SOL at this juncture and beyond. Momentum is also beginning to pick up for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), rising as the next crypto to explode. MUTM Presale: Taking Advantage of Investor Storm Mutuum Finance is moving higher and higher in the DeFi crypto market, as it is soon to reach full capacity for its presale Phase 6. The current price for MUTM tokens is $0.035, marking the last stage before entering presale Phase 7, where prices will go up by 20% to $0.04. This project has already cemented its place as one of the most sought-after initiatives for 2025 and has successfully completed Phase 5 while accumulating $18.9 million from 18,140+ participants. Innovation is at its peak while focusing on sustainability and growth strategies to offer a very good investment option to its investors while being one of the most profitable best cryptos to buy before the next market bull run takes place. A New Stablecoin for DeFi Enhancement One of the most significant events for Mutuum Finance will be launching its fully collateralized and USD-pegged stable coin, which will form the foundation for its lending and borrowing marketplace. This collateralized asset provides security for borrowers and lenders alike. With its integration of a stablecoin into its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance provides low-risk opportunities for returns to all categories of investors, whether retail or institutional investors. Another way through which it facilitates growth within DeFi is by ensuring its introduction of a stablecoin improves market liquidity and enhances scalability as well as security within DeFi. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly being identified as one of the most notable top cryptocurrencies to keep your eye on as it passes through this market downturn with Phase 6 of their presale being over 95% sold out among 18,140+ investors to raise $18.9+ million. At $0.035, opportunities to participate remain before entering Phase 7 at $0.04. Utilizing its fully collateralized stablecoin to facilitate lending and borrowing functions and further integrating itself into DeFi makes MUTM the next crypto to explode with strong potential for early investors.

As an investor, staying informed about key financial events can mean the difference between capitalizing on opportunities and missing crucial market shifts. This week brings several significant economic releases that could impact your portfolio decisions. Why This Week’s Key Financial Events Matter for Your Investments Understanding the schedule of key financial events helps you anticipate market volatility and make informed decisions. This week features critical data releases that could influence Federal Reserve policy and market sentiment. Moreover, with Thanksgiving affecting trading hours, timing becomes even more crucial for active investors. Monday’s Economic Indicators: Setting the Week’s Tone November 25 kicks off with the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) release at 1:30 p.m. UTC. This important inflation gauge measures the average change in selling prices received by domestic producers. Watch for: Core PPI trends excluding food and energy Year-over-year inflation comparisons Market reaction to unexpected deviations These key financial events often trigger immediate market responses, making them essential monitoring points. Tuesday’s Data Deluge: Multiple Market Movers November 26 brings a packed economic calendar with three major releases. At 1:30 p.m. UTC, we get both the preliminary third-quarter GDP figures and initial jobless claims data. Then at 3:00 p.m. UTC, the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data arrives – the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Later at 7:00 p.m. UTC, the Federal Reserve publishes its Beige Book, providing anecdotal information about economic conditions across different regions. This comprehensive snapshot helps investors gauge the Fed’s perspective on the economy. How Do International Events Fit Into Your Strategy? On November 27 at 1:00 a.m. UTC, South Korea announces its interest rate decision. While U.S. markets are closed for Thanksgiving, global events continue to shape international market sentiment. Remember that Asian market movements often influence subsequent U.S. trading sessions. Navigating Holiday Trading Hours and Market Closures Thanksgiving brings important schedule changes that affect these key financial events. U.S. markets close entirely on November 27 and operate on shortened hours November 28. Consider these implications: Reduced liquidity during holiday sessions Potential for increased volatility in thin trading Opportunities in extended hours trading Planning around these market closures helps you manage risk effectively during this week’s key financial events. Actionable Insights for This Week’s Trading Successful navigation of this week’s key financial events requires strategic preparation. Focus on understanding how each data point might influence Federal Reserve policy expectations. Monitor bond market reactions closely, as they often lead equity market movements. Most importantly, maintain perspective – single data points rarely change long-term trends. Frequently Asked Questions Why is the Core PCE data so important? The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge because it excludes volatile food and energy prices, providing a clearer view of underlying inflation trends. How do holiday trading hours affect market behavior? Reduced trading volumes during holidays can amplify price movements and increase volatility, making risk management particularly important during these periods. What should I watch for in the Fed Beige Book? Focus on regional employment trends, wage pressures, and business sentiment indicators, as these often signal broader economic shifts before they appear in hard data. How do international rate decisions impact U.S. markets? Global central bank actions affect currency markets, international capital flows, and risk sentiment, all of which can influence U.S. market performance when trading resumes. Should I adjust my strategy for shortened trading sessions? Consider reducing position sizes, widening stop-loss orders, and avoiding complex strategies that require normal liquidity conditions. Which economic indicator has the biggest market impact this week? The Core PCE data typically generates the most significant market reaction, given its importance to Federal Reserve policy decisions.

This significant movement raises important questions about the team’s strategy and what it means for the token’s future price action. What Does the 1inch Team Withdraw Mean for Investors? The 1inch team withdraws 20 million 1INCH tokens from one of the world’s largest exchanges over a 14-hour period. According to on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, this substantial transaction occurred at an average price of $0.1856 per token. This move represents one of the largest single withdrawals by the team in recent months. When the 1inch team withdraws tokens from exchange custody, it typically signals several possible scenarios: Long-term holding strategy – Moving tokens to cold storage Ecosystem development – Preparing for upcoming projects Price confidence – Belief in future appreciation Staking preparation – Getting ready for network participation How Does This Impact the 1INCH Token Supply? Following this transaction, the 1inch team’s address now controls an impressive 111 million 1INCH tokens. This massive holding, valued at approximately $20.34 million, represents a significant portion of the circulating supply. The team’s average acquisition price sits at $0.184, very close to current market levels. The timing of when the 1inch team withdraws tokens often provides clues about market sentiment. Currently, 1INCH trades at $0.1829, showing a minor 0.11% decline over the past 24 hours. This stability despite the large withdrawal suggests market confidence in the team’s actions. Why Should Crypto Traders Monitor Team Movements? Smart investors always pay attention when a project team makes substantial moves. The decision by the 1inch team to withdraw millions of dollars worth of tokens from exchange custody demonstrates their commitment to the project’s long-term success. Such actions often precede important developments or indicate strong belief in future price appreciation. Key factors to consider when analyzing team movements include: Transaction size – Larger withdrawals typically carry more significance Timing – Movements during price dips or rallies tell different stories Frequency – Regular patterns versus one-off events Market conditions – How the move relates to broader crypto trends What Can We Learn From This Strategic Move? The recent action where the 1inch team withdraws tokens from Binance provides valuable insights into project management and token economics. With their average purchase price very close to current market levels, the team demonstrates confidence in their project’s fundamentals. This move potentially reduces selling pressure on exchanges, which could support price stability. Moreover, when a project team maintains significant token holdings, it aligns their interests with those of regular investors. The 1inch team’s substantial position ensures they remain motivated to drive the project’s success and increase token value over time. Conclusion: Strategic Positioning for Future Growth The decision by the 1inch team to withdraw $3.71 million in tokens represents a strategic positioning move that signals confidence in their project’s future. This substantial reduction of exchange-held tokens decreases immediate selling pressure while demonstrating the team’s long-term commitment. For investors, this action provides reassurance about the project’s direction and the team’s belief in their token’s value proposition. Frequently Asked Questions Why would the 1inch team withdraw tokens from Binance? The 1inch team likely withdraws tokens for long-term holding, staking, or upcoming ecosystem development. Moving tokens off exchanges reduces immediate selling pressure and demonstrates commitment to the project. How much 1INCH does the team now hold after this withdrawal? Following this transaction, the 1inch team holds 111 million 1INCH tokens worth approximately $20.34 million at current prices. Does this withdrawal affect 1INCH token price? While large withdrawals can influence market sentiment, the immediate price impact appears minimal. The token remains stable, trading at $0.1829 with only a 0.11% decline. What was the average price of the withdrawn tokens? The 1inch team withdrew tokens at an average price of $0.1856 per 1INCH token, very close to their overall average acquisition price of $0.184. Should investors follow team token movements? Yes, monitoring team movements provides valuable insights into project confidence and potential future developments. However, it should be one factor among many in investment decisions. How often does the 1inch team make large withdrawals? While occasional large withdrawals occur, this $3.71 million movement represents one of the more significant recent transactions by the team. Found this analysis helpful?
