In contrast, the past week showed a drop of 24.02%, and over the past month, it decreased by 6.85%. The current price ranges between $0.00002 and $0.00002779, reflecting recent market volatility. The coin is nearing its nearest support level at $0.000018, which is about 25% below the current price. Falling below this could lead to the next support at $0.00001126, a further drop. On the upside, if demand increases, Pepe could reach the nearest resistance at $0.00003144, about 31% higher. Breaking past this could aim for the second resistance at $0.00003818, nearly 59% above the current price. Technical indicators suggest a possible rebound. The RSI is at 30.42, close to oversold, indicating the price may rise. The Stochastic indicator at 32.86 points to similar potential. The 10-day moving average is $0.00001929, below the 100-day average of $0.00002261, showing a recent downtrend. If momentum builds, the price could move above these averages. The negative MACD level could shift to positive, signaling upward momentum. Dogecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced notable price changes recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 12.87%, settling within a range of $0.36 to $0.46. The past month saw a smaller decline of 2.80%. Despite these short-term drops, Dogecoin has surged by 189.72% over the last six months, showing significant long-term growth. Technical indicators reveal mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.21, nearing oversold territory, which might suggest a potential price rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.36, while the 100-day SMA is slightly higher at $0.39, indicating a short-term downward trend. The MACD level stands at -0.00808, reflecting recent bearish momentum. Looking ahead, Dogecoin’s nearest support level is $0.31. If the price falls below this, the next support is at $0.21. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is $0.51. Breaking through this could lead to the next resistance at $0.62. Overcoming these resistance levels could result in price increases exceeding 10% to 20%. Given its substantial six-month growth, Dogecoin may have the potential for further gains if market conditions become favorable. Conclusion While PEPE and DOGE are notable, XYZ unites sports fans and meme culture, aiming for 20,000% growth and positioning itself as the next G.O.A.T of memecoins.

This comes after the case had been referred to the Commission by an Italian competition authority in September asking if the proposed acquisition would not result in competition concerns in the European Economic Area (EEA). EU gave thumps up to the Nvidia transaction After some rigorous screening, the EU said it approved the proposed acquisition of the Israeli startup saying it did so unconditionally, adding the transaction would raise no competition concerns in the EEA. According to a Reuters article , the EU’s probe into the deal focused on activities that could strengthen Nvidia’s control over GPUs, sought-after chips that could divide and process computer tasks. The EU, however, concluded that the deal would not raise any such concerns in the EEA. Nvidia designs and supplies GPUs for data center applications, while the Israeli startup – Run:ai is a supplier of GPU orchestration software that enables corporate clients to manage their compute infrastructure. “Since Nvidia is a leading producer of key hardware for AI applications used in the EU and beyond, it was important to carefully check whether its acquisition of start-up software company Run:ai may have negatively impacted competition in critical markets which are key for future competitiveness,” said Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for clean, just and competitive transition at the European Commission, in a statement. “But our market investigation confirmed to us that other software options compatible with Nvidia’s hardware will remain available in the market.” Ribera. The statement also emphasized that the two companies’ areas of activity do not overlap, while the EU Commission on the other hand has the authority to oversee mergers and acquisitions of large multinational corporations operating in the EU countries. The EU has scrutinized other big techs apart from Nvidia Nvidia announced the acquisition of the Israeli startup in April in a deal worth $700 million, a price tag that was to be reviewed by the bloc following requests by Italian regulators under the EU Merger Regulation (EUMR). When announcing its plans, Nvidia said the deal would help customers make more efficient use of their computing resources. “Run:ai enables enterprise customers to manage and optimize their compute infrastructure, whether on-premises, in the cloud or in hybrid environments,” Nvidia said in an April 24 blog post. Run:ai co-founder and CEO Omri Geller revealed the startup has collaborated with Nvidia since 2020, adding that both companies “share a passion for helping our customers make the most of their infrastructure.” However, regarding the proposed acquisition, the EU Commission revealed in October that Nvidia would need to get approvals and antitrust clearance for the transaction due to the raised concerns that the deal would undermine competition within the sectors in which the two companies operate. Responding to the EU’s concerns then, Nvidia spokesperson John Rizzo said back then that the company was willing to provide any information to regulators regarding the deal. “After the acquisition closes, we’ll continue to make AI available in every cloud and enterprise, and help customers select any system and software solution that works best for them.” Nvidia. These developments also come as the big tech industry has for years enjoyed minimal oversight on the takeover of smaller rival firms prompting regulators to pay more attention to these to ensure fair competition. Firms like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have also been scrutinized over their investments in AI startups or other tech firms as they expand their AI operations and stay ahead of peers. The EU has probed the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI as well as others like Google and Samsung.

RCO Finance: Which Token Will Deliver The Highest ROI By 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-vs-dogecoin-vs-rco-finance-which-token-will-deliver-the-highest-roi-by-2025/,"With the market on the verge of another altcoin season, experts have selected XRP, Dogecoin, and RCO Finance as the top cryptocurrencies vying for the highest ROI by 2025. This analysis examines the unique features and recent developments of each token, providing insights to help determine which one may deliver the most impressive gains by the end of the decade. RCO Finance: Outshining XRP Price and DOGE? Amid the recent excitement surrounding the anticipated XRP price rally and Dogecoin, RCO Finance emerges as a compelling alternative for investors seeking substantial returns in 2025. More than just a trading platform, RCO Finance represents a gateway to the future of cryptocurrency trading, highlighted by its distinctive features. One of the noteworthy features is its AI-powered robo advisor, which offers personalized financial services that could revolutionize the trading experience. This intelligent software is able to perform the necessary mathematical calculations for tailoring of trading strategies to specific requirements and targets. The AI trading tool gradually learns trading patterns whether for novice traders or seasoned ones to provide better suggestions. This type of system works without human oversight, allowing users to promptly respond to market fluctuations. Additionally, RCO Finance plans to introduce debit cards post-launch, giving users access to a range of DeFi projects. These cards will allow investors to engage with various DeFi initiatives, unlocking exciting new avenues for earning. The DeFi trading platform prioritizes investor security by conducting thorough audits of its smart contracts through SolidProof, a leading security firm. This commitment to safety boosts investor confidence, ensuring users that their funds are protected against potential risks. The XRP Price Surges As RLUSD Takes Off Ripple has launched its stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD ), available on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger. Initially fluctuating 20% from its $1 target, RLUSD has now stabilized. Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, cautioned about a potential temporary shortage that could affect RLUSD and also the XRP price. Following the launch, the XRP price dipped slightly to $2.63, likely due to users exchanging XRP for RLUSD. However, the XRP price is now on the rebound, having risen by 31% over the past week. If this upward trend continues, market experts predict that the XRP price could achieve a new all-time high by Q1 2025. Dogecoin’s “Age Consumed” Metric Hits Record High Amid Price Rally Currently trading around $0.40, Dogecoin is up 7% over the past week after a significant rise in early November. The “Age Consumed” metric , which tracks old coins traded, reached 1 trillion coins on December 16, its highest since October. Experts note that the activity spike on December 16 aligns with DOGE’s price surge. Transaction volumes have also increased since late October, peaking mid-November and again on December 16, exceeding 5.5 billion transactions. Some experts also suggest that the movement of old coins may influence DOGE’s price, potentially leading to a rise to $0.45 in 2025. RCOF Presale: Your Last Chance to Buy Now! As investors speculate on which token—XRP, Dogecoin, or RCO Finance—will yield the best returns by 2025, the RCOF token presale is gaining significant attention. The RCOF token price is steadily climbing as more investors participate, resulting in impressive profits for early adopters. Currently in Stage 4 of its presale, RCOF is priced at $0.0777 per token. The final stage is projected to increase the price to $0.0214, reflecting a remarkable 174% rise. Analysts anticipate that RCOF could reach between $0.40 and $0.60 by the end of the presale, representing a potential growth of 670%. Additionally, holding RCOF tokens could lead to exciting price surges after the launch. The project operates on a deflationary model, meaning the total supply of tokens will decrease over time. This scarcity is expected to significantly enhance the tokens’ value, with projections suggesting increases of up to 10,000x by 2025. With a limited-time 25% discount available using the promo code RCOF25, now is the perfect opportunity to invest in RCOF!

Powered by blockchain and AI, this innovative low cap altcoin aims to transform property investment while offering substantial returns. With projections of significant growth by Q2 2025, the anticipation is growing. But what sets this altcoin apart, and why do the Solana expert believe it could deliver exceptional ROI? Let’s find out the key factors driving the excitement. Why Solana Expert Sets His Sight on this Low Cap Altcoin A Solana expert who turned an initial investment into millions during Solana’s rise from $0.50 to nearly $260 now sees similar potential in a low cap altcoin. Driven by high-speed transactions and low fees, Solana’s success has established itself as a blockchain powerhouse for decentralized apps and has become a benchmark. This expert predicts a new altcoin will deliver exceptional ROI by Q2 2025, driven by Solana’s market growth and trends now evident with this low cap altcoin. The focus is identifying transformative opportunities that mirror Solana’s exponential growth and real-world impact on the cryptocurrency market. PropiChain is Transforming Real Estate with Outstanding Blockchain Investment Features PropiChain is an RWA altcoin reshaping the real estate investment landscape by combining blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and the Metaverse to create a revolutionary platform for buying, selling, and managing property. Its unique features set it apart from traditional property investment methods, and it has started to generate significant attention in the industry. Real estate tokenization is one of the key innovations of this low cap altcoin. This process enables investors to buy digital tokens representing fractional real estate asset ownership. For instance, an investor with as little as $500 can own a share of a high-value property, earning rental income relative to their investment. This makes real estate investment accessible to a broader audience, from small individual investors to seasoned professionals looking to expand their portfolios. Another standout feature is PropiChain altcoin AI-powered predictive analytics tools. These tools provide users real-time data on market trends, property values, rental yields, and occupancy rates. For example, an investor considering a luxury rental property can access detailed insights about its financial performance, helping them make well-informed decisions. This AI-driven approach reduces the risks traditionally associated with property investments and maximizes potential returns. This altcoin also integrates Metaverse technology, allowing users to take virtual tours of properties from anywhere in the world. This feature adds convenience and opens up new investment opportunities by allowing investors to explore properties remotely. Smart contracts are central to this altcoin’s operations, automating key processes like rental payments and fund distribution. This eliminates the need for middlemen, streamlines transactions, and reduces administrative costs. This low cap altcoin blockchain ensures security and transparency in every transaction, preventing fraud and title disputes. With these innovative features, this low cap altcoin addresses the challenges of the real estate market while creating new opportunities for global investors. The Future of Real Estate Investment: A High-ROI Opportunity in a Low Cap Altcoin As Solana traders and crypto enthusiasts shift their attention to this low cap altcoin, PropiChain’s potential for massive growth becomes undeniable. With a projected 50,000% ROI by Q2 2025, altcoin is carving its path in property investment. Its innovative features stand apart from speculative altcoins. Having raised over $1 million in presale, PropiChain is poised for success, with tokens currently priced at $0.011 in stage 2. With a BlockAudit security audit ensuring the altcoin’s safety and a CoinMarketCap listing on the horizon, confidence in PropiChain continues to build. Early investment in this low cap altcoin could prove highly rewarding, particularly for those securing tokens at presale prices. For example, an investment of $800 at the presale price of $0.011 could acquire approximately 72,727 tokens. With projections of 50,000% growth, this investment could see a return of over $400,000 by Q2 2025. Now is the time to copy the Solana expert. Early adopters can gain a significant advantage as PropiChain moves closer to its full launch. Join a community of forward-thinking investors and secure your place in the future of blockchain-powered real estate investment.

This development is significant considering current market dynamics with massive price decline in the last 48 hours. Despite the rapid price decrease, investors have remained unwilling to sell. Low Bitcoin Liquidity and Rising Demand Hints at Looming Storm According to CryptoQuant , an on-chain analysis firm, the cumulative volume of Bitcoin readily available for sale, referred to as sell-side liquidity inventory, is low. Based on the figures, the current sell-side liquidity inventory is at a level last seen in October 2020. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that only 3.397 million BTCs are available for sale across different platforms. These include exchanges, miners, OTC desks, and GBTC. In 2024 alone, sell-side liquidity has dropped by 678,000 BTC. The shrinking supply will impact possible selling pressure and create a tighter market demand. This could lead to a price rally if it continues as demand surges. Will Accumulator Trigger Supply Shock? Meanwhile, Bitcoin demand has grown steadily since late September. Figures show Bitcoin has been growing at 228,000 BTC per month. Additionally, accumulator addresses- wallets that consistently buy Bitcoin but have never sold- are also strengthening their holdings. These addresses have increased their monthly accumulation to a record level of 495,000 BTC. Notably, accumulators are reckoned with in Bitcoin as they contribute to the liquidity crunch. This is because they lock BTC away from circulation. Market observers say their activities contributed to the recent all-time high (ATH) of $108,000 BTC attained this December. Market Chaos and the Path Forward On December 20, 2024, massive liquidation hit the crypto market as over $1 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated within 24 hours. Bitcoin price plunged to a low of $92,281, leaving many investors concerned about the next price trajectory of the asset. The market soon rebounded as BTC resumed its climb and found support at the $95,000 level. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $97,028. Market volume remains up by 8.09% at $116.76 billion. Analysts say this hints at the confidence among some investors who might be buying the dip , anticipating that the coin could reclaim its position above the $100,000 level .

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) says it’s suing the three banking giants and Zelle’s parent firm for allegedly failing to protect people from widespread fraud on the popular payments network. The lawsuit, which has been anticipated for months, alleges hundreds of thousands of the banks’ customers filed fraud complaints and were largely denied assistance, with some being told to contact the fraudsters directly to get their money back. “Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo also allegedly failed to properly investigate complaints or provide consumers with legally required reimbursement for fraud and errors. The CFPB is seeking to stop the alleged unlawful practices, secure redress and penalties, and obtain other relief.” The CFPB alleges widespread consumer losses and security failures on the part of the banks, stating the lenders limited identity verification measures, allowed repeat offenders to hop between banks, ignored red flag warnings from customers and abandoned customers after fraud occurred. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra says the banks, which co-own Zelle, rushed to launch the platform without properly addressing security concerns. “The nation’s largest banks felt threatened by competing payment apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle. By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fend for themselves.” Zelle says it’s fully prepared to defend itself in court. “The CFPB’s attacks on Zelle are legally and factually flawed, and the timing of this lawsuit appears to be driven by political factors unrelated to Zelle. Zelle leads the fight against scams and fraud and has industry-leading reimbursement policies that go above and beyond the law.” JPMorgan Chase has previously said it may sue the CFPB over the Zelle investigation, stating the agency is going “above and beyond what the law requires.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The company announced this in a December 20 post on X, adding that the repayment will be made from exercising its 12th series stock acquisition rights. Details of the 5th Series Ordinary Bonds In a separate post , Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said the money accrued from the offering will be used to push forward the buying of BTC initially planned for 2025 to before the end of 2024. “These funds will accelerate Bitcoin purchases originally planned for 2025 into the current year.” The bond issuance consists of ¥5 billion in total, divided into units of ¥250 million each. The offering will carry no interest and be redeemed at face value, with each bond worth 100 yen per 100 yen principal amount. The scheduled issuance date is December 20, 2024, with the maturity date set for June 16, 2025. The entire security will be allocated to EVO FUND, a private investment entity, and will be subject to redemption provisions. Further, the bonds can be redeemed early if EVO FUND gives written notice at least one business day in advance or if funds from the exercise of the Tokyo-listed firm’s 12th series stock acquisition rights reach a specified threshold. This development follows Metaplanet’s announcement on December 17, 2024, of a separate ¥4.5 billion ($28.7 million) bond issuance that will also mature on June 16, 2025. It means that in just a few days, the company has raised a total of ¥9.5 billion, or about $60.6 million. Bitcoin-Centred Approach Metaplanet’s Bitcoin-centred approach aligns with its strategic focus on adopting the asset as a hedge against economic instability. In June 2024, it acquired 23.351 BTC for approximately $1.6 million, followed by 42.4 BTC for $2.4 million, bringing its total holdings to 203.7 BTC. The company continued to increase its holdings, purchasing 57.273 BTC for $3.4 million and 106.976 BTC worth $6.6 million in October. Additionally, it made a significant purchase of 156.7 BTC in October, valued at $10.4 million. In addition to its buying strategy, the Japanese investment firm recently established a new Bitcoin treasury operations business line. This division will focus on purchasing, holding, and managing the cryptocurrency through various financial instruments, including loans, equity issuances, and convertible bonds. According to BitcoinTreasuries data, as of December 20, 2024, the outfit holds 1,142 BTC, valued at approximately $109.6 million. Its stock has also seen remarkable growth, with shares trading at ¥3,575, reflecting a 58.05% increase in the past month and a 2,134.38% rise year-to-date, based on data from Google Finance.

The Trump-Vance inaugural committee reportedly confirmed it, and it’s the largest crypto contribution they got. The fund, which has already hit over $200 million, will fuel a three-day bash celebrating Trump’s win and VP-elect JD Vance. Coinbase and Kraken each pledged $1 million, while MoonPay chipped in too, though they haven’t shared how much. Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi told FOX Business said: “For the first time, we have a President who truly understands the potential of disruptive technology and embraces the crypto sector. We’re excited to continue to work with President-Elect Trump and his administration to push for long-overdue regulatory clarity and unlock this next wave of innovation.” Setting new records The inaugural committee has already smashed fundraising records. They’ve blown past the $107 million raised for Trump’s first inauguration in 2017 and Biden’s $62 million in 2021. Insiders say the total could hit $225 million by Inauguration Day. Major names in tech and crypto, like Jesse Powell from Kraken and Marc Andreessen from Andreessen Horowitz, are also on board. They see Trump as a leader who understands blockchain’s potential and are betting he’ll make policies that encourage innovation. The president has already proven that he meant everything he said during his campaign. The Trump administration is stacked. Former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, known for being an early Bitcoin believer, will take over from Gary Gensler as SEC Chair. He is expected to ease up on crypto regulations. David Sacks is also joining as the first crypto and AI czar. He’ll work on bridging the gap between regulators and the crypto industry while leading the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Other pro-crypto picks include Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary and Howard Lutnick as Commerce Secretary, both strong supporters of blockchain. Ripple’s moment and XRP’s rise This spotlight on Ripple brings XRP (XRP) back into focus. The token has had a strong year after its legal battle with the SEC ended in a win. A court ruled that XRP isn’t a security, restoring confidence in the token and pushing its price higher. As of press time, it is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, trading at about $2.30—up nearly 500% since the legal win. Analysts are watching resistance at $2.58, with targets of $2.92 and $4.50, while support levels sit at $2.35 and $1.96. Ripple also just launched RLUSD, its dollar-pegged stablecoin, on December 16. Approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services, it’s available on both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger.

During the Dec. 18 episode of the Open Interest show on Bloomberg Television, Saylor voiced his willingness to provide his advice on the digital assets policy to President-elect Donald Trump, either publicly or confidently, if he is asked to do so. Before expressing his willingness to advise Trump on the crypto policy, Saylor admitted that he had already met “with a lot of people” in the incoming administration but declined to specify the personalities nor mentioned if he already met Trump. Is Saylor fit for a position? Since the 2020s, Michael Saylor has been one of the key Bitcoin advocates and investors. Saylor is one who puts money where his mouth is, as he personally spent around one billion dollars on BTC. In 2020, Saylor took to X (Twitter at the time) to announce that he personally owns 17,732 bitcoins and that he acquired these coins before MicroStrategy (MSTR) made the first massive purchase of bitcoins. YahooFinance! reports that currently MicroStrategy owns around 440,000 BTC, which is close to a 2% share of the entire BTC supply. MicroStrategy made headlines on the eve of the latest BTC price peak when the company was included in the Nasdaq 100 index. Read more: MicroStrategy to join Nasdaq-100 Index following Bitcoin-driven stock surge Michael Saylor names Bitcoin an apex property of the human race and has an insatiable thirst for bitcoins. He compares Bitcoin to the territories like Manhattan or Alaska that were bought by the early colonist administration, specifying that Bitcoin is rather a kind of cyberspace. That’s why MicroStrategy aims to own bitcoins in bulk. According to Saylor, buying as much of this “space” as possible is crucial for the United States. This vision speaks to the statement posted by Donald Trump on the Truth Social platform. “We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!” the post reads . Saylor singled out Trump as the most crypto-friendly Republican politician. It seems that Saylor shares the President-elect’s views on Bitcoin. Although not an outright GOP supporter, in September, Saylor made claims that he sees Republicans as a more progressive party when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation. He names regulation pressure decrease, treating crypto as a tool to boost the U.S. economy, and encouraging individuals to pursue their economic aims using digital finance as progressive characteristics of the Republican approach to the crypto industry. What Do We Know About the Crypto Advisory Council? Trump proposed the creation of a crypto advisory council during his now famous speech at the Nashville cryptocurrency conference in July 2024. As of December, not much information about the preparations of this council has been made public. The participating companies’ lineup is not clear yet. However, it has been reported that such brands as Coinbase, Ripple Labs, Paradigm, and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) are seeking interactions with the incoming administration. Allegedly, an a16z rep was involved in advising the Trump team during the presidential campaign. On December 6, Trump introduced entrepreneur and venture capitalist David O. Sacks as the “White House A.I. and Crypto Czar” via the Truth Social post. It’s worth saying that, to say the least, before 2024, Trump wasn’t an avid crypto enthusiast. In the past , the President-elect made a series of anti-crypto remarks, calling Bitcoin “not money” and saying that the value of cryptocurrencies is based on thin air. However, the 2024 Presidential campaign saw a drastic change in Trump’s stance on crypto. He started to take donations in digital currencies, visited a major crypto conference in Nashville where he promised to make America “a crypto capital of the world,” and made several important proposals concerning the cryptocurrency policy. On top of tax cuts for the U.S. cryptocurrency companies, the removal of Gary Gensler from the SEC, and the creation of the strategic Bitcoin reserve, Trump announced the creation of the advisory body with the leading position granted to the richest man on Earth and his passionate supporter Elon Musk. This unofficial agency is called The Department of Government Efficiency, or simply DOGE, a reference to a legendary memecoin, a notorious soft place of a Tesla CEO .

The broader market is still bearing the brunt of Bitcoin’s crash, worrying both investors and speculators. Related Reading: SUI The Rising Star: Analyst Foresees Over $25 Breakthrough Market Overview: A Sudden Change The recent drop in the value of crypto assets has caused around $787 million to be lost through liquidations of different types of digital assets. Dogecoin, which is often considered as a joke, has been among the hardest hit. Approximately $29 million in DOGE liquidations were recorded recently, with bullish positions suffering the most losses, according to CoinGlass data. In a mere 24 hours, the price of Dogecoin plummeted to a low of $0.34 before ultimately stabilizing at approximately $0.365, a 6.05% decline. Macroeconomic issues influencing more general market movements can help to explain this fall. The Federal Reserve’s concern about interest rate cuts has aggravated bearish attitude. For example, Ethereum and Dogecoin followed suit after Bitcoin’s value dropped to the $94k level. A Closer Examination Of Liquidation Issues Approximately $24 million in bullish wagers on Dogecoin were liquidated in the past 24 hours, while $5.93 million in losses were attributed to short positions. The market’s present extreme volatility is underscored by this wave of liquidations. Dogecoin is currently approaching critical support levels, as noted by analysts. Some analysts have speculated that it could fall below $0.20 if adverse momentum persists. Key support levels for DOGE are being closely monitored by market analysts. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that Dogecoin may be oversold, which could indicate a potential rebound if traders are able to effectively defend the critical price zones.

Some analysts believe that DOGE’s capacity to maintain a weekly closing above $0.26 will help to create a recovery rally toward higher goals. Still, the reality of continuous market pressures and unpredictability helps to temper this hope. As they negotiate this stormy terrain, many traders are left wondering how low Dogecoin might fall before it finds solid ground. Given the expected significant price swings in the next days and weeks, all eyes will be on this famous meme coin as it tries to recuperate in the face of a difficult crypto climate.

Usual is a multi-chain infrastructure that aggregates the growing tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) from entities like BlackRock, Ondo, Mountain Protocol, M0 or Hashnote to transform them into a permissionless, on-chain verifiable, and composable stablecoin (USD0). 2. Usual is built around the redistribution of power and ownership to users & third parties, akin to a scenario where Tether’s TVL providers would own the company and the associated revenues.” USUAL is going for $1.43 at time of writing, up 17% on the day. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap is down 6% over the same period.

Ripple is contributing $5 million in its native XRP token, while Kraken has donated $1 million to the Trump-Vance inaugural committee managing the celebrations. Ripple and Kraken Pledge $6M For Donald Trump Inauguration According to a report by FOX Business , Ripple and Kraken are among the cryptocurrency firms contributing to the record-breaking $200 million inaugural fund. The contributions aim to support the three-day celebration marking the swearing-in of Donald Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance on January 20, 2025. Ripple’s $5 million donation will be made in its native XRP token. This reflects the XRP company’s commitment to advancing its presence in the political landscape. Similarly, Kraken, a top crypto exchange , has contributed $1 million in support of the inaugural events. This marks the first time many crypto companies have participated in funding a presidential inauguration. Additionally, President-elect Donald Trump has acted quickly to deliver on his campaign promises to support the cryptocurrency industry. Trump recently nominated Paul Atkins , known for his crypto-friendly stance, as the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Concurrently, David Sacks has been appointed as the first-ever crypto and AI czar, tasked with bridging the gap between the industry and regulators. Sacks will oversee policy initiatives and head the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Showcasing his crypto-friendly stance, the new crypto czar has already outlined plans to investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0 amid growing industry complaints. David Sacks has pledged to address the concerns highlighted by Coinbase’s release of FDIC “pause letters.” Tech and Crypto Leaders Join Record-Breaking Inaugural Fund The Trump-Vance inaugural committee has already raised $200 million, surpassing all previous records. Major contributions from tech giants like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Vlad Tenev, alongside cryptocurrency leaders, underscore the broad support for the event. Each of these tech executives has pledged $1 million or more to the fund. Stressing the importance of crypto industry support for the president-elect, Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi told FOX Business, “For the first time, we have a President who truly understands the potential of disruptive technology and embraces the crypto sector. We’re excited to continue to work with President-Elect Trump and his administration to push for long-overdue regulatory clarity and unlock this next wave of innovation.” These developments come as the US appeals court reveals key dates for the Ripple case. The opening brief is scheduled for March 6, 2025, and XRP company’s answering brief is due by April 7, 2025. The court also set deadlines for the mediation questionnaire and appeal transcripts, marking significant steps in the long-running XRP lawsuit.

Here’s Where Its Headed Next,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-the-ethereum-price-crash-over-heres-where-its-headed-next/,"The Ethereum (ETH) price’s post-US Federal Reserve meeting rollercoaster continued on Friday with prices crashing as low as the $3,100 area before covering sharply to just above $3,400. That leaves the Ethereum price roughly flat over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap , but losses since last week’s peaks just above $4,100 currently stand at around 16.5%. The Fed rocked sentiment across traditional financial and crypto markets on Wednesday after they sounded the alarm about sticky inflation and revised their guidance for easing in 2025 to just two rate cuts from the four they had previously signaled. US equity marketed, which were arguably due a correction following their impressive run to new record levels since Trump’s election victory last month, were hammered at the time. S&P 500 FALLS 3% IN BIGGEST POST-FED DROP SINCE MARCH 2020 — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) December 18, 2024 It’s no surprise then that a risk appetite-sensitive asset like Ethereum (ETH), and cryptos more broadly, also took a beating. However, price action on Friday in suggests the worse might be over, and a period of stabilization and even a potential recovery into the year end could be on the cards. The Ethereum price looks on course to form a bullish dragonfly doji daily candle, which tends to form around the time of price bottoms. ETH also received super strong support as it neared its 200DMA, and there are strong signs that dip buyers are aggressively entering the market to support the price. Even Trump-affiliated crypto project World Liberty Financial’s wallet was spotted scooping up over $2 million in ETH. Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial ( @worldlibertyfi ) spent another 2.5M $USDT to buy 722.2 $ETH 2 hours ago, after the price dropped by ~6%! Since November 30, this fund has spent $47.5M on 6 crypto assets: $ETH , $WBTC , $LINK , $AAVE , $ENA , and $ONDO (tweet ). Of this,… https://t.co/8v3pGVG8Hr pic.twitter.com/Ix3h8Y1hxc — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) December 20, 2024 Assuming no further macro surprises hit in the coming weeks (unlikely given an absence of important US data or Fed events), focus should return to bullish themes such as the incoming Trump administration’s pro-crypto policy stance, and how a 2025 should bring a new golden era to crypto. That means the stage could be set for a gradual recovery for the Ethereum price into the year’s end, assuming the US dollar and US yields stop charging higher. Calls for new all-time highs before the year’s end may not be realistic, but a gradual recovery in the upcoming sessions back toward $4,000 certainly is. Ethereum Price – Wen New All-Time Highs? The Ethereum price’s strong rejection of its latest retest of yearly highs in the $4,100 area has some investors panicking. But they should relax. Firstly, the major theme in crypto right now is adoption – Wall Street gobbling up supply, talk of a crypto industry boom over the next for years in the US, and potentially even the establishment of Bitcoin national reserves, which would further legitimize the nascent industry. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says the Fed is ""not allowed to own Bitcoin"" They weren't allowed to own Corporate Bonds before Covid either. Rules change… pic.twitter.com/3UBBUuKtdF — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) December 18, 2024 So yes, maybe the Fed won’t cut as much as hoped next year, which isn’t as good for risk assets like stocks and crypto as if they cut more. But the adoption tailwinds are set to far outweigh anyway macro headwinds. And macro isn’t even really a headwind anyway – we remain in an environment of a strong US economy at the same time as a Fed that is still inclined to ease rates, which many longer-term minded investors think of as “Goldilocks” for risk assets. Secondly, ETH’s historic cyclical relationship with BTC also gives reason for optimism about the medium-term Ethereum price outlook. In prior cycles (like 2020/21 and 2017), Bitcoin has broken out to new record highs one to two months ahead of ETH. Bitcoin broke out in mid-November, meaning it’s not been just over one month. That sets the table for a potential January surge for the Ethereum price as it follows Bitcoin’s lead. FUD relating to ETH’s recent price underperformance versus BTC and its “poor tech” when compared to rivals like Solana or Sui shouldn’t deter investors. That’s not to say those blockchains won’t perform well, but Ethereum remains far and away the dominant blockchain in DeFi with around 56% of TVL, per DeFi Llama , and has US ETFs plus the backing of BlackRock , one of Wall Street’s biggest players. . @BlackRock buying $ETH while everyone panic selling: https://t.co/FYX6l6bJ9y pic.twitter.com/rB48lRarUj — Ethereum Daily (@ETH_Daily) December 12, 2024 One BlackRock executive recent commented that, rather than launching more crypto ETF products, their focus right now is on promoting their existing BTC and ETH ETFs to a wider investor base.

On a recent episode of the Coinage podcast, guest SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said that she is open to reconsidering in-kind redemptions for spot bitcoin ETFs. (For those who aren’t familiar with the term “in-kind redemption,” it refers to the ability to withdraw the bitcoin you’ve purchased via an ETF into your own custody. In essence, it turns a bitcoin IOU into the real thing.)

It was built to set us free from that system. If Peirce can work with the incoming SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, to facilitate the approval of in-kind redemptions then the spot bitcoin ETFs can serve as some of the biggest on-ramps to Bitcoin, as Bitwise co-founder Hong Kim put it , as opposed to simply existing as speculation vehicles. Bitcoin was born to exist in the wild. It wasn’t born to exist in a Wall Street zoo. In-kind redemptions would allow the bitcoin currently trapped within the zoo the ability to return to its natural habitat. This article is a Take .

This strategic move has sent Rumble stock soaring by 50% in aftermarket trading. The investment, valuing Rumble shares at $7.50 each, will boost the platform’s financial stability and growth prospects. Tether $775M Rumble Investment Sends Stock Soaring 50% Following a recent press release , Tether revealed its decision to acquire 103,333,333 shares of Rumble’s Class A Common Stock at $7.50 per share. The $775 million transaction marks a strategic move into decentralized communications. News of the investment triggered a sharp 50% increase in Rumble stock price during aftermarket trading, reflecting investor optimism about the collaboration. Rumble stock had been experiencing a downturn following Federal Reserve announcements on interest rates. However, the USDT issuer’s backing has restored market confidence, driving the share price upward. This highlights the growing ties between cryptocurrency initiatives and decentralized media platforms. Chris Pavlovski, Rumble’s CEO expressed enthusiasm stating, “This transaction provides an immediate liquidity event for all of our stockholders who elect to participate in the self tender offer. I truly believe Tether is the perfect partner that can put a rocket pack on the back of Rumble as we prepare for our next phase of growth.” These developments come just weeks after the video-sharing platform announced its intention to allocate up to $20 million of its treasury to Bitcoin. The decision reflects Rumble’s focus on diversifying its cash reserves and leveraging Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. $250M Allocated For Growth, $525M For Share Buyback In addition, the USDT issuer has earmarked $250 million from the investment to boost Rumble’s growth initiatives. These funds will expand the platform’s operational capabilities and strengthen its financial foundation, enabling it to compete in the video-sharing and cloud services markets. The remaining $525 million will fund a self-tender offer for up to 70 million shares of Rumble’s Class A Common Stock. This buyback program, offered at the same $7.50 per share as Tether’s investment, provides liquidity for existing stockholders. Rumble’s CEO, Chris Pavlovski, will retain his controlling stake in the company, committing to tender no more than 10 million of his shares in the offer. Additionally, the partnership reflects shared values of decentralization and free speech. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, emphasized the alignment between Tether’s mission to promote financial freedom and Rumble’s dedication to providing an alternative to traditional media. Meanwhile, the move comes as Tether diversifies its portfolio, leveraging profits from USDT’s backing assets, which generated $2.5 billion in net profit during Q3 2024. With this investment, the USDT issuer continues its expansion into sectors such as AI, decentralized messaging, and now, video-sharing platforms. Most recently, Paolo Ardoino revealed that Tether is targeting the end of Q1 2025 for the launch of its AI platform. While specific details remain limited, the platform is expected to integrate privacy-focused Peer-to-Peer AI Agents.

Despite that, 2024 still ended up as a win for the ARB ecosystem . Not only did it become the third-largest blockchain by stablecoin capitalization, it also achieved over $100M in Real World Assets (RWA) tokenization. RWA, stablecoin liquidity, and everything that went right for Arbitrum In 2024 Arbitrum’s stablecoin market cap significantly increased this year, thanks to the enabling environment the blockchain provides. According to reports , Arbitrum added almost $1 billion to its stablecoin market cap between November and this month, positioning it ahead of blockchains like Binance Smart Chain and Solana. As of December 20, Arbitrum has a stablecoin market cap of approximately $6.75 billion and is on track to surpass $7 billion in total value locked. When stablecoin market cap grows on a blockchain as it has on Arbitrum, it typically signals liquidity stacking ahead of activity on the network. There was also a noticeable uptick in the tokenization of RWAs on Arbitrum . At the start of this year, it had less than $100k in tokenized assets, but that stat has steadily grown to around $85 million as of mid-December. Major contributors to this growth include major asset managers like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock,, who deployed tokenized Money Market Funds on the platform. 99% of these tokenized assets are US Treasuries, which is unsurprising as tokenized equities and equity indices have always been a niche sector, with a combined AUM of merely $800k. Investors can access stocks and indices on Arbitrum, such as SPY, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, and COIN. While a majority of those assets are held by externally-owned accounts, the Arbitrum DAO treasury holds 18.4% of the chain’s RWAs, and 10.1% reside in DEX liquidity pools. Why is the Arbitrum DAO holding so much in RWAs? The goal is to create an alternative revenue stream with a different risk profile than ETH and ARB. Ecosystem development and community engagement Arbitrum’s ecosystem recorded significant growth across various parameters. The network’s TVL (Total Value Locked) hit $20 billion, proof of its capacity to scale and innovate. This is thanks to developments like the support for USDC as a gas token for Orbit chains, which facilitated broader adoption and new use cases for onboarding retailers into Web3. Another area that made Arbitrum more enticing to whales is its profitability for liquidity providers. It attracted more users and devs thanks to its shorter block times, which many have lauded. As it stands, Arbitrum One boasts an average block time of 250 milliseconds. However, with Arbitrum Orbit, block times can be configured to go as low as 100 milliseconds if transactions arrive that quickly. The efficiency contributed immensely to the competitive edge the blockchain now has over other blockchains, including Ethereum, which has an average block time of around 12 seconds. Arbitrum stuck around during the bear market, and unsurprisingly, the ecosystem’s community and developer activity have rewarded it with their support. Showcases of its active user base include surpassing a billion transactions on Arbitrum One and the 1 million Stylus NFTs mint milestone. Despite the already strong RWA growth on the chain this year, there’s still significant room for expansion. As it stands, 99% of RWAs on Arbitrum are US Treasuries , which means other industries like real estate are yet to be represented and could be the next in line. Real estate can offer higher yields and tangible value. There has always been global demand for premium properties, which makes it an untapped market with massive potential. Arbitrum’s low fees and scalability make it the ideal ecosystem for RWAs in crypto, and if it intersects with other use cases, it could be set for another great year in 2025.

Speaking in an interview, Scaramucci dismissed the fears of a financial collapse tied to MicroStrategy’s substantial Bitcoin holdings and debt structure, explaining that only a prolonged and systemic Bitcoin crash spanning several years would destabilize the company. Long-Term Debt Structure Shields MicroStrategy MicroStrategy’s financial strategy has attracted attention due to its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions , funded largely through convertible debt and equity sales. The company currently holds $46.02 billion worth of Bitcoin, with an unrealized profit of $18.9 billion. Critics argue that Bitcoin price volatility could jeopardize MicroStrategy’s ability to service its debt, potentially leading to forced Bitcoin sales and market disruptions. However, Anthony Scaramucci emphasized that MicroStrategy’s debt is structured for the long term, reducing the risk of immediate financial distress. “If you really study his balance sheet, he has long, long-term debt, and he has rolling long-term debt,” Scaramucci said, referring to Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s executive chairman. He added that a systemic Bitcoin crash would need to last six or seven years to pose a significant threat to the company’s financial stability. Market Concerns About Bitcoin Price Volatility MicroStrategy’s reliance on Bitcoin as a corporate asset has fueled skepticism among investors. The company’s shares have soared by over 400% this year, driven by Bitcoin’s record-breaking price surges. However, Bitcoin price has recently retreated from its all-time high of $108,000, leading to renewed concerns about MicroStrategy’s exposure to market volatility. Despite this, Anthony Scaramucci believes fears of forced Bitcoin sales are unfounded. “The narrative of him being forced to sell hundreds of thousands of tokens into the market, I think it’s a forced narrative,” he said. Scaramucci attributed this confidence to his Wall Street experience, adding that MicroStrategy’s debt structure is fundamentally different from situations like the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. MicroStrategy Temporary Halt to Bitcoin Purchases Rumors have surfaced that MicroStrategy may pause Bitcoin acquisitions in January due to potential blackout restrictions on share or convertible debt issuance. Such blackout periods are common for publicly traded companies, often imposed around fiscal quarter closings to comply with insider trading regulations. Speculation suggests that the restrictions could prevent Michael Saylor from issuing convertible debt to finance additional Bitcoin purchases. However, analysts believe the potential pause would have limited impact, given the company’s substantial existing Bitcoin holdings and its history of regulatory compliance. MicroStrategy’s next earnings report is expected between February 3 and 5, 2025, with analysts predicting that any blackout period would span January or begin mid-month. The company’s inclusion in the NASDAQ 100 index on December 23 has also raised theories that internal recommendations may have prompted this move. Bitcoin Outlook Remains Positive While Bitcoin’s recent price retreat has sparked concerns, Anthony Scaramucci remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. He acknowledged that Bitcoin could experience corrections of 30% to 40% next year, possibly dropping to $60,000–$70,000. However, he highlighted factors such as the introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and potential favorable legislation that could support Bitcoin’s price stability. “Could it get to $18 trillion dollars in market cap? We believe that it could,” Scaramucci said, while cautioning that the path to such a valuation would not be linear. He also noted that Bitcoin’s growing adoption and institutional interest could continue driving its appreciation over time.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 23:44:00

On Dec. 20, the company announced a $1 million investment in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Following the disclosure, QNTM’s shares on the Nasdaq dropped nearly 10%. Quantum BioPharma, also listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange and Frankfurt Stock Exchange, specializes in biotech solutions for treating neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and alcohol misuse disorders. “The company is now set up to receive financing in cryptocurrencies as well as executing other types of transactions in cryptocurrencies,” Quantum stated, though it did not reveal the specific tokens in its portfolio. More non-crypto businesses are embracing digital assets to diversify their holdings and hedge against inflation. In November, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-over-year, with a 0.3% monthly increase, marking the sharpest rise in seven months. Jiva Technologies, a wellness e-commerce firm, approved a plan to invest up to $1 million in Bitcoin last month, citing its inflation-resistant qualities. Similarly, video-sharing platform Rumble allocated $20 million of its cash reserves to Bitcoin in late November. Hoth Therapeutics, another biopharmaceutical company, added $1 million in Bitcoin to its treasury on Nov. 20. MicroStrategy, which adopted this strategy in 2020, remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 439,000 BTC as of December 2024. Think Tank Advocates Bitcoin Adoption The National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, has pushed major corporations like Amazon and Microsoft to adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies. Microsoft shareholders voted against the proposal during a Dec. 10 meeting, calling it “unnecessary.” Amazon’s shareholders are set to review the proposal in April 2025.

Cardano (ADA) cratered as low as $0.76 on Friday, taking its pullback from recent highs to more than 40% at the time. The Fed triggered a major stock and crypto market sell-off when they issued more-hawkish-than-expected guidance for only two additional rate cuts in 2025 on Wednesday. What just happened? The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points which is exactly what 97% of market participants wanted. But, the S&P 500 just posted its largest post-Fed drop since March 2020, erasing $1.8 TRILLION of market cap. Why? Let us explain. (a thread) — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 18, 2024 Since the Fed’s bearish meeting, ADA futures positions worth nearly $20 million have been liquidated, per coin glass.com . However, Cardano’s strong recovery from intra-day lows in the $0.76 area to around $0.95, which has seen ADA also reclaim its 50DMA, suggests the worst might be over. ADA is currently on course to close out a bullish hammer candlestick for this session. And with macro set to take a back seat into the year’s end, with no further major US economic data releases or Fed events, focus is likely to return to bullish “adoption” talking points. And Cardano has a few highly bullish narratives running in its favor right now. Here is why the price is likely to reclaim $1.0 and start 2025 on the front foot. Cardano Is Likely to Retake $1 and Start 2025 Strong, Here’s Why Trump’s election victory last month sparked a major rally in crypto, but Cardano was one of the strongest performers. That’s because Cardano has been one of the most beaten down cryptocurrencies by the current SEC, who classified it as an unregistered security in 2023 in lawsuits versus Binance and Coinbase. The Trump administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history – the treasury secretary is pro-crypto, there is a new Crypto/AI czar and the incoming SEC chair is also a friend to the industry. Moreover, Cardano’s co-founder Charles Hopkinson may also end up advising the incoming administration. This is a game changer for Cardano, which has until now struggled to garner substantial adoption for its blockchain when compared to rivals like Ethereum and Solana . Cardano proponents are urging the Cardano Foundation to match Ripple’s massive donation to Trump’s inauguration to ensure their spot as a key player in future policy discussions. Cardano should absolutely be donating to Donald Trump’s inaugural fund Match Ripple Cardano needs to do everything possible to be a key player in all of the policy discussions about the future of finance This could encourage even more dialogue & cooperation with policymakers https://t.co/bt6sZJgQ5m — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 20, 2024 Meanwhile, Cardano hopes to accelerate the adoption of its blockchain by transforming itself into the go to BTC DeFi chain by mid-2025. BREAKING NEWS: BITCOIN IS COMING TO CARDANO MAY 2025 – CHARLES ""We're going to get Bitcoin on cardano at most likely may 2025"" Are you not excited? pic.twitter.com/i0SxJdpMhp — Mintern (@MinswapIntern) December 19, 2024 A lot of traders have lined up to short Cardano around $1, per a Tweet from Deezy.eth. That raises the risk of a short-squeeze that could see ADA quickly retake years highs in the $1.30 area should the current recovery accelerate. Looking into 2025, assuming the incoming pro-crypto administration and Congressional session delivers on all the talk, the arrival of a new golden age for crypto could send ADA skyrocketing. A retest of record highs above $3 is certainly a possibility. Cardano Alternative to Consider While Cardano could be setting up for 3x gains in 2025, investors looking to secure larger gains might instead want to consider getting involved in meme coin markets. Well-known meme coins like Dogecoin , Pepe and dogwifhat could all offer between 5-10x upside potential. Alternatively, newer and lesser-known meme coins , whilst riskier, could offer substantially greater upside potential. One meme coin that the team at cryptonews.com is a big fan of is a fun new gamified cat token called Catslap (SLAP) . This highly promising meme coin has already been able to reach a market cap of over $14 million per DEXTools . The meme coin is running a massive $1,000,000 giveaway to users who accumulate the most slap points. With a new meme season likely to hit as markets recover into the year’s end, SLAP could be one of the best-performing memes.

Crypto All-Stars is nearing the end of its presale today, having raised an incredible $25M, making it one of the most successful meme coin presales of 2024. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu continues to push boundaries by integrating Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), expanding its tokens to 12 blockchains. But the coin everyone’s talking about is BTFD Coin, a fresh new entrant that’s creating a storm with its $4.2M presale and innovative features like 90% APY staking and a beta play-to-earn (P2E) game. With over 57 billion tokens sold to more than 6,100 holders, BTFD Coin is quickly gaining traction as the meme coin to watch. Let’s dive deeper into why Crypto All-Stars, Shiba Inu, and BTFD Coin are the best meme coins to buy this week and how each is reshaping the crypto landscape. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Are Running Wild First, let’s talk about BTFD Coin , the meme coin that’s quickly becoming the talk of the town. BTFD Coin’s presale, now in its 12th stage, has already raised $4.2M, selling over 57 billion tokens to more than 6,100 investors. With only 16 presale stages in total, time is running out to grab this coin at its current price of $0.00013. But why is everyone so excited about BTFD Coin? For starters, it’s not just a meme coin—it’s a community-powered movement. The coin’s branding, focused on helping investors “own the dip,” has struck a chord with those looking for smart investment opportunities. Its features, including a play-to-earn game in beta testing and 90% APY staking rewards , make it more than just another crypto. It’s a utility-packed asset with the potential for massive growth. Here’s a scenario to consider: If you invest $20,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’d receive approximately 153.8 million $BTFD tokens. Once the coin hits its post-presale price of $0.0006, your investment could be worth $92,307. That’s a jaw-dropping 361% return on investment! But it’s not just about the numbers. BTFD Coin’s growing community of over 6,100 “bulls” is a testament to its appeal. The coin has captured the imagination of investors worldwide, and its presale success shows no signs of slowing down, making it one of the best meme coins to buy this week. Crypto All-Stars: Presale Hits $25M and Ends Today If you’ve been following meme coins this year, you’ve probably heard about Crypto All-Stars. This project has captured the market’s attention with its MemeVault Protocol, a revolutionary staking platform that allows users to stake multiple meme coins like Dogecoin, PEPE, and Floki. It’s the first of its kind—a multi-token, multi-chain staking platform that rewards users for holding $STARS, the platform’s native token. At a presale price of $0.0016782 per token, investors have had the chance to secure $STARS and start earning staking rewards, with APYs as high as 141%. As the presale wraps up today, Crypto All-Stars has already raised a staggering $25M, cementing its place as one of the biggest successes of 2024. Now, as the presale concludes, many Crypto All-Stars investors are looking to reinvest their gains, and BTFD Coin is emerging as a natural next step. With its promising presale performance and bullish community, BTFD Coin is proving to be the perfect dip for Crypto All-Stars holders to own. Shiba Inu: Expanding Across Blockchains Shiba Inu is no stranger to making waves in the crypto world. Its recent partnership with Chainlink has taken things to a whole new level by integrating the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) into Shibarium, its layer-2 solution. This move allows Shiba Inu tokens—BONE, LEASH, and TREAT—to function seamlessly across 12 blockchains, vastly increasing their utility and appeal. This kind of technological innovation isn’t just impressive—it’s essential. By expanding its ecosystem, Shiba Inu is positioning itself as a leader in cross-chain functionality, which is a major step forward for the entire meme coin space. Despite recent price fluctuations, Shiba Inu’s commitment to innovation and its global community make it a strong contender for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio with meme coins that have real-world use cases. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, Crypto All-Stars, Shiba Inu, and BTFD Coin are the top picks for investors this week. Crypto All-Stars’ presale is ending today, and its innovative platform will undoubtedly shape the future of meme coins. Shiba Inu’s cross-chain capabilities demonstrate its staying power in a competitive market. And BTFD Coin’s presale success, combined with its community-driven approach, makes it a standout choice among the best meme coins to buy this week to secure massive returns. If you’re ready to join the bulls and seize this opportunity, join the BTFD Coin meme coin presale now. With only a few stages left and the price set to climb, there’s no better time to invest in one of the most promising meme coins of 2024. Don’t miss your chance to make this week your most profitable one yet.

According to some market watchers, the flagship crypto’s recent performance resembles its December 2023 trajectory, suggesting that BTC might see a massive breakout soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Peak Between $160,000 And $290,000 If These Historical Patterns Repeat – Report Bitcoin Price Mirrors December 2023’s Performance On Wednesday, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market saw a massive correction after the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announced a 25-basis-point rate cut and signaled fewer cuts than expected in 2025. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped 9.2% from its $108,135 all-time high (ATH), briefly falling below the $99,000 on support before recovering. BTC quickly climbed back to $100,000, surging 2% on Thursday morning to the $102,000 resistance. After the dump, crypto trader Follis suggested that this month’s price action mirrored BTC’s 2023 trajectory. The trader stated that Bitcoin was “repeating the December playbook from last year,” forecasting that a pump to a new high is coming soon. Per the chart, BTC moved within the $40,000-$45,000 price range before breaking out in January 2024. The breakout was followed by a significant 20% correction to the previous consolidation zone, briefly dipping below this range. However, Bitcoin reclaimed the breakout levels in the following weeks and surged another 47% to its March ATH of $73,000. If the largest crypto by market cap continues to follow this “playbook,” then its price could see a correction below $88,000 by year-end before resuming its bullish run to new highs. Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that BTC’s performance in Q4 resembles its Q4 2023 price action. The analyst stated that Bitcoin will likely continue the “slow hoppy grind up before the actual breakout” happens. He recommended “zooming out” as the short-term chart “doesn’t look pretty” but noted that BTC’s price is still “trending up slowly.” Analyst Warns Of BTC’s Daily Close Other analysts suggested that the coming hours will be decisive for BTC’s short-term performance. Rekt Capital asserted that holding the $100,000 support was crucial, as failing to maintain this level could send Bitcoin below the previous key resistance of $98,000. Moreover, a daily close above the $101,000 mark would be necessary to prevent this range from turning into resistance again. The analyst emphasized that “doing so could kickstart a chain of events where BTC starts to lose support level by level.” Related Reading: Sentiment For Ethereum Hits 1-year Low, Analyst Says A Massive Run Is Coming He added that a close above this level would invalidate the short-term bearish outlook. Previously, the analyst explained that Bitcoin is amid the first “Price Discovery Correction,” which tends to happen between the 6thand 8th week of BTC’s post-halving “Parabolic Upside Phase”: As a result, over the next 3 weeks or so, I am going to be increasingly cautious about retest attempts, and given BTC’s history at this point in the cycle, I wouldn’t be surprised to see key levels get invalidated. However, he emphasized that the “Second Price Discovery Uptrend” will follow the big correction. As of this writing, Bitcoin has dipped below the $100,000 support level, registering a 5.1% 24-hour drop to the $98,900 mark.

The DOJ is currently seeking his extradition from Israel, where he was arrested. Panev was arrested in August following two guilty pleas in July from two Russian members of the group; Ruslan Astamirov and Mikhail Vasiliev. The LockBit gang , according to the US Department of Justice, has hit over 2500 victims in 120 countries around the world. These include small businesses, large multinationals, hospitals, schools, critical infrastructure, and government and law enforcement agencies. Notable victims of LockBit include Boeing Co., The Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, and the UK’s Royal Mail. The group has been connected to a string of ransomware attacks, with victims’ data locked up or their systems rendered inoperable until they extort a fee from them. LockBit developer arrested Rostilav Panev worked as a developer and coder for LockBit for approximately five years starting from its inception in 2019 to February 2024. The now-detained developer received approximately $230,000 in cryptocurrency transfers as payment for his work, according to the charges filed by the Department of Justice. LockBit and its affiliates extorted at least $500M in payments from victims and also caused significant losses in revenue. According to Panev’s lawyer, defense attorney Sharon Nahari, he developed tools for the group without any knowledge of the intended use of the software. The superseding complaint received by the DOJ alleges that Panev exchanged direct messages through a cybercriminal forum with LockBit’s primary administrator. His attorney, Sharon Nahari, maintains that Panev corresponded with the group solely through Telegram messages and had no idea about their identity. “The arrest of Mr. Panev reflects the Department’s commitment to using all its tools to combat the ransomware threat,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland also stated that three individuals allegedly responsible for the cyber attacks against thousands of victims are in custody and that the Justice Department will continue to hold all those who enable ransomware attacks accountable. Law enforcement crackdown The LockBit group emerged in 2019. The group was discovered in 2020 when its malicious software was discovered on a Russian cybercrimes forum. In February, law enforcement in the UK and the US seized websites and servers used by LockBit members and associates. The police also obtained victim data and thousands of decryption keys urging victims to reach out to the group for help in recovering their stolen data. LockBit quickly resurfaced after the seizure, stating threateningly, “I cannot be stopped.” Despite their bold stance, the efforts of law enforcement have significantly weakened the group’s ability.
