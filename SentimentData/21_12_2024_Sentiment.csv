Early investors could see pennies transform into millions – so don’t miss your shot at crypto glory! Pepe Pepe (PEPE) has seen significant price changes over the past six months, rising by 67.15%. In contrast, the past week showed a drop of 24.02%, and over the past month, it decreased by 6.85%. The current price ranges between $0.00002 and $0.00002779, reflecting recent market volatility. The coin is nearing its nearest support level at $0.000018, which is about 25% below the current price. Falling below this could lead to the next support at $0.00001126, a further drop. On the upside, if demand increases, Pepe could reach the nearest resistance at $0.00003144, about 31% higher. Breaking past this could aim for the second resistance at $0.00003818, nearly 59% above the current price. Technical indicators suggest a possible rebound. The RSI is at 30.42, close to oversold, indicating the price may rise. The Stochastic indicator at 32.86 points to similar potential. The 10-day moving average is $0.00001929, below the 100-day average of $0.00002261, showing a recent downtrend. If momentum builds, the price could move above these averages. The negative MACD level could shift to positive, signaling upward momentum. Dogecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced notable price changes recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 12.87%, settling within a range of $0.36 to $0.46. The past month saw a smaller decline of 2.80%. Despite these short-term drops, Dogecoin has surged by 189.72% over the last six months, showing significant long-term growth. Technical indicators reveal mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.21, nearing oversold territory, which might suggest a potential price rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.36, while the 100-day SMA is slightly higher at $0.39, indicating a short-term downward trend. The MACD level stands at -0.00808, reflecting recent bearish momentum. Looking ahead, Dogecoin’s nearest support level is $0.31. If the price falls below this, the next support is at $0.21. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is $0.51. Breaking through this could lead to the next resistance at $0.62. Overcoming these resistance levels could result in price increases exceeding 10% to 20%. Given its substantial six-month growth, Dogecoin may have the potential for further gains if market conditions become favorable. Conclusion While PEPE and DOGE are notable, XYZ unites sports fans and meme culture, aiming for 20,000% growth and positioning itself as the next G.O.A.T of memecoins.

This comes after the case had been referred to the Commission by an Italian competition authority in September asking if the proposed acquisition would not result in competition concerns in the European Economic Area (EEA). EU gave thumps up to the Nvidia transaction After some rigorous screening, the EU said it approved the proposed acquisition of the Israeli startup saying it did so unconditionally, adding the transaction would raise no competition concerns in the EEA. According to a Reuters article , the EU’s probe into the deal focused on activities that could strengthen Nvidia’s control over GPUs, sought-after chips that could divide and process computer tasks. The EU, however, concluded that the deal would not raise any such concerns in the EEA. Nvidia designs and supplies GPUs for data center applications, while the Israeli startup – Run:ai is a supplier of GPU orchestration software that enables corporate clients to manage their compute infrastructure. “Since Nvidia is a leading producer of key hardware for AI applications used in the EU and beyond, it was important to carefully check whether its acquisition of start-up software company Run:ai may have negatively impacted competition in critical markets which are key for future competitiveness,” said Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for clean, just and competitive transition at the European Commission, in a statement. “But our market investigation confirmed to us that other software options compatible with Nvidia’s hardware will remain available in the market.” Ribera. The statement also emphasized that the two companies’ areas of activity do not overlap, while the EU Commission on the other hand has the authority to oversee mergers and acquisitions of large multinational corporations operating in the EU countries. The EU has scrutinized other big techs apart from Nvidia Nvidia announced the acquisition of the Israeli startup in April in a deal worth $700 million, a price tag that was to be reviewed by the bloc following requests by Italian regulators under the EU Merger Regulation (EUMR). When announcing its plans, Nvidia said the deal would help customers make more efficient use of their computing resources. “Run:ai enables enterprise customers to manage and optimize their compute infrastructure, whether on-premises, in the cloud or in hybrid environments,” Nvidia said in an April 24 blog post. Run:ai co-founder and CEO Omri Geller revealed the startup has collaborated with Nvidia since 2020, adding that both companies “share a passion for helping our customers make the most of their infrastructure.” However, regarding the proposed acquisition, the EU Commission revealed in October that Nvidia would need to get approvals and antitrust clearance for the transaction due to the raised concerns that the deal would undermine competition within the sectors in which the two companies operate. Responding to the EU’s concerns then, Nvidia spokesperson John Rizzo said back then that the company was willing to provide any information to regulators regarding the deal. “After the acquisition closes, we’ll continue to make AI available in every cloud and enterprise, and help customers select any system and software solution that works best for them.” Nvidia. These developments also come as the big tech industry has for years enjoyed minimal oversight on the takeover of smaller rival firms prompting regulators to pay more attention to these to ensure fair competition. Firms like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have also been scrutinized over their investments in AI startups or other tech firms as they expand their AI operations and stay ahead of peers. The EU has probed the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI as well as others like Google and Samsung.

Powered by blockchain and AI, this innovative low cap altcoin aims to transform property investment while offering substantial returns. With projections of significant growth by Q2 2025, the anticipation is growing. But what sets this altcoin apart, and why do the Solana expert believe it could deliver exceptional ROI? Let’s find out the key factors driving the excitement. Why Solana Expert Sets His Sight on this Low Cap Altcoin A Solana expert who turned an initial investment into millions during Solana’s rise from $0.50 to nearly $260 now sees similar potential in a low cap altcoin. Driven by high-speed transactions and low fees, Solana’s success has established itself as a blockchain powerhouse for decentralized apps and has become a benchmark. This expert predicts a new altcoin will deliver exceptional ROI by Q2 2025, driven by Solana’s market growth and trends now evident with this low cap altcoin. The focus is identifying transformative opportunities that mirror Solana’s exponential growth and real-world impact on the cryptocurrency market. PropiChain is Transforming Real Estate with Outstanding Blockchain Investment Features PropiChain is an RWA altcoin reshaping the real estate investment landscape by combining blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and the Metaverse to create a revolutionary platform for buying, selling, and managing property. Its unique features set it apart from traditional property investment methods, and it has started to generate significant attention in the industry. Real estate tokenization is one of the key innovations of this low cap altcoin. This process enables investors to buy digital tokens representing fractional real estate asset ownership. For instance, an investor with as little as $500 can own a share of a high-value property, earning rental income relative to their investment. This makes real estate investment accessible to a broader audience, from small individual investors to seasoned professionals looking to expand their portfolios. Another standout feature is PropiChain altcoin AI-powered predictive analytics tools. These tools provide users real-time data on market trends, property values, rental yields, and occupancy rates. For example, an investor considering a luxury rental property can access detailed insights about its financial performance, helping them make well-informed decisions. This AI-driven approach reduces the risks traditionally associated with property investments and maximizes potential returns. This altcoin also integrates Metaverse technology, allowing users to take virtual tours of properties from anywhere in the world. This feature adds convenience and opens up new investment opportunities by allowing investors to explore properties remotely. Smart contracts are central to this altcoin’s operations, automating key processes like rental payments and fund distribution. This eliminates the need for middlemen, streamlines transactions, and reduces administrative costs. This low cap altcoin blockchain ensures security and transparency in every transaction, preventing fraud and title disputes. With these innovative features, this low cap altcoin addresses the challenges of the real estate market while creating new opportunities for global investors. The Future of Real Estate Investment: A High-ROI Opportunity in a Low Cap Altcoin As Solana traders and crypto enthusiasts shift their attention to this low cap altcoin, PropiChain’s potential for massive growth becomes undeniable. With a projected 50,000% ROI by Q2 2025, altcoin is carving its path in property investment. Its innovative features stand apart from speculative altcoins. Having raised over $1 million in presale, PropiChain is poised for success, with tokens currently priced at $0.011 in stage 2. With a BlockAudit security audit ensuring the altcoin’s safety and a CoinMarketCap listing on the horizon, confidence in PropiChain continues to build. Early investment in this low cap altcoin could prove highly rewarding, particularly for those securing tokens at presale prices. For example, an investment of $800 at the presale price of $0.011 could acquire approximately 72,727 tokens. With projections of 50,000% growth, this investment could see a return of over $400,000 by Q2 2025. Now is the time to copy the Solana expert. Early adopters can gain a significant advantage as PropiChain moves closer to its full launch. Join a community of forward-thinking investors and secure your place in the future of blockchain-powered real estate investment.

This development is significant considering current market dynamics with massive price decline in the last 48 hours. Despite the rapid price decrease, investors have remained unwilling to sell. Low Bitcoin Liquidity and Rising Demand Hints at Looming Storm According to CryptoQuant , an on-chain analysis firm, the cumulative volume of Bitcoin readily available for sale, referred to as sell-side liquidity inventory, is low. Based on the figures, the current sell-side liquidity inventory is at a level last seen in October 2020. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that only 3.397 million BTCs are available for sale across different platforms. These include exchanges, miners, OTC desks, and GBTC. In 2024 alone, sell-side liquidity has dropped by 678,000 BTC. The shrinking supply will impact possible selling pressure and create a tighter market demand. This could lead to a price rally if it continues as demand surges. Will Accumulator Trigger Supply Shock? Meanwhile, Bitcoin demand has grown steadily since late September. Figures show Bitcoin has been growing at 228,000 BTC per month. Additionally, accumulator addresses- wallets that consistently buy Bitcoin but have never sold- are also strengthening their holdings. These addresses have increased their monthly accumulation to a record level of 495,000 BTC. Notably, accumulators are reckoned with in Bitcoin as they contribute to the liquidity crunch. This is because they lock BTC away from circulation. Market observers say their activities contributed to the recent all-time high (ATH) of $108,000 BTC attained this December. Market Chaos and the Path Forward On December 20, 2024, massive liquidation hit the crypto market as over $1 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated within 24 hours. Bitcoin price plunged to a low of $92,281, leaving many investors concerned about the next price trajectory of the asset. The market soon rebounded as BTC resumed its climb and found support at the $95,000 level. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $97,028. Market volume remains up by 8.09% at $116.76 billion. Analysts say this hints at the confidence among some investors who might be buying the dip , anticipating that the coin could reclaim its position above the $100,000 level .

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) says it’s suing the three banking giants and Zelle’s parent firm for allegedly failing to protect people from widespread fraud on the popular payments network. The lawsuit, which has been anticipated for months, alleges hundreds of thousands of the banks’ customers filed fraud complaints and were largely denied assistance, with some being told to contact the fraudsters directly to get their money back. “Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo also allegedly failed to properly investigate complaints or provide consumers with legally required reimbursement for fraud and errors. The CFPB is seeking to stop the alleged unlawful practices, secure redress and penalties, and obtain other relief.” The CFPB alleges widespread consumer losses and security failures on the part of the banks, stating the lenders limited identity verification measures, allowed repeat offenders to hop between banks, ignored red flag warnings from customers and abandoned customers after fraud occurred. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra says the banks, which co-own Zelle, rushed to launch the platform without properly addressing security concerns. “The nation’s largest banks felt threatened by competing payment apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle. By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fend for themselves.” Zelle says it’s fully prepared to defend itself in court. “The CFPB’s attacks on Zelle are legally and factually flawed, and the timing of this lawsuit appears to be driven by political factors unrelated to Zelle. Zelle leads the fight against scams and fraud and has industry-leading reimbursement policies that go above and beyond the law.” JPMorgan Chase has previously said it may sue the CFPB over the Zelle investigation, stating the agency is going “above and beyond what the law requires.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The company announced this in a December 20 post on X, adding that the repayment will be made from exercising its 12th series stock acquisition rights. Details of the 5th Series Ordinary Bonds In a separate post , Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said the money accrued from the offering will be used to push forward the buying of BTC initially planned for 2025 to before the end of 2024. “These funds will accelerate Bitcoin purchases originally planned for 2025 into the current year.” The bond issuance consists of ¥5 billion in total, divided into units of ¥250 million each. The offering will carry no interest and be redeemed at face value, with each bond worth 100 yen per 100 yen principal amount. The scheduled issuance date is December 20, 2024, with the maturity date set for June 16, 2025. The entire security will be allocated to EVO FUND, a private investment entity, and will be subject to redemption provisions. Further, the bonds can be redeemed early if EVO FUND gives written notice at least one business day in advance or if funds from the exercise of the Tokyo-listed firm’s 12th series stock acquisition rights reach a specified threshold. This development follows Metaplanet’s announcement on December 17, 2024, of a separate ¥4.5 billion ($28.7 million) bond issuance that will also mature on June 16, 2025. It means that in just a few days, the company has raised a total of ¥9.5 billion, or about $60.6 million. Bitcoin-Centred Approach Metaplanet’s Bitcoin-centred approach aligns with its strategic focus on adopting the asset as a hedge against economic instability. In June 2024, it acquired 23.351 BTC for approximately $1.6 million, followed by 42.4 BTC for $2.4 million, bringing its total holdings to 203.7 BTC. The company continued to increase its holdings, purchasing 57.273 BTC for $3.4 million and 106.976 BTC worth $6.6 million in October. Additionally, it made a significant purchase of 156.7 BTC in October, valued at $10.4 million. In addition to its buying strategy, the Japanese investment firm recently established a new Bitcoin treasury operations business line. This division will focus on purchasing, holding, and managing the cryptocurrency through various financial instruments, including loans, equity issuances, and convertible bonds. According to BitcoinTreasuries data, as of December 20, 2024, the outfit holds 1,142 BTC, valued at approximately $109.6 million.

The Trump-Vance inaugural committee reportedly confirmed it, and it’s the largest crypto contribution they got. The fund, which has already hit over $200 million, will fuel a three-day bash celebrating Trump’s win and VP-elect JD Vance. Coinbase and Kraken each pledged $1 million, while MoonPay chipped in too, though they haven’t shared how much. Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi told FOX Business said: “For the first time, we have a President who truly understands the potential of disruptive technology and embraces the crypto sector. We’re excited to continue to work with President-Elect Trump and his administration to push for long-overdue regulatory clarity and unlock this next wave of innovation.” Setting new records The inaugural committee has already smashed fundraising records. They’ve blown past the $107 million raised for Trump’s first inauguration in 2017 and Biden’s $62 million in 2021. Insiders say the total could hit $225 million by Inauguration Day. Major names in tech and crypto, like Jesse Powell from Kraken and Marc Andreessen from Andreessen Horowitz, are also on board. They see Trump as a leader who understands blockchain’s potential and are betting he’ll make policies that encourage innovation. The president has already proven that he meant everything he said during his campaign. The Trump administration is stacked. Former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, known for being an early Bitcoin believer, will take over from Gary Gensler as SEC Chair. He is expected to ease up on crypto regulations. David Sacks is also joining as the first crypto and AI czar. He’ll work on bridging the gap between regulators and the crypto industry while leading the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Other pro-crypto picks include Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary and Howard Lutnick as Commerce Secretary, both strong supporters of blockchain. Ripple’s moment and XRP’s rise This spotlight on Ripple brings XRP (XRP) back into focus. The token has had a strong year after its legal battle with the SEC ended in a win. A court ruled that XRP isn’t a security, restoring confidence in the token and pushing its price higher. As of press time, it is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, trading at about $2.30—up nearly 500% since the legal win. Analysts are watching resistance at $2.58, with targets of $2.92 and $4.50, while support levels sit at $2.35 and $1.96. Ripple also just launched RLUSD, its dollar-pegged stablecoin, on December 16. Approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services, it’s available on both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger.

During the Dec. 18 episode of the Open Interest show on Bloomberg Television, Saylor voiced his willingness to provide his advice on the digital assets policy to President-elect Donald Trump, either publicly or confidently, if he is asked to do so. Before expressing his willingness to advise Trump on the crypto policy, Saylor admitted that he had already met “with a lot of people” in the incoming administration but declined to specify the personalities nor mentioned if he already met Trump. Is Saylor fit for a position? Since the 2020s, Michael Saylor has been one of the key Bitcoin advocates and investors. Saylor is one who puts money where his mouth is, as he personally spent around one billion dollars on BTC. In 2020, Saylor took to X (Twitter at the time) to announce that he personally owns 17,732 bitcoins and that he acquired these coins before MicroStrategy (MSTR) made the first massive purchase of bitcoins. YahooFinance! reports that currently MicroStrategy owns around 440,000 BTC, which is close to a 2% share of the entire BTC supply. MicroStrategy made headlines on the eve of the latest BTC price peak when the company was included in the Nasdaq 100 index. Read more: MicroStrategy to join Nasdaq-100 Index following Bitcoin-driven stock surge Michael Saylor names Bitcoin an apex property of the human race and has an insatiable thirst for bitcoins. He compares Bitcoin to the territories like Manhattan or Alaska that were bought by the early colonist administration, specifying that Bitcoin is rather a kind of cyberspace. That’s why MicroStrategy aims to own bitcoins in bulk. According to Saylor, buying as much of this “space” as possible is crucial for the United States. This vision speaks to the statement posted by Donald Trump on the Truth Social platform. “We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!” the post reads . Saylor singled out Trump as the most crypto-friendly Republican politician. It seems that Saylor shares the President-elect’s views on Bitcoin. Although not an outright GOP supporter, in September, Saylor made claims that he sees Republicans as a more progressive party when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation. He names regulation pressure decrease, treating crypto as a tool to boost the U.S. economy, and encouraging individuals to pursue their economic aims using digital finance as progressive characteristics of the Republican approach to the crypto industry. What Do We Know About the Crypto Advisory Council? Trump proposed the creation of a crypto advisory council during his now famous speech at the Nashville cryptocurrency conference in July 2024. As of December, not much information about the preparations of this council has been made public. The participating companies’ lineup is not clear yet. However, it has been reported that such brands as Coinbase, Ripple Labs, Paradigm, and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) are seeking interactions with the incoming administration. Allegedly, an a16z rep was involved in advising the Trump team during the presidential campaign. On December 6, Trump introduced entrepreneur and venture capitalist David O. Sacks as the “White House A.I. and Crypto Czar” via the Truth Social post. It’s worth saying that, to say the least, before 2024, Trump wasn’t an avid crypto enthusiast. In the past , the President-elect made a series of anti-crypto remarks, calling Bitcoin “not money” and saying that the value of cryptocurrencies is based on thin air. However, the 2024 Presidential campaign saw a drastic change in Trump’s stance on crypto. He started to take donations in digital currencies, visited a major crypto conference in Nashville where he promised to make America “a crypto capital of the world,” and made several important proposals concerning the cryptocurrency policy. On top of tax cuts for the U.S. cryptocurrency companies, the removal of Gary Gensler from the SEC, and the creation of the strategic Bitcoin reserve, Trump announced the creation of the advisory body with the leading position granted to the richest man on Earth and his passionate supporter Elon Musk. This unofficial agency is called The Department of Government Efficiency, or simply DOGE, a reference to a legendary memecoin, a notorious soft place of a Tesla CEO .

The broader market is still bearing the brunt of Bitcoin’s crash, worrying both investors and speculators. Related Reading: SUI The Rising Star: Analyst Foresees Over $25 Breakthrough Market Overview: A Sudden Change The recent drop in the value of crypto assets has caused around $787 million to be lost through liquidations of different types of digital assets. Dogecoin, which is often considered as a joke, has been among the hardest hit. Approximately $29 million in DOGE liquidations were recorded recently, with bullish positions suffering the most losses, according to CoinGlass data. In a mere 24 hours, the price of Dogecoin plummeted to a low of $0.34 before ultimately stabilizing at approximately $0.365, a 6.05% decline. Macroeconomic issues influencing more general market movements can help to explain this fall. The Federal Reserve’s concern about interest rate cuts has aggravated bearish attitude. For example, Ethereum and Dogecoin followed suit after Bitcoin’s value dropped to the $94k level. A Closer Examination Of Liquidation Issues Approximately $24 million in bullish wagers on Dogecoin were liquidated in the past 24 hours, while $5.93 million in losses were attributed to short positions. The market’s present extreme volatility is underscored by this wave of liquidations. Dogecoin is currently approaching critical support levels, as noted by analysts. Some analysts have speculated that it could fall below $0.20 if adverse momentum persists. Key support levels for DOGE are being closely monitored by market analysts. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that Dogecoin may be oversold, which could indicate a potential rebound if traders are able to effectively defend the critical price zones. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Growth In 2025 With Record $173 Million Q3 Funding—Report The Road Ahead For Dogecoin Despite the present challenges, market watchers’ future expectations of Dogecoin remain high. Some analysts believe that DOGE’s capacity to maintain a weekly closing above $0.26 will help to create a recovery rally toward higher goals. Still, the reality of continuous market pressures and unpredictability helps to temper this hope. As they negotiate this stormy terrain, many traders are left wondering how low Dogecoin might fall before it finds solid ground. Given the expected significant price swings in the next days and weeks, all eyes will be on this famous meme coin as it tries to recuperate in the face of a difficult crypto climate.

Two days ago, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Binance, added support for Usual Protocol ( USUAL ). “Binance is excited to announce that Usual (USUAL) will be added to Binance Simple Earn, Buy Crypto, Binance Convert, Binance Margin, Binance Auto-Invest, and Binance Futures at the respective dates and timings listed below.” According to a post on the social media platform X from Usual in response to the Binance listing, the team says the protocol aims to usher in a “stablecoin renaissance”. “9 0% for the Community: Usual is built to empower, with the majority of tokens for users. No VC (venture capital)/Team Dumps: Just 10% allocated to insiders, cliffed for one year. 100% Revenue for the DAO (decentralized autonomous organization): Every $ of revenue belongs to USUAL holders” According to the Usual Protocol’s website , USUAL acts as a governance token performing two major functions: “1. Usual is a multi-chain infrastructure that aggregates the growing tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) from entities like BlackRock, Ondo, Mountain Protocol, M0 or Hashnote to transform them into a permissionless, on-chain verifiable, and composable stablecoin (USD0). 2. Usual is built around the redistribution of power and ownership to users & third parties, akin to a scenario where Tether’s TVL providers would own the company and the associated revenues.” USUAL is going for $1.43 at time of writing, up 17% on the day.

Ripple is contributing $5 million in its native XRP token, while Kraken has donated $1 million to the Trump-Vance inaugural committee managing the celebrations. Ripple and Kraken Pledge $6M For Donald Trump Inauguration According to a report by FOX Business , Ripple and Kraken are among the cryptocurrency firms contributing to the record-breaking $200 million inaugural fund. The contributions aim to support the three-day celebration marking the swearing-in of Donald Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance on January 20, 2025. Ripple’s $5 million donation will be made in its native XRP token. This reflects the XRP company’s commitment to advancing its presence in the political landscape. Similarly, Kraken, a top crypto exchange , has contributed $1 million in support of the inaugural events. This marks the first time many crypto companies have participated in funding a presidential inauguration. Additionally, President-elect Donald Trump has acted quickly to deliver on his campaign promises to support the cryptocurrency industry. Trump recently nominated Paul Atkins , known for his crypto-friendly stance, as the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Concurrently, David Sacks has been appointed as the first-ever crypto and AI czar, tasked with bridging the gap between the industry and regulators. Sacks will oversee policy initiatives and head the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Showcasing his crypto-friendly stance, the new crypto czar has already outlined plans to investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0 amid growing industry complaints. David Sacks has pledged to address the concerns highlighted by Coinbase’s release of FDIC “pause letters.” Tech and Crypto Leaders Join Record-Breaking Inaugural Fund The Trump-Vance inaugural committee has already raised $200 million, surpassing all previous records. Major contributions from tech giants like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Vlad Tenev, alongside cryptocurrency leaders, underscore the broad support for the event. Each of these tech executives has pledged $1 million or more to the fund. Stressing the importance of crypto industry support for the president-elect, Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi told FOX Business, “For the first time, we have a President who truly understands the potential of disruptive technology and embraces the crypto sector. We’re excited to continue to work with President-Elect Trump and his administration to push for long-overdue regulatory clarity and unlock this next wave of innovation.” These developments come as the US appeals court reveals key dates for the Ripple case. The opening brief is scheduled for March 6, 2025, and XRP company’s answering brief is due by April 7, 2025.

Here’s Where Its Headed Next,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-the-ethereum-price-crash-over-heres-where-its-headed-next/,"The Ethereum (ETH) price’s post-US Federal Reserve meeting rollercoaster continued on Friday with prices crashing as low as the $3,100 area before covering sharply to just above $3,400. That leaves the Ethereum price roughly flat over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap , but losses since last week’s peaks just above $4,100 currently stand at around 16.5%. The Fed rocked sentiment across traditional financial and crypto markets on Wednesday after they sounded the alarm about sticky inflation and revised their guidance for easing in 2025 to just two rate cuts from the four they had previously signaled. US equity marketed, which were arguably due a correction following their impressive run to new record levels since Trump’s election victory last month, were hammered at the time. S&P 500 FALLS 3% IN BIGGEST POST-FED DROP SINCE MARCH 2020 — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) December 18, 2024 It’s no surprise then that a risk appetite-sensitive asset like Ethereum (ETH), and cryptos more broadly, also took a beating. However, price action on Friday in suggests the worse might be over, and a period of stabilization and even a potential recovery into the year end could be on the cards. The Ethereum price looks on course to form a bullish dragonfly doji daily candle, which tends to form around the time of price bottoms. ETH also received super strong support as it neared its 200DMA, and there are strong signs that dip buyers are aggressively entering the market to support the price. Even Trump-affiliated crypto project World Liberty Financial’s wallet was spotted scooping up over $2 million in ETH. Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial ( @worldlibertyfi ) spent another 2.5M $USDT to buy 722.2 $ETH 2 hours ago, after the price dropped by ~6%! Since November 30, this fund has spent $47.5M on 6 crypto assets: $ETH , $WBTC , $LINK , $AAVE , $ENA , and $ONDO (tweet ). Of this,… https://t.co/8v3pGVG8Hr pic.twitter.com/Ix3h8Y1hxc — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) December 20, 2024 Assuming no further macro surprises hit in the coming weeks (unlikely given an absence of important US data or Fed events), focus should return to bullish themes such as the incoming Trump administration’s pro-crypto policy stance, and how a 2025 should bring a new golden era to crypto. That means the stage could be set for a gradual recovery for the Ethereum price into the year’s end, assuming the US dollar and US yields stop charging higher. Calls for new all-time highs before the year’s end may not be realistic, but a gradual recovery in the upcoming sessions back toward $4,000 certainly is. Ethereum Price – Wen New All-Time Highs? The Ethereum price’s strong rejection of its latest retest of yearly highs in the $4,100 area has some investors panicking. But they should relax. Firstly, the major theme in crypto right now is adoption – Wall Street gobbling up supply, talk of a crypto industry boom over the next for years in the US, and potentially even the establishment of Bitcoin national reserves, which would further legitimize the nascent industry. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says the Fed is ""not allowed to own Bitcoin"" They weren't allowed to own Corporate Bonds before Covid either. Rules change… pic.twitter.com/3UBBUuKtdF — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) December 18, 2024 So yes, maybe the Fed won’t cut as much as hoped next year, which isn’t as good for risk assets like stocks and crypto as if they cut more. But the adoption tailwinds are set to far outweigh anyway macro headwinds. And macro isn’t even really a headwind anyway – we remain in an environment of a strong US economy at the same time as a Fed that is still inclined to ease rates, which many longer-term minded investors think of as “Goldilocks” for risk assets. Secondly, ETH’s historic cyclical relationship with BTC also gives reason for optimism about the medium-term Ethereum price outlook. In prior cycles (like 2020/21 and 2017), Bitcoin has broken out to new record highs one to two months ahead of ETH. Bitcoin broke out in mid-November, meaning it’s not been just over one month. That sets the table for a potential January surge for the Ethereum price as it follows Bitcoin’s lead. FUD relating to ETH’s recent price underperformance versus BTC and its “poor tech” when compared to rivals like Solana or Sui shouldn’t deter investors. That’s not to say those blockchains won’t perform well, but Ethereum remains far and away the dominant blockchain in DeFi with around 56% of TVL, per DeFi Llama , and has US ETFs plus the backing of BlackRock , one of Wall Street’s biggest players. . @BlackRock buying $ETH while everyone panic selling: https://t.co/FYX6l6bJ9y pic.twitter.com/rB48lRarUj — Ethereum Daily (@ETH_Daily) December 12, 2024 One BlackRock executive recent commented that, rather than launching more crypto ETF products, their focus right now is on promoting their existing BTC and ETH ETFs to a wider investor base.

On a recent episode of the Coinage podcast, guest SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said that she is open to reconsidering in-kind redemptions for spot bitcoin ETFs.

If Peirce can work with the incoming SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, to facilitate the approval of in-kind redemptions then the spot bitcoin ETFs can serve as some of the biggest on-ramps to Bitcoin, as Bitwise co-founder Hong Kim put it , as opposed to simply existing as speculation vehicles. Bitcoin was born to exist in the wild. It wasn’t born to exist in a Wall Street zoo. In-kind redemptions would allow the bitcoin currently trapped within the zoo the ability to return to its natural habitat. This article is a Take .

This strategic move has sent Rumble stock soaring by 50% in aftermarket trading. The investment, valuing Rumble shares at $7.50 each, will boost the platform’s financial stability and growth prospects. Tether $775M Rumble Investment Sends Stock Soaring 50% Following a recent press release , Tether revealed its decision to acquire 103,333,333 shares of Rumble’s Class A Common Stock at $7.50 per share. The $775 million transaction marks a strategic move into decentralized communications. News of the investment triggered a sharp 50% increase in Rumble stock price during aftermarket trading, reflecting investor optimism about the collaboration. Rumble stock had been experiencing a downturn following Federal Reserve announcements on interest rates. However, the USDT issuer’s backing has restored market confidence, driving the share price upward. This highlights the growing ties between cryptocurrency initiatives and decentralized media platforms. Chris Pavlovski, Rumble’s CEO expressed enthusiasm stating, “This transaction provides an immediate liquidity event for all of our stockholders who elect to participate in the self tender offer. I truly believe Tether is the perfect partner that can put a rocket pack on the back of Rumble as we prepare for our next phase of growth.” These developments come just weeks after the video-sharing platform announced its intention to allocate up to $20 million of its treasury to Bitcoin. The decision reflects Rumble’s focus on diversifying its cash reserves and leveraging Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. $250M Allocated For Growth, $525M For Share Buyback In addition, the USDT issuer has earmarked $250 million from the investment to boost Rumble’s growth initiatives. These funds will expand the platform’s operational capabilities and strengthen its financial foundation, enabling it to compete in the video-sharing and cloud services markets. The remaining $525 million will fund a self-tender offer for up to 70 million shares of Rumble’s Class A Common Stock. This buyback program, offered at the same $7.50 per share as Tether’s investment, provides liquidity for existing stockholders. Rumble’s CEO, Chris Pavlovski, will retain his controlling stake in the company, committing to tender no more than 10 million of his shares in the offer. Additionally, the partnership reflects shared values of decentralization and free speech. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, emphasized the alignment between Tether’s mission to promote financial freedom and Rumble’s dedication to providing an alternative to traditional media. Meanwhile, the move comes as Tether diversifies its portfolio, leveraging profits from USDT’s backing assets, which generated $2.5 billion in net profit during Q3 2024. With this investment, the USDT issuer continues its expansion into sectors such as AI, decentralized messaging, and now, video-sharing platforms. Most recently, Paolo Ardoino revealed that Tether is targeting the end of Q1 2025 for the launch of its AI platform. While specific details remain limited, the platform is expected to integrate privacy-focused Peer-to-Peer AI Agents.

Despite that, 2024 still ended up as a win for the ARB ecosystem . Not only did it become the third-largest blockchain by stablecoin capitalization, it also achieved over $100M in Real World Assets (RWA) tokenization. RWA, stablecoin liquidity, and everything that went right for Arbitrum In 2024 Arbitrum’s stablecoin market cap significantly increased this year, thanks to the enabling environment the blockchain provides. According to reports , Arbitrum added almost $1 billion to its stablecoin market cap between November and this month, positioning it ahead of blockchains like Binance Smart Chain and Solana. As of December 20, Arbitrum has a stablecoin market cap of approximately $6.75 billion and is on track to surpass $7 billion in total value locked. When stablecoin market cap grows on a blockchain as it has on Arbitrum, it typically signals liquidity stacking ahead of activity on the network. There was also a noticeable uptick in the tokenization of RWAs on Arbitrum . At the start of this year, it had less than $100k in tokenized assets, but that stat has steadily grown to around $85 million as of mid-December. Major contributors to this growth include major asset managers like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock,, who deployed tokenized Money Market Funds on the platform. 99% of these tokenized assets are US Treasuries, which is unsurprising as tokenized equities and equity indices have always been a niche sector, with a combined AUM of merely $800k. Investors can access stocks and indices on Arbitrum, such as SPY, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, and COIN. While a majority of those assets are held by externally-owned accounts, the Arbitrum DAO treasury holds 18.4% of the chain’s RWAs, and 10.1% reside in DEX liquidity pools. Why is the Arbitrum DAO holding so much in RWAs? The goal is to create an alternative revenue stream with a different risk profile than ETH and ARB. Ecosystem development and community engagement Arbitrum’s ecosystem recorded significant growth across various parameters. The network’s TVL (Total Value Locked) hit $20 billion, proof of its capacity to scale and innovate. This is thanks to developments like the support for USDC as a gas token for Orbit chains, which facilitated broader adoption and new use cases for onboarding retailers into Web3. Another area that made Arbitrum more enticing to whales is its profitability for liquidity providers. It attracted more users and devs thanks to its shorter block times, which many have lauded. As it stands, Arbitrum One boasts an average block time of 250 milliseconds. However, with Arbitrum Orbit, block times can be configured to go as low as 100 milliseconds if transactions arrive that quickly. The efficiency contributed immensely to the competitive edge the blockchain now has over other blockchains, including Ethereum, which has an average block time of around 12 seconds. Arbitrum stuck around during the bear market, and unsurprisingly, the ecosystem’s community and developer activity have rewarded it with their support. Showcases of its active user base include surpassing a billion transactions on Arbitrum One and the 1 million Stylus NFTs mint milestone. Despite the already strong RWA growth on the chain this year, there’s still significant room for expansion. As it stands, 99% of RWAs on Arbitrum are US Treasuries , which means other industries like real estate are yet to be represented and could be the next in line. Real estate can offer higher yields and tangible value. There has always been global demand for premium properties, which makes it an untapped market with massive potential. Arbitrum’s low fees and scalability make it the ideal ecosystem for RWAs in crypto, and if it intersects with other use cases, it could be set for another great year in 2025.

Speaking in an interview, Scaramucci dismissed the fears of a financial collapse tied to MicroStrategy’s substantial Bitcoin holdings and debt structure, explaining that only a prolonged and systemic Bitcoin crash spanning several years would destabilize the company. Long-Term Debt Structure Shields MicroStrategy MicroStrategy’s financial strategy has attracted attention due to its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions , funded largely through convertible debt and equity sales. The company currently holds $46.02 billion worth of Bitcoin, with an unrealized profit of $18.9 billion. Critics argue that Bitcoin price volatility could jeopardize MicroStrategy’s ability to service its debt, potentially leading to forced Bitcoin sales and market disruptions. However, Anthony Scaramucci emphasized that MicroStrategy’s debt is structured for the long term, reducing the risk of immediate financial distress. “If you really study his balance sheet, he has long, long-term debt, and he has rolling long-term debt,” Scaramucci said, referring to Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s executive chairman. He added that a systemic Bitcoin crash would need to last six or seven years to pose a significant threat to the company’s financial stability. Market Concerns About Bitcoin Price Volatility MicroStrategy’s reliance on Bitcoin as a corporate asset has fueled skepticism among investors. The company’s shares have soared by over 400% this year, driven by Bitcoin’s record-breaking price surges. However, Bitcoin price has recently retreated from its all-time high of $108,000, leading to renewed concerns about MicroStrategy’s exposure to market volatility. Despite this, Anthony Scaramucci believes fears of forced Bitcoin sales are unfounded. “The narrative of him being forced to sell hundreds of thousands of tokens into the market, I think it’s a forced narrative,” he said. Scaramucci attributed this confidence to his Wall Street experience, adding that MicroStrategy’s debt structure is fundamentally different from situations like the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. MicroStrategy Temporary Halt to Bitcoin Purchases Rumors have surfaced that MicroStrategy may pause Bitcoin acquisitions in January due to potential blackout restrictions on share or convertible debt issuance. Such blackout periods are common for publicly traded companies, often imposed around fiscal quarter closings to comply with insider trading regulations. Speculation suggests that the restrictions could prevent Michael Saylor from issuing convertible debt to finance additional Bitcoin purchases. However, analysts believe the potential pause would have limited impact, given the company’s substantial existing Bitcoin holdings and its history of regulatory compliance. MicroStrategy’s next earnings report is expected between February 3 and 5, 2025, with analysts predicting that any blackout period would span January or begin mid-month. The company’s inclusion in the NASDAQ 100 index on December 23 has also raised theories that internal recommendations may have prompted this move. Bitcoin Outlook Remains Positive While Bitcoin’s recent price retreat has sparked concerns, Anthony Scaramucci remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. He acknowledged that Bitcoin could experience corrections of 30% to 40% next year, possibly dropping to $60,000–$70,000. However, he highlighted factors such as the introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and potential favorable legislation that could support Bitcoin’s price stability. “Could it get to $18 trillion dollars in market cap? We believe that it could,” Scaramucci said, while cautioning that the path to such a valuation would not be linear. He also noted that Bitcoin’s growing adoption and institutional interest could continue driving its appreciation over time.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

On Dec. 20, the company announced a $1 million investment in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Following the disclosure, QNTM’s shares on the Nasdaq dropped nearly 10%. Quantum BioPharma, also listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange and Frankfurt Stock Exchange, specializes in biotech solutions for treating neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and alcohol misuse disorders. “The company is now set up to receive financing in cryptocurrencies as well as executing other types of transactions in cryptocurrencies,” Quantum stated, though it did not reveal the specific tokens in its portfolio. More non-crypto businesses are embracing digital assets to diversify their holdings and hedge against inflation. In November, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-over-year, with a 0.3% monthly increase, marking the sharpest rise in seven months. Jiva Technologies, a wellness e-commerce firm, approved a plan to invest up to $1 million in Bitcoin last month, citing its inflation-resistant qualities. Similarly, video-sharing platform Rumble allocated $20 million of its cash reserves to Bitcoin in late November. Hoth Therapeutics, another biopharmaceutical company, added $1 million in Bitcoin to its treasury on Nov. 20. MicroStrategy, which adopted this strategy in 2020, remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 439,000 BTC as of December 2024. Think Tank Advocates Bitcoin Adoption The National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, has pushed major corporations like Amazon and Microsoft to adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies. Microsoft shareholders voted against the proposal during a Dec. 10 meeting, calling it “unnecessary.” Amazon’s shareholders are set to review the proposal in April 2025.

With its volatility remaining low, STX has been steady, aiming for a $3.80 value in 2025 after testing essential support levels. On the other hand, Shiba Inu’s technical analysis shows a decline in momentum as its burn rate plummeted by 99.84%, signaling reduced demand and wavering confidence. BlockDAG (BDAG) distinguishes itself with superior mining efficiency, having sold over 14,919 mining rigs and accruing over $6 million from these sales. The network’s X1 Miner, combined with the efficient X10 Miner, boosts rewards by 10x, presenting an exceptional chance for users to enhance their earnings effortlessly. This interesting pairing positions BlockDAG among the best crypto miners. Stacks Crypto Prediction: Will It Hit $3.80 by 2025? Stacks (STX) is progressing slowly but surely, consolidating around pivotal levels. Recent support at $2.06 demonstrates resilience, with Stacks crypto’s prediction foreseeing a rise to $3.80 by 2025. Its gradual ascent might not attract those seeking faster results. While the Stacks crypto prediction suggests the potential for sustained gains, its dependence on cautious, low-risk development may not captivate those drawn to swift innovation. Moreover, the current resistance at $2.31 acts as an impediment, stalling further advances. Shiba Inu Technical Analysis: Burn Rate Plummets by 99.84% Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces challenges as its burn rate has sharply fallen by 99.84%, with only 112,182 tokens recently burned. This significant drop indicates a slump in demand, as seen in its daily volume dwindling to $604 million, trailing behind its meme coin rivals. Recent Shiba Inu technical analysis points to possible recovery patterns, supported by an ascending channel and crucial moving averages. Although a rebound could occur, the diminishing demand and declining confidence question whether SHIB still stands as the best crypto to buy now. Combine BlockDAG’s X1 & X10 Miners for 10X Rewards! BlockDAG is revolutionizing the way we mine cryptocurrencies, captivating miners across the globe with its top-notch efficiency. For instance, the X1 Miner app is reshaping crypto mining, enabling even novices to extract up to 20 BDAG daily from their smartphones—without battery drain. The app boasts over 270,000 active users. In a recent AMA, BlockDAG’s CEO Antony Turner unveiled a thrilling update: linking the X1 Miner with the X10 device could increase mining output tenfold, allowing users to collect up to 200 BDAG daily. This combination promises to amplify your BDAG earnings, potentially reaching $200 daily once BDAG hits its anticipated $1 coin value. Moreover, BlockDAG’s superior rigs are capable of producing up to 2,000 BDAG coins daily. This breakthrough has reignited interest in BlockDAG’s mining solutions, rapidly driving miner sales beyond $6 million with over 14,919 units snapped up swiftly. This endeavor underscores the company’s commitment to delivering the best crypto miners for everyone, from newcomers to expert miners. Additionally, BlockDAG’s crypto presale has garnered over $170 million by distributing more than 17.4 billion BDAG coins. With an initial price of $0.001 in the first presale batch and a current rate of $0.0234 in batch 26, the price has escalated by 2240%. With BDAG coins in soaring demand and expected to hit a $1 valuation soon, mining them now might offer substantial returns. Miners keen on BlockDAG’s equipment must seize this opportunity before they sell out. The Top Crypto Miners & Coins to Keep an Eye On While the Stacks crypto prediction anticipates a gradual rise to $3.80 and Shiba Inu technical analysis shows a drastic 99.84% decline in its burn rate, BlockDAG continues to push the boundaries of mining productivity. With its impressive sale of over 14,919 mining rigs and $6 million in revenue from these sales, BlockDAG is fast becoming the preferred choice for both novice and experienced miners alike. BlockDAG’s ongoing presale, having raised over $170 million, remains a top choice for those searching for the best crypto miners. With its potential to reach the $1 mark in the near future, BlockDAG emerges as an exceptionally lucrative option.

Cardano (ADA) cratered as low as $0.76 on Friday, taking its pullback from recent highs to more than 40% at the time. The Fed triggered a major stock and crypto market sell-off when they issued more-hawkish-than-expected guidance for only two additional rate cuts in 2025 on Wednesday. What just happened? The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points which is exactly what 97% of market participants wanted. But, the S&P 500 just posted its largest post-Fed drop since March 2020, erasing $1.8 TRILLION of market cap. Why? Let us explain. (a thread) — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 18, 2024 Since the Fed’s bearish meeting, ADA futures positions worth nearly $20 million have been liquidated, per coin glass.com . However, Cardano’s strong recovery from intra-day lows in the $0.76 area to around $0.95, which has seen ADA also reclaim its 50DMA, suggests the worst might be over. ADA is currently on course to close out a bullish hammer candlestick for this session. And with macro set to take a back seat into the year’s end, with no further major US economic data releases or Fed events, focus is likely to return to bullish “adoption” talking points. And Cardano has a few highly bullish narratives running in its favor right now. Here is why the price is likely to reclaim $1.0 and start 2025 on the front foot. Cardano Is Likely to Retake $1 and Start 2025 Strong, Here’s Why Trump’s election victory last month sparked a major rally in crypto, but Cardano was one of the strongest performers. That’s because Cardano has been one of the most beaten down cryptocurrencies by the current SEC, who classified it as an unregistered security in 2023 in lawsuits versus Binance and Coinbase. The Trump administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history – the treasury secretary is pro-crypto, there is a new Crypto/AI czar and the incoming SEC chair is also a friend to the industry. Moreover, Cardano’s co-founder Charles Hopkinson may also end up advising the incoming administration. This is a game changer for Cardano, which has until now struggled to garner substantial adoption for its blockchain when compared to rivals like Ethereum and Solana . Cardano proponents are urging the Cardano Foundation to match Ripple’s massive donation to Trump’s inauguration to ensure their spot as a key player in future policy discussions. Cardano should absolutely be donating to Donald Trump’s inaugural fund Match Ripple Cardano needs to do everything possible to be a key player in all of the policy discussions about the future of finance This could encourage even more dialogue & cooperation with policymakers https://t.co/bt6sZJgQ5m — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 20, 2024 Meanwhile, Cardano hopes to accelerate the adoption of its blockchain by transforming itself into the go to BTC DeFi chain by mid-2025. BREAKING NEWS: BITCOIN IS COMING TO CARDANO MAY 2025 – CHARLES ""We're going to get Bitcoin on cardano at most likely may 2025"" Are you not excited? pic.twitter.com/i0SxJdpMhp — Mintern (@MinswapIntern) December 19, 2024 A lot of traders have lined up to short Cardano around $1, per a Tweet from Deezy.eth. That raises the risk of a short-squeeze that could see ADA quickly retake years highs in the $1.30 area should the current recovery accelerate. Looking into 2025, assuming the incoming pro-crypto administration and Congressional session delivers on all the talk, the arrival of a new golden age for crypto could send ADA skyrocketing. A retest of record highs above $3 is certainly a possibility. Cardano Alternative to Consider While Cardano could be setting up for 3x gains in 2025, investors looking to secure larger gains might instead want to consider getting involved in meme coin markets. Well-known meme coins like Dogecoin , Pepe and dogwifhat could all offer between 5-10x upside potential. Alternatively, newer and lesser-known meme coins , whilst riskier, could offer substantially greater upside potential. One meme coin that the team at cryptonews.com is a big fan of is a fun new gamified cat token called Catslap (SLAP) . This highly promising meme coin has already been able to reach a market cap of over $14 million per DEXTools . The meme coin is running a massive $1,000,000 giveaway to users who accumulate the most slap points. With a new meme season likely to hit as markets recover into the year’s end, SLAP could be one of the best-performing memes.

This Trending Meme Coin Presale Is Reviving the Trust in Bulls,https://thenewscrypto.com/neiro-feeling-stale-this-trending-meme-coin-presale-is-reviving-the-trust-in-bulls/,"Meme coins have long been the cheeky underdogs of the crypto world. What started with Dogecoin as a playful experiment has turned into a full-blown phenomenon, drawing millions of investors and community members worldwide. These coins don’t just rely on humour; they’ve evolved into serious contenders with real utility and innovative ecosystems. In 2024, meme coins are making headlines again, with BTFD Coin (BTFD) leading the charge. BTFD Coin is rewriting the rules of what meme coins can achieve. Its combination of a Play 2 Earn game, a generous referral programme, and a staking system offering a whopping 90% APY has positioned it as the trending meme coin presale to watch. With analysts predicting stellar returns, BTFD is raising the bar for what’s possible in the meme coin space. But how does it compare to Neiro, another community favourite? Let’s take a closer look. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Setting New Standards in Meme Coins BTFD Coin isn’t just riding the meme coin wave; it’s creating its own. With a presale that’s already raised over $4.2 million and sold more than 57 billion coins to over 6,100 holders, BTFD has surged to Stage 12 in record time. Each coin is currently priced at $0.00013, with a post-presale listing set at $0.0006. The potential for profit has investors clamouring to join before the presale ends. One of BTFD’s standout features is its Play 2 Earn game. The beta version launched during Stage 10, offering a glimpse into the engaging, reward-driven gameplay that’s on the horizon. While the beta doesn’t offer rewards yet, it’s building anticipation for the full launch. Add to that the referral programme, which rewards users for bringing in new investors, and you’ve got a community-focused ecosystem that’s primed for growth. Staking is where BTFD truly shines. With an APY of 90%, staking went live on December 2, giving holders an unmatched opportunity to grow their assets passively. The Bulls Squad, an exclusive group for top-tier investors, adds another layer of excitement by offering perks that go beyond the typical meme coin experience. To put the potential returns in perspective, imagine investing $100,000 in Stage 12 at $0.00013 per coin. That would secure you approximately 769,230,769 coins. When BTFD lists at $0.0006 post-presale, your investment would balloon to $461,538, a gain of $361,538. It’s numbers like these that have made BTFD the trending meme coin presale investors can’t ignore. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin is redefining meme coin potential with its robust ecosystem, impressive presale performance, and unmatched ROI potential. Neiro (NEIRO): A Community-Driven Contender Neiro emerged as a favourite among meme coin enthusiasts earlier this year. Rooted in community-driven innovation, Neiro focuses on fostering a decentralised ecosystem that empowers its holders. Its playful branding and loyal fanbase have helped it carve out a niche in the meme coin world. One of Neiro’s unique selling points is its community voting mechanism, which allows holders to influence the coin’s direction. This democratic approach has been a hit with investors looking for more transparency and involvement in their crypto projects. Neiro also introduced its own NFT collection, featuring playful designs that have resonated with its audience. However, Neiro has faced challenges in maintaining momentum. While its launch was met with enthusiasm, its utility hasn’t expanded as quickly as some investors had hoped. Analysts note that while Neiro has strong community support, it needs to innovate further to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market. Why did this coin make it to this list? Neiro’s community-focused approach and early success make it a worthy contender in the meme coin space. Conclusion: BTFD Coin or Neiro? Meme coins are no longer just about laughs; they’re about innovation, community, and opportunity. While Neiro has established itself as a community-driven project, BTFD Coin is taking things to the next level with its groundbreaking ecosystem and impressive presale performance. If you’re looking for a project that combines entertainment with real earning potential, BTFD Coin is the clear choice. Its Play 2 Earn game, 90% APY on staking, and referral programme make it the trending meme coin presale that’s capturing the crypto world’s attention. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin’s presale . Join now and be part of the future of meme coins.

Crypto All-Stars is nearing the end of its presale today, having raised an incredible $25M, making it one of the most successful meme coin presales of 2024. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu continues to push boundaries by integrating Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), expanding its tokens to 12 blockchains. But the coin everyone’s talking about is BTFD Coin, a fresh new entrant that’s creating a storm with its $4.2M presale and innovative features like 90% APY staking and a beta play-to-earn (P2E) game. With over 57 billion tokens sold to more than 6,100 holders, BTFD Coin is quickly gaining traction as the meme coin to watch. Let’s dive deeper into why Crypto All-Stars, Shiba Inu, and BTFD Coin are the best meme coins to buy this week and how each is reshaping the crypto landscape. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Are Running Wild First, let’s talk about BTFD Coin , the meme coin that’s quickly becoming the talk of the town. BTFD Coin’s presale, now in its 12th stage, has already raised $4.2M, selling over 57 billion tokens to more than 6,100 investors. With only 16 presale stages in total, time is running out to grab this coin at its current price of $0.00013. But why is everyone so excited about BTFD Coin? For starters, it’s not just a meme coin—it’s a community-powered movement. The coin’s branding, focused on helping investors “own the dip,” has struck a chord with those looking for smart investment opportunities. Its features, including a play-to-earn game in beta testing and 90% APY staking rewards , make it more than just another crypto. It’s a utility-packed asset with the potential for massive growth. Here’s a scenario to consider: If you invest $20,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’d receive approximately 153.8 million $BTFD tokens. Once the coin hits its post-presale price of $0.0006, your investment could be worth $92,307. That’s a jaw-dropping 361% return on investment! But it’s not just about the numbers. BTFD Coin’s growing community of over 6,100 “bulls” is a testament to its appeal. The coin has captured the imagination of investors worldwide, and its presale success shows no signs of slowing down, making it one of the best meme coins to buy this week. Crypto All-Stars: Presale Hits $25M and Ends Today If you’ve been following meme coins this year, you’ve probably heard about Crypto All-Stars. This project has captured the market’s attention with its MemeVault Protocol, a revolutionary staking platform that allows users to stake multiple meme coins like Dogecoin, PEPE, and Floki. It’s the first of its kind—a multi-token, multi-chain staking platform that rewards users for holding $STARS, the platform’s native token.

According to some market watchers, the flagship crypto’s recent performance resembles its December 2023 trajectory, suggesting that BTC might see a massive breakout soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Peak Between $160,000 And $290,000 If These Historical Patterns Repeat – Report Bitcoin Price Mirrors December 2023’s Performance On Wednesday, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market saw a massive correction after the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announced a 25-basis-point rate cut and signaled fewer cuts than expected in 2025. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped 9.2% from its $108,135 all-time high (ATH), briefly falling below the $99,000 on support before recovering. BTC quickly climbed back to $100,000, surging 2% on Thursday morning to the $102,000 resistance. After the dump, crypto trader Follis suggested that this month’s price action mirrored BTC’s 2023 trajectory. The trader stated that Bitcoin was “repeating the December playbook from last year,” forecasting that a pump to a new high is coming soon. Per the chart, BTC moved within the $40,000-$45,000 price range before breaking out in January 2024. The breakout was followed by a significant 20% correction to the previous consolidation zone, briefly dipping below this range. However, Bitcoin reclaimed the breakout levels in the following weeks and surged another 47% to its March ATH of $73,000. If the largest crypto by market cap continues to follow this “playbook,” then its price could see a correction below $88,000 by year-end before resuming its bullish run to new highs. Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that BTC’s performance in Q4 resembles its Q4 2023 price action. The analyst stated that Bitcoin will likely continue the “slow hoppy grind up before the actual breakout” happens. He recommended “zooming out” as the short-term chart “doesn’t look pretty” but noted that BTC’s price is still “trending up slowly.” Analyst Warns Of BTC’s Daily Close Other analysts suggested that the coming hours will be decisive for BTC’s short-term performance. Rekt Capital asserted that holding the $100,000 support was crucial, as failing to maintain this level could send Bitcoin below the previous key resistance of $98,000. Moreover, a daily close above the $101,000 mark would be necessary to prevent this range from turning into resistance again. The analyst emphasized that “doing so could kickstart a chain of events where BTC starts to lose support level by level.” Related Reading: Sentiment For Ethereum Hits 1-year Low, Analyst Says A Massive Run Is Coming He added that a close above this level would invalidate the short-term bearish outlook. Previously, the analyst explained that Bitcoin is amid the first “Price Discovery Correction,” which tends to happen between the 6thand 8th week of BTC’s post-halving “Parabolic Upside Phase”: As a result, over the next 3 weeks or so, I am going to be increasingly cautious about retest attempts, and given BTC’s history at this point in the cycle, I wouldn’t be surprised to see key levels get invalidated. However, he emphasized that the “Second Price Discovery Uptrend” will follow the big correction. As of this writing, Bitcoin has dipped below the $100,000 support level, registering a 5.1% 24-hour drop to the $98,900 mark.

The DOJ is currently seeking his extradition from Israel, where he was arrested. Panev was arrested in August following two guilty pleas in July from two Russian members of the group; Ruslan Astamirov and Mikhail Vasiliev. The LockBit gang , according to the US Department of Justice, has hit over 2500 victims in 120 countries around the world. These include small businesses, large multinationals, hospitals, schools, critical infrastructure, and government and law enforcement agencies. Notable victims of LockBit include Boeing Co., The Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, and the UK’s Royal Mail. The group has been connected to a string of ransomware attacks, with victims’ data locked up or their systems rendered inoperable until they extort a fee from them. LockBit developer arrested Rostilav Panev worked as a developer and coder for LockBit for approximately five years starting from its inception in 2019 to February 2024. The now-detained developer received approximately $230,000 in cryptocurrency transfers as payment for his work, according to the charges filed by the Department of Justice. LockBit and its affiliates extorted at least $500M in payments from victims and also caused significant losses in revenue. According to Panev’s lawyer, defense attorney Sharon Nahari, he developed tools for the group without any knowledge of the intended use of the software. The superseding complaint received by the DOJ alleges that Panev exchanged direct messages through a cybercriminal forum with LockBit’s primary administrator. His attorney, Sharon Nahari, maintains that Panev corresponded with the group solely through Telegram messages and had no idea about their identity. “The arrest of Mr. Panev reflects the Department’s commitment to using all its tools to combat the ransomware threat,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland also stated that three individuals allegedly responsible for the cyber attacks against thousands of victims are in custody and that the Justice Department will continue to hold all those who enable ransomware attacks accountable. Law enforcement crackdown The LockBit group emerged in 2019. The group was discovered in 2020 when its malicious software was discovered on a Russian cybercrimes forum. In February, law enforcement in the UK and the US seized websites and servers used by LockBit members and associates. The police also obtained victim data and thousands of decryption keys urging victims to reach out to the group for help in recovering their stolen data. LockBit quickly resurfaced after the seizure, stating threateningly, “I cannot be stopped.” Despite their bold stance, the efforts of law enforcement have significantly weakened the group’s ability.

The research firm Cerulli Associates says $105 trillion will be passed on to heirs by 2048, while charities will receive $18 trillion over the same period. Baby Boomers, the Silent Generation and other older generations will be the major benefactors. “Nearly $100 trillion will be transferred from Baby Boomers and older generations, representing 81% of all transfers. More than 50% of the overall total volume of transfers ($62 trillion) is expected to come from those who are currently high-net-worth (HNW) and ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW), which together make up only 2% of all households.” Over the short term, generation X will benefit more than Millennials from the Great Wealth Transfer. “Millennials will be inheriting the most of any generation over the course of the next 25 years ($46 trillion). However, Gen X stands to inherit the greatest portion of assets in the next 10 years, totaling $14 trillion to Millennials’ $8 trillion.” Widows in the Baby Boomer and the Silent Generation as well as other older generations are set to receive about 38% of the wealth before it can get to heirs and charities, according to the report. “Projections of horizontal, or intra-generational, transfers show that $54 trillion will be passed on to spouses before eventually transferring intergenerationally to heirs and to charities. Nearly $40 trillion of these spousal transfers will be going to widowed women in the Baby Boomer and older generations…” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK.

This sudden pullback has sent shockwaves across the crypto market, shifting sentiment from extreme bullishness to uncertainty and even fear. The sell-off has been particularly brutal for altcoins, many of which are bleeding hard as Bitcoin struggles to regain momentum. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal Cardano Whales Are ‘Buying The Dip’ – Details Key metrics from CryptoQuant highlight the gravity of the situation, with realized losses totaling $28.9 million—an alarming 3.2 times higher than the weekly average. This spike in realized losses suggests that some investors exit positions as the market recalibrates after weeks of aggressive upward movement. The big question now is whether this is simply a healthy correction in an otherwise bullish trend or the start of a larger downtrend. Traders are closely watching Bitcoin’s ability to hold critical support levels and the behavior of altcoins, which often amplify Bitcoin’s price movements. For now, the market remains at a crossroads, with the coming days likely to reveal whether Bitcoin can recover and resume its uptrend—or if this correction signals a more prolonged period of weakness. Bitcoin Facing Selling Pressure Bitcoin is under significant selling pressure after two days of aggressive bearish activity, marking a pivotal moment for the market. The sudden sentiment shift has caused many analysts and investors to turn cautious, with some flipping bearish as Bitcoin’s recent trend begins to lose momentum. This correction has left the market questioning whether the current price movement is a natural pause or a precursor to deeper losses. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared insights on X, supported by compelling on-chain data, highlighting that realized losses have surged to $28.9 million. This figure is 3.2 times higher than the weekly average, indicating heightened selling activity. Adler’s analysis underscores that while the sell-off might seem alarming, it’s consistent with a healthy market correction, especially following Bitcoin’s remarkable rally to $108,300. Adler notes that the current dip should not trigger panic but instead serve as a moment of patience for long-term holders. He emphasized that now is a time to HODL unless additional bearish signals emerge to suggest a more prolonged downtrend. Corrections like this often provide the market with the necessary fuel for the next leg up, as weaker hands exit and strong hands position themselves strategically.

Price action remains critical, with investors watching closely to determine whether this correction solidifies a strong foundation for future growth or signals further downside. BTC Holding Bullish Structure (For Now) Bitcoin is trading at $94,400 following three consecutive days of aggressive selling pressure. Despite the apparent bearish sentiment gripping the market, BTC has managed to maintain its footing above the key support level of $92,000. This support is crucial as it clearly defines the ongoing uptrend. Holding above this level suggests resilience and sets the stage for a potential strong bounce if buyers regain control in the coming sessions. While the recent price action reflects uncertainty, the decline has not been as severe as the market sentiment indicates. Negative emotions have driven many traders to adopt a cautious stance, but BTC’s ability to stay above $92,000 shows underlying strength in the market structure.

Restoring confidence will be essential for Bitcoin to reclaim higher levels and resume its bullish momentum. If sentiment does not improve and prices continue to drop, the risk of a deeper correction becomes more likely. Losing the $92,000 support could pave the way for a retest of lower levels, potentially causing additional volatility.

The surge in global cryptocurrency adoption is fueled significantly by heavyweight investors like Fidelity and BlackRock, who are actively enhancing the sector’s credibility. Remarkably, about 6.8% of the global population, over 560 million people, now engage with cryptocurrency. Amidst this explosive growth, utility coins like Solana and Tron are gaining traction, but the real game-changer could be Web3Bay, poised to command a larger ecosystem. Don’t Miss Out on Web3Bay’s Rise in Crypto E-Commerce As the pace of cryptocurrency adoption quickens, Web3Bay is rapidly becoming a dominant force in the e-commerce landscape, moving from theoretical utility to tangible, real-world impact. Supported by giants such as Fidelity and BlackRock, the crypto sphere is gaining unprecedented legitimacy. While platforms like Solana and Tron push the envelope with sophisticated blockchain solutions, Web3Bay distinguishes itself by focusing on decentralizing e-commerce. Operating on a robust Layer-1 blockchain, Web3Bay guarantees the privacy, control, and transparency demanded by today’s crypto users, empowering them to manage their data securely. The 3BAY token, central to Web3Bay’s operations, goes beyond mere transactions by offering governance rights, exclusive rewards, and discounts, thus directly involving users in shaping the platform’s future. Currently, Web3Bay’s presale introduces the 3BAY token at just $0.003, with prices set to climb 15% through 28 stages. By the final stage, the token price is projected to hit $0.1959, translating to a potential ROI of over 6000% for early participants. As cryptocurrencies become integral to finance and digital experiences, Web3Bay is establishing itself as a powerhouse, seamlessly integrating Web2 and Web3 to create a revolutionary decentralized shopping experience. Solana’s Impressive Growth & Future Outlook Recently, Solana has shown remarkable progress, trading around $221 and nearing its all-time high of $263.83 as of December 2024. Known for its ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second, Solana stands out in the blockchain community, particularly for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT applications due to its high speed and low fees. Market analysts predict that Solana could reach new peaks, potentially climbing to $300 in 2025 and possibly surpassing $900 by 2030. Tron’s Steady Market Performance Tron remains a strong player in a volatile market, with network activity showing that 97% of TRX investors were profitable as of December 2024—an indicator of robust market confidence. In October 2024, Tron’s blockchain processed a record-breaking 10 million transactions in a single day, with a user base that now exceeds 296 million accounts, indicating strong ongoing demand. Time to Invest in These Utility Altcoins While Solana and Tron continue to impress with their advanced transaction capabilities and active networks, Web3Bay is carving out a niche with its innovative approach to decentralized e-commerce. With a presale designed to generously reward early backers and a commitment to bridging conventional and crypto payments, Web3Bay is reshaping online shopping. As the need for more privacy, greater control, and enhanced utility in cryptocurrencies grows, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a leader, ready to define the future of Web3-driven commerce.

This AI altcoin has the potential to grow 70x in the first quarter of 2025. Investors are putting funds into WallitIQ (WLTQ) in whale-like motion, confident in its ability to deliver solid exponential returns. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin and XRP prices have recently shown signs of nearing the $5 mark. Despite this, many prominent investors are more interested in WallitIQ (WLTQ) as it is currently priced at an affordable $0.0243 in its ongoing presale. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Returns Dwarfs Potential Gains From Dogecoin And XRP Prices Hitting $5 Following a significant yearly peak of $0.47 last month, many analysts predict that Dogecoin, currently trading at $0.4063 , might hit the $5 mark soon as analysts are on the lookout for this increase in 2025. On Monday, the XRP price rallied further to test the resistance level at $2.58 after bouncing off the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. The maximum profit target from the pole’s length indicates that the XRP price could hit a new all-time high of $5. A high-volume move above the resistance levels at $2.58 and $2.92 could accelerate the rally to $5. With the XRP price currently at $2.69 , hitting $5 seems more plausible for Ripple (XRP) than ever. Yet, even if Dogecoin and XRP prices reach the $5 milestone, the returns are still very modest compared to what the new AI altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), offers. Currently priced at just $0.0243 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides an opportunity for investors seeking exponential growth. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) 70x potential dwarfs the gains from Dogecoin and Ripple (XRP). Unlike Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin, which are already mature assets with slower growth rates, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is a new project, and its ability to grow from its current presale price of $0.0243 by 70x in 2025 gives it an edge over Dogecoin and the XRP price. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Smart Choice for Forward-Thinking Investors Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin offer significant returns. However, AI altcoin WallitIQ (WLTQ) could soon outshine Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin. The project’s appealing features are driving fast adoption. WallitIQ (WLTQ) prioritizes security and user experience. It uses AI-powered anomaly detection to monitor transactions, offering enhanced protection by detecting potential threats in real-time. A thorough audit conducted by SolidProof verifies the reliability of its smart contract. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) AI altcoin provides significant benefits to its users, including staking rewards of up to 180% APY, premium features, unlimited referral bonuses, and transaction fee coverage within its ecosystem. Priced at an accessible $0.0243 during its presale, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents an attractive investment opportunity with the potential to deliver returns that rival or surpass those of Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is making a name in the AI market, valued at over $136 billion in 2023. Its integration of AI and blockchain ensures relevance in two of the fastest-growing industries, driving more rapid adoption. Its ongoing presale is drawing significant attention from retail and institutional investors, thanks to its low entry price of $0.0243 and sky-high upside potential. Dogecoin and Ripple (XRP) offer mere peanuts compared to this AI altcoin. Act Now or Regret Later While Dogecoin and XRP prices continue their journey toward the $5 milestone, their potential returns are limited compared to WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) 70x promise. The opportunity will not remain open forever. The AI altcoin is currently in its second presale stage, meaning the window for maximizing returns is rapidly closing. Early investors in projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum reaped life-changing rewards not because of luck, but because they acted decisively when the prices were low. Imagine seeing headlines about WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) price increase months from now, knowing you had the chance to buy in early but hesitated. Don’t wait until it’s too late. Buy the WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) AI altcoin at its presale price of $0.0243 and set yourself up for exponential profits soon.

Success often finds those who recognize potential early. Consider the remarkable journey of a Miami college student who, in 2013, used $5,600 to buy Litecoin (LTC) at $2 per coin. By 2017, Litecoin’s rise to $360 per coin transformed his initial stake into an astonishing $1 million, illustrating the impact of strategic early moves in the crypto world. Now, BlockDAG (BDAG) presents a similar prospect, poised to match or even surpass Litecoin’s success. How a Miami Student’s $5,600 Bet on Litecoin Became $1M Back in 2013, the crypto market was still emerging, but Bitcoin’s dramatic rise caught many eyes. A Miami student saw the potential in this space and, with a bold step and $5,600 in hand, he invested in Litecoin (LTC) at $2 per coin. Over four years, as Litecoin’s value increased, his patience and strategic thinking were rewarded. By 2017, his investment soared to $1 million as Litecoin reached $360 per coin. This story highlights how early, well-thought-out risks can lead to substantial rewards. For those who missed Litecoin’s impressive climb, BlockDAG, a pioneering layer-1 blockchain, offers a new opportunity for significant returns. BlockDAG: The DAG Pioneer with Unprecedented Growth Potential BlockDAG merges the robust security of blockchain with the flexibility of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, effectively addressing scalability, security, and decentralization issues faced by traditional blockchains. Its dual Blockchain + DAG architecture enhances transaction speeds, scalability, and reliability, establishing it as a leading Layer 1 project. BlockDAG’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus model upholds network integrity while promoting decentralized management, making it an appealing choice for those seeking long-term growth. The platform’s technological strength has attracted significant market interest, accumulating over $170 million through 26 presale rounds. Prices have escalated from $0.001 in the initial batch to $0.0234 in the latest, marking a substantial 2,240% increase. Experts now anticipate a potential 30,000x ROI for early participants. The continued momentum of BlockDAG’s presale indicates it is on course to reach its $600 million goal, reinforcing its status as a premier crypto acquisition. How BlockDAG May Surpass Litecoin in Future Gains While Litecoin has shown the benefits of early adoption, BlockDAG presents an even more promising opportunity. Its sophisticated technology offers unmatched scalability and security, essential for future blockchain demands. With a 2,240% increase in its value already, projections suggest a potential rise to $30 per coin by 2030. At the current presale price of $0.0234, these forecasts suggest growth that could far surpass that of Litecoin. BlockDAG is also tailored to modern needs with its low-code/no-code smart contract functionality, allowing users to develop and implement smart contracts with minimal technical expertise. This simplifies the application of blockchain technology for businesses, developers, and non-technical users, fostering wider adoption and enhancing the value of BDAG coins. The Next Wave of Millionaires Crypto success often arises from seizing opportunities before they become mainstream. While Litecoin has previously minted millionaires, BlockDAG stands as the top crypto presale with its state-of-the-art Layer 1 technology and potential for massive financial returns. For those considering this emerging leader, now is an ideal time to engage. BDAG coins are currently priced at just $0.0234, but as the sale of batch 26 nears completion, the shift to batch 27 could mean significant price increases. Immediate action is crucial to avoid missing out on what could be a transformative wealth-building opportunity.

After retesting levels below $2, the price is now maintaining bullish momentum. Bitcoin and other coins are also down right now, and some traders are taking advantage of the dip by buying more. The price of XRP has been consolidating around the $2 range, and this is where it could stay for a while, which is a good sign for holders. Overall, the market is seeing a lot of liquidations, with $680 million wiped out in the last 12 hours alone. Short-Term Price Range and Potential Movements Currently, XRP is trading between $1.96 and its all-time high of $3.30. The price remains squeezed within this range, and a potential upside movement could still emerge. A short-term bullish scenario could see one or two additional highs as part of a larger wave structure, similar to what is expected in other major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. Possible Elliott Wave Count and Structure There are two possible Elliott Wave counts on the XRP chart. The first suggests the top may already be in place, with the current price action forming a fourth wave triangle. If this count plays out, a final fifth wave could complete the current bullish cycle. The second wave count proposes that an additional 4-5% upside movement may occur before the cycle concludes. The focus remains on the current structure and its potential implications. Validation and Invalidations: Key Price Levels To keep the triangle scenario alive, XRP must stay above $1.90. If the price breaks below this level, it would invalidate the triangle count, suggesting a more direct ABC correction. This scenario would likely see XRP move lower before any potential recovery.

Recent reports highlight a significant influx of capital, with Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana collectively attracting $130 billion, signaling renewed investor confidence. Amidst this financial whirlwind, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves by addressing real-world challenges that have hindered blockchain adoption. Its innovative QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is set to simplify blockchain development, making it more accessible to developers of all skill levels. Qubetics ($TICS): Simplifying Blockchain Development with QubeQode IDE Qubetics is currently in its 13th presale stage, offering $TICS tokens at $0.0342. The project has already raised over $7 million, attracting more than 10,600 holders and selling over 355 million tokens. The QubeQode IDE is a game-changer in the blockchain space.

By addressing real-world challenges such as complex user interfaces and limited transaction scalability, Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in the blockchain space. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, representing a significant return on investment. To learn more about Qubetics, you can check this out: Watch the Video . Solana (SOL): Riding the Wave of Market Momentum Solana has been making headlines with its rapid growth and increasing market momentum.

Cardano (ADA): Steady Growth Amid Market Fluctuations Cardano continues to demonstrate steady growth, even amid market fluctuations. While Bitcoin recently dipped below $98,000, affecting the broader crypto market, Cardano has maintained its position, reflecting its resilience and the confidence of its community.

Its commitment to peer-reviewed research and a robust development roadmap further solidify its standing as a reliable blockchain platform.

As we edge closer to 2025, cryptocurrency markets are buzzing with activity, with investors closely monitoring the best cryptos to join in December 2024. From strategic acquisitions by whale investors to groundbreaking blockchain innovations, the latest developments have set the stage for an exhilarating year-end. Toncoin has captured headlines with its surging whale activity, while Render continues to intrigue analysts with its price forecasts for 2025 and beyond. However, the spotlight undoubtedly shines on Qubetics ($TICS), a project revolutionising blockchain technology with its unique presale structure and unmatched use cases. This article delves into the latest updates and opportunities surrounding these three cryptos: Qubetics, Toncoin, and Render. Let’s explore why Qubetics is leading the pack among the best cryptos to join in December 2024. Qubetics: Redefining Cross-Border Payments How do banks and financial institutions stay competitive in an increasingly interconnected world? Qubetics ($TICS) offers a revolutionary solution tailored to modern financial needs. Its cutting-edge blockchain network empowers institutions to perform near-instant cross-border payments and settlements, eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional systems. By forging strategic partnerships with the Qubetics Network, banks can achieve faster, more cost-effective, and transparent transactions. This advancement benefits businesses reliant on swift settlements to maintain operational efficiency and individuals seeking faster international remittances. Could this be the breakthrough that reshapes global finance?\ Adding to its momentum, Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session , engaging its vibrant community with insights and updates about the network’s vision and utility. With these developments, it’s no surprise that Qubetics is emerging as one of the best cryptos to join in December 2024. Toncoin: Whale Investors Fuel a 27% Surge Toncoin (TON), the cryptocurrency of The Open Network, has experienced a dramatic price surge, thanks to the involvement of major investors. By the end of November 2024, whales accumulated nearly $30 million worth of TON in just four days, driving a 27% price increase and pushing the token above $6.20. This bullish activity highlights growing confidence in Toncoin’s potential, amplified by recent regulatory changes such as the resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Its integration with Telegram’s 800-million-strong user base positions Toncoin as a frontrunner for mainstream adoption. With a market capitalisation of $13.96 billion, Toncoin is proving its relevance as a strategic asset in the evolving crypto market. Render: A Rollercoaster Year with Optimistic Projections The price of Render ($RENDER) currently sits at $7.71, reflecting a -3.14% decline this month. Despite this dip, long-term forecasts remain optimistic, with analysts predicting a potential high of $13.20 by the end of 2025 and a staggering $96.94 by 2030. Render has seen significant developments this year, with a 60.28% increase in GPU computing power usage during Q1 2024, leading to a strong rally in March. While its price has cooled since reaching a record high above $13.00, Render’s growing market cap of $3.02 billion underscores its resilience and potential for recovery. A Thrilling Opportunity: The Qubetics Presale What makes the Qubetics presale so compelling? In Phase 13, the presale boasts weekly phases with a 10% price hike, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. At just $0.034 per $TICS token, Qubetics has already raised over $7.3 million, attracted 10,900+ holders, and sold an impressive 363 million tokens. This unique structure rewards early participants and fuels anticipation with every phase. For investors seeking the best cryptos to join in December 2024 , Qubetics presents an unmatched opportunity. With its robust community backing and innovative approach, $TICS tokens are more than an investment—they’re a statement of trust in the future of blockchain. Conclusion: Why Qubetics ($TICS) Stands Out As December unfolds, Qubetics ($TICS), Toncoin, and Render each present unique opportunities for investors. While Toncoin benefits from whale activity and Render boasts strong long-term potential, Qubetics is redefining the crypto landscape with its revolutionary technology and presale strategy. For those seeking the best cryptos to join in December 2024, Qubetics offers an exciting chance to be part of a groundbreaking project at an early stage. With its momentum building and presale nearing completion, now is the time to secure your stake in $TICS tokens and position yourself at the forefront of blockchain innovation.

This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 02:25:24

The timing for the purchase couldn’t be less perfect, as the crypto market plunged after a hawkish Fed meeting on Wednesday where officials voted for the third and final interest rate cut of 2024 by 25 basis points. During the press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also addressed the prospect of the central bank building a strategic reserve of Bitcoin, one of Trump’s boldest campaign promises to the crypto industry. The official said that the central bank is legally not allowed to hold Bitcoin and is not looking for a law change. For context, in July 2024, Republican Senator Cyntia Lummis introduced a Bitcoin Act to create such a reserve, proposing to acquire 5 percent of the BTC supply funded by Fed bank deposits and gold holdings. Powell’s comments poured cold water on expectations that Bitcoin’s price will continue its upward trend fueled by optimism over Trump’s embrace of the crypto industry. Following the Fed meeting, Bitcoin saw a sharp decline, falling by 6% within hours to $98,900 after trading above $100,000 for the past week, during which it reached a new ATH of $108,135. Ethereum and other major altcoins mirrored the downturn, with ETH losing 11% since Wednesday and currently trading at $3,400. Despite backing from the president-elect, World Liberty Financial got off to a rocky start. The October public sale of WLFI tokens only managed to sell a little more than 4% of the coins. Because of lukewarm demand, the project had to slash its presale goal from $300 million to just $30 million. Besides stagnating sales, WLFI faces other behind-the-scenes issues, such as a lack of a well-defined roadmap, barriers to entry antithetical to the tenets of DeFi, and possible conflict of interest. The project, which was launched with the commitment to democratize and depoliticize finance through decentralized lending, directs the sale of WLFI tokens only to accredited investors who meet a certain wealth threshold, a criterion that excludes a broader audience from participating. WLFI scoops up alts and lends a helping hand to Justin Sun Besides Ethereum, World Liberty Financial has been actively shopping for other altcoins, including ETH, WBTC, AAVE, LINK, ENA, and ONDO. Meanwhile, the native token of CoW Protocol (COW) used by WLFI jumped nearly 35% over the last 24 hours due to investors’ speculative interest in the platform. On Thursday, World Liberty Financial swapped $10.4 million of cbBTC for wBTC, taking the side of a controversial crypto mogul Justin Sun in his brawl with Coinbase over wBTC delisting. The popular Bitcoin wrapper issued by BiT Global was delisted by Coinbase without much elaboration except its alleged incompatibility with the exchange’s listing standards. In response, BiT Global filed a lawsuit, claiming that the move was meant to give Coinbase’s own wrapper, cbBTC, an unfair advantage. Coinbase countered with the claim that Justin Sun’s control over BiT Global presented unacceptable risks for customers. While Justin Sun’s connection to BitGo may be less clear, his ties to World Liberty Financial are much more obvious. The $30 million investment in WLFI announced by Sun in November made him at the time the project’s largest investor. The following day, Sun was invited to join the advisory board, cementing the Sun-Trump alliance. Ethereum ETFs with record inflows in December Despite the market’s neurotic reaction to the Fed’s recent rate cut, Ethereum ETFs performed exceptionally well in December, The Block’s data suggests. This month has brought $1.66 billion in new investments to such products, which is 74% of the $2.24 billion total inflows since inception. The market structure of Ethereum ETFs remains highly concentrated, with BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) staying ahead of the competition by a wide margin. On December 5, ETHA recorded a single-day high of $292 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity's FETH as the second most popular choice. Other Ethereum ETF providers have garnered only modest investor interest compared to the broader distribution seen in Bitcoin ETFs.",News|Ethereum|Altcoins,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-21 02:29:49

The SEC also accused Tai Mo Shan of unlawfully offering and selling LUNA, a cryptocurrency issued by Terraform, as unregistered securities. Misleading Investors About Terra USD Peg Stability The SEC alleged that Tai Mo Shan deceived investors by creating the impression that Terraform Labs’ algorithmic mechanism was maintaining the $1 peg of UST. When UST fell below its $1 value in May 2021, Tai Mo Shan entered an agreement with Terraform Labs to intervene in stabilizing the price. Under this agreement, Terraform incentivized Tai Mo Shan with discounted LUNA tokens to buy UST and attempt to restore its peg. On May 19, 2021, Tai Mo Shan made substantial purchases of UST, totaling over $20 million, which temporarily stabilized the stablecoin’s price. The SEC stated that these actions misled the market into believing that Terraform’s algorithm was maintaining the peg, while the stability was actually driven by Tai Mo Shan’s trades. This conduct was deemed negligent by the SEC, as investors were not informed about the reliance on external intervention to stabilize UST. Role as a Statutory Underwriter for LUNA The SEC’s findings revealed that Tai Mo Shan acted as a statutory underwriter for Terraform Labs by acquiring LUNA tokens with the intent to resell them on U.S.-based platforms. From January 2021 to May 2022, Tai Mo Shan offered and sold these tokens as securities without proper registration, violating U.S. securities laws. The SEC classified LUNA as a security, noting that Tai Mo Shan acquired the cryptocurrency from Terraform for distribution to the public. This activity further contributed to the SEC’s charges of unregistered securities offerings. As part of the settlement, Tai Mo Shan agreed to pay $73.45 million in disgorgement, $12.91 million in prejudgment interest, and a $36.72 million civil penalty. These penalties aim to address the illegal gains obtained through misleading actions and unregistered transactions. Tai Mo Shan neither admitted nor denied the findings of the SEC’s investigation. However, the company agreed to comply with a cease-and-desist order prohibiting future violations of federal securities laws. US SEC’s Statement on Investor Protection SEC Chair Gary Gensler emphasized the need for compliance in the crypto markets, stating, “Too many times in the crypto markets, we’ve seen investor losses due to fraud. Regardless of the labels, crypto market participants should comply with securities laws and not deceive the public. Otherwise, investors get hurt.” The SEC also highlighted that Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, were found liable for fraud and unregistered securities offerings earlier in 2024. Terraform and Kwon agreed to pay $4.5 billion to compensate harmed investors, demonstrating the widespread fallout from the Terra ecosystem’s collapse. This case marks another step in the SEC’s ongoing efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry and protect investors from deceptive practices.

While Ripple (XRP) grapples with regulatory challenges and Toncoin (TON) struggles to find its identity in a saturated market, Lightchain AI is emerging as a powerful contender with its unique approach to AI-powered blockchain technology. Let’s unpack why this token is causing such a stir in the crypto community. Where Ripple and Toncoin Fall Short Even with their set places, both Ripple and Toncoin are up against troubles that make them not so nice to smart investors. Ripple’s XRP stays favored, but its worth is greatly swayed by ongoing law fights with the SEC creating doubt about its long-term chance. On the other side, Toncoin, even with its link to Telegram, has a hard time finding who it is. Aside from its aim on growth, TON misses a clear story which makes it hard to get a loyal g͏roup of builders or gain wide use. On the other hand Lightchain AI shines as a forward-looking plan with its special focus on smart solutions and an open, good roadmap. A Deeper Look Into Lightchain AI’s Vision Lightchain AI is setting itself apart from other blockchain projects by focusing on the integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), rather than simply addressing scalability or payment solutions. Its mission is to go beyond decentralization and create an ecosystem where blockchain technology fuels advanced AI capabilities for real-world applications. At its core is the Adaptive AI Framework, powered by the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), which evolves with community input to stay on the cutting edge of AI innovation. Ethical AI development is another cornerstone of Lightchain AI’s vision. By leveraging Proof of Intelligence (PoI), the platform ensures energy-efficient and purposeful computations, addressing pressing concerns around AI ethics and sustainability. Additionally, Lightchain AI has already begun establishing partnerships in industries such as healthcare and finance, ensuring its technology is applied to practical, impactful use cases. Features Driving Lightchain AI’s Popularity Several key features make Lightchain AI a standout project. Its Dynamic AI Ecosystem Expansion emphasizes the creation of an open-source innovation hub, allowing developers from various industries to collaborate on groundbreaking projects. This dynamic approach contrasts with the static nature of other platforms. Data privacy is also a central focus of Lightchain AI. By using privacy-preserving technologies like homomorphic encryption, the platform ensures the security of sensitive AI data computations, which is particularly critical for industries like healthcare and finance. Furthermore, Lightchain AI is building strong global cross-industry partnerships. The platform is actively engaging with enterprises to implement its technology in areas such as logistics optimization, predictive analytics, and climate modeling—markets that remain unexplored by many other projects in the blockchain space. Why Smart Money Is Betting on Lightchain AI Institutional investors and crypto whales have started accumulating LCAI tokens, and for good reason. Lightchain AI addresses inefficiencies in traditional AI models while offering blockchain-backed decentralization. One area of focus is AI-driven decentralized finance (DeFi), where Lightchain AI enhances platforms with predictive models to enable smarter lending and borrowing mechanisms. The platform also provides advanced developer tools, such as APIs and SDKs, to streamline the development of AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps), which in turn attracts top-tier talent to the ecosystem. Sustainability is another major draw for investors, as Proof of Intelligence significantly reduces the platform’s carbon footprint, appealing to those who prioritize environmentally conscious investments. With its innovative approach and real-world applications, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to lead the way in the integration of blockchain and AI. Rare Opportunity for Exponential Growth While Ripple and Toncoin navigate their respective challenges, Lightchain AI is blazing a trail with its innovative blend of AI integration, real-world applications, and deflationary tokenomics. With its low entry price and high growth potential, LCAI offers a chance for investors to participate in the next major shift in the crypto landscape. Smart investors understand the importance of timing. Don’t wait to join the Lightchain AI presale—secure your stake now and prepare for a potential breakout that could redefine the industry. Visit Lightchain AI to learn more and invest today! Keep an eye out for more updates on this exciting project.

The controversy emerged following unsubstantiated claims by a Hedera community member that sparked intense discussion across digital asset markets. The initial assertions came from Shawn (@oroogle) on X. According to his statements , the president-elect’s team had developed plans to establish a national cryptocurrency reserve incorporating not only Bitcoin but also XRP and Hedera’s HBAR token. These digital assets were supposedly classified as “American Commodities” in a broader strategy to position the United States as a global leader in cryptocurrency innovation. The claims extended beyond reserve status, suggesting comprehensive integration of both Hedera and Ripple technologies into American electoral and financial infrastructure. Perhaps most notably, these statements included an alleged quote from Eric Trump suggesting his father’s intention to implement tax exemptions for domestically developed cryptocurrencies to reinforce American dominance in the digital asset sector. Will HBAR and XRP Join the Strategic Reserve? Donald Trump has shown notable support for cryptocurrencies, recently nominating a pro-crypto successor to Gary Gensler, current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and well-known anti-crypto figure. However, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson intervened to address what he characterized as misinformation circulating within the cryptocurrency community. According to Hoskinson, any consideration for a strategic reserve would be limited exclusively to Bitcoin, with no plans to include alternative cryptocurrencies. This isn't accurate. The reserve is only for Bitcoin — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 18, 2024 The cryptocurrency community’s response has been notably divided, as some participants commending Hoskinson’s effort to maintain factual accuracy in industry discourse. Others, however, questioned his motivations, suggesting potential bias due to Cardano’s absence from the purported reserve plans. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Further skepticism regarding the feasibility of any cryptocurrency reserve has emerged from prominent industry figures. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has published a detailed analysis arguing against the likelihood of such an initiative. Hayes emphasized that existing governmental priorities, particularly those related to social program funding, would likely preclude the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve. Hayes’ analysis also addressed potential market implications, warning of increased volatility in cryptocurrency markets. He specifically highlighted concerns about market instability around the anticipated presidential inauguration in January 2025, suggesting that the president-elect’s perceived cryptocurrency-friendly stance might overly influence current market optimism. However, with rumors that Trump wants to eliminate capital gains taxes on U.S.-based cryptocurrencies, the market could end up in a better place even if the Bitcoin reserve is not established as many expect.

For the Japanese, anything would beat being taxed at 55%, or in the case of inheritance tax, sometimes 110% on crypto gains, and being unable to offset losses. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Japan has finalized an outline for tax reform plans in 2025, in a meeting held on December 20. In a post to X , house member Junichi Kanda summarized the annual meeting of the nation’s tax commission, noting: “The LDP Tax Commission and Tax System Research Council general meeting finalized the outline of tax reform for fiscal year 2025. The report also included future considerations regarding the tax system for crypto assets.” The news is bullish for mainstream crypto investors, who have been suffering under tax rates as high as 55% on gains in the country, or even — in some cases — mind-blowing gouges to the tune of 110% (more than the value of the actual asset) where inheritance tax on crypto comes into play. House of Representatives member Junichi Kanda posted Friday about the development on social media platform X. Industry players and crypto holders alike have been urging politicians, such as Democratic Party for the People (DPP) leader Yuichiro Tamaki , to revamp the prohibitive system. But recently elected prime minister Shigeru Ishiba has been publicly doubtful of the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies as an asset class, ostensibly standing against such reform. Bitcoiners and crypto-heads in Japan are pushing for a separate 20% rate for crypto gains, which will include the ability to offset losses via a carryover system. According to local media , former minister for digital transformation (DX) and house member Takuya Hirai also submitted a proposal via the FSA (Financial Services Agency) to the minister of finance, to “make crypto assets an asset that contributes to the national economy.” The proposal, which included a separate tax scheme for crypto — instead of considering gains “miscellaneous income” as is currently the case — was reportedly well-received by Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato. Concrete movements toward reform are now expected, but as it stands for 2024, the tax law in the nation remains as convoluted as the Tokyo Metro subway, minus the efficiency and usefulness.

A crypto analyst has warned of an impending XRP price crash, urging investors not to get distracted as the RSI is still significantly above 50%. Discussing his predictions through short and long-term XRP price charts, the analyst shows that the cryptocurrency is firmly positioned in a bullish trend despite impending corrections. XRP Price RSI Hints At Potential Crash On the 4-hour XRP chart, a double tap structure is highlighted in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a technical indicator used to measure the momentum of a cryptocurrency. This double tap pattern typically signals further downward movement before a price stabilization. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash 2 Days Ago, Full Prediction Shows A Further 30% Decline According to Dark Defender, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), the RSI’s recurrent dips into oversold territory indicate that XRP could experience a price crash to new lows. The analyst disclosed that the XRP price had previously found strong support at $2.17; however, the cryptocurrency experienced a bounce to the upside. After hitting this support level, the XRP price is now consolidating, a pattern often associated with a potential uptrend after a correction. Despite the slight market recovery, the analyst has warned of another impending price crash in this same support zone as the RSI approaches oversold levels once more. Earlier in December, the RSI had hit oversold territories after dipping below 30%. Now XRP’s RSI is above 50% and signaling a potential to experience a price correction between the support levels at $2.17 and $2.18. Dark Defender has revealed that this price crash could occur soon as XRP is expected to enter oversold territory within a day. Despite this potential price correction, the analyst has acknowledged that the XRP’s broader outlook still looks bullish, with an uptrend continuation expected once the market consolidates following its projected price dip to new lows. Dark Defender has also predicted that XRP’s next price target after this projected correction is likely above $3, marking an almost 40% increase from the $2.17 support area. XRP 3-Month Chart Signals Strong Bullish Set Up Following his predictions that the XRP price could crash as it enters oversold conditions, Dark Defender also shared a 3-month chart analysis, painting a brighter outlook for the cryptocurrency. The chart shows that XRP has recently broken through a multi-year resistance level for the first time in over five years, signaling a strong bullish shift. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Not The End As Analyst Predicts Another 52% Jump The three-month green candle structure between October and December confirms strong buying pressure, setting the stage for a potentially bullish Q1 2025 from January to March. A rounded bottom pattern can also be seen on the XRP 3-month chart. This pattern is a classic bullish reversal structure that indicates a gradual move from a downtrend to an uptrend. Dark Defender has marked several Fibonacci levels as potential price targets for XRP. According to the analyst, XRP could see a 261.80% rise to the 5.8563 Fibonacci level between $5 to $9. After which, the analyst expects a 361.80% surge to the 18.2275 Fibonacci between $16 to $28. Support levels at the 0.6649 Fibonacci at $0.9 have also been highlighted, acting as a safety net for XRP during price corrections.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/78-of-litecoin-addresses-held-ltc-for-over-a-year-heres-the-significance/,"Recent data from IntoTheBlock highlights notable trends in Litecoin (LTC) holder behavior, offering insights into market dynamics and investor sentiment. According to the analysis shared on X, 78% of Litecoin addresses have held their LTC for over a year, demonstrating an accumulation pattern during bear markets and distribution near peak price levels. This provides valuable context for assessing market sentiment and potential future price movements. 78% of Litecoin addresses have held their $LTC for over a year, typically accumulating during bear markets and selling near peak prices. In this cycle, the slight decrease in long-term holdings is less marked than in past cycles, indicating that many holders are expecting… pic.twitter.com/nB7YuoYEKv — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 19, 2024 Litecoin (LTC) Accumulation in 2024 The data illustrates the consistent role of long-term holders in Litecoin’s market. Historically, these holders have exhibited patience, building positions during periods of low market activity. The accumulation during bearish phases aligns with strategic investment approaches, often reflecting confidence in Litecoin’s long-term value. Conversely, as market cycles progress toward price peaks, these same holders have tended to realize gains, contributing to short-term volatility. An intriguing aspect of the current market cycle is the relatively small decline in long-term holdings compared to previous cycles. This suggests a shift in market sentiment, with many long-term investors maintaining their positions despite price fluctuations. IntoTheBlock notes that this trend may indicate “expectations of further price growth,” signaling optimism regarding Litecoin’s future performance. Litecoin (LTC) Holders Beginning to Sell Although the hodlers have risen in 2024, the chart shows sell-offs during notable rallies. LTC experienced this in 2018 and 2021 when it reached new all-time highs. There was also a slight dip in early 2024 when Bitcoin rose to a new all-time high above $67,000, and Litecoin crossed $100 for the first time in almost a year. The end of the chart also shows this intriguing pattern, as the hodlers are beginning to drop. Litecoin recently experienced a massive resurgence, surpassing $120 for the first time since 2022, and it seems some investors are taking profits. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Is Litecoin About to Climb? Despite this dip, LTC hodlers are still the highest in the asset’s history. This fact, combined with the long period they have held the tokens, reinforces the point made by IntoTheBlock that these token holders are anticipating a bigger price surge. The incoming Donald Trump administration is bringing a crypto-friendly SEC Chair and pro-crypto policies and regulations that could help the market climb further. Litecoin has maintained a loyal base of long-term investors. This base has likely contributed to price stability, even during periods of heightened volatility across the broader cryptocurrency market, and it seems they might reap rewards for their loyalty.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 03:46:00

The SEC has charged Tai Mo Shan Limited, a subsidiary of Jump Crypto Holdings LLC for misleading investors about Terra USD stability and selling unregistered securities. The story doesn’t just expose a company but raises questions about the broader crypto ecosystem. How did things go so wrong? Let’s dig in. The Truth Behind Terra Terra USD was supposed to be a stablecoin. As the name suggests, such a token should remain stable as it should be pegged to $1. Tai Mo Shan played a role in assuring investors it was safe, claiming Terraform Labs’ algorithm kept everything in check. But things weren’t as solid as they seemed. When UST lost its $1 peg in May 2021, Tai Mo Shan stepped in. They made $20 million worth of trades to stabilize the price, temporarily. Could they save it? No. Behind the scenes, the company had an agreement with Terraform Labs. They’d stabilize UST in exchange for discounted LUNA tokens. Investors weren’t told the truth. The peg wasn’t held by some magical algorithm but by external interventions. The SEC calls this misleading. Hard to argue with that. SEC Labels LUNA Sales as Securities Here’s where it gets messier. From January 2021 to May 2022, Tai Mo Shan acquired LUNA tokens from Terraform Labs. Then they resold them on U.S. based exchanges. The SEC sees LUNA and most of the crypto tokens as a security, as we all know. So, by acting as a statutory underwriter and failing to register these offerings, the company broke securities laws. Tai Mo Shan agreed to pay over $123 million in fines , prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. They’re also under a cease and desist order now. But an important thing to note here is that they didn’t admit to the charges. They’re not exactly waving a white flag, just agreeing to move on. What to Expect For the crypto world, Terra collapse was a wake up call. And the SEC is tightening the reins on crypto. Gary Gensler, who is stepping down in January as the SEC chair, shared that protecting investors from fraud is a top priority. This case shows how fragile the systems can be and how much investors rely on trust. Though the new administration is focusing on creating a nurturing environment for the digital space, cases like this highlights the need for strict regulations.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Scam,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|LUNA|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-21 03:51:31

This is why so many investors continue to allocate toward the huge disruption of the Rollblock ($RBLK) GambleFi presale, which experts predict will return 50x this year on the strength of its growing community casino platform. Rollblock ($RBLK) Momentum Already At Fever Pitch During Presale Rollblock ($RBLK) is an opportunity that doesn’t come along very often in crypto, as this blockchain-backed betting platform seeks to disrupt the $450 billion online gambling industry with its focus on trust and transparency. Rollblock offers a fully functioning Web3 casino that includes over 7000 games alongside a sports betting league that opens up the huge world of esports to Rollblock gamers. The Rollblock community is currently rallying around this recent update on the Rollblock Discord server, sharing wins and adding to the massive hype. Everything is fully encrypted onto the Ethereum blockchain, meaning that all transactions can be verified to ensure a transparent gaming experience. This gives players peace of mind and prevents the house from manipulating bets. The $RBLK token runs the entire ecosystem and rewards its holders with exclusive VIP benefits, free spins, and staking rewards with hassle-free yield of up to 30%. Regular buybacks from Rollblock will ensure a deflationary supply, as 60% of these purchases are burned while the remaining 40% is placed back in the hands of community stakers. This lucrative rewards scheme will mean that demand will far outstrip supply in 2025 and boost the price of $RBLK up to 50 times higher than its current level of $0.043. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) Airdrop Meets With Market Apathy The Pudgy Penguins token was recently launched as members of the Pudgy Penguins NFT community were airdropped large numbers of coins, along with crypto OGs from various chains, including Solana and Ethereum. The Pudgy Penguins NFT floor price rose steadily in anticipation of this airdrop but has since fallen by 40% as the Pedgy Penguins token has not rallied as expected. Pudgy Penguins is down by 26% to trade at $0.02. Nonetheless, analysts believe that Pudgy Penguins could take its place as a leading NFT token as it represents one of the most recognizable brands in crypto. Magic Eden ($ME) Quests Fail To Propel Token Price Magic Eden has also failed to follow its early promise, falling from $10 on its initial launch at the start of December to its current level of $2.85. Magic Eden offers NFT and crypto token trading and can be staked for up to 4 years, requiring holders to lock up Magic Eden tokens for a set time frame. Magic Eden holders can perform quests to earn more rewards, a unique feature that should send Magic Eden into the top 100 next year. Rollblock Ready To Rock The Gaming World This Year While Pudgy Penguins and Magic Eden have yet to gain real momentum, Rollblock ($RBLK) remains the best bet for many investors to scale in early to one of the most promising projects in all of crypto gaming. Stage 9 tokens are selling out rapidly, and the price looks set for a further hike to $0.052 as it progresses to the next stage in the coming days.

Whales Loading Up for a Massive Bull Run,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/ethereum-price-prediction-eth-to-20k-whales-loading-up-for-a-massive-bull-run/,"The post Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH to $20K? Whales Loading Up for a Massive Bull Run appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum is struggling to maintain a level above $4k, even in a bull run, but where can Ethereum go? Coincodex has the Ethereum price prediction at quite bullish, but a $20k mark seems a ways off. This begs the question of whether Ethereum is a good investment or if there are alternatives like Lunex Network to set the market on fire. Ethereum (ETH): The Road To 20k? The market had a red week in the second week of December as investors took a well-deserved profit off the massive November gains. One of the tokens that underperformed was Ethereum. While Solana and Bitcoin – and a host of others – reached their ATHs during the November bull run, Ethereum maxed out at a hair over $4k, still almost $900 short of its ATH. The Ethereum price prediction is relatively bullish, and Coincodex predicts ETH will break the $4k mark by the new year. Is this enough, though? The Ethereum price prediction is said to max out this cycle at just under $7k in November next year before falling to about $4,700. But what about the mythical $20k mark for the Ethereum price prediction? Coincodex says that is a long time off. 2033, to be exact. That will mark a 5x return for Ethereum. The Bitcoin price prediction for the same timeline is over $700k for a 7x return. The Ethereum price prediction says it’s not a great investment. Lunex Network (LNEX): A Rising Star For The Next Bull Run The cryptocurrency market thrives on cycles, and during a bull run, savvy investors seek out opportunities with massive growth potential. While major tokens like Ethereum grab headlines, the real gains often lie with emerging platforms like Lunex Network . Lunex Network is a next-generation Web3 decentralized exchange offering users unparalleled ease of use, security, and scalability. Though utilizing non-custodial wallets, Lunex eliminates the need to keep tokens in exchange, which ensures complete user control over assets. Sporting over 50,000 trading pairs across multiple blockchains, it’s firing a warning shot across the bow of established exchanges like BNB and Uniswap: Lunex is coming! Unlike larger tokens that often plateau during bull runs, Lunex Network offers exponential growth potential. Its innovative technology, which combines on-chain and off-chain elements, ensures lightning-fast transactions while maintaining the decentralized integrity that crypto enthusiasts demand. Leveraging features such as a liquidity aggregator and a robust staking program, Lunex positions itself as the disrupting force in the DeFi and crypto exchange ecosystem. For investors looking to maximize returns, Lunex Network represents an opportunity to participate in a project designed for long-term scalability and user-focused innovation. While giants like Ethereum promise steady progress, Lunex could redefine expectations during the next bull run. Conclusion Investing in crypto can be highly lucrative, and the appeal to established tokens like Ethereum is undeniable. However, these big guns are not necessarily the best tokens to invest in, even in a bull run. The Ethereum price prediction is bullish, but it’s not bullish enough considering the growth potential of tokens like Lunex Network. Smaller undervalued tokens like Lunex Network can return 100x – even more – at the same time it would take Ethereum to make a mere doubling of value. It’s worth adding Lunex Network to a well-balanced crypto portfolio. Lunex Network is now available at $0.0046.

What 2025 Holds for Decentralized Exchanges",https://dailyhodl.com/2024/12/20/no-middleman-no-problem-what-2025-holds-for-decentralized-exchanges/,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post In 2024, DEXs (decentralized exchanges) snagged a greater portion of the crypto trading pie, demonstrating the future of finance is firmly headed toward decentralization. And Trump’s recent victory has only reinforced this trend, with Bitcoin’s price surging to nearly $91,000 . As monthly DEX trading volume soared above $250 billion in March and June 2024 for the first time since 2021, it’s clear that traders are increasingly opting for the benefits of autonomy and transparency these platforms offer. Over the past 12 months, several DEX platforms have refined their offerings to enhance the trading experience while prioritizing financial inclusivity and trust. This evolution indicates that the market is not just progressing – it has reached a level of maturity that some skeptics never anticipated. But these successes did not come without some hurdles. As 2025 approaches, 2024’s achievements and setbacks serve as a roadmap for where the market is heading. While no crystal ball can predict the future, one can assume that the steady shift from CEXs (centralized exchanges) to DEXs is just the beginning. DEX developments and challenges in 2024 This year, the DeFi (decentralized finance) landscape continued to grow significantly, particularly with the advancements in concentrated liquidity models. While these advancements enhance DeFi by providing greater capital efficiency and enabling users to concentrate liquidity in specific ranges, it’s no secret that this advancement was achieved at the expense of liquidity providers. On the governance front, 2024 saw the emergence of ‘DAO wars,’ where various DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) engaged in strategic maneuvers to assert dominance. These organizational rivalries add another layer of complexity to the DeFi ecosystem with DAOs fighting for control, leading to opportunities and risks for participants. As DAOs compete for influence, they have experimented with novel voting mechanisms, management strategies and community incentives to help attract and retain participants. This competitive environment has led to both innovation and volatility, with some DAOs forming alliances to strengthen their position, while others engage in aggressive tactics to undermine their rivals. In January 2024, a blockchain interoperability project launched a crypto bridge to allow a staked ETH token to move across multiple blockchains but did so without waiting for approval from the token’s governing body. This move sparked controversy, with critics accusing the project of overstepping its bounds and trying to lock in users ahead of its competitors. These challenges are especially significant because they expose the limitations and vulnerabilities of decentralized governance, specifically in areas like accountability and decision-making speed, further exposing cracks in the community. The rise of intent-based trading has also transformed the DeFi experience. These tools have invited users to implement sophisticated cross-chain strategies and facilitate wallet seeding, enhancing the overall multi-chain experience. This has streamlined functionality, allowing users to navigate DEX intricacies more efficiently without managing multiple networks. While we can’t know for sure what next year will bring, the past year can help guide DEX developers and users to anticipate what lies ahead. What to look out for in 2025 The rise of AI in trading strategies will likely enhance market dynamics, helping traders optimize their DEX performance. This integration has already taken off in the TradFi landscape, and as DeFi continues to see sustained growth, the technology’s inevitable integration will address challenges like limited liquidity, slippage and price manipulation. AI’s capabilities are certainly compelling. Its ability to predict price swings, identify arbitrage opportunities and mitigate risks will only improve with more data, making it a critical resource for DeFi and its participants. As DeFi protocols continue to evolve, its focus has shifted towards creating and utilizing aggregated assets to address long-standing liquidity and user experience issues. Aggregating liquidity from various sources similar to CEXs that accept deposits from different channels allows DEXs to offer more efficient trading experiences. For instance, protocols might allow users to deposit different stablecoins such as USDC into a unified liquidity pool, simplifying the user interface and expanding the trading pairs. This aggregation also improves the execution of the trades, reducing slippage and enhancing price discovery. However, as managing these complex assets becomes more difficult, so does the potential risk exposure across different types of assets. When multiple deposit types are integrated into a protocol, a single exploit in one of the bridges or smart contracts can ripple across the entire ecosystem. Ultimately, the vulnerabilities threaten a platform’s financial stability but also expose the ecosystem to larger systemic risks. Securing these aggregated assets will be one of the defining factors of growth and sustainability in 2025 and beyond. In regulation, up until now, the tax structuring for digital assets has been a poorly conceived policy, often resembling the taxation of unrealized gains in traditional markets. Under the Trump administration, the expectation is that taxes will be lowered and more nuanced in the US, leading to better relations between government agencies and decentralized organizations, and creating an environment that breeds opportunity and innovation rather than FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt). While many crypto builders and activists believe Trump will ‘make crypto great again,’ only time can tell if that will actually happen. While the future remains uncertain, the challenges of 2024 can serve as a roadmap for the advancement of DEXs as we enter the new year. While DEXs have their imperfections, their advantages far outweigh the drawbacks, positioning DeFi for a promising surge in the market . In the coming year, expect DEX developers to deepen their commitment to crafting a better user experience, focusing on building long-term solutions that support the ongoing goals of DeFi.

Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared across networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without the need for intermediaries. By employing a system of parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing transactions more efficiently than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The native token, DOT, is used for governance and staking within the network. Holders of DOT can participate in decision-making processes and contribute to transaction validation. Developed by Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, and maintained by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot launched on May 26, 2020. The protocol aims to create a more interconnected and efficient blockchain ecosystem. Its technology addresses key limitations of existing blockchains, such as scalability and interoperability. In the current market cycle, Polkadot continues to develop its technology and expand its ecosystem. Its focus on interoperability and scalability addresses significant challenges in the blockchain industry. As the demand for cross-chain solutions grows, Polkadot’s role may become increasingly significant. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that implements the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains that may orphan blocks created in parallel, GHOSTDAG allows these blocks to coexist and orders them in the consensus. This approach results in a block directed acyclic graph (blockDAG) rather than a single chain. Kaspa aims for secure operation while achieving high block rates—currently one block per second—with goals to increase this to 10 blocks per second and eventually 100 blocks per second. Confirmation times are minimized and are primarily affected by internet latency. Kaspa includes features such as Reachability for querying the DAG’s topology and block data pruning, with plans for block header pruning. It supports Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs and is preparing for future subnetwork support to ease the implementation of layer 2 solutions. These technological advancements focus on enhancing scalability and speed in cryptocurrency transactions. In the current market cycle, Kaspa introduces a unique approach to consensus and blockchain structure that contributes to ongoing discussions about the evolution of blockchain technology. Conclusion DOT and KAS are strong, but XYZVerse (XYZ) unites sports fans in a unique memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth, aspiring to be the G.O.A.T in the current bull run.

This Exchange Token Looks Primed for 1,000% Gains While Ripple & Ethereum Face Challenges",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/dtx-exchange-dtx-skyrockets-500-more-price-gains-ahead/,"The post Experts Say Don’t Miss the Next Big Thing! This Exchange Token Looks Primed for 1,000% Gains While Ripple & Ethereum Face Challenges appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) are seeing slight price dips at the moment. However, many analysts like Crypto Tony and Ali remain bullish on them. They have made some price predictions that have stunned the community. Meanwhile, experts are paying close attention to DTX Exchange (DTX) , a phase six presale phenomenon that may skyrocket by 1,000% in 2025. Since this altcoin has seen a 500% growth so far, this prediction has some merit. DTX Exchange (DTX) Skyrockets 500%, More Price Gains Ahead DTX Exchange (DTX) aims to revolutionize online trading while Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) experience hardships. This upcoming trading platform will launch in Q1 of 2025, combining the best features of CEX and DEX. On it, people will be able to trade over 120,000 asset classes, including FX and crypto. This will also come with a leverage of up to 1000x. Although people are excited about the DTX Exchange platform, its ecosystem will also include other products that have already been launched: VulcanX Blockchain: The testnet for this blockchain was launched and saw 100K TPS. Phoenix Wallet: A custody solution for crypto coins, stocks and more. CoinMarketCap Listing: The DTX native token, now in its presale, was listed on CoinMarketCap. Speaking of DTX, it will be the native token of this platform. Holding this altcoin will give traders governance voting rights, a portion of the trading fee revenue, and more. Currently, one DTX costs $0.12, which is a 500% growth from its starting price. However, this price will reach $0.14 after phase seven begins. Everybody is excited, as a Tier-1 CEX listing is expected to trigger a rally to $0.20. With over 300K wallets already owning DTX, it is clear that this altcoin may become a fan favorite for fast returns. Ripple (XRP) Shows Red Price Charts, Analyst Remains Optimistic Ripple (XRP) is among the top 5 cryptocurrencies, but it has seen some price dips. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Ripple fell over 10% on the weekly chart. In that period, its value saw movement between around $2.30 and close to $2. Nevertheless, market analyst Crypto Tony excited traders with his Ripple price prediction. In a recent X post, he told his followers that this altcoin looks healthy and that a pullback is good. He set $3.80 for Ripple (XRP) as a price target. Although the Ripple crypto may see a rebound soon, experts think its highest upswings have passed. This altcoin has seen a surge of nearly 250% on the YTD chart. Therefore, many traders are looking at DTX Exchange for noteworthy gains instead. Ethereum (ETH) on a Downtrend, Ali With a Bold Price Prediction Ethereum (ETH) has also seen some red price charts in the past week. On the one-week chart, its value has sunk from around $3,900 to nearly $3,100. This is nearly a 20% drop in just seven days, as per CoinMarketCap. But traders still have faith in the Ethereum coin, and many analysts are making exciting price predictions. For example, prominent market analyst Ali thinks that after Ethereum (ETH) passes the $4,100 resistance level, it may reach $6,000. Although this Ethereum price prediction has made some headlines, it is worth noting that its market cap now sits at $373B. This means the Ethereum price will need a large influx of new money to skyrocket. On the other hand, DTX will not face this issue. Can DTX Exchange (DTX) Outshine Ripple (XRP) & Ethereum (ETH)? While Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) are facing some turbulence right now, experts are growing more bullish for DTX Exchange (DTX). Demand is rising for this altcoin, with over $10M raised so far. As the demand rises, so will its price. Its smaller market cap could make a noteworthy price surge very easy to achieve. Thus, many experts foresee this crypto coin soaring by 1,000% in 2025.

It currently appeared bearish on the day with no sign of halting correction at the time of writing. In the first week, Gala advanced bullish rally but later faced rejection after registering over 100% gain in November. This rejection led to a halt in the rally and the price traded calmly for the rest of that week. Earlier last week, it lost grip above the $0.06 level and nosedived into $0.04. The price recovered briefly from there and later stopped buying at $0.055 due to a rejection. It remains indecisive for three days and broke down steadily until it tested $0.032 today for the first time in a month. The price is approaching the $0.03 level that flipped during last month’s rally. Locating support above this key level could fuel a new buy order capable of bringing the bulls back on track. As of now, the bears are still in charge of the market on the daily scale. While the latest price correction is healthy for the market, we can expect a bounce back anytime soon. A deeper correction from the current price level could reset the market back to the $0.02 level before rising back. It is currently down 36% in the past week of trading. Gala’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview As today turns out more volatile, the bears are now approaching $0.031. If they reclaim it, the $0.0263 support would be their next target. Lower supports considered for drops are $0.0216 and $0.017. Pushing back above the $0.0405 level, there’s a minor resistance at the $0.048 level. Reclaiming the $0.055 level could trigger a full recovery to the monthly $0.065 high before exploding to a new high. Key Resistance Levels: $0.0405, $0.055, $0.0666 Key Support Levels: $0.031, $0.0263, $0.0216 Spot Price: $0.0326 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Meanwhile, Lunex, a new crypto project, is gaining traction. Lunex is a Web3 multi-chain bridge network that helps you instantly swap your assets between blockchains without having to trust any third party. Solana price predictions have sparked excitement, but understanding what’s driving the market is key. Similarly, Lunex presents the dynamics of how innovation defines the crypto sphere. It can demonstrate the opportunities in the rapidly developing sphere. Let’s break it down. Lunex: The new crypto redefining rewards and convenience Lunex hasn’t taken long to gain traction in the crypto market, and for good reason. As a new crypto project, it combines innovation with practical solutions for everyday users. Among the features, it is necessary to mention the Lunex crypto card, which can perform the conversion process from crypto to fiat instantly. The Lunex black card, which is available only to VIP presale clients, is only valid for 200 users and provides great benefits. This traction has also been driven by the Lunex presale, which has attracted a lot of attention. Hence, with the token price of $0.0046, it had been able to raise over $5.3 million. This strong support shows that people are developing trust in Lunex. For early adopters, it is a possibility to invest in a potentially successful project from scratch. Another reason for Lunex’s success is its tokenomics. All merchant and token listing fees are paid in $LNEX, making it a deflationary asset. This creates natural buying pressure, helping to maintain a stable floor price. It’s a system designed to benefit long-term holders while supporting the overall ecosystem. For those looking to earn passive income, Lunex staking is a game-changer. By holding $LNEX for just 30 days, you can earn up to 18% APY. Better yet, you can grow your staking portfolio without lowering your initial returns. Lunex isn’t just a new crypto—it’s building a comprehensive system that rewards its users. With its deflationary model, innovative card, and attractive staking options, it’s no wonder Lunex is gaining momentum. Solana price prediction: paving the way for a $315 breakout Solana is currently in a pivotal consolidation phase, which has traders and investors eyeing a potential breakout. A bullish flag pattern has emerged, signaling a possible surge in the asset’s value. Analysts suggest this accumulation period could push Solana’s price to $315, fueled by growing market confidence and strategic positioning. Such patterns often precede significant price hikes, aligning with positive Solana price predictions. The outflow of $112.29 million in SOL from exchanges shows rising demand for Solana. This shift to private wallets limits circulating supply, increasing demand and price potential. This investment behavior shows long-term trust in Solana’s ecosystem. Additionally, Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) recently rose by $618.4 million, reflecting increased activity across its protocols. These developments reinforce optimistic Solana price predictions, underscoring its strong momentum in the crypto market. Solana sets big goals, but Lunex is making waves – which will you bet on? When it comes to crypto, there’s room for everyone to shine. While Solana’s ambitious price prediction has its fans excited, Lunex is making waves with its innovative features and growing momentum. Whether you’re cheering for Solana or diving into Lunex, you’re part of a thrilling era for digital assets!

This steep correction has mirrored the broader market’s turbulence, intensifying negative sentiment around XRP. However, notable developments are emerging beneath the surface of this bearish price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Reveals No Significant Panic Selling In The Market – Shakeout Or Trend Shift? Key on-chain data from Santiment reveals that whales are taking advantage of the dip. In the last 24 hours alone, these large holders have accumulated an additional 110 million XRP, demonstrating significant confidence in the asset’s long-term prospects. Historically, whale activity during negative sentiment often signals strategic positioning for future gains. This accumulation trend suggests that whales are undeterred by short-term price fluctuations, focusing instead on XRP’s potential in the coming months. As retail traders grow increasingly cautious amidst the recent drop, the actions of these large holders highlight a different perspective. While the immediate outlook for XRP remains uncertain, the notable whale activity is a bullish indicator for the long run. Whether this signals a bottom or simply positions XRP for a broader recovery remains to be seen, but it is clear that big players are looking beyond the current market turbulence. XRP Holding Key Levels XRP is currently trading 28% below its multi-year high of $2.90, but it has managed to stay above a critical support level at $1.90. This zone, regarded as the bulls’ last line of defense, has proven resilient amid recent market volatility. Holding above this level is essential to maintaining the bullish structure that has characterized XRP’s recent price action. Adding to the optimism, key metrics from Santiment, shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, reveal that XRP whales have accumulated actively during the pullback. Over the last 24 hours, these large holders have purchased an additional 110 million XRP, underscoring their confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. Historically, whale activity during price dips often signals preparation for a recovery. The next step for XRP to regain momentum is to push above critical supply levels that have previously stalled upward moves. A breakout above these zones could trigger a swift rally, bringing XRP closer to its multi-year high. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal Cardano Whales Are ‘Buying The Dip’ – Details The strong support at $1.90 and continued whale accumulation suggest a positive outlook for the weeks ahead. However, maintaining current levels and overcoming resistance will be crucial for XRP to capitalize on this potential and reignite its bullish trajectory. Technical Levels To Watch XRP is trading at $2.06, reflecting a loss of momentum after failing to reclaim the crucial $2.60 level. This inability to push higher has left the market uncertain, with XRP holding above the critical $1.90 low. For now, these levels suggest the asset could enter a prolonged period of range-bound trading, oscillating between $1.90 and $2.60 in the coming days. However, market sentiment remains fragile, and this indecision could tilt toward the bearish side if the overall mood doesn’t improve. With XRP trading just above the psychologically significant $2 mark, a continued lack of bullish momentum might lead to a significant selloff. If bears take control, the lack of strong support below $2 could pave the way for a deeper correction, eroding recent gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck Between $99K And $102K – Analyst Explains Macro Situation For XRP to break free from this indecisive phase, a clear reclaim of the $2.60 level is necessary to restore confidence among bulls. Until then, traders and investors are likely to exercise caution, closely monitoring price movements and sentiment shifts to gauge the next directional move. Without a decisive breakout, the price may face mounting pressure, risking a more pronounced downturn if support at $1.90 fails.

XRP’s surge of 20% to $0.83 signals a robust market confidence amid anticipated regulatory changes, including the speculated departure of SEC Chairman Gensler. On the other hand, Tron is solidifying its position with a stellar Q3, achieving revenues of $577 million and broadening its user network. However, Web3Bay steals the spotlight with its revolutionary approach to decentralized e-commerce. By eliminating middlemen and providing users governance rights via 3BAY tokens, Web3Bay is paving the way for the future of Web3 commerce. The presale, promising a massive 6430% ROI for initial backers, positions Web3Bay not just as another player in the crypto arena but as a trailblazer ready to lead. XRP’s Notable Uptick Amid Regulatory Changes Recently, XRP has experienced a significant uptick, gaining about 20% to reach $0.83. This increase is largely attributed to rumors of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s possible resignation, potentially fostering a more crypto-friendly regulatory landscape. This prospect has rejuvenated interest in Ripple’s native token, making it a strong candidate for an upcoming market surge. Furthermore, with platforms like Robinhood broadening their crypto offerings to include XRP, its market presence has strengthened, attracting more retail investors. Ripple’s continuous expansion in cross-border payment applications further supports XRP’s real-world utility. Increased on-chain activities on the XRP Ledger are also boosting investor optimism. Analysts believe that breaking the $0.85 resistance could lead to further gains, possibly reaching the $1 threshold. Tron’s Exceptional Market Performance & Expansion Tron is currently enjoying robust market momentum, recently peaking at $0.1914, buoyed by heightened trading volumes and revitalized investor interest after Bitcoin’s rally. With over 271 million accounts and 50 million transactions weekly, Tron’s growing ecosystem underscores its escalating adoption and influence. Financially, Tron has surpassed other major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, by recording a remarkable $577 million in revenue for Q3 2024. This achievement highlights Tron’s efficacy in generating stable revenue through its DeFi and dApp platforms, attracting both developers and users. Analysts are optimistic about TRX’s prospects, predicting it could soon test the $0.20 mark. 6430% ROI? Web3Bay’s Potential as the Year’s Major Crypto Venture Web3Bay is revolutionizing the e-commerce landscape by challenging traditional intermediary-dependent models, shifting control back to users through a decentralized marketplace. This transformation is not only about cost savings but also about influencing the platform’s trajectory with governance rights provided by the 3BAY token. In an exciting offer for early investors, Web3Bay’s presale lists tokens at an initial $0.003. With a structured 28-stage price increase plan, the final stage could see token prices at $0.1959. For early investors, this means an ROI of 6430% at launch, marking it as a highly promising pre-2025 crypto investment. As blockchain technology becomes integral to various industries, Web3Bay is not just participating in the Web3 movement—it’s at the forefront. Imagine being part of a platform with the potential to rival major market players like Amazon, but where you have a stake in its development. Web3Bay represents more than just a project; it’s a community-driven revolution. Summing Up While XRP leverages upcoming regulatory changes and Tron excels through ecosystem expansion and record earnings, Web3Bay is setting new benchmarks in e-commerce by utilizing blockchain to give users complete control over their data and financial transactions, thus removing expensive intermediaries. The 3BAY token extends beyond functionality by offering governance rights, special rewards, and the opportunity for investors to influence the platform’s future. Starting at just $0.003 per token, its presale offers an extraordinary ROI of 6430%, presenting one of the most enticing investment opportunities in the crypto space.

It may appear weak, but its short-term bullish trajectory is still intact. The first and second weeks of December saw CRV’s price through a consolidation phase after failing to push above $1.34 earlier this month. Breaking down from that phase, it lost the key $1 level on Wednesday and closed with an engulfing bar. This triggered more sell-offs yesterday and the price further fell off the $0.8 level to a low of $0.735 today. There are no signs of recovery yet as supply becomes heavy in intraday trading. The bears are now targeting the $0.7 level. If this price level holds, we can expect a small relief in the selling pressure. If not, it may enter the $0.5 range before bouncing back stronger. Looking at the last three days of trading, which marked CRV’s biggest drops since the crypto started to correct lower, it seemed to have reached an oversold condition in the hourly timeframe, though there’s still room for selling in the daily timeframe. So far, the overall market condition has been horrible following a 40% loss in the past week. Nonetheless, there’s still hope for the long-term bulls. A drop below $0.2 could trigger a serious bearish sentiment. CRV’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The next target support for the bears right now is $0.577. If it breaks, the key support level to watch next would be $0.47. A broader correction could bring us back to $0.367 before initiating a fresh increase. A recovery from the current daily low could bring a retest at the flipped $0.88 and $105 levels. The higher resistance level for a break-up is $1.34.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 05:08:00

It’s creative, engaging, and just a little bit ridiculous—everything you want from a meme coin. Why did this coin make it to this list?

DEGEN is proof that when you double down on your niche, you can create something truly special. 6. Andy (ANDY): The Meme Coin with Heart Named after a fictional character who’s all about helping others, ANDY combines meme culture with philanthropy.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/early-shiba-inu-investor-cashes-in-9-5m-during-recent-shib-dip-heres-how/,"An early Shiba Inu investor sold nearly 400 billion tokens during the ongoing market downturn, earning a profit of $9.59 million. The transaction was shared by Lookonchain, a platform that tracks smart money movements. According to Lookonchain , the wallet involved in this transaction belongs to an investor who purchased the digital asset shortly after the project launched. On August 6, 2020, this user acquired 15.28 trillion SHIB for just $3,800, paying an average price of $0.000000000248 per token. By October 2021, when the token reached its all-time high, the value of these holdings surged to $1.22 billion. Since then, the investor has steadily sold portions of their holdings, significantly profiting from the asset’s price appreciation over time. Recent Shiba Inu (SHIB) Sale Details The latest sale, completed in several transactions, involved nearly 400 billion tokens transferred to the Gemini exchange. Data from Lookonchain indicates three initial transactions totaling 250 billion SHIB, broken down into 10 million, 99.98 billion, and 150 billion tokens. Shortly after these transactions, the investor transferred another 150 billion SHIB to the same exchange, bringing the total to approximately 399.99 billion tokens. With the asset trading at around $0.000024 at the time of the sale, the 400 billion tokens were valued at $9.6 million. This represents a staggering profit, as the investor acquired these tokens for just $99.19 in 2020. Etherscan data reveals that this user has also conducted other sales on exchanges like Crypto.com and Gemini in recent weeks. Despite these large sales, the wallet still holds a balance of 2 trillion tokens worth about $48 million. Market Conditions and Broader Trends The investor’s decision to sell comes amid a broader cryptocurrency market downturn, led by Bitcoin’s declining price. The asset has not been immune to the bearish trend, as its value dropped massively during the recent dip. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Amid this market volatility, many investors are converting riskier assets into stablecoins like USDT to protect their capital. In a related move, Lookonchain reported another significant transaction, where an investor moved 150 billion PEPE tokens, valued at $2.72 million, to Binance in response to the market decline. Investor Strategies Amid the Dip The user behind the PEPE transaction had previously purchased 150 billion PEPE tokens for $2.94 million and 60 billion SHIB worth $1.52 million on November 28. However, following the recent market drop, they incurred losses of $219,000 on their PEPE holdings and $136,000 on their SHIB investment. While the PEPE tokens were sold, the investor retained their 60 billion tokens, signaling potential confidence in a recovery for the token. This latest sale highlights the strategic moves of early investors during turbulent market conditions. While some continue to offload their holdings to lock in profits or mitigate losses, others remain confident in the asset’s long-term potential, even during the ongoing market challenges.

In the background, the hot new crypto Rollblock is getting a lot of attention because it could deliver a superior ROI compared to its established competitors. Is RBLK the next big opportunity you shouldn’t miss? Rollblock is the Hot New Crypto with Game-Changing Potential Rollblock is a promising contender in the crypto space. Positioned at the intersection of DeFi and online gaming, Rollblock’s innovative GambleFi model offers a compelling mix of utility and profitability. It already raised over $7 million in its presale. Rollblock’s ecosystem is designed to support over 7,000 games, live casinos, and sports betting, leveraging Ethereum-based smart contracts to ensure transparency and security. What sets Rollblock apart is its deflationary tokenomics, which include regular token buybacks and burns to create scarcity. Investors also benefit from lucrative staking rewards, adding to the token’s appeal. Analysts view Rollblock’s unique approach as a significant advantage, with its projected growth aligned with the $740 billion online gaming market. Early investors in Rollblock’s presale , priced at just $0.043 per token, stand to gain substantial returns as the platform gains traction. Hedera Keeps Gaining Ground Hedera ( HBAR ) has seen a lot of growth, its value soaring over 200% since the start of November. This surge highlights the appeal of its hashgraph technology, which is celebrated for its unmatched speed, energy efficiency, and scalability. Hedera ’s governing council, including industry heavyweights like Google, IBM, and Boeing, further cements its reputation as a trustworthy and forward-thinking blockchain project. Market analysts predict Hedera could climb to $0.566 in the near term. Long-term projections extend even further, with some estimates stating it could reach $2.19 by 2030. Polkadot’s ROI Struggles Because of Persistent Challenges Polkadot was once a favorite in the market, but its price has declined to around $3.98. This is well below its ATH of $55 in 2021. The recent descending triangle pattern in its price chart signals bearish sentiment, with potential support levels at $3.88 and $3.50. Technical indicators suggest that DOT is not done with challenges. Some experts are even concerned it might get back to its launch price of $2.69. Despite these setbacks, Polkadot ’s underlying technology remains robust. Its unique parachain system enables interoperability across blockchains, a feature that could drive future adoption. However, for now, the project struggles to attract the level of investor confidence required for a significant rebound. The Case for High ROI in Emerging Cryptos Hedera ’s bullish momentum demonstrates the potential of innovative technologies to capture market attention. However, Rollblock’s GambleFi protocol offers a fresh angle, blending blockchain transparency with real-world utility in a high-growth industry. Meanwhile, Polkadot faces an uphill battle to reclaim its former glory. For investors seeking strong ROI , the key lies in identifying projects with clear use cases and robust tokenomics. Rollblock, with its presale success and industry-first features, appears well-positioned to outpace established players like Polkadot. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Rollblock’s innovative model may lead the next wave of investor interest. Discover more about Rollblock’s presale and its potential for explosive growth.

Since the advent of the Internet, cloud mining has gradually gained attention as a more convenient way to mine cryptocurrencies. Cloud mining allows users to participate in mining projects of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum by simply renting the computing power of cloud servers without having to purchase expensive mining machines and perform complex technical operations. Such projects have attracted many people who hope to get rich quickly. What is Cloud Mining? First of all, we need to understand what cloud mining is. Cloud mining is a way of mining cryptocurrencies through remote servers. It allows users to participate in cryptocurrency mining activities without owning and maintaining actual mining equipment. Users only need to purchase a certain amount of computing power through cloud mining platforms. These platforms provide corresponding mining machines and computing power. Users only need to monitor and manage their mining income through the interface provided by the platform. Users no longer need to deal with hardware failures, equipment maintenance or power consumption. All of these tasks are taken care of by CrytocoinMiner . How cloud mining works: Renting computing power: Users choose the CrytocoinMiner cloud mining platform and purchase one or more computing power contracts according to their needs. Computing power is usually measured in hash rate (Hash). The higher the hash rate, the more mining benefits. 2.Mining operation: The rented computing power is connected to the mining pool, which is a network that concentrates a large number of miners and improves mining efficiency through division of labor and cooperation. The user’s computing power participates in the calculation of the network to mine cryptocurrency. 3.Obtain income: CrytocoinMiner shares the daily interest rate income according to the computing power contract rented by the user. These income will be distributed to the user’s account regularly. Platform maintenance: CrytocoinMiner will be responsible for providing hardware, operation and maintenance, data center management, and handling electricity costs, etc. Users do not need to buy expensive mining machines, nor do they need to worry about equipment failure or maintenance. https://crytocoinminer.com/xml/index.html#/product What is CrytocoinMiner? This is a cloud mining company founded in 2018. They designed a simple and easy-to-use page so that experienced or inexperienced miners can quickly get started, which also quickly made their global membership exceed 3.7 million. They are an FCA-regulated company (FCA Regulation: Financial Services, Companies and Markets), and CrytocoinMiner treats consumers fairly. According to statistics, the company contributes about 4.5% of the global hash rate. The advantage of CrytocoinMiner is that it is easy to make profits instead of losses. Simplified operation: No technical background or expensive mining machines are required, and anyone can participate. Cost saving: Users do not need to invest in infrastructure such as electricity, mining machines, and cooling equipment. No worries: The platform will be responsible for the operation, management, and update of the mining machines, and users only need to focus on profits. Cryptocurrency fluctuates greatly, and you can earn money when it goes up and lose money when it goes down. Users can mine through crytocoinminer cloud to obtain stable tokens for sale or collection. The following are recommended projects for earning cryptocurrency: Example: Invest $10,000 to purchase $10,000 worth of BTC [Advanced Computing Power], with a contract term of 50 days and a contract daily interest rate of 1.75%. The amount of passive income you can get every day after purchase = $10,000*1.75%=$175. After 50 days, your principal and income = $10,000+$175*50=$10,000+$8,750=$18,750 (Different contract computing power values, different investment amounts and terms, and different incomes, please log in to the CrytocoinMiner official website to view more contracts) To sum up, anyone who participates in the CrytocoinMiner cloud mining project can obtain good passive income. Warm reminder: Since its launch, CrytocoinMiner’s innovative business has been imitated by some companies and even used to create scams. Please be careful to identify it.

37912415,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52783,1734760748,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Shares Top XRP Investment Strategy Amid Market Downturn,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-shares-top-xrp-investment-strategy-amid-market-downturn/,"The cryptocurrency market faced significant turbulence following the Federal Reserve’s latest decision to cut interest rates by 0.25%. This announcement triggered sharp declines across major assets. XRP, in particular, saw its value drop by 6.75%, currently trading at $2.19. Federal Reserve’s Rate Cut and Market Reaction The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut the interest rates to stimulate economic growth but rather led to unexpected market volatility. Traditional and crypto markets experienced sharp declines, with the U.S. stock market losing $1.5 trillion. Cryptocurrency markets suffered $310 million in liquidations within a day, with XRP among the most affected assets. Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, emphasized the central bank’s current position on cryptocurrency, stating that it has no intention of holding Bitcoin or altering its policies to accommodate such assets. These comments contributed to negative sentiment, raising concerns about regulatory uncertainty in the crypto space. Performance Amid the Market Decline XRP’s price collapse erased gains made after the recent launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. After peaking at $2.72, XRP retraced to $2.23, marking a 17% decline within 24 hours. The asset initially recovered slightly, but is currently in a precarious position, with its trading value hovering around $2.19. Despite the recent downturn, cryptocurrency analyst Oscar Ramos suggested that the dip could present an opportunity for accumulation. In a recent video, Ramos highlighted the recurring nature of price corrections in the crypto market and encouraged investors to adopt long-term strategies rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations. Ramos pointed to a similar price drop on December 10, when the token declined following Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s interview on 60 Minutes. According to Ramos, the asset eventually rebounded. The analyst disclosed that he increased his XRP holdings during the latest drop, expressing optimism about the asset’s future. He emphasized the benefits of dollar-cost averaging and advised investors to remain focused on the long-term potential of the token rather than making decisions based on market panic. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin as a Positive Development Ramos also highlighted the recent launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin as a potential driver of XRP’s long-term value. Monica Long, Ripple’s President, described RLUSD as part of Ripple’s commitment to regulatory-compliant stablecoin solutions. She noted the increasing demand for such assets and projected that the market for stablecoins could grow to $3 trillion by 2028. Ripple’s diversification efforts, including its focus on stablecoins, are seen by some analysts as a promising strategy for supporting the asset’s future growth. The token’s struggles are part of a larger downturn across the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin fell from $108,000 to $96,762, while Ethereum faced significant liquidations, including a $4.7 million transaction in ETH perpetual futures on Binance. Ramos urged investors to remain calm in the face of widespread market uncertainty. While fear dominated the market following the Federal Reserve’s announcement, he emphasized the importance of adhering to long-term investment plans rather than making emotionally driven decisions. While the market remains unstable, Ramos and other analysts see opportunities for investors willing to adopt disciplined strategies.

Experts Weigh In On Bitcoin 13% Dip And Potential Recovery,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-this-the-bottom-experts-weigh-in-on-bitcoin-13-dip-and-potential-recovery/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing its first seven-day decline in eight weeks, prompted by hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) that have led traders to sell off the asset, which has more than doubled in value this year. Bitcoin Rebounds To $97,500 After Historic ETF Outflow The market’s leading cryptocurrency saw a drop of as much as 5.3% to $92,149 on Friday, following a record high of just above $108,000 earlier in the week. Since then the Bitcoin price has recovered the $97,500 mark, down approximately 5% since Sunday. This downturn has also affected smaller cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE), despite a generally positive performance in US equities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Loses Momentum: Could A Drop To $75,000 Signal The Final Correction? The shift in sentiment is further highlighted by a significant outflow from US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest directly in Bitcoin. On Thursday, these funds recorded a historic outflow of $680 million, ending a 15-day streak of inflows, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The heightened volatility in the crypto market follows a rally that began after Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election on November 5. Analysts from QCP Capital have noted that positioning in the market had become “overly bullish,” leaving digital assets susceptible to fluctuations in the Federal Reserve’s tone regarding inflation control. With the US Federal Reserve signaling a potential slowdown in its easing measures with its chair’s Powell announcement on Wednesday, the focus is shifting to the pace at which traditional financial institutions adopt cryptocurrency. Historical Patterns Suggest Potential Rebound For BTC’s Price Hani Abuagla, a senior market analyst at XTB, stated in a recent note that the interplay of monetary policy, institutional adoption, and political developments suggests that Bitcoin will remain sensitive to both macroeconomic and crypto-specific catalysts through 2025. This sentiment is echoed by Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group, who advised caution in the short term. Weston noted that while a collapse in price is not imminent, the momentum behind Bitcoin’s recent rally has diminished, indicating a shift in market control. Related Reading: XRP, Solana Among Altcoins Witnessing TD Buy Signal, Analyst Reveals Market expert Lark Davis on the other hand, weighed in on the current price action, reassuring investors that historical patterns could suggest a rebound in the coming days. The expert referenced December 2020, when Bitcoin experienced a 12% drop following a 77% rally in the preceding months but then surged from $17,000 to $41,000—a 136% increase—in just 23 days. Davis posits that a similar scenario may be unfolding now, with Bitcoin facing a 13% dip after a robust fourth quarter. While he acknowledges the possibility of an additional 10-15% correction, he remains optimistic about the potential for further upward movement in the cryptocurrency market.

It fell down to $92,000 as we predicted in our analysis yesterday . Though BTC has moved up by 5%, it still lies in a danger zone. Let’s analyse market metrics to understand what is happening and what to expect. The Bitcoin Chart Bitcoin is currently trading at $97,536 and is trying to move ahead. The presence of Moving Average 200 is active as the active resistance here. The RSI has also risen and has moved out of the oversold zone, however the danger of pullback remains. If the market does not get enough buying volume, the MA 200 can push the price back down. Earlier, it received support around $92k due to the presence of MA 50 on the daily chart, however that might not be enough this time. The Greed and Fear index is at 73, however the real market sentiment is still bearish. Source : Coinglass The MACD histogram shows reduction in selling pressure, however the average direction index has fallen to 33.62 which is not a good sign for Bitcoin. We can also see the moving average 20 has fallen below MA 50 and 100 which sends a negative impression to the market. If the price keeps on consolidating in this area or it moves a little down the smallest MA will go below the highest and it will trigger a panic in the market. This could send the price down to $90k or even bad. The Liquidation Data According to Coinglass’s crypto liquidation data, in the past 24 hours, 296,631 traders got liquidated. This caused a total of $831.74 million to wash out of the market. Yesterday this amount went over $1 billion. The last 4 days have been very bad for the long traders as the market kept on going down. Source : Coinglass The liquidation map shows that there are still traders who have opened long trades for Bitcoin with high leverages upto 100x. Taking some decisions in time of a bearish momentum shows there are still people out there who do not understand the gravity of the situation. The map also shows the short trades with high leverages. During such periods, the market has a tendency to suddenly move in the opposite direction to liquidate traders with bad risk management. Source : Coinglass What to Expect The very first thing we should be seeing now is Bitcoin price coming above the moving average 200. That will decrease the negative sentiment from the market and encourage more investors to jump in. However, for this to happen the market needs some buying volume. The market could make a sudden spike, just to liquidate the careless short traders, and this will give support to the market.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 06:24:00

Meanwhile, NEAR Protocol and innovative new crypto Rollblock challenge its momentum. Both projects have unique strengths that are fascinating investors globally. Rollblock: A New Crypto Poised to Disrupt the Market Rollblock is a game-changing project, having already raised $7.4 million during its ongoing presale. It leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize the online gaming industry and presents a unique value proposition that stands out in the crowded DeFi space. The platform offers seamless integration across over 7,000 games, live casino experiences and even sports betting, all secured by Ethereum-backed smart contracts that enhance transparency and security. Its innovative deflationary tokenomics system, which includes regular token buybacks, burns and staking rewards, reduces supply and incentivizes holding in the long term. Targeting the $500 billion global gaming industry, Rollblock provides tangible real-world applications that set it apart from competitors. Analysts highlight its potential to deliver substantial returns on investment (ROI), with some suggesting it could even outperform established projects like Litecoin and NEAR . Litecoin’s Momentum Builds on Miner Activity and ETF Buzz The performance of the Litecoin price has been nothing short of unimpressive. The token dropped 35% within just seven days, hitting a low of $90, buoyed by $18 million worth of LTC purchased by miners. These acquisitions, totaling 140,000 coins, reduced the supply of newly minted tokens entering circulation, driving demand and supporting upward momentum. The anticipation of a Litecoin ETF has only added to the excitement. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas recently identified Litecoin as a strong contender for ETF approval due to its regulatory clarity as a Bitcoin fork. Such an ETF could introduce significant institutional investment and push the Litecoin price toward $150. Technical indicators suggest that breaking resistance at $135 could trigger another rally, setting the stage for the Litecoin price to test new highs. NEAR Protocol Eyes $11 After 95% Price Surge NEAR Protocol has also been making waves, recovering from $3.50 to $6.83 in just three weeks—a staggering 95% gain. This V-shaped rally has been supported by strong buying pressure, resulting in a golden crossover between the 100-day and 200-day EMAs. Despite minor pullbacks, NEAR continues to demonstrate resilience, with its current resistance at $7.26 marking the next critical level to watch. Looking ahead, analysts are targeting $9.59 and $11 as potential price milestones for NEAR . The protocol’s innovative approach to decentralized applications and its robust technical indicators make it a strong candidate for further growth, even amid market volatility. Where to Focus? As Litecoin , NEAR , and Rollblock compete for investor attention, each presents a unique blend of opportunity and risk. Litecoin’s combination of strong miner support and the potential for ETF approval makes it an appealing choice for those seeking immediate market momentum. NEAR’s rapid recovery and robust technical indicators position it as a solid mid-term growth play, particularly for investors looking for consistent upward trends. However, new crypto Rollblock’s innovative approach and unmatched real-world utility firmly establish it as the standout option for long-term investment. It delivers practical applications and addresses tangible needs. It redefines expectations in DeFi and so positions itself as the project most likely to deliver sustained and significant returns.

Investors are also going all-in into Lunex (LNEX) , a new DeFi token handpicked by market pundits as the best crypto investment of 2025. Let’s examine why LNEX is expected to beat Cardano’s price hands down with an incredible presale performance. Analysts praise Lunex (LNEX) as the best crypto investment in DeFi The Lunex Network brings groundbreaking crypto trading solutions into the DeFi market. Featuring an innovative multichain bridge, this new non-custodial decentralized exchange brings together multiple blockchain networks, creating an all-in-one DeFi trading protocol. This cross-chain functionality enables seamless asset transfers across different blockchains, significantly reducing trading costs and transaction times. Traders and investors can now trade, swap, and transfer over 50,000+ crypto pairs across 40+ blockchains using the Lunex DEX. More impressively, a portion of the funds collected on the Lunex DeFi swapping dApp is allocated for investors’ rewards. The platform pays up to 18% APY to LNEX holders engaging in staking, making the asset a top crypto investment for DeFi degens seeking high ROI passive income streams. LNEX is also a solid investment option for growth investors. With the DeFi market tipped to continue growing exponentially, experts believe the Lunex crypto exchange is well-positioned to capitalize on the rising DeFi trading trends. Conservative predictions place LNEX presale returns at 18x, followed by staggering post-launch yields as the Lunex DEX develops into a multi-billion crypto exchange. Whales enter an accumulation spree as Cardano’s price drops Early December, the Cardano price was trading at $1.1, a slight pullback from its recent high of $1.32. Cardano whales have taken advantage of the price decrease to solidify their positions, scooping over 80 million ADA in the past few days. The recent buying spree aligns with broader trends observed over the past weeks, where large-wallet holders poured nearly $300 million into ADA . That indicates investors’ confidence in the smart contracts platform and could fuel further price appreciation. Is ADA a good crypto investment ? Cardano’s price broke out in November and has delivered a nearly 5x return from its $0.27 August dip. Per CoinMarketCap, ADA has delivered a 70% return year to date and was up over 90% monthly. ADA ‘s community sentiment was over 90% bullish, indicating there could still be more progress in store for Cardano in the coming months. The altcoin is expected to trade in the $1-$1.2 zone through December, giving investors enough wiggle to double up before the next leg up. Per CoinCodex data, ADA is expected to trade in a channel between $1.13 and $5.83 in 2025 for a 400% potential ROI, making Cardano a good crypto investment for solid yields. ADA is good, but LNEX is great Crypto shrimps looking for staggering yields have scooped up over 2.28 billion LNEX as the Lunex ICO surpasses $5.3 million. The presale is already past 283%, with only about 1.7 billion tokens left up for grabs. Tokens are selling out fast at $0.0046, so race over to load up your LNEX bag today!

Lunex Network (LNEX) Soars 283% in Crypto ICO Event, More Gains Incoming While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are seeing some red price charts right now, Lunex Network (LNEX) is riding a bullish wave. This DeFi project , now in its presale run, has given early buyers a 283% return. Moreover, it has raised over $5M. This shows the level of interest people have in Lunex Network. Hype is growing for Lunex Network as it will disrupt the DeFi market . It will launch a non-custodial crypto exchange that connects all isolated blockchains.

A Tier-1 crypto exchange listing is expected to trigger a pump to $0.0216 – a 369% return for anyone who buys LNEX now. This surge could make LNEX one of the best DeFi coins for fast returns. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price May See a Massive Pump, Analyst Predicts Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen some red price charts, although it is still one of the meme coin titans . Its value has dropped over 15% in the past week as per CoinMarketCap . In that period, the Dogecoin price has jumped from around $0.40 to nearly $0.35. But, crypto analyst CEO remains optimistic about Dogecoin (DOGE). In a recent X post , he told his followers that the next price pump for this meme coin will be massive.

Currently, this meme coin has a momentum indicator of -0.06, which is in the buy zone per TradingView . This suggests that a bullish trend may continue. The Price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) Could Rise, but Volatility Remains Shiba Inu (SHIB) is another meme coin experiencing volatility right now.

Nevertheless, market analyst InvestingHaven is still bullish on Shiba Inu (SHIB). According to his X post , this meme coin could surge to $0.0000998 in 2025. However, the path to this level may be volatile. Many traders are excited about this Shiba Inu price prediction . The Shiba Inu crypto also has some good technical signs. TradingView data points to this meme coin has a momentum indicator of −0.00000409, which is in the buy zone. With this indicator, a bullish trend may come for this Shiba Inu. Can Lunex Network (LNEX) Outpace Dogecoin (DOGE) & Shiba Inu (SHIB)? Though Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) may have been successful, Lunex Network (LNEX) offers more: real utility and a promising future. Thanks to its cutting-edge technology, privacy focus, and cross-chain capacity, it can become a strong player in the crypto market . Since it will also have a smaller market cap than its peers, LNEX could see faster growth with less money too. Therefore, experts predict a potential 3x growth for this DeFi coin in 2025.

(Terraform). Tai Mo Shan is further charged with trading securities in unregistered transactions. The SEC established that the firm acted as a statutory underwriter on some of its offers and sales of LUNA, which was also issued by Terraform and sold as a security. SEC chair Gary Gensler said: “This case reminds us that, too many times in the crypto markets, we’ve seen significant investor losses due to fraud.” ~ Gary Gensler He stated that Tai Mo Shan’s illegal activities affected the entire crypto market, leading to serious investor losses. Gary stressed the need for market players to comply with security laws and avoid deceiving the public about investors’ security. Tai Mo Shan agreed to settle the fine TerraUSD worked at a constant $1 value through a web of mixed algorithms and trader motivations involving LUNA . However, when the network was strained and seemed to be breaking, Tai Mo Shan made huge purchases that helped to stabilize the coin. According to the SEC, the impression from Tai Mo’s purchase was that the algorithmic mechanism was working, yet it was a deceitful tactic. Tai Mo made the purchases around May 2021, when the value of TerraUSD dropped below the $1 peg. The firm was motivated to purchase more than $20 million from Terraform. Tai Mo Shan agreed to pay $73,452,756 in disgorgement, $12,916,153 in prejudgment interest, and a $36,726,378 civil penalty as part of the settlement. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Tai Mo Shan agreed to cease and desist from violating the registration and fraud provisions it violated. SEC reveals Jump Crypto’s involvement in TerraUSD collapse According to SEC’s court filings, Jump Crypto had an arrangement with Terraform to bolster TerraUSD and earned up to $1 billion in profit. Later, Terraform agreed to pay around $4.5 billion to settle a SEC lawsuit on its collapse. Terra’s collapse shook the crypto world, wiping out $40 billion in investor assets and stock. Luna Foundation established a ring of people as its guard, and among those people was Jump Crypto’s intern-turned-president Kanav Kariya. Luna Foundation Guard was responsible for overseeing TerraUSD’s reserve. The SEC’s case against Jump Trading was initiated during the crypto winter and finally settled.

MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Thinks So! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Michael Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, has shared a bold idea: by using Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the United States could make up to $81 trillion. Saylor believes this move could position the U.S. as the leader of the global digital economy. Perhaps his idea faced criticism, with some saying it could weaken the U.S. dollar and harm the economy. US Could Unlock $81 Trillion With Bitcoin According to Michael Saylor, adopting a Bitcoin reserve would allow the U.S. to leverage the cryptocurrency’s scarcity and growing global value. He suggests that a strategic Bitcoin policy could strengthen the U.S. dollar, reduce national debt, and boost the economy by creating trillions in value. Saylor also outlined a scenario where global digital capital markets could expand from $2 trillion to $280 trillion, with the U.S. capturing a significant share of this growth. He also predicted that the Bitcoin reserve could generate anywhere from $16 trillion to $81 trillion for the U.S. Treasury, unlocking huge opportunities for U.S. companies. Some even believe that Bitcoin’s price could soar to $500,000 if this vision comes to life. Peter Schiff Slams Salyor’s Proposal While Saylor’s vision has its supporters, it has also faced strong criticism. Economist and long-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff called the proposal “complete bullshit, ” claiming it would harm the U.S. economy. This is complete bullshit. The proposal would do the opposite. It would weaken the dollar, exacerbate the national debt, and making America a laughing stock. It would deprive business of power, diminish growth, and destroy value. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 20, 2024 Schiff argued that adopting Bitcoin as a national reserve would weaken the dollar, increase national debt, and destabilize the economy. “This would deprive businesses of power, reduce growth, and destroy value.” Although, Schiff has always argued that Bitcoin is too risky and unstable to be a reliable financial asset. Instead, he supports gold, which he sees as a safer investment. Bitcoin’s Role in the Future Saylor’s bold proposal adds to the ongoing discussion about Bitcoin’s place in national economies.

The massive withdrawals from the crypto exchange Binance show that big players are confident of ETH’s future rally despite recent volatility. This sets the stage for a quick bounce back to $4,000, which has served as a strong resistance. Analysts believe that once ETH crossed $4,000, new all-time highs past $5,000 will come in no time. Ethereum Whales Turn Active Buying the Dips Following yesterday’s crypto market crash , there’s a brief recovery amid significant Ethereum (ETH) accumulation by whales amid the current ETH price dips. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain reported that ten newly created wallets collectively withdrew 17,698 ETH, valued at approximately $61.66 million, from Binance. The activity by Ethereum whales underscores renewed interest from large investors, who appear to be capitalizing on the market’s recovery momentum.

To date, World Liberty has purchased 9,587 ETH, valued at $35 million, with $3,651 as an average acquisition price per ETH. Despite market fluctuations, the entity has reduced its unrealized loss on ETH holdings to $3.4 million, reflecting a narrowing deficit as prices recover.

On Friday, the ETH price touched a low of $3098 before bouncing back once again amid Ethereum whale accumulation. As of press time, the Ethereum price is trading at $3,480 levels with its daily trading volume above $61 billion. As per the Coinglass data , the 24-hour liquidations have soared to $170 million amid the current price volatility. For now, the immediate resistance is $3,500 for Ethereum, crossing which it could bounce to $4,000. Crypto market analysts remain bullish despite this current turbulence in ETH. Market analyst Crypto Patel expects ETH price to surge to $8,000-$10,000 level. He wrote: “I’m buying every $ETH dip, no matter how much it drops. Just holding strong and stacking up. Ethereum hasn’t hit its new all-time high yet, but it’s only a matter of time. Staying patient and ready for the rise! Still telling you my ETH Target is $8000-$10k”. Source: Crypto Patel Another crypto analyst venturefounder noted that Ethereum is still on track to new all-time highs in 2025, supported by whale buying. The analyst compared the current four-year cycle (2021–2024) to the previous one (2016–2020), highlighting striking similarities. According to the analysis, Ethereum’s performance in the year following a Bitcoin halving—such as 2017 and 2021—has historically marked significant growth phases. Previously, venturefounder gave an ETH price target of over $15,000 by May 2025.

Sacks said he would spend 50% of his time in Washington D.C. guiding policy and 50% in Silicon Valley to stay connected with cutting-edge technological advancements, including artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrencies. ‘AI & Crypto Czar’ David Sacks Refutes Forbes Report David Sacks took to X on December 21 to clarify his role remains the same as he requested. The incoming AI and crypto czar said he will have a leadership role in establishing policies and regulations for technologies, such as AI and crypto. Earlier today, Fortune reported that the AI and crypto czar role initially expected to be a cut-and-dry leadership role is set to be more of a general advisory position. The legacy media cited two people familiar with the inner workings of the Trump Vance transition team. The reason for scaling back the role was reported to be Sacks not divesting from his investment firm Craft Ventures. “Not divesting, not taking a more formal government role, that makes it very complicated. Even if Trump and people in his administration usually see conflicts of interest as an afterthought, the situation with Sacks became an issue, even from a practical perspective.” However, Sacks said, “This is total nonsense.” Also, he expects to spend 50% of his time in Washington D.C. directing policy. The remaining 50% in Silicon Valley staying on the cutting edge technological advancements, he added. This is in line with what David Sacks requested .

Ripple CTO David Schwartz addressed the situation, attributing the pricing anomaly to economic factors related to supply and demand. RLUSD’s Launch and Early Impact RLUSD officially debuted on December 17 as a native stablecoin on the XRP Ledger network. Its release generated excitement among XRP holders, briefly sending its price above $2.70. However, in the days leading up to its launch, some wallets reported irregular valuations for the stablecoin, far exceeding its intended $1 peg. Screenshots shared on social media, including X, highlighted RLUSD being priced at 511.20 XRP on the Xaman wallet, equating to approximately $1,200. This abnormal valuation was particularly striking, given RLUSD’s classification as a stablecoin designed to maintain a fixed value. Community Reactions and Speculation The unusual pricing attracted significant attention from the community. Some users speculated that the inflated stablecoin’s value could drive XRP’s market price. Questions were raised about whether this valuation trend would persist until the stablecoin’s official release. One community member confirmed observing the elevated pricing and expressed optimism about its potential impact on XRP. Such sentiments underscored growing anticipation around the stablecoin and its possible role in shaping the broader ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple CTO Explains Price Spike In response to concerns, Ripple CTO David Schwartz provided insights into the price surge, citing basic economic principles. According to Schwartz, the pre-launch valuation spike was primarily driven by the limited supply of the coin combined with high demand. He explained that the XRPL system adjusts valuations based on the highest buy orders. In this case, a buyer willing to pay $1,200 for one RLUSD caused the system to reflect that price. Schwartz emphasized that such discrepancies are expected in the early stages of issuance but assured that market dynamics would stabilize as RLUSD’s supply increases over time. Costly Pre-Launch Trades It’s worth noting that some traders experienced significant losses during the price volatility. A user swapped 10,000 XRP for 100 RLUSD before the stablecoin’s official market debut. The token was trading at approximately $2.71 at the time, meaning the trader effectively paid $271 per RLUSD. Once the stablecoin launched and reverted to its $1 peg, the trader’s $27,100 investment dropped to just $100. Since its launch, RLUSD has settled closer to its intended valuation. As of now, CoinMarketCap reports that the stablecoin is trading at $1, with a total supply of 53.1 million. This stabilization aligns with Schwartz’s prediction, alleviating concerns over the extreme pre-launch fluctuations. The RLUSD rollout has highlighted the complexities of introducing new digital assets, particularly stablecoins, on blockchain networks. While the pre-launch pricing anomaly drew criticism and financial losses for some, the stablecoin appears to have achieved its intended function of maintaining a stable value. Ripple’s focus will likely shift to optimizing the stablecoin’s performance and utility within the ecosystem.

Concerns have surfaced about whether this downturn signals the conclusion of the current bull cycle or merely represents a temporary setback. While short-term holders face losses, long-term metrics provide a broader perspective on Bitcoin’s trajectory, as analyzed by CryptoQuant’s Avocado Onchain in a recent report. Related Reading: As Bitcoin Reclaims $100,000, Warning Signs Emerge from Long-Term Investors Opportunity Or End of The Bull Cycle? According to Avocado Onchain, the realized price for investors who entered the market during Bitcoin’s recent peak at $98,000 places them in a loss-making position. However, for those who invested between one to three months ago, the realized price is significantly lower at $71,000, offering a cushion against the current correction. Avocado pointed out that historical patterns from Bitcoin’s 2021 bull cycle reveal similar alternations between record highs and sharp corrections, suggesting that these dips may not necessarily indicate the end of the cycle. Instead, they have historically been “opportunities” for market rebalancing and subsequent growth. A key indicator analyzed is the 30-day moving average of the short-term SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio). This metric tracks whether recent market participants are selling at a profit or a loss. The current SOPR data reveals that recent short-term inflows into Bitcoin have yet to result in substantial profit-taking. Unlike previous cycle peaks characterized by aggressive selling, the ongoing correction appears subdued, indicating that the market may still have room for upward movement. Bitcoin Short-Term Dips vs. Long-Term Trends Additionally, Avocado Onchain highlights the importance of distinguishing between short-term corrections and broader cycle trends. Bitcoin’s tendency to rebound after corrections in past bull cycles reinforces the notion that the current downturn might not mark the cycle’s end. These insights align with the behaviour of long-term holders, who often use corrections to consolidate their positions, strengthening market resilience. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In For This Cycle? On-Chain Signals You Need To Know Avocado concluded the analysis, noting: For investors who have yet to enter the market, this may be an excellent opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a discount. Instead of succumbing to panic selling during short-term downturns, adopting a long-term perspective and a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy could be a more effective approach. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is seeing a gradual rebound in its price surging by 1.3% in the past 1 hour. Regardless, the asset still appears to be overshadowed by the bears as BTC remains down by 3.5% in the past day and 10.5% from its peak of $108,135 recorded last week.

It’s a deflationary memecoin with a catchy theme and a straightforward approach. Unlike other complicated projects, PEPE embraces its meme roots and keeps things pure and simple. There’s no utility promised, and the team is upfront about it. They appeal to the crypto community by having no transaction taxes and focusing purely on being a fun and engaging token. In late April to May 2023, PEPE saw an explosive surge that pushed its market cap to a staggering $1.6 billion. Early investors saw massive gains, turning some into millionaires overnight. This surge sparked what many call a “memecoin season,” with other meme-based tokens experiencing wild price swings. PEPE’s roadmap includes plans to get listed on major exchanges and aims for a “meme takeover.” While it’s uncertain if PEPE and other memecoins will reach new highs, many in the crypto community are hopeful, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle. In a market where memes can drive value, PEPE stands out as an attractive coin for those looking to ride the next big wave. Conclusion SUI and PEPE are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) leads as a sports-themed memecoin uniting fans, aiming for massive growth and blending meme culture with sports enthusiasm.

BTFD Coin: The Brightest Newcomer in Meme Coins BTFD Coin is redefining what it means to be a meme coin.

Its Play-to-Earn game is a standout feature, allowing players to engage in fun gameplay while earning rewards.

Mog Coin: The Once-Darling of Meme Coins Mog Coin burst onto the scene with a lot of fanfare, tapping into the meme coin craze that has captured the imagination of many.

Many investors who once believed in Mog Coin are now looking elsewhere, seeking opportunities that promise more substantial returns. While Mog Coin has managed to retain a dedicated following, it’s struggling to keep pace with newcomers like BTFD Coin. Analysts have been cautious about Mog Coin’s future, with some suggesting that its initial hype may not translate into sustainable growth. In a world where meme coins rise and fall based on trends, Mog Coin’s ability to adapt is under scrutiny. Recent developments indicate that Mog Coin is facing challenges in maintaining its relevance. As BTFD Coin continues to attract attention and investment, the contrast becomes stark.

The question many are asking is: can Mog Coin recover, or is it time to pivot towards more promising investments?

The current price of $0.00013 is a steal compared to the projected listing price of $0.0006. If you’re not paying attention, you might miss out on what could be a life-changing investment opportunity. In contrast, Mog Coin’s allure is waning, and the crypto all-stars are starting to shift their focus. For anyone serious about investing in meme coins, BTFD Coin is quickly becoming the go-to option.

Solana and its role in blockchain technology Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and hosting decentralized applications. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, powers the network by facilitating transactions, running programs, and rewarding contributors. Solana’s design supports fast processing without requiring sharding or extra layers, attracting developers and projects. This architecture makes it suitable for building high-activity solutions and innovative services. SOL has utility within the system, supporting various projects and acting as an incentive for participants. In the current market, SOL’s appeal depends on interest in scalable platforms and decentralized app growth. Its performance potential may draw attention from developers and investors seeking alternatives to other established blockchains. Cardano: A scalable and sustainable blockchain platform Cardano is a blockchain platform known for its focus on sustainability, scalability, and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for value storage, payments, and staking. Cardano uses an energy-efficient proof-of-stake model called Ouroboros. The platform is divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This design improves speed and scalability. Cardano supports decentralized finance apps, token creation, and games, making it a competitor to Ethereum. Its unique setup allows secure and low-fee interactions. With high transaction potential and an environmentally friendly approach, ADA remains a strong contender in the evolving cryptocurrency market. Its technological advancements make it an appealing option in the current cycle. XRP: A digital currency for fast and borderless transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency created for quick, low-cost, and worldwide payments. It runs on the XRP Ledger, a decentralized system that ensures secure and irreversible transactions without requiring a bank account. Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz designed XRP with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple, the organization behind XRP, holds a significant portion and uses it for liquidity and ecosystem support. By operating without central control, XRP aims to simplify currency transfers and enable broader financial access. Its speed and scalability make it stand out in the cryptocurrency market. XRP’s performance in the current market depends on broader adoption and technological advancements driving its use case. BNB: Key cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem BNB is the main cryptocurrency of Binance, launched in 2017 as an ERC-20 token. It now operates on the Binance Chain and Smart Chain, supporting smart contracts and various transactions. It is used to pay fees, issue tokens, and transfer assets. Users get discounts on Binance and access to third-party services. Its supply is reduced quarterly through burning, aiming to decrease the original 200 million supply by half. BNB’s integration into Binance’s ecosystem and its utility in multiple areas make it appealing. Its role in smart contracts, staking rewards, and fee discounts adds value. The overall demand for Binance services influences its market appeal. Evaluation depends on market timing and broader cryptocurrency trends. Conclusion SOL, ADA, XRP, and BNB show modest short-term potential but may gain over time. However, DOGEN stands out as the ultimate choice for those chasing unparalleled success. With an expected 700% presale surge and ties to the success of tokens like BONK, it aims to dominate. DOGEN offers exclusive rewards and builds a community of leaders seeking true market impact.

Ripple Explodes 20% From $1.96 Lows,https://cryptopotato.com/is-xrps-bottom-in-ripple-explodes-20-from-1-96-lows/,"TL:DR; The entire cryptocurrency market went through a massive crash in the past few days, but Ripple’s cross-border token was among the poorest performers. Since then, though, XRP has gained roughly 20%, leading to the question of whether it has found its bottom. XRP Bounces Off The developments at the start of the business week couldn’t really foresee what would transpire just a few days later. On Monday, Ripple announced that its long-awaited stablecoin will finally see the light of day on the next day (December 17) after it was greenlighted by the NYDFS. XRP’s price reacted positively to both the announcement and the subsequent launch as its price skyrocketed from $2.35 to a multi-day peak of over $2.7 by Tuesday. After a minor retracement to $2.6, things went sour on Wednesday after the latest US FOMC meeting. XRP, alongside the rest of the market, plummeted to under $2.25, losing nearly 20% of its value in 36 hours. Although that was already a painful retracement, the landscape worsened on Thursday and Friday as the asset plunged to below $2 for just the third time since December 1. Thus, Ripple’s token had dumped by 28% from Tuesday to Friday, going from $2.72 to $1.96. The bulls finally stepped up at this point and didn’t allow any further declines. Just the opposite, XRP bounced off and has gained about 20% since then, currently sitting at $2.35. According to popular X analyst Dark Defender, XRP “double tap on 4-hour charts for both on RSI and Price,” which, alongside the “tremendous bullish pin” on the daily chart, suggests that the asset has already bottomed and is ahead of more gains. XRP double tap on 4-hour charts for both on RSI and Price. Additionally daily frame has a tremendous bullish pin bar. These are initial signals for momentum to continue. Time will tell pic.twitter.com/85zgnzOhvC — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 20, 2024 It’s About Perspective During the lows, many crypto commentators started to speculate whether the overall bull cycle had ended. After all, the entire crypto market cap lost roughly $500 billion in just days at one point. However, Moon Lambo outlined a different view for those retracements, including XRP’s plunge. The YouTuber talked about having a perspective, as XRP, for instance, stood below $0.5 less than two months ago. Consequently, going from over $2.7 to under $2 is indeed painful, but looking at it on a broader scale, it still shows that the asset is a lot higher than it used to be just weeks ago. As someone who has been holding $XRP for over 7 years, while the price has been well under $1.00 for almost 100% of that time, and having never sold a single $XRP ever, I must say… I find it amusing that people are freaking out that $XRP *dropped* to $2.15. Bitch it was 49… pic.twitter.com/1FoohjdxUv — Moon Lambo (@MoonLamboio) December 20, 2024 The post Is XRP’s Bottom In?

Kiyosaki Urges Investment in Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Robert Kiyosaki, a renowned businessman and the author of a highly successful financial book series, Rich Dad Poor Dad, in a recent post on X, warns about the possibility of a global financial crisis. He advises people to invest in gold, silver and Bitcoin to protect wealth. Here is what you should know. Why Kiyosaki Distrusts the US Financial System The popular financial author strongly criticises the US government, Treasury and the Federal Reserve, denouncing the established financial governance system as a ‘Den of Thieves’. The 77-year old business leader states that he lost his trust in the US established system when silver coins were replaced with alloys in 1965. He also presents the removal of the gold standards in 1971 by the Nixon regime as another reason for his distrust towards the US government and its established economic system dominated by the US dollar. https://twitter.com/therealkiyosaki/status/1870288365150781627?s=46 The Case for Gold, Silver and Bitcoin Dismissing fiat currency as fake money, the American businessman advises people to invest in gold, silver and Bitcoin. It is not the first time that he has openly questioned the credibility of fiat currency. In some of his recent interviews, he explained how fake money is used to loot people. Criticism of Financial Planners and Education System Emphasising how financial planners misguide people, Kiyoski recommends preparing by learning about money and investing independently using possibilities like YouTube videos. In conclusion, Kiyosaki’s message is clear: Protect your wealth by investing in real assets and educating yourself. As financial uncertainties loom, his advice to think independently about money has never been more relevant.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-21 07:18:58

Besides, the recent performance of XRP, as well as the broader crypto market, also signals that investors are once again entering the market after a recent pause. Simultaneously, the recent Ripple developments also indicate that the momentum remains strong for the future trajectory of the coin. XRP News: Ripple Whales Bag 80M Coins Amid Market Crash In the latest XRP news, Ripple whales have once again fueled speculations with their recent moves. According to reports, the whales have continued their buying spree as the broader crypto market crashed recently, giving investors a buy-the-dip opportunity. For context, Bitcoin and top altcoins have recorded sharp declines recently, which has created a buying opportunity at a dip for many investors. Prominent crypto market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the buying trend for XRP. He noted that the whales have accumulated 80 million coins since December 17, when the market started declining after a robust run over the past few days. In addition, other big transfers of the tokens have also fueled speculations in the digital assets space, especially amid the recent developments. Source: Ali Martinez, X Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s election win has already fueled market optimism this year. In addition, crypto has been crucial this year, with Trump pledging to make the US the crypto capital. This has also triggered speculations over a potential rally ahead for the crypto issued by US-based firms. Additionally, the blockchain firm also reportedly made a significant contribution to Donald Trump’s inauguration recently alongside other crypto firms. According to a FOX Business report, Ripple is reportedly planning to donate $5 million to the fund, with Coinbase and Kraken giving $1 million each. This has further fueled sentiments over a pro-crypto regulatory environment in the US after Trump’s inauguration on January 20. What Lies Ahead For Ripple? The recent launch of Ripple stablecoin RLUSD has already fueled optimism, and this XRP news is expected to continue to support the bullish momentum ahead. Market experts said the new stablecoin would help in increasing liquidity through XRPL, which in turn would improve its native crypto’s appeal as a bridge asset for cross-border payments. Notably, XRP price today jumped more than 4% and exchanged hands at $2.36, while its trading volume soared 27% to $26.34 billion. Notably, the crypto has declined below the $2 mark in the last 24 hours, indicating that investors are regaining confidence in the asset. However, despite the recent surge, its Futures Open Interest was down more than 30% during writing, CoinGlass data showed. In addition, in a separate post recently, Ali Martinez said that Ripple’s native crypto might face heavy liquidation of $20.50 million in short positions if it hits $2.62. Despite these short-term pullback concerns, experts remained confident about the long-term trajectory of the coin towards the $3 mark ahead.

The coin still has zero utility and still represents a joke, but it has grown into a massive crypto project with millions of fans all over the world. Dogecoin has risen to an all-time high above $0.6, which is quite impressive for the kind of origin and utility it has. And for many years, DOGE holders have wondered if the coin would hit the elusive $1 landmark. Will it hit this price level or will a new altcoin like Rollblock do so first? Read on to find out. Positive Dogecoin news indicate better future for DOGE Dogecoin picked up some big fans over the years. One of its prominent proponents is Elon Musk, who has incessantly tweeted about it and even suggested that DOGE would be used as a payment method in his company. Even Dogecoin news from the Financial Times are answering questions on the possibilities of Dogecoin becoming the US currency. What if Donald Trump fires Federal Reserves chair Jay Powell and makes this suggestion a reality? In essence, Dogecoin has a lot of goodwill around it at the moment. That is why there are shouts that it could hit a landmark $1. If this happens, it would fetch DOGE holders really decent profits. But are there other coins that would fetch investors a bigger ROI? New altcoin Rollblock leads the way Rollblock is a crypto pioneer like Dogecoin , but it is leading the way in a different manner. This new altcoin combines blockchain technology with iGaming to create a transparent online casino where honest gambling and fair gaming takes priority. In essence, Rollblock is a place where anyone can play exciting games, have an unforgettable experience, win big and cash out without any hassles. Its dedication to user empowerment and trustworthy practices makes it the go-to platform for most gamblers. As a result, Rollblock is home to thousands of active users and the number will keep growing. This is quite impressive, as Rollblock is still in presale. Having a working product takes it ahead of most presales, and the fact that it is at the forefront of provably fair gaming sets it apart from other platforms in the GambleFi space. Savvy crypto investors acknowledge Rollblock’s potential and that’s why they’re rushing its presale in droves. Over $7.4 million has been raised in its ongoing presale with more than 10 million tokens sold. The token itself is available for $0.043 and based on its precedents, there’s a real possibility of hitting $1. The bottom line Only hype can push Dogecoin above $1 and that is a defect in itself. When that hype dies down or there’s negative market sentiment, Dogecoin tanks. That is why DOGE depreciated by over 20% in the last month after crypto market sentiments turned sour. Rollblock, on the other hand, is a utility token, so it isn’t really affected by hype. Its aim is to dominate the online gaming market, which is worth over half a trillion dollars at the moment. The new altcoin has the capacity to achieve this feat, but realizing just 1% of this ambition will push its price above $1 and fetch early investors enormous gains. This is why no one should miss out on it. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Nabiullina said the central bank was considering three options: keeping the interest rate steady, raising it to 22% or increasing it further to 23%. Ultimately, the board decided that keeping the interest rate steady was a stronger signal for the economy. “From a forward-looking policy perspective, the stronger signal was that credit growth was slowing,” Nabiullina said. If this trend is confirmed at the February meeting, it could indicate that the desired level of monetary tightening has been achieved, she added. Addressing concerns about the ruble's performance, Nabiullina reiterated that Russia maintains its floating exchange rate policy and does not aim to keep its currency at a certain level. Related News: The Decline Also Hit Donald Trump: All 6 Altcoins He Bought Suffered Major Decline “Our exchange rate is floating, we do not have a goal of keeping it at a certain level,” he said. However, he explained that currency interventions are made in case financial stability risks that the central bank does not currently foresee arise. Nabiullina reaffirmed the central bank’s cautious approach to cryptocurrencies, distinguishing between domestic and international use cases. “We continue to believe that cryptocurrencies should not be used as a means of domestic payment,” he said. However, while he supports projects involving cryptocurrencies for external payments, he expressed his absolute opposition to their use within Russia’s domestic financial system.

Table of Contents Dogecoin: A memecoin with millionaire potential FX Guys: Unlocking endless earning opportunities with staking and Trade2Earn Rewards FX Guys: Empowering skilled investors with capital and simplified trading Conclusion Investing $1,000 in cryptocurrency could be a life-changing move. But for this to happen, users must invest in the right tokens. Investing in the right crypto entails conducting detailed personal research to identify good projects with versatile utilities, clear roadmaps, and active communities. Among the top DeFi coins that can transform $1,000 into a significant chance, FX Guys (FXG) and Dogecoin (DOGE ) are commonly chosen. Dogecoin, a meme cryptocurrency that has provided great returns for initial investors, has remained prominent since its inception. Similarly, FX Guys is considered one of the best cryptos to invest in, designed with effective DeFi and TradFi tools to offer investors optimal benefits. This article explores the potential of FX Guys and Dogecoin to turn $1,000 into a life-changing investment.

From its low of $0.0000869, DOGE has removed several zeros and ranks as one of the top altcoins with potential to make a $1,000 investment into a large sum. Currently priced over $0.39, it has seen a rise of more than 24% in the past month. DOGE has a community and some crypto influencers that hype it up. Recently, Tesla, owned by Elon Musk, accepted it as payment. This use makes it more practical, allowing the price to possibly rise further. FX Guys: Unlocking endless earning opportunities with staking and Trade2Earn Rewards The FX Guys is an altcoin with the most potential due to its unique strategies that provide lasting benefits for traders. It combines features from both DeFi and TradFi tools for an effective trading experience. Its money-making strategies, such as Trade2Earn, a staking model, and trader funding support, make FX Guys a top choice among the best cryptos to buy now that could make you a millionaire in 2025. With the staking model, an investor could multiply $1,000 endlessly. How it works is that they can buy a large quantity of the FXG token with $1,000 and lock them up on the platform. This will continue to yield more FX Guys tokens, thereby multiplying the money. Putting $1,000 into top DeFi coin lets users join the Trade2Earn program. This system pays them for each trade they make on the platform, no matter if the trade is successful or not. It creates a lively community since all traders are trying to earn more money. FX Guys: Empowering skilled investors with capital and simplified trading What about the ecosystem that aims to make trading easier for users? There is no KYC and no tax with FXG, making it one of the top altcoins with most potential for big returns by 2025. It also allows fast transactions in more than 100 local currencies and offers same-day payouts for deposits and withdrawals. With the FX Guys’ funding support model, traders can easily make profits. This model offers up to $500,000 to those who have trading skills but lack funds. This feature positions the FX Guys as one of the best cryptos to buy now for significant earnings. The ideal time to invest in the FXG could be now because it is in presale. The token is currently in stage two at the current price of $0.04 and will go through other stages before listing at $0.1.

In the meantime, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is working to file its main brief before Chairman Gary Gensler leaves, but a potential government shutdown may cause delays. Here’s Why! Ripple Lawsuit: Key Dates Set The U.S. Court has ordered Plaintiff Bradley Sostack to submit a Mediation Questionnaire by December 23 similar to the US SEC appeals filing. Following that, the court expects the Appeals Transcript Order by December 31, and the full transcript by January 30. Meanwhile, Sostack will file his opening brief on March 6, 2025, outlining his claims against Ripple and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. Although Ripple Labs, XRP II, and Garlinghouse’s response is due by April 7, 2025. If either party fails to meet these deadlines, the appeal could be dismissed. Previous Court Rulings The recent announcement follows earlier court rulings that have been favorable to Ripple. Despite this, Bradley Sostack is still pushing forward with his claims. Judge Phyllis Hamilton recently approved a motion to amend the decision about judgment and the stay in the case Both sides proposed a new order, agreeing there was no need to postpone the judgment since the class claims were already settled. SEC Prepares for Shutdown In the meantime, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is also involved in the Ripple lawsuit , faces challenges of its own. The U.S. government is approaching a potential shutdown due to budgetary issues. The situation could delay the SEC’s response to the appeal, with some analysts predicting that the ongoing legal battle could be paused. This delay might relieve some immediate pressure on Ripple, but it could also push back any resolution that might bring clarity to the regulatory status of XRP.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-21 07:46:37

XRP Has Been The Top Traded Altcoin On Binance This Month In a new CryptoQuant Quicktake post, community analyst Maartunn has talked about how the altcoins currently compare against each other based on their monthly Binance futures trading volumes. The “trading volume” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset that’s becoming involved in trading on a centralized exchange. In the context of the current topic, the platform is Binance. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the monthly value of this metric for various top altcoins in the sector. From the graph, it’s apparent that during most months of this year, Solana (SOL) dominated the trading volume on the exchange. A shift has occurred in the market during the past couple of months, however, as SOL has lost its number one spot. Last month, it was Dogecoin (DOGE) that managed to surpass the asset to become the number one altcoin in this metric, while this month, XRP has overtaken both of them. So far, XRP has seen trading volume amounting to $116.6 billion on the exchange. This value is also certain to go even higher, as this month of December still has one-third of the way to go. While Binance doesn’t make up for the entire sector, the exchange is still the largest in terms of volume, so the trend on there can be representative of the wider market. “It’s important to track the top-traded coins on Binance, as they should be your main focus when trading altcoins,” notes Maartunn. During the last couple of days, the entire cryptocurrency sector has witnessed a crash. Based on the monthly Binance volume, though, the analyst says, “XRP seems to be one that could recover quickly.” In some other news, the market plummet in the last 24 hours has meant that the derivatives side of the cryptocurrency sector has registered a massive amount of liquidations, according to data from CoinGlass. Out of the $1.40 billion liquidations that have occurred inside this window, XRP-related contracts seem to have contributed for around $42 million, as the below heatmap shows. Interestingly, Dogecoin and Solana appear to have seen a larger flush than XRP. This may be down to the fact that both of these assets have also witnessed a deeper price drawdown. XRP Price During the latest crash, XRP briefly slipped under the $2.0 level, but it seems the coin has managed to recover back above the mark for now as its price is trading around $2.1.

In a new thread, Tapiero tells his 123,500 followers on the social media platform X that once the US government tightens up fiscal policy, the top crypto asset by market cap will skyrocket. According to Tapiero, the Federal Reserve is too focused on inflation, and interest rates in the US are still too high. “Danger in China. Do people understand? The second-largest economy in [the] world DEFLATING now. Fed concerns on inflation wrong. Interest rates [are] still too high in [the] US and now fiscal policy will tighten, USD strengthen. Liquidity coming to drive… Bitcoin. $200,000 next year [is] doable.” Tapiero – the founder of crypto venture capital firm 10T Holdings – says that the total market cap of digital assets will make a move toward $10 trillion sometime this cycle. “Back in mid-2019, I thought [the total market cap of crypto] could hit $10 trillion. Hence the fund name. Many Bitcoiners claimed I was too conservative. They have been right. Total market cap of cryptocurrency will challenge $10 trillion this cycle. Unique asset in the history of value and finance.” In a recent post, best-selling finance author Robert Kiyosaki predicts that the crypto king could hit even further heights in 2025 and that its design enables latecomers to make money as well. “The beauty of Bitcoin’s design is [that] it is never too late to start, regardless of how high Bitcoin’s price goes. Bitcoin is designed to make everyone rich, even those who start late. Just don’t get greedy… Bitcoin to $350,000 by 2025.” Bitcoin is trading for $97,082 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day.

Bitcoin, for example, went from $100,000 last Saturday to over $108,000 by Tuesday to reach a new record but then dumped by $16,000 to a multi-week low of $92,000 after the Fed’s hawkish comments for 2025. It has recovered about seven grand since then and is now close to $100,000 once again. Aside from causing billions of dollars worth of liquidations from over-leveraged traders, these enhanced fluctuations played with a lot of people’s emotions, with many speculating whether the bull cycle has ended. The Fear and Greed Index, a metric showing the overall sentiment in the crypto market toward BTC and the altcoins, went from deep ‘extreme greed’ of 87 down to just ‘greed’ – 73 in a couple of days. Such large differences only go to show the emotional part of the ever-volatile crypto market. Zooming out a bit, though, and it’s about perspective. Fear and Greed 7-Day. Source: Alternative.me The Emotional Part It’s obvious that we cannot exclude emotions from anything; otherwise, we wouldn’t be humans. The financial markets are no different, especially crypto, due to its substantial price fluctuations. One cannot just shut down their emotions when they see their portfolio going up and especially down by double-digits within a day or two. Julian Hosp, Bake’s CEO, outlined the importance of emotions but also perspective in a recent X post during the correction. He believes the most vital part of people’s perspective is the direction and not the actual numbers. “Here’s the crazy thing about crypto: It doesn’t matter if Bitcoin is at 30k, 60k, or 100k – it’s all about the direction. Price goes up? Everyone’s euphoric: 90k to 100k? Amazing. 108k to 100k? Disaster. Same price, totally different vibes.” Let’s analyze what happens during those massive green or red candle periods. When BTC’s price surges toward a new all-time high, euphoria kicks in. Remember what happened back in 2021? Bitcoin jumped toward $70,000, and people put laser eyes on X (then Twitter) as they were focused on its price going to $100,000. And what happened next – BTC dumped and went into a year-long bear market. Fear dominated during that dark period, especially when previous industry giants like FTX and Celsius went bust. The landscape changed once again in 2023 when BlackRock filed for a spot in Bitcoin ETF, which essentially guaranteed that the US SEC would finally greenlight such products. The same happened when Donald Trump, who made numerous pro-crypto promises during his campaign, won the elections, and BTC started pumping. The asset indeed went into six-digit territory, and the aforementioned euphoria started to kick in. People celebrated when it hit $100,000, but it then tapped $108,000 and went back to $100,000 – this time, the overall sentiment was not all that bullish, even though it seemed impossible just two years ago to be at this level. Mirror of Emotions Hosp concluded that the crypto market is a “mirror of emotions: greed, feat, hope – it’s all about the feeling of where the market is heading.” He noted that the ultimate utility is the price itself, and rationality goes away when that price and trends “dominate over facts.” He added that large green candles “generate more hype than any actual numbers ever could.” We know it’s impossible to leave emotions at the door when dealing with finances, especially crypto. However, one should zoom out during such violent corrections as the one from this week and look at the bigger picture – is your portfolio better now than it was a few months/years ago? If yes, then keep calm and keep doing what you have been doing. If not, then you need to analyze what went wrong and how you can improve.

37914929,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112666,1734768551,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BTC Dominance Shows Signs of Recovery After 6% Dip: CryptoQuant CEO’s Insights,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/btc-dominance-recovery/,"Bitcoin (BTC) , the flagship cryptocurrency, remains a focal point in market discussions as it recovers from a recent 6% dip in dominance. According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, this fluctuation doesn’t indicate a traditional altcoin season. Instead, the current market dynamics suggest that liquidity flows into select altcoins rather than the broader altcoin market. BTC Dominance Recovery in Focus In the cryptocurrency space, Bitcoin dominance refers to BTC’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market capitalization. Historically, significant changes in BTC dominance have often heralded shifts in the market, including altcoin booms or Bitcoin’s resurgence. Ki Young Ju shared on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin dominance is rebounding after a noticeable dip. He emphasized that the current conditions do not mirror the classic “alt season” narratives that have characterized past cycles. Instead, a handful of altcoins have outperformed, attracting liquidity, while the majority remain unaffected. What Is Driving BTC Dominance Recovery? The recovery of Bitcoin dominance can be attributed to several market factors: Institutional Interest: Recent developments show increased institutional adoption of Bitcoin, such as spot ETF applications and major partnerships. This continued interest fuels Bitcoin’s position as the leading cryptocurrency. Macro Conditions: As traditional markets grapple with economic uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to emerge as a hedge against inflation, reinforcing its dominance. Altcoin Saturation: Many altcoins have struggled to maintain investor interest due to oversaturation in the market, with only a select few showing promise. Why Is It Not a Traditional Altcoin Season? A “traditional altcoin season” typically occurs when Bitcoin’s dominance declines significantly, and the majority of altcoins experience widespread growth. However, this cycle appears different. According to Ki Young Ju, liquidity is flowing selectively to specific altcoins rather than spreading across the board. Some potential reasons include: Regulatory Pressure: Many altcoins face scrutiny from regulators, creating uncertainty for investors. Shift in Market Sentiment: Investors are favoring utility-driven projects over speculative tokens. Market Consolidation: The crypto market is maturing, leading to consolidation around proven assets like Bitcoin and select altcoins with strong fundamentals. Key Altcoins Benefiting From the Current Dynamics While the overall altcoin market is subdued, some tokens have managed to attract significant liquidity. Ju referred to this selective growth as “{your_outperformed_alt} season,” implying that the winners in this cycle are few but impactful. Among the notable performers are: Ethereum (ETH): With its robust DeFi ecosystem, Ethereum continues to draw attention from institutional and retail investors. Solana (SOL): Known for its high-speed transactions and developer-friendly environment, Solana has seen a resurgence in interest. Polygon (MATIC): As a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, Polygon remains a top choice for projects seeking scalability. Market Outlook: Bitcoin’s Next Moves As Bitcoin dominance rebounds, it raises questions about its next trajectory. Analysts suggest the following possibilities: Further Recovery: If Bitcoin continues to attract institutional investment, its dominance could strengthen further. New All-Time Highs: Positive macroeconomic trends and increased adoption might push Bitcoin towards new price milestones. Potential Consolidation: A stable dominance level could signal market consolidation, benefiting both Bitcoin and select altcoins. Implications for Investors For crypto investors, the current market dynamics offer valuable insights: Focus on Fundamentals: Given the selective nature of liquidity flows, investors should prioritize projects with strong use cases and proven track records. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin remains a safe bet, diversification into promising altcoins can provide opportunities for growth. Stay Informed: Regular updates from reliable sources like CryptoQuant can help investors navigate the evolving landscape. Conclusion Bitcoin dominance is making a recovery after a recent dip, signaling resilience in the face of market volatility. However, this recovery does not signify a traditional altcoin season, as highlighted by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju. Instead, a few select altcoins are leading the charge, reflecting a more targeted flow of liquidity. For investors, understanding these shifts is crucial for making informed decisions. As the crypto market continues to mature, Bitcoin’s role as the cornerstone of the ecosystem remains unshaken, while opportunities in altcoins require careful consideration.

Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg Television, Wood attributed her forecast to Bitcoin’s unique supply-and-demand dynamics, its capped supply, and the growing institutional interest driven by favorable regulatory developments. Bitcoin’s Supply Cap: A Key Driver of Price Growth At the heart of Cathie Wood’s prediction is Bitcoin’s immutable supply limit of 21 million coins. Unlike traditional commodities like gold, where higher prices incentivize increased production, Bitcoin’s supply is governed by a decentralized protocol that ensures no more coins can be minted beyond the cap. Wood explained, “Bitcoin’s capped supply makes it fundamentally different from other assets. Its scarcity increases as demand grows, driving value.” This Year’s Rally as a Case Study In 2024, Bitcoin surged past $108,000, highlighting the impact of scarcity on its price. The rally has reaffirmed investor confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value and hedge against inflation. Bitcoin vs. Gold: The Scarcity Factor Bitcoin has often been likened to digital gold, but Wood emphasized a key difference: Gold’s Supply Growth: Higher gold prices typically lead to increased mining activity, which boosts supply and moderates price increases. Bitcoin’s Fixed Supply: Bitcoin’s supply is finite, creating a “hard ceiling” that ensures scarcity as demand grows. This distinction has made Bitcoin an attractive alternative to gold, particularly among younger, tech-savvy investors. Regulatory Easing Under Trump Administration Wood also cited anticipated regulatory changes as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s growth. With Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency, the crypto industry expects a more favorable regulatory environment. How Regulation Impacts Bitcoin Institutional Adoption: Clearer regulations could pave the way for increased institutional investment, including Bitcoin spot ETFs. Retail Growth: A friendlier regulatory framework may encourage more retail participation in the crypto market. Global Adoption: U.S. policy often influences global crypto regulation, potentially leading to broader acceptance. Supply and Demand Dynamics in Action Cathie Wood’s prediction hinges on the principle that Bitcoin’s fixed supply, combined with rising demand, will create upward price pressure. Here’s why: Institutional Interest: Institutions are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Geopolitical Factors: Economic instability and inflation fears drive investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge. Adoption Trends: Growing adoption for payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications fuels demand. ARK’s Historical Bitcoin Advocacy ARK Investment Management has long been bullish on Bitcoin. The firm has invested heavily in crypto-related assets and has consistently advocated for the digital currency’s potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. Wood’s $1 million prediction aligns with ARK’s broader investment thesis, which sees Bitcoin as a transformative asset with long-term growth potential. Challenges to Bitcoin’s $1 Million Target While the prediction is optimistic, several challenges could impede Bitcoin’s path to $1 million: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite Trump’s expected easing, the global regulatory landscape remains fragmented. Technological Risks: Cybersecurity threats and network vulnerabilities could undermine investor confidence. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, which may deter risk-averse investors. Implications for the Broader Crypto Market If Bitcoin reaches $1 million, it could have a ripple effect across the crypto ecosystem: Altcoin Growth: Rising Bitcoin prices often boost the broader crypto market. Increased Innovation: A bullish Bitcoin market may encourage more blockchain innovation and investment. Global Adoption: Bitcoin’s success could accelerate adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology worldwide. What Investors Should Consider Cathie Wood’s prediction underscores the importance of understanding Bitcoin’s fundamentals and market dynamics. Here’s what investors should keep in mind: Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s price movements can be volatile, but its scarcity-driven growth is a long-term play. Diversification: While Bitcoin holds promise, diversification remains a prudent strategy. Stay Updated: Regularly monitor market trends, regulatory developments, and expert analyses to make informed decisions.

37914989,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112672,1734768645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Japan’s LDP Pushes for Crypto Tax Reform with Proposed 20% Taxation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japans-ldp-pushes-for-crypto-tax-reform-with-proposed-20-taxation/,"The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan is advocating for a significant overhaul of the country’s cryptocurrency tax policy. According to reports by CoinPost and Japanese media outlets, the proposed reform includes a reduced, separate tax rate of 20% on cryptocurrency trading profits and the introduction of a loss carryforward system. This initiative could mark a pivotal shift in how Japan treats cryptocurrency income, potentially making the nation a more attractive hub for digital asset investors and businesses. The Current Tax System for Cryptocurrency in Japan Under Japan’s existing tax framework, cryptocurrency profits are classified as miscellaneous income , subjecting them to progressive tax rates of up to 55%. This classification places a heavy financial burden on individual investors, particularly those in higher income brackets. Key Features of the Current System High Tax Rates: Progressive rates can discourage active trading and investment. No Loss Carryforward: Investors cannot offset crypto losses against future profits, exacerbating financial risks. Limited Clarity: The lack of detailed regulations creates confusion among taxpayers and accountants alike. What the LDP’s Proposed Tax Reform Entails The LDP’s proposal aims to modernize the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies to align with global standards and foster innovation in Japan’s digital economy. Key Features of the Proposed Reform 20% Separate Tax Rate: Profits from cryptocurrency trading would be taxed at a flat 20%, a significant reduction from the current maximum of 55%. Loss Carryforward System: Investors could offset losses incurred in one tax year against future profits, reducing their overall tax burden. Streamlined Classification: A dedicated tax category for cryptocurrency trading would eliminate ambiguity and ensure uniform application of the law. These changes would align cryptocurrency taxation with other investment categories, such as stocks and forex trading, creating a fairer system for investors. Why the Push for Crypto Tax Reform? The LDP’s push for reform is driven by several factors: Boosting Competitiveness: Japan aims to strengthen its position as a leading crypto-friendly nation amid rising global competition. Encouraging Innovation: Lower taxes and clearer rules could attract blockchain startups and crypto-related businesses to set up operations in Japan. Investor Confidence: Simplified and fairer taxation would encourage more retail and institutional participation in the crypto market. The Global Context: How Japan Compares Japan’s current taxation policy is considered one of the most stringent among developed nations. Comparatively: United States: Crypto gains are taxed as capital gains, with rates varying based on income and holding period. Germany: Long-term crypto holdings are tax-free after one year, providing significant incentives for investors. Singapore: No capital gains tax on cryptocurrency transactions, making it a global crypto hub. The proposed reforms could help Japan remain competitive in the global crypto landscape. Potential Impact of the Reform For Individual Investors Reduced Financial Burden: A flat 20% tax would lower the tax liability for most investors, particularly high-income traders. Increased Market Activity: Lower taxes and loss carryforward provisions could encourage more frequent trading and investment. For Businesses and Startups Favorable Ecosystem: A friendlier tax regime would attract blockchain projects and crypto firms, fostering innovation. Talent Retention: Entrepreneurs and developers may find Japan more appealing, reducing the talent drain to countries with better crypto policies. Challenges and Considerations While the proposed reforms are a step in the right direction, they are not without challenges: Implementation Complexity: Transitioning to a new tax system requires clear guidelines and substantial administrative effort. Potential Revenue Loss: The government may face initial revenue shortfalls from reduced tax rates. Regulatory Oversight: Striking a balance between encouraging innovation and preventing misuse of cryptocurrencies remains critical. Japan’s Crypto Legacy and Future Outlook Japan has been a pioneer in cryptocurrency regulation, being one of the first countries to legalize Bitcoin as a payment method in 2017. The proposed tax reforms are part of its broader effort to maintain leadership in the blockchain and crypto space. By addressing investor concerns and creating a more equitable tax structure, Japan could pave the way for sustainable growth in its digital economy. Conclusion Japan’s LDP is making strides toward a more progressive cryptocurrency tax system with its proposal for a 20% separate tax rate and a loss carryforward system. These changes have the potential to transform the nation’s crypto landscape, making it more attractive for investors and businesses alike. While challenges remain, the proposed reforms signal Japan’s commitment to fostering innovation and maintaining its status as a global leader in the crypto space. If implemented effectively, these changes could position Japan as a top destination for digital asset activity in the years to come.

With an impressive HYPE price rally over the week, the token has entered its prime, and here is why. HYPE Price Hit ATH After 63% Rally Beating the crypto market crash’s odds, the HYPE token is constant on the bullish move. Over the week, the Hyperliquid price has increased 63%, pushing the token to an ATH of $34.71. More importantly, its market capitalization has hit the $10B mark, placing it right after the Polkadot in the top 20 cryptos. The layer one blockchain, Hyperliquid, launched its native token, HYPE, just three weeks ago and has followed a bullish trajectory. As a result, the HYPE price has risen 977% since then, impressing the community. At present, the HYPE is under a minor consolidation, currently trading at $34.47 with a 50% increased trading volume of $655.01M Notable, the token is still missing listings on the top crypto exchanges like Binance and others, but the current surge has increased the possibility of that. Hyperliquid’s Buyback Mechanism Fueling The Price Hyperliquid has implemented many unique feature that investors highly appreciate. The L-1 blockchain network has introduced a fee-to-buyback mechanism, which utilizes the 100% fees of the trades to purchase tokens. This buyback eventually creates buying pressure on the token, pumping the price. Interestingly, the firm utilizes every $10K revenue to buy back HYPE tokens, per a crypto analyst, who further revealed that the blockchain had recently spent $3M to buy more Hyperliqud token, resulting in the current HYPE price rally. Additional reports reveal that the firm has completed $16B in notional perpetual volume, which is almost 30% of the volume of Binance. With this, many users have called Hyperliquid ‘the decentralized Binance,’ where its lower perpetual fees and many other factors constantly increase demand. Interestingly, a few traders have begun urging other blockchain networks to follow similar features, especially Ethereum, as the ETH price is struggling on the charts. HYPE Airdrop Success Favored the HYPE Price Rally HYPE airdrop has become one of the biggest crypto airdrops in 2024 after distributing 270M HYPE among 94,000 users per ASXN data. The airdrop went live in late November and significantly pumped the token price during the launch. With that, the HYPE token surged 125% within a day. Analysts have called this a perfect marketing tactic, as they kept airdropped to limited people (94,000 only) compared to its competitor. On average, eligible users received 2881 HYPE, but a few more enormous whales have received as high as 508,985 tokens, worth $16M per current price. What’s In There For You? After a massive crash earlier, top altcoins began showing momentum today. However, the Hyperliquid token is way ahead of others, with a 63% surge over the week and HYPE price ATH at $34.71 after the firm spent $3M on buying back the HYPE token. The layer1 blockchain network has implemented quite a few interesting features, like the fee-to-buyback mechanism, which is constantly building the buying pressure of the token, eventually pushing the price. Moreover, the demand will likely grow with its low trading fees on perpetual contracts and constant development, further fueling its price rally.

(Nasdaq: MSTR), the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, is experiencing a sharp decline in pre-market trading. According to TradingView data, the company’s stock fell by 5.64%, trading at $308.04 as of December 20, 2024. This latest drop extends a worrying trend for the tech and Bitcoin-focused firm, marking a staggering 40% decline since its November 21 peak. MicroStrategy’s Relationship with Bitcoin MicroStrategy is widely known for its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which has made it a proxy for Bitcoin’s market performance. The company holds over 150,000 BTC, positioning it as a corporate leader in cryptocurrency adoption. However, the company’s reliance on Bitcoin has made its stock price highly sensitive to the cryptocurrency’s price fluctuations. Why Is MicroStrategy Stock Dropping? Several factors contribute to MicroStrategy’s current stock decline: Bitcoin Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price movements directly affect MicroStrategy’s stock. Recent BTC market corrections have likely influenced the sell-off. Market Sentiment: Investor confidence in tech and crypto-focused firms has wavered amid global economic uncertainty and regulatory scrutiny. Profit-Taking After November’s Rally: MicroStrategy’s peak stock price in November attracted profit-taking by investors, contributing to the subsequent decline. Stock Performance Metrics As of the pre-market session on December 20, 2024: Current Price: $308.04 Percentage Drop: 5.64% from the previous day. Peak-to-Current Decline: Nearly 40% since November 21. The steep decline raises questions about MicroStrategy’s strategy and its exposure to Bitcoin’s volatile market. Long-Term Implications for MicroStrategy While short-term volatility is causing concern among investors, the long-term outlook for MicroStrategy depends on several factors: Bitcoin’s Performance: A rebound in Bitcoin’s price could reverse the downward trend in MicroStrategy’s stock. Corporate Strategy: The company’s continued focus on Bitcoin acquisition could either be a boon or a risk, depending on market trends. Investor Sentiment: Rebuilding investor confidence will be key, especially as MicroStrategy remains a high-risk, high-reward investment. Market Analysts Weigh In Experts have varying opinions on MicroStrategy’s stock trajectory: Bullish Perspective: Analysts bullish on Bitcoin believe that MicroStrategy’s stock could recover alongside a broader crypto market rally. Bearish Perspective: Others caution that the company’s heavy reliance on Bitcoin introduces significant risk, particularly in uncertain market conditions. Impact on Cryptocurrency Markets MicroStrategy’s performance also affects perceptions of Bitcoin as a corporate asset: Positive Feedback Loop: When MicroStrategy’s stock rises, it often boosts confidence in Bitcoin adoption by institutions. Negative Sentiment: Conversely, stock declines can lead to skepticism about Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset. What Investors Should Know For investors, MicroStrategy remains a high-risk, high-reward option due to its unique position as a major Bitcoin holder. Here are some key takeaways: Diversification Is Key: MicroStrategy’s stock may not suit risk-averse investors due to its high volatility. Monitor Bitcoin Trends: The company’s fortunes are closely tied to Bitcoin’s price movements, making it crucial to stay informed about the crypto market. Long-Term Outlook: Despite recent declines, MicroStrategy’s bullish stance on Bitcoin positions it as a long-term bet on the cryptocurrency’s success. Conclusion MicroStrategy’s 6% pre-market drop reflects its susceptibility to Bitcoin price movements and broader market sentiment. While the company’s innovative strategy has made it a pioneer in cryptocurrency adoption, its reliance on Bitcoin exposes it to significant volatility. Investors should weigh the risks and rewards of holding MicroStrategy stock carefully. With a nearly 40% decline since November, the company faces challenges but remains a compelling player in the intersection of technology and cryptocurrency.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 10:47:36

However, on-chain data suggests a new record high could be on the horizon amid the recent volatility. Specifically, data indicates that Bitcoin is currently hovering near a critical price range between $97,500 and $99,800, where over 924,000 addresses previously purchased more than 1.19 million BTC. To this end, prominent on-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez identified this zone as a ‘brick wall’ due to the magnitude of Bitcoin accumulated at these levels, he said in an X post on December 21. “Bitcoin faces a brick wall between $97,500 and $99,800. If BTC can manage to break above this level, we could see new all-time highs soon,” Santana noted. Bitcoin in/out of the money around price chart. Source: IntoTheBlock A breakdown of the data shows that wallets holding approximately 583,460 BTC are currently profitable, representing 18.77% of the market. On the other hand, 2.52 million BTC, or 81.09%, is held at higher levels, awaiting price recovery, while a minimal 4,400 BTC is sitting at breakeven. Generally, a break above the $97,500-$99,800 range would signal strong bullish momentum and possibly trigger ‘Fear of Missing Out’ ( FOMO ) from investors on the sidelines. This projection comes after Bitcoin briefly dipped to $92,000 before rebounding as the cryptocurrency market experienced sustained volatility. Notably, these conditions were triggered by the Federal Reserve, which signaled the possibility of fewer interest rate cuts in 2025. Indeed, this scenario saw the market record significant outflows that also impacted spot exchange-traded funds ( ETF ). To this end, on December 19, Bitcoin ETFs recorded a $680 million outflow, the largest in their history. Bitcoin ETFs outflow. Source: Bloomberg What next for Bitcoin? Following the recent price movement, cryptocurrency trading expert Alan Santana stressed in a TradingView post on December 21 that the recent drop is not cause for concern. Santana stated that the drop to $92,000 should be considered a healthy correction. The cryptocurrency has already rebounded to $97,000, reinforcing its bullish momentum. The expert highlighted that $90,000 level, aligning with the 55-day Exponential Moving Average ( EMA ) on the daily chart, is a critical support level that remains untested—a sign of market strength. While $100,000 was temporarily breached, it remains within reach for another attempt. Santana noted that longer-term projections point to key Fibonacci extension levels at $113,968, $138,794, and $163,620 as Bitcoin advances. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Alan Santana Overall, he attributed the shakeout to profit-taking by major investors as part of a broader bullish trend that continues to unfold. Santana suggested that the next primary growth phase could pick up speed by late February, while periods of consolidation and altcoin expansion provide interim opportunities. “Bitcoin won’t move overnight, it takes time to grow. We are looking at two months, late February, for maximum speed and maximum growth. But we can experience some high, some sideways, some consolidation while the Altcoins grow,” he said. Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin was trading at $98,510 by press time, rallying over 3.5% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, BTC is down 3%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold As things stand, Bitcoin’s technical setup is pointing to a continuation of renewed bullish momentum, with the asset well positioned above its 50-day simple moving average ($91,185) and the 200-day SMA ($69,891). Despite this, market sentiment is bearish , though the Fear & Greed Index sits at 73 (Greed), reflecting investor confidence. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 50.65 indicates neutral momentum. Overall, attention is on bulls to sustain the ongoing momentum and help Bitcoin establish its price above $99,000 for a possible stab at a new record high.

Detailed in his “ Digital Assets Framework ” policy published Friday, the proposal outlines a roadmap for the United States to foster growth in the digital asset industry, establish clear compliance standards, and ensure defined rights for crypto asset holders and companies. Saylor Says the U.S. Needs to Lead Digital Economy Saylor’s framework noted the importance of the U.S. leading the global digital economy through innovation in digital assets. “By establishing a clear taxonomy, a legitimate rights-based framework, and practical compliance obligations, the United States can lead the global digital economy,” he wrote. He added that such measures could unlock trillions of dollars in wealth, empower millions of businesses, and secure the U.S. dollar’s status as the cornerstone of the digital financial system. A long-time Bitcoin advocate, Saylor gained prominence in 2020 when MicroStrategy began acquiring significant amounts of the cryptocurrency. The company, which primarily provides business intelligence software, now holds an estimated $42.6 billion in Bitcoin, making it the largest corporate holder of the asset. While Saylor is widely regarded as a Bitcoin maximalist, his framework extends beyond Bitcoin, proposing universal standards for all digital assets. He suggested creating a comprehensive taxonomy to classify digital assets, including “digital commodities” like Bitcoin, “digital securities” such as tokenized equity or debt, “digital currencies” backed by fiat, and “digital tokens” offering utility. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and tokens linked to physical assets like gold and oil are also distinctly categorized. MICHAEL SAYLOR: Dump all US gold for 5M #Bitcoin —the trade is free. Demontize enemy gold reserves to zero while we take control of the World's Reserve Capital Network pic.twitter.com/XpWhVtKeuF — Swan (@Swan) December 7, 2024 Saylor’s proposal calls for a robust framework of rights and responsibilities for issuers, exchanges, and other participants in the digital asset ecosystem. This framework would ensure transparency, compliance with local laws, and accountability. “No one has the right to lie, cheat, or steal. All participants are civilly and criminally responsible for their actions,” he emphasized. To encourage innovation, Saylor advocates limiting compliance costs for token issuance to 1% of a firm’s assets under management and reducing annual maintenance costs to no more than 10 basis points. He argued this approach could significantly lower the cost of issuing tokens, from $10–100 million to $10–100 thousand, and reduce the timeline for launching new digital assets to minutes instead of years. Saylor Proposes Growing Stablecoin Market Central to Saylor’s vision is positioning the U.S. dollar as the “global reserve digital currency.” He proposes growing the stablecoin market from its current $25 billion to $10 trillion, which would create substantial demand for U.S. Treasuries and secure the dollar’s dominance. Saylor also supports the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, a policy backed by lawmakers like Senator Cynthia Lummis and President-elect Trump. While Saylor did not specify the size of the reserve, he suggested it could create wealth ranging from $16 to $81 trillion, potentially erasing the U.S. national debt of $36 trillion. Trump has reiterated his commitment to retaining the government’s 198,000 BTC acquired through criminal seizures and recently voiced support for a Bitcoin reserve.

In a post on X, Schiff warned that the Fed’s policies are leading to long-term damage, particularly regarding inflation. According to Schiff, inflation is expected to rise in the coming year. He suggested that any future rate cuts by the Fed would likely be aimed at averting a financial crisis, boosting asset markets, or providing relief to struggling banks and labor markets, not to reduce inflation. Fed officials were doing damage control today following Powell's comments on Wednesday. Inflation is likely headed higher next year. So, if the Fed does cut rates, it's only to avert a financial crisis, prop up asset markets, bail out banks, or to ""stimulate"" a weak labor market. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 20, 2024 On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve reduced its key interest rate by a quarter-point, marking the third rate cut this year. The move, however, was coupled with a notable shift in the central bank’s outlook for 2025. The Fed now expects to slow the pace of rate cuts next year, primarily due to persistent inflation. US Fed change 2025 economic projections According to recent reports, the US central bank’s projections for the rate have been revised upward to 3.9%, up from 3.4% in September. Additionally, inflation expectations were adjusted from 2.1% to 2.5%, indicating a more difficult battle ahead in the coming years. Fed Chair Jerome Powell defended the decision during a news conference, stating that the slower pace of rate cuts reflects both the higher-than-expected inflation this year and the anticipation of continued inflationary pressure into 2025. Despite the rate reduction, Powell’s comments suggested a future trajectory of slow and cautious cuts to address inflation concerns. Schiff, appearing on Fox Business after the Fed’s announcement, criticized Powell’s rhetoric, particularly his portrayal of the Fed’s hawkish stance on inflation. Schiff argued that Powell’s actions did not align with his words, pointing out that the Fed’s early rate cuts were premature. He contended that rates never reached restrictive levels, and cutting them further now would be a mistake. Schiff also expressed skepticism over Powell’s claim that inflation could return to the Fed’s target of 2% in two years. He believes inflation will remain elevated, dismissing Powell’s projections as overly optimistic. “Inflation won’t be anywhere near 2% in two years. It’s going to be higher than it is right now,” Schiff remarked. Impact of deficits and fiscal policy concerns Schiff warned that the US may be heading for a scenario that could complicate economic conditions for the incoming Trump administration. As the administration prepares to take office in January, Schiff speculated that Trump may inherit a fragile economic environment marked by a sluggish economy and heightened financial risks. Schiff’s concerns also extended to broader fiscal issues. A recent article on SchiffGold, that the economist reposted on X, highlighted the US government’s ballooning deficit. According to the latest figures from the Treasury Department, the US government spent $668 billion in November, adding to October’s $584 billion in spending. This brings the total deficit for the first two months of the 2025 fiscal year to a staggering $624 billion, the highest such total ever recorded for this period. Source: Treasury Department With government revenues amounting to just $628 billion, the US is on track for a record deficit by the end of the fiscal year, potentially exceeding $3.5 trillion. Schiff warns that this unprecedented spending is draining the real economy, and such fiscal policies could lead to long-term economic instability. Schiff’s criticism of Trump’s policy suggestions Schiff also criticized President-elect Trump’s approach to international energy markets, particularly his suggestion that the European Union should increase its purchase of US oil and gas. The economist argues that this would lead to reduced domestic supply and rising energy prices for Americans. #Trump wants the EU to buy more U.S. oil and gas. If they do, the added demand will reduce domestic supply, pushing up energy prices for Americans. Also, if dollars are used to buy oil and gas instead of buying our debt, the result will be higher bond yields and mortgage rates. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 20, 2024 He further contended that if dollars were used to buy US energy exports instead of financing debt, the result would be higher bond yields and mortgage rates, exacerbating economic challenges for households. Yesterday, Schiff took a dig at Trump’s “cutting costs” policies, saying the US President-elect is campaigning for debt reduction, yet he is forcing the hand of House Republicans to “vote to suspend the debt ceiling for the next two years.” He believes this will set up the US Congress to “run up an unlimited amount of debt.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",Economy|Federal Reserve|Treasury Department|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-21 11:00:03

YUSKO SAYS IN AN INTERVIEW: „DONALD TRUMP IS BUYING A BUNCH OF CRYPTO: BITCOIN AND HEDERA AND XRP!“ TRUMP #XRP pic.twitter.com/ymAtOGhUUU — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) December 20, 2024 The Role of ETFs in Driving Interest The reference to ETFs is notable. Over the past year, interest in cryptocurrency ETFs has surged, with several applications for spot XRP ETFs currently under review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulator has approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs , leading to significant increases in institutional interest in these assets, and market growth. XRP has been touted by many including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse as the next candidate for ETF approval. The asset’s legal clarity and popularity have heightened its appeal. While Hedera is also a prominent player in the crypto space, XRP is the real standout performer.

Recent rumors suggested that Trump planning to include Hedera and XRP in a proposed U.S. strategic crypto reserve. However, these claims were refuted by Charles Hoskinson , the founder of Cardano, who tagged them as unfounded. Despite the denials, speculation continues to swirl, fueled by Trump’s reported ties to World Liberty Financial, a financial institution inspired by his business and political persona. Many in the crypto community believe this connection indicates his growing interest in digital assets. Trump has consistently supported cryptocurrencies. He even accepted crypto donations during his campaign. If Yusko’s claims are accurate, Trump’s involvement could have broader implications for the cryptocurrency industry. High-profile endorsements or investments often attract significant attention and legitimacy to the market. Given Trump’s influence and political standing, his participation could encourage other investors, including institutional players, to follow suit.

As of writing, RXS tokens currently sell for $0.15 each during its Stage 10 presale, whereby the project has already managed to raise $27.8 million. Just like in 2020, when Shiba Inu (SHIB) skyrocketed thousands of times in value, analysts are predicting a possible 25,000% ROI. Find out what could be the most undervalued gem in the market—read on. Rexas Finance (RXS): Asset Ownership via Blockchain Rexas Finance (RXS) is quickly becoming one of the most exciting cryptocurrency projects of 2024, delivering RWA tokenization to the blockchain industry.

Presale Progress and Achievements Now So far, the RXS presale has been a hit, with stage 9 selling out ahead of time. So far, the project has achieved strong investor interest, with an impressive $27.8 million being raised to date. In Stage 10, RXS tokens are currently priced at $0.15 per token, with 346 million sold so far of the 1,000,000,000 total supply. The token price did not rise briefly before an official launch; rather, when the white paper was released, token holders sold to maximize profits, allowing early adopters to get in on this project with the potential for significant growth. The Key Features That Make Rexas Finance Attractive The advanced features of Rexas Finance’s platform are meant to simplify and improve asset tokenization.

Recently, the platform passed a thorough audit by one of the foremost blockchain security firms, CertiK. This certification ensures that the investor knows that the platform is reliable and will take critical steps to safe keep the user’s funds and data. As an addition to the community appeal, Rexas Finance also launched a $1 million giveaway to early participants. The winners get 20 lucky winners $50,000 in RXS tokens each.

RXS has definitely provided the right tools to turn things around in terms of tokenization, and after its successful presale and focus on real-world applications, it’s definitely a game changer in many aspects. At earlier stages, investors can make a lot of returns as the platform increases its growth and becomes known in the market. Conclusion Rexas Finance is already transforming the cryptocurrency space as the presale continues. Through the combination of cutting-edge technology, secure storage measures, and a tight community bond, RXS is laying the foundation for a new perception of functional asset management. As a real-world project with high growth potential, Rexas Finance has become a project investors should explore if they’re looking for high growth with real-world application.

He described the investment as a strategic step in supporting technologies and companies that empower individuals and foster societal resilience. Ardoino Expresses Confidence in Rumble Leadership Ardoino expressed confidence in Rumble’s leadership under CEO Chris Pavlovski, praising the platform’s achievements and hinting at future collaboration. Tether and Rumble aim to explore joint initiatives involving advertising, cloud services, and crypto payment solutions. Pavlovski, sharing Ardoino’s enthusiasm, took to X to express his determination to challenge YouTube’s dominance in the video-sharing market. “YouTube, lookout. I’m coming for your monopolistic market share globally,” he declared. YouTube, lookout. I’m coming for your monopolistic market share, globally. — Chris Pavlovski (@chrispavlovski) December 20, 2024 The announcement triggered a sharp rise in Rumble’s stock price (RUM), which surged 51.60% during after-hours trading, reaching $10.90, according to Google Finance. Rumble’s embrace of cryptocurrency extends beyond Tether’s investment. On November 25, the platform confirmed plans to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet, with its board approving up to $20 million of the company’s excess cash reserves for Bitcoin purchases. The decision followed a poll by Pavlovski, where 93.9% of 43,790 respondents supported the proposal. Cantor Fitzgerald Acquires 5% Stake in Tether Financial services giant Cantor Fitzgerald has acquired a 5% stake in Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, in a deal valued at up to $600 million. The acquisition, which occurred within the past year, positions the firm to potentially leverage political influence through its CEO Howard Lutnick, who was recently appointed as U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump’s Secretary of Commerce. Cantor Fitzgerald’s involvement with Tether could bolster the stablecoin issuer’s standing amid increasing regulatory scrutiny. Tether has faced ongoing investigations from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York regarding alleged use of its stablecoin, USDT, in illicit activities such as terrorism financing. Amid these challenges, Lutnick’s political clout may play a pivotal role in navigating regulatory hurdles. Tether’s largest shareholder, Giancarlo Devasini, reportedly expressed confidence in Lutnick’s ability to “defuse threats facing Tether,” according to sources cited in the WSJ. Lutnick, who has been working closely with Trump as a transition advisor, is vetting candidates for key government roles, some of which could directly impact oversight of Tether. He is expected to step down as Cantor Fitzgerald’s CEO upon Senate confirmation of his cabinet position.

This has left many wondering how it could impact crypto’s current four-year boom-bust cycle and lead to a crypto supercycle. Earlier this year, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced the Bitcoin Reserve Act. Texas and Pennsylvania have also introduced proposals to establish a state Bitcoin reserve. Can A Bitcoin Reserve Impact Current Cycles? Besides the US, several countries like Russia, Germany, and Thailand are contemplating similar proposals. If governments attempt to create a stockpile of Bitcoin (BTC), could it impact crypto prices and the four-year boom-bust cycle attributed to Bitcoin's halving event? Some analysts like Iliya Kalchev believe the Bitcoin Reserve Act could be a landmark moment for Bitcoin and signal its recognition as a legitimate financial instrument. Bitcoin has already garnered significant attention from major financial institutions, who have started adding it to their reserves. Kalchev stated, “Every Bitcoin cycle has a narrative trying to push the idea that ‘this one is different.' The conditions have never been so ideal. Crypto has never had a pro-crypto US President who controls the Senate and the Congress.” The Bitcoin Reserve Act would allow the US government to add Bitcoin to its treasury as a reserve asset. The act states that the government must buy 200,000 BTC annually over five years and hold the asset for at least twenty years. Jack Mallers, founder and CEO of Strike, believes Trump could issue an executive order to purchase Bitcoin. However, he added that it would not equate to a 1 million BTC purchase. “It wouldn't be the size and scale of 1 million coins, but it would be a significant position.” Dennis Porter, the co-founder of the non-profit act Satoshi Act Fund, which supports pro-Bitcoin US policy bills, also believes Trump is exploring the option of creating a reserve through an executive order. “I can confirm that Trump is exploring an Executive Order creating a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.’ The Treasury, through the Exchange Stabilization Fund, has the authority to stabilize the dollar by buying currencies. Trump will use this fund to buy Bitcoin.” Is Bitcoin Already In A Supercycle? Alex Kruger, economist and founder of macro digital advisory firm Asgard Markets, believes the election results indicate Bitcoin is already in a supercycle. He compared Bitcoin’s current situation with gold, which jumped from $35 per ounce in 1971 to $850 in 1981 after President Richard Nixon took the US off the gold standard. Kruger did not rule out the possibility of another bear cycle but urged investors to compare this cycle with previous ones. A Domino Effect If passed, the act could kick off a race as other countries scramble to create their own Bitcoin strategic reserves. Analysts believe enacting the Bitcoin Reserve Act would be a turning point for global Bitcoin adoption and become one of the most bullish events in crypto history by catalyzing a race to acquire as much BTC as possible. Crypto investor and Bitcoin educator Chris Dunn said that a FOMO-based buying spree by some of the world’s biggest economies could completely alter the current crypto market cycle. “If the US or another major economic power started accumulating, Bitcoin could trigger an FOMO, which could create a market cycle and supply-demand dynamics unlike anything we’ve seen so far.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

BONK surged 30%, CoinGecko data shows , with dogecoin (DOGE), shiba inu (SHIB), dogwifhat (WIF) and floki (FLOKI) surging as much as 20%. The dog-themed token category gained 8% on average in the past 24 hours, beating a market-wide jump of 4.5% as tracked by the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index. Memecoins are known for their high volatility and tend to outperform major tokens during price rallies, serving as a leveraged bet on the overall crypto market sentiment. However, in this case, fundamentals are helping back gains and sentiment among some memecoins. FLOKI was named alongside ether (ETH) and Avalanche’s AVAX as a utility token in a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) meeting last month . The derivatives regulator proposed in a Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) a new class of assets termed utility tokens, which fulfill six criteria that include providing their holder “immediately available, non-incidental consumptive use” in a crypto platform without including “governance and voting abilities.” ""FLOKI was recently highlighted by the CFTC's Global Markets Advisory Committee as a case study of a utility token, which is a big deal and validates Floki's utility-first approach,” Floki lead developer B told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Floki's Valhalla metaverse game will go live in early Q1 2024, and the recently released Floki Trading Bot has generated over a million dollars in fees. “This puts Floki on an entirely different level from other memecoins, especially when the market turns and people start to pay attention to fundamentals again,” B added. Elsewhere, interest in BONK comes as a host of activities intend to deflate token supply gain traction among users — a move that has historically contributed to higher prices. BonkDAO, a decentralized group of bonk believers that maintain the token, burned 100 billion tokens from the circulating supply in November and targeted a trillion token burn in December. This could increase the token's value due to scarcity. The feat could meet its target in the weeks ahead, observers say .",Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|FLOKI|BONK,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-21 11:06:21

Responding to a journalist’s post on X that described CoinDesk as “in shambles,” Charles questioned the outlet’s current valuation. “Remember when we thought about buying Coindesk?” he asked. “I wonder what the price is these days.” The drama began when Bullish, CoinDesk’s parent company, abruptly fired three top editors, including editor-in-chief Kevin Reynolds, after newsroom tensions boiled over an article on TRON founder Justin Sun. Bullish under fire for its newsroom shake-up Sources reportedly confirmed that Bullish dismissed Reynolds, deputy editor-in-chief Nick Baker, and ethics and standards head Marc Hochstein on Friday. The decision followed weeks of unrest at CoinDesk, starting with the removal of an article about Justin’s purchase and staged consumption of a $6.2 million banana art installation. The piece also covered Justin’s legal troubles though, including fraud charges from the SEC, which he disputes. According to insiders, his team pressured Bullish to take the story down, claiming the tone was damaging. Bullish CEO Tom Farley approved the takedown without the usual retraction notice, an action that blindsided the editorial staff. The company attempted damage control by citing “cost reduction measures” as the reason for the layoffs in an email sent by CoinDesk CEO Sara Stratoberdha. Viewed by staff and later leaked, the email claimed the restructuring would boost productivity while reaffirming the company’s commitment to journalistic independence. But few in the newsroom believed it. A senior staffer reportedly described the firings as “devastating,” saying the trio were the “heart of the newsroom.” The same source questioned Bullish’s priorities, adding, “It’s clear they care more about pleasing sponsors than actual reporting.” Another staff member said morale at CoinDesk is at an all-time low, with many employees actively exploring other opportunities. The Justin debacle and its fallout Critics say Justin’s ties to CoinDesk may have influenced the decision to pull the story. TRON is a major sponsor of Consensus, CoinDesk’s flagship conference, which is debuting in Hong Kong this year. The timing is interesting, given Bullish’s rumored plans for an initial public offering. Matt Murray, a former Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief appointed by Bullish to oversee CoinDesk’s editorial direction, resigned in protest after the article was pulled. By Friday, the tensions culminated in a dramatic showdown. Reynolds, Baker, and Hochstein were locked out of their Slack accounts before the company announced their dismissals. Staff were informed via email after the fact, a decision some described as “cold and calculated.” Charles’ last CoinDesk bid In January, Charles Hoskinson publicly considered purchasing the outlet but balked at its $200 million asking price. At the time, he argued that CoinDesk was overvalued, saying, “You could build a better, decentralized competitor for $5 to $10 million.” Charles has long been critical of crypto journalism, accusing major outlets of bias and inaccuracy. His vision for media reform included ideas like “veracity bonds,” where outlets would stake funds on the accuracy of their reporting, losing the money if stories were proven false. He also suggested integrating blockchain technology into news reporting. Using non-fungible tokens (NFTs), articles could become interactive “living objects.” Once the gold standard for blockchain reporting, CoinDesk made its name exposing fraud and corruption, including its pivotal role in uncovering the FTX scandal in 2022. But under Bullish, the outlet is clearly struggling to maintain its credibility.

The focus on both speed and flexibility positions Kaspa as a promising option for future blockchain development. TRON (TRX): A Decentralized Platform for Digital Content and dApps TRON (TRX) is a blockchain platform founded in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. It began on the Ethereum network but moved to its own blockchain in 2018. TRON aims to give content creators full ownership and better rewards for their work by removing intermediaries. The platform supports smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain systems. It uses a public ledger for transactions and follows a model similar to Bitcoin. TRON enables developers to build dApps and share content while earning digital assets. Its low transaction fees and focus on decentralization make it an alternative to Ethereum. The coin aligns with the growing interest in blockchain-driven solutions for digital content and decentralized technologies. APT: A Scalable Blockchain with Web3 Focus Aptos is a layer-one blockchain created to solve issues like high fees and congestion in older networks. Built by former contributors to Meta’s Diem project, it uses a Proof-of-Stake system and the Move language for smart contracts. Aptos prioritizes safety, scalability, and flexibility, making it suitable for diverse Web3 applications. Its technology shows potential for fast and efficient transactions. In the current market cycle, its focus on scalability and usability could make it appealing to users and developers seeking alternatives to older blockchains. Aave: Decentralized Lending and Borrowing on Ethereum Aave is a cryptocurrency used in a decentralized finance platform on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on digital assets without banks or intermediaries. Transactions are managed by smart contracts, making the system trustless. Aave supports 17 cryptocurrencies for loans. Unique features include flash loans, which are instant loans without collateral that must be repaid in seconds. AAVE tokens give holders benefits like voting rights, fee discounts, and use as collateral. The platform also has a Safety Module, where users can stake tokens to improve security. Aave’s design, limited token supply, and innovative features make it an appealing option depending on market conditions. Conclusion KAS, TRX, APT, and AAVE show steady potential but may provide slower short-term gains. DOGEN stands out as the ultimate choice for those pursuing peak success and luxury. With an expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and massive returns during the current altcoin season, DOGEN positions itself as the leader for high achievers.

This outlook suggests that the recent crash was normal and that the uptrend will continue. Expert Hints Bitcoin Price to Hit $225K After Two More Crashes While the recent drop caused billions in positions to be liquidated, Saturday has seen Bitcoin price recover 7% from the December 20 swing low of $92,230. BTC currently trades at $98,859, showing strength after a brutal crypto market crash. Popular and certified analyst Adrian Zduńczyk posted to X stating that 80% of Bitcoin’s bull run is now behind us. Regarding the recent crash, Zduńczyk notes that two more 20% to 30% crashes might occur before Bitcoin price hits $225,000, an all-time high for the ongoing bull cycle. BNC Liquid Index 1-Week Chart He paints a bullish picture for the remaining 20% of the bull run, saying, “Real altseason will happen after BTC top.” The expert warns investors to “realize gains” before 2025 ends. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: What BTC Needs To Resume Uptrend Bitcoin price crashed 15% from its ATH of $108,41.6 and now trades at $98K. Using the Volume Profile indicator between November 11 and December 11 shows that 68% of the volume is concentrated between the value area high (VAH) at $100,000 and the value area low (VAL) at $90,915. Interestingly, the recent drop has brought BTC back into the 68% volume profile range. For a bullish Bitcoin price prediction, BTC bulls need to overcome two key barriers. The VAH at $100K is the first hurdle, followed by the daily imbalance, which extends from $102.7K to $105.3K. BTC/USDT 12-hour chart On the other hand, if Bitcoin bears are still in control, then the ongoing recovery could face rejection at $100K or the aforementioned daily imbalance, stretching from 102.7K to $105.3K. In such a case, Bitcoin price could continue its descent and retest the range low or VAL at $90,915.

Market analysts, including Guy Turner from CoinBureau , are closely observing ETH’s trajectory, hinting at the possibility of five-digit valuations by 2025. His predictions are grounded in technical analysis and broader market trends, underscoring Ethereum’s potential to surpass its historical peak price. Ethereum’s Historical Highs and New Expectations In November 2021, Ethereum reached its all-time high of $4,878. According to Turner, breaking past this level could propel the cryptocurrency to new price tiers, with $7,300 being a key target based on Fibonacci extensions. This 1.618 Fibonacci level is widely recognized as a critical indicator for price expansions beyond previous highs. Despite its recent upward momentum, Ethereum continues to lose value against Bitcoin, currently trading at $98,368. Turner emphasized the importance of Ethereum regaining resistance against Bitcoin to unlock its full price potential. Source: Guy Turner/YouTube However, Ethereum’s performance remains heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s trajectory, with both assets maintaining a close correlation. Bitcoin’s Role in Ethereum’s Outlook Turner suggests that if Bitcoin reaches $200,000 by 2025, Ethereum could potentially soar to $14,600. This projection hinges on increased investment interest in Ethereum as Bitcoin’s price ascends. The analyst believes that surpassing Ethereum’s previous all-time high would signal price discovery, unlocking new peaks for the asset. However, Turner also advises caution, pointing out the volatility in the crypto market. While his predictions offer valuable insights, he urges investors to assess risk factors carefully before making decisions. Ethereum, currently trading at $3,686, remains under scrutiny as it navigates critical resistance and support levels. Ethereum Technical Outlook – December 21, 2024 Ethereum’s short-term price action highlights significant resistance at $3,550, where a downward trendline converges with a supply zone. This level, previously a support area, has flipped to resistance, creating a challenging environment for bullish momentum. Ethereum faces key resistance at $3,550, a critical level where a downward trendline meets a supply zone. A breakout could pave the way to $3,717 and $3,897, while failure risks retesting support at $3,252. RSI at 46 signals neutral momentum. #Ethereum #Crypto #ETH pic.twitter.com/f0qCZ2IZBO — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) December 21, 2024 Key resistance levels include $3,550, $3,717, and $3,897. On the downside, Ethereum finds immediate support at $3,252, with further levels at $3,097 and $2,940. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 46, signaling neutral to slightly bearish conditions. Meanwhile, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) sits below the current price, reinforcing tentative recovery trends. A breakout above $3,550 could ignite bullish momentum, paving the way for higher targets. Conversely, failure to surpass this level may result in renewed selling pressure, with Ethereum retesting support zones.

A modest $40,000 investment has skyrocketed by 62,400%, reaching an incredible value of $25 million. However, despite the extraordinary surge, FARTCOIN has faced a 16% dip in the past 24 hours, reminding traders of the crypto market’s volatility. FARTCOIN Became a Star According to Arkham Intelligence, a leading blockchain analytics firm, FARTCOIN is now Truth Terminal’s largest asset. The platform holds over $40 million in AI-related tokens, with most of it coming from FARTCOIN. Truth Terminal didn’t buy the token at market price; instead, it got it for just $40,000, making its profit even more remarkable. This massive growth highlights the power of AI-based trading platforms and the growing popularity of tokens like FARTCOIN. As more people adopt and use the token, its value continues to draw attention. However, FARTCOIN’s rapid rise got another push after being listed on Binance Futures. By offering USD-margined perpetual contracts with 75x leverage, Binance has sparked increased demand for the token, driving market activity around FARTCOIN and other Solana-based assets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : DeBridge (DBR) Hits All-Time High Following Major Bithumb Listing , FARTCOIN’s Robust Performance FARTCOIN has shown incredible growth over time.

Despite its overall success, FARTCOIN’s price recently fell by 16% in the past 24 hours currently trading around $0.89 . Although some analysts believe FARTCOIN’s growth will continue, especially with support from platforms like Truth Terminal. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Particularly, CryptoQuant has pointed out that leverage ratios on centralized exchanges have become a focal point, offering insights into the potential risks and opportunities shaping the crypto market. The platform’s recent data highlights the importance of assessing these ratios to gauge the financial stability of exchanges and the impact on trading dynamics. Related Reading: As Bitcoin Reclaims $100,000, Warning Signs Emerge from Long-Term Investors Leverage Trends And Exchange Stability A detailed analysis revealed that Binance maintains strong reserves relative to its open interest, signaling a strong ability to manage market volatility. In contrast, smaller exchanges like Gate.io and Bybit exhibit higher leverage ratios, raising questions about their capacity to withstand liquidity crunches. According to CryptoQuant, monitoring these metrics has become even more “critical” in light of past events, such as the collapse of FTX in November 2024, which was triggered by insufficient reserves against high open interest. CryptoQuant’s latest findings further highlight the varying leverage strategies employed by major cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance emerged as a leader in maintaining a stable leverage ratio while expanding its Bitcoin open interest from $4.45 billion in December 2023 to $11.64 billion in December 2024. Despite this growth, Binance’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT reserves have consistently exceeded its open interest, ensuring liquidity and stability even during volatile market conditions. The exchange’s leverage ratio, which rose modestly from 12.8 to 13.5 over the past year, remains the lowest among its peers. Conversely, exchanges like Gate.io, Bybit, and Deribit exhibit significantly higher leverage ratios of 106, 86, and 32, respectively. CryptoQuant wrote: These figures show their Bitcoin open interest exceeds or approaches their reserves, with similar patterns observed for Ethereum. Coinbase Premium: A Key Indicator For Bitcoin Traders Beyond leverage ratios, another crucial metric shaping Bitcoin market sentiment is the Coinbase Premium. This indicator, which tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other exchanges, is a barometer for institutional demand and market trends. A CryptoQuant analyst named BQYoutube suggested that traders adopt a cautious approach based on Coinbase Premium signals: When the premium is negative, it may be wise to stay on the sidelines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Loses Momentum: Could A Drop To $75,000 Signal The Final Correction? However, a positive premium often signals the return of strong demand, offering a strategic entry point for traders looking to ride major market trends. According to the latest data, this metric currently sits on the negative side, suggesting to stay on the sidelines. BQYoutube added: You might miss few small trends with this approach but at least you can ride all the big trends and avoid losses in dips or downtrends.

The biggest crypto has been unable to reclaim the $100K mark even after many recent attempts, which has begun to spread doubt and FOMO among investors. However, analysts suggest that the $99,800 appears to be a make-or-break level for BTC. The global digital assets market cap jumped by over 5% over the last day to stand at $3.43 trillion. The 24-hour trading volume saw a marginal decline but still hit the $280 billion mark. The Fear and Greed index also reflects “Greed” in the market. Bitcoin on the brink of a breakout? Bitcoin is testing a key resistance between the $97,500 and $99,800 price zones. This is the area where around 924K wallets bought over 1.19 million BTC (approximately worth $117 billion). Analysts suggest that a new all-time high could be on the horizon if BTC manages to break above this level. BTC price tried to make a comeback on Saturday morning by jumping more than 3% over the last day. BTC is trading at an average price of $98,319 as of press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is down by 12% to stand at $89 billion. Coinglass data shows that over $134 million worth of long and short bets set on BTC price were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Around $78.32 million worth of liquidated positions (58%) turned out to be long bets. This suggests that investors were hoping Bitcoin price would recover and keep moving toward the $100K mark, but Bitcoin price fluctuated enough to go against the bulls. BTC ETFs bleeding After setting a record high above $108,000 earlier this week, Bitcoin slid over 10% to hit a low of $92,200 area. Meanwhile, smaller tokens like Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) also felt the impact. Adding to the bearish sentiment, US Bitcoin ETFs posted a record outflow of $680 million on Thursday, which eventually ended a 15-day streak of continuous inflows. The fresh data shows that Bitcoin spot ETFs are still bleeding, and the net outflow reached $277 million on Friday, December 20. Grayscale’s GBTC recorded a net outflow of $57.36 million bringing its total historical net outflow to $21.29 billion. Its Mini Trust ETF reported an inflow of $6.41 million. Franklin’s ETF EZBC registered a daily net inflow of $5.61 million to lead its total historical net inflow to reach $467.25 million. Bitcoin spot ETFs flow data.

The Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance is adding more pressure to the situation. With fewer rate cuts expected for 2025, investors are reassessing risk assets.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 11:34:00

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains.

Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? The TIA price has faced resistance around $8.5, resulting in minor selling pressure. However, buyers are strongly defending further decline. Will TIA price reach $100?

Celestia price prediction December 2024 Celestia’s price triggered intense bullish pressure following Bitcoin’s surge toward the $100K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $7.6 and a maximum of $10.5, with an average of $8.7. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction December 2024 $7.6 $8.7 $10.5 Celestia price prediction 2024 Despite its recent launch, Celestia already boasts a strong ecosystem with wallets, developer tools, and DeFi protocols. New developments and partnerships could boost prices. However, the absence of a clear development roadmap poses a challenge to investor hype and community engagement. The price of 1 Celestia is expected to reach a minimum level of $12.21 in 2024. Celestia (TIA) could reach a maximum level of $13.67, with an average price of $12.59 throughout the year.

This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $17.84, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025. Celestia price prediction for 2026 Notably, a portion of early investors’ vested tokens will become available before and during this period.

Consequently, there could be significant downward pressure on the price of TIA (Celestia’s token) as it reaches its peak moment.

Speculation suggests that the meeting may result in the case being closed or dropped entirely, with answers expected soon. A user reacted to this, praising the XRP community for its unwavering perseverance. Despite being wrong many times, the community continues to stay positive and hopeful, showing up every month for updates. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel weighed in, saying he has attended hundreds of these meetings, and Ripple has been a topic of discussion in almost every single one. He wrote on X, “I started attending in the late 1990s, and they were already talking about settling with Ripple. It’s always been a highlight of the weekly meeting.” Fagel believes the SEC will continue on its current path for now, filing the opening brief as planned. He also pointed out that the new SEC chair could take some time to be confirmed, and it’s possible that they may vote to dismiss the appeal. Though it’s an unusual step, Fagel thinks it’s a possibility if the right people are in charge. I think they continue on the current path (i.e. file the opening brief as scheduled) for now. It'll take time for the new Chair to be confirmed. Does the new SEC then vote to dismiss the appeal? Maybe. It's highly unprecedented, but I can see Atkins/Peirce/Uyeda taking that step. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) December 20, 2024 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Signals SEC’s Shift Toward Pro-Crypto Innovation , SEC’s Shutdown, RLUSD Live and More In other news, the SEC is preparing for a government shutdown , which could impact its operations.

Sophgo allegedly provided a key AI chip for Huawei’s Ascend 910B processor—one of the most advanced AI chips ever developed by a Chinese company. The chip was manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and sourced under questionable circumstances. Sophgo now faces the US Commerce Department’s Entity List, a trade blacklist used to punish companies acting against American national security or foreign policy interests. Once on the list, companies lose access to critical US technologies and products unless granted a license, which almost never happens. Sophgo, a lesser-known affiliate of crypto mining giant Bitmain, is the latest Chinese firm accused of helping Huawei bypass restrictions imposed by the US since 2019. Sophgo’s connection to Huawei exposed through tech investigation The scandal began when tech researchers at TechInsights took apart Huawei’s Ascend 910B chip. What they found was a design matching a chip Sophgo had ordered from TSMC . This discovery triggered a domino effect. TSMC, the world’s largest chipmaker, immediately stopped shipping to Sophgo. According to the chip giant, it has not supplied Huawei directly since 2020, after US export controls blocked foreign companies from providing advanced chips to Huawei without explicit licenses. In November, Washington ordered a complete halt on shipments of advanced seven-nanometer or smaller chips to Chinese entities. Meanwhile, Huawei denies any active relationship with Sophgo, though evidence suggests otherwise. The Ascend 910B chip, released in 2022, was viewed as a key step forward for Chinese AI technology. Huawei, once crippled by US sanctions, is betting on AI chips to reclaim its global standing. Crypto links, shady dealings, and China’s AI ambitions Sophgo’s troubles are not just about Huawei. The company’s roots are entangled with Bitmain, the Bitcoin mining powerhouse founded by Micree Zhan. Corporate filings show Zhan indirectly owns 23% of Sophgo through an investment vehicle. Adding to the problems, Sophgo has communicated with US regulators using Bitmain email addresses, raising questions about its independence. Bitmain, for its part, denies involvement, claiming it has nothing to do with the supply chain investigation. The company’s AI chips have been purchased by Chinese state-run universities, local governments, and even police departments. These institutions are using AI for everything from building research tools to improving surveillance. But Huawei seems undeterred. The company has announced plans to mass-produce its next-generation AI chip, the Ascend 910C, in early 2025. Market analysts believe the new chip will compete directly with Nvidia, the sitting jewel of the US AI chip market.

In the meantime, the third-generation token Cardano remains sure of a consolidated ascending trend regardless of growing bearish influence. Therefore, the ADA price is believed to revamp a strong rise, intending to mark a new ATH before the end of the year. Cardano is among the tokens believed to surpass 20% growth, leveraging innovation, scalability, and market adaptability to redefine the altcoin landscape. Meanwhile, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson outlines the roadmap of the platform, which is expected to prioritise decentralisation and governance. Therefore, there is a huge chance that the ADA price will maintain a steep ascending trend if the bulls manage to rise above certain levels before the yearly close. The ADA price has rebounded from the interim support levels just below $0.75, which appeared to be the fresh monthly bottoms. Although the bulls have triggered a rebound, the intensity remains lower as the recovery volume has not reached the required levels. Besides, the technicals continue to remain within the bearish range, which suggests the selling pressure continues to haunt the Cardano price rally. The DMI just triggered a bullish crossover but the levels failed to divert from each other, suggesting a drop in volatility. Moreover, they could be heading towards a bearish crossover while the ADX continues to maintain a descending trend. On the other hand, the RSI has triggered a bullish divergence, which is yet to be validated. Therefore, the Cardano (ADA) price is expected to surge by 20% and reclaim the yearly highs above $0.125 only if the weekly close occurs above $0.98. Otherwise, a pullback could cause the price to reach the monthly lows at $0.75 or levels below if bearish strength intensifies.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-21 11:55:42

After several media notifications following his potential destination, Mangione arrived in New York and will be remanded at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Coincidentally, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is also housed in the same jail. Bankman-Fried is currently serving a 25-year sentence for his part in the collapse of his firm. Aside from Bankman-Fried, another high-profile individual in the same detention center is famous music producer Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, who is facing charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking offenses. Combs, who is reportedly sharing a space with Bankman-Fried, is also engaging in the services of the former crypto company’s CEO. UnitedHealth Group CEO’s shooter remanded in solitary confinement Before its collapse , FTX was one of the biggest crypto exchanges globally, providing all kinds of services to its users. Aside from its buying and selling services, users were allowed to bet on the price of diverse tokens and assets listed on the platform. However, things turned sour in 2022, when the exchange went bankrupt leading to billions of dollars going up in smoke. Bankman-Fried was later arrested in connection with the collapse, and after months of protracted legal tussle, he was subsequently sentenced to jail. Meanwhile, Mangione was charged as the key suspect in the murder of the UnitedHealth Group CEO. The executive was murdered on December 4, in New York, with the murder and the manhunt that followed making global headlines. According to details, the police tracked and arrested Mangione at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania some days later. Prosecutors noted that Mangione had been orchestrating the murder months before he carried out the act, citing contempt for the CEO as his motive. According to a prison consultant with knowledge about Mangione’s housing, the suspect, who is still in solitary confinement, could be put in the same place with both SBF and Combs by Monday. Mangione is in solitary confinement, in a small cinderblock Special Housing Unit called ‘the SHU’ or ‘the hole’, according to the official. Mangione is expected to have his meals in the cells, with only an hour of recreation or showering and guards are to check on him at 15-minute intervals. If found guilty, the Judge may rule on a possible death penalty for the suspect. SBF is doing well in jail as FTX releases repayment deadline Sam Bankman-Fried is reportedly doing well in jail, with several reports saying that he is being treated well. A recent interview with Williams Cohan of Puck News showed the former FTX CEO is still in great spirits. With SBF set to serve 25 years in jail, he may only serve half if he keeps up good behavior. He appealed his fraud charges in September, attacking the judge who oversaw his conviction. SBF had been found guilty of allegations against him by a federal jury, as he attempted to steal $8 billion from users of his crypto exchange. In his appeal, his legal counsel pointed at the ruling’s limitation on SBF’s ability to introduce new materials integral to his case, noting that the judge already presumed him guilty. FTX, on its part, has released its repayment timeline, announcing the date and method of repaying its creditors. With the announcement, the firm is nearing the end of its Chapter 11 Bankruptcy proceedings. The exchange’s approved date will take effect on January 3, giving the platform a 60-day window to commence repayments. In its announcement, the repayments will be facilitated through Kraken and BitGo, with users expected to finalize their KYC verifications and onboard on the selected exchanges.

On-chain data shows that large wallets poured millions into both during the recent market meltdown. The market-wide crash that began in the middle of the business week caught many by surprise, given the billions of dollars worth of liquidations that were evident on a couple of occasions. All crypto assets headed south vigorously, with BTC leading the way by plummeting from over $108,000 on Tuesday to $92,000 on Friday. As it typically happens, the altcoins were not sparred, just the opposite. Dogecoin and Ripple were among the worst-performing assets at one point. The largest meme coin stood north of $0.41 before the correction began but dumped by over 35% to its low on Friday of $0.26. XRP’s price plummet was almost identical as the asset came crashing down from $2.72 on Tuesday to $1.96 – a 28% drop. However, both have bounced off since those lows, with DOGE trading close to $0.34 (30% higher) and XRP at $2.3 ( up by 17% ). On-chain data shared by the popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shows that whales tracking both assets didn’t sit on the sideline but actually went on an accumulation spree. In Ripple’s case, they stacked up on 80 million tokens since the retracement began on December 17.

Maksim Balashevich noted that to gauge the health of the market, it is important to analyze the average dollar investment age (MDIA). This metric reflects the average age of coins in a wallet and can indicate whether assets are actively traded or held: A decline in MDIA indicates that younger coins are circulating in the market, indicating active participation and optimism. Conversely, a rising MDIA could indicate accumulation that could lead to a recession in the market if not accompanied by new buying pressure. “Seeing that the average invested dollar age is falling is a positive sign. It confirms the upward price movements and shows that the assets are entering a healthy cycle,” said Maksim Balashevich. Analysts say that recent market conditions show signs of accumulation, with investors remaining confident in the market despite price corrections. Maksim Balashevich warned that this could signal a long-term uptrend, but could also be a precursor to short-term fluctuations. Related News: What Will Happen for Cryptocurrencies in 2025? Here are the Analyst's Opinions for the Trump Administration “When you see accumulation and the price starts to rise slightly after a decline, it usually indicates strong belief among investors. However, this can lead to vulnerability if there is excessive optimism without sufficient buying pressure,” he said. Santiment analysts also looked at the historical course of market activity in the final months of the year. In previous years, including 2017 and 2021, there were significant swings in December and major corrections after all-time highs. “This year has been a big tax year for many institutional and individual investors who profited from crypto and stocks,” said Maksim Balashevich, suggesting that even if long-term fundamentals remain strong, year-end profit-taking for tax purposes could lead to further price declines. Despite the short-term turmoil, Santiment analysts remain optimistic about 2025. They predict softer market conditions in early 2025 as the industry matures and adapts to macroeconomic factors. *This is not investment advice.

The general anticipation is that the United States will witness a lavish inaugural function – far more extravagant than in the previous inaugurations. The inauguration committee has already collected $200 million, and the fund is expected to cross $225 million before the inauguration day. Notably, it is the unprecedented support from the crypto industry that has pushed the fund to this high level. Curious to know more? Read on! Why Crypto Companies Are Backing Trump During the US election campaign, Donald Trump presented himself to the electorate as a pro-crypto candidate. He promised to formulate policies necessary to strengthen the cryptocurrency sector, and assured voters he would dismantle policies that have stifled the growth potential of the sector. Ripple, a crypto company that is fighting a tough legal battle with the US SEC, has donated more than $5 million, as per reports. Coinbase and Kraken are among crypto companies that have made significant contributions to the inauguration committee. Reports suggest that Coinbase and Kraken have contributed at least $1 million each. Interestingly, some crypto companies, like MoonPay, have declined to comment on how much they have contributed to the inauguration fund. Record Fundraising Efforts for Trump’s Inauguration As per a recent report, at least $200 million has been collected so far by the inaugural committee for the three-day celebration, which will mark the official commencement of Trump’s presidency. The report notes that the inaugural committee is preparing to amass over $225 million before the inauguration day. Trump’s Crypto-Friendly Appointments Trump recently named a pro-crypto advocate, Paul Atkins as the successor of Gary Gensler, who is set to step down from his post of the US SEC chairman on the day when Trump takes his oath as the president. Reports indicate that Trump is planning to bring in several pro-crypto figures to his cabinet. There is a high chance that vocal crypto supporters, Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick, will secure key positions in Trump’s cabinet. Recently, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, welcomed the appointments made by Trump, terming the action as a fresh start for the crypto industry. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : What Happened in Crypto This Week?

The collaboration between Tether and Rumble marks a strong stance in favor of free speech and financial freedom, according to statements from both companies. In a December 20 post on X, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino expressed the company’s commitment to supporting technologies and businesses that promote resilience and independence. “Tether deeply believes in the fundamental values of freedom of speech and financial freedom,” Ardoino emphasized, framing the investment as a strategic step toward empowering individuals. Ambitions to Challenge YouTube Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski welcomed the investment, underscoring his determination to disrupt YouTube’s dominance. In a statement on social media, Pavlovski said, “YouTube, lookout. I’m coming for your monopolistic market share globally.” The partnership aims to integrate advertising, cloud services, and crypto payment solutions, strengthening Rumble’s position as a competitive platform. The announcement immediately impacted Rumble’s stock price, with shares (RUM) soaring by 51.60% in after-hours trading, hitting $10.90, according to Google Finance. This surge reflects market confidence in the alliance between Tether and Rumble, as well as growing interest in platforms that prioritize free expression . Bitcoin on Rumble Balance Sheet In addition to its partnership with Tether, Rumble recently decided to add Bitcoin to its corporate balance sheet. The decision follows a social media poll conducted by Pavlovski in November, where 93.9% of 43,790 respondents voted in favor of the move. Rumble’s board of directors approved a strategy to allocate up to $20 million from its excess cash reserves toward Bitcoin acquisitions. This step aligns with the platform’s focus on financial innovation and decentralization, positioning it as a forward-thinking player in the tech and crypto sectors. Tether’s investment and Rumble’s bold financial strategies signal a growing alignment between decentralized technologies and platforms advocating for free speech.

With reports indicating that Donald Trump’s fund is purchasing XRP, there are speculations over its impact on the token’s value. Lets dive deeper to know XRP price prediction and what it means for the investors. XRP is currently trading at $2.30, up over 16% in the last 24 hours. After a slight decrease in the past week, the price of XRP is experiencing a modest recovery. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering around $99,000, which is fueling optimism in the market. Besides, Mark Yusko, founder of Morgan Creek Capital Management, recently highlighted Donald Trump’s alleged involvement in cryptocurrency investments. Yusko claimed that Trump and his son Eric have been actively acquiring digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Hedera (HBAR), and Ripple’s XRP. According to Yusko, Trump’s investments, particularly in HBAR and XRP, could position him at the forefront of ETF approval for these cryptocurrencies.

More importantly, SOL was among the first cryptos to recover from the dip, showing positive interest in investors. Here’s how its recovery is taking place. Whale Jumps On Solana Price Dip The Coinshare data confirms the increased whale activity for days now. The previous week’s Solana inflows hit $1.7M, showing investors’ mindsets shifting to ‘buy the dip.’ The same is true for this week as well, as the trading activity for the token stayed quite high. Interestingly, the whale’s involvement grew tremendously this week, with investors attempting to buy before the market hits the bull in mid-2025. SOL price hit the ATH at $263.83 in November, keeping the investor’s enthusiasm for the further rally. As a result, the whales jumped on the opportunity when the Solana price moved 29% away from that with the crypto market crash . During this period, Solana’s performance collapsed to a month low of $177.21, but analysts call it a retest rather than a drop. Solana Retest Begins, SOL Price Up 9% Today November was the most bullish month for Solana, with a new ATH rally and increased adoption. At that time, it grabbed 53% of the global crypto users on the network, per Glassnode’s relative capital flow report . More importantly, Solana has performed way better than Bitcoin and Ethereum on many metrics, but its recent price drop is concerning to users. However, many crypto analysts have called this a simple breakout and retest , which has already begun. Additionally, many see it as the healthy part of the trend and not a bearish phase. Interestingly, the SOL price charts confirm the theory, as the price has surged 9% today. It is currently at $195.73 and has a market capitalization of $93.8B. The buying pressure is building with the whale’s involvement, but this is the beginning, as the technical charts show hints at the full recovery. Solana Price Technical Analysis The Solana charts indicate a leading rebound from the key support closer to the 200-day SMA, which is an opportunity for the SOL price to move above the VWAP anchored from the September low. Crypto analysts concluded that this is Solana’s opportunity to follow the bulls and recover. Additionally, the analysts see the 4-hour oscillator curling upwards, which confirms the analyses. With that, the next resistance is at the 5-day SMA, so a move above confirms the sustained bullish momentum. What’s Next? With the recent Bitcoin price, experts warned about upcoming Bitcoin crashes . Regardless, altcoins like Solana and others will likely continue to pump with bullish momentum building amidst the whales’ buying before the altcoin season. Although the Solana price has initiated the upward movement with a 9% surge today, the ATH still sits at 29% away, despite setting the target just a few days ago. Many analysts have called this the period of breakout and retest, where the altcoin domination is likely to set in April-May. At that time, altcoins will likely witness a 5x-10x rally once the Bitcoin consolidation paves the way for others.

Brandt tells his 763,600 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may be forming a bearish reversal pattern on the daily chart that could lead to a dip into the $70,000 range. “Hey trolls, this is not a prediction. Just always pointing out possibilities, not probabilities, not certainties. No screenshot is necessary. BTC right-angled broadening triangle could project back into the $70,000s and a test of the parabolic modality.” Source: Peter Brandt/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC may drop to as low as $76,614 if it shatters support at around $90,000. Bitcoin is trading for $97,201 at time of writing, up fractionally in the last 24 hours. Brandt is also warning that Ethereum ( ETH ) rival Cardano ( ADA ) may be printing a head and shoulders pattern on the daily time frame and could plunge if the support level at $0.91 fails to hold. A head and shoulders pattern is typically considered a bearish reversal structure in technical analysis, suggesting that the asset’s uptrend is over. “Cardano looks like a potential car crash.” Source: Peter Brandt/X ADA is trading for $0.95 at time of writing, up 7.2% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, Brandt suggests that payments-focused altcoin XRP is printing a bullish continuation pattern on the daily chart. “XRP appears to be resolving a half-mast flag. If so, distance to the upside should equal advance into the tip of flag.” Source: Peter Brandt/X XRP is trading for $2.28 at time of writing, up slightly in the past day.

It is trading at resistance and is now on the verge of breaking out. As several altcoins witnessed major losses in the past few days, SUI saw a little drop and quickly recovered after testing the descending trendline, which has been providing support for the market since August. On the daily chart, the bulls appeared back in control and now look set to cross over the $4.9 resistance level that initiated drops this week. A successful cross-over there should fuel bigger growth in the upcoming week. Rejecting this resistance could slow down things for the bulls. However, it is important to note that the overall market structure is still looking bullish from a mid-term perspective as SUI maintained a higher high and higher low pattern on the daily chart. The steady rise in the daily volume indicator is another factor to consider for more growth. While the bears continue to suffer loss daily, a dip below the ascending trendline could trigger a serious sell-off capable of activating a major retracement in the market. This should give the bears temporal control before rising back. But for now, SUI’s bears are looking for more gains! SUI Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview SUI is currently on the verge of breaking out of the weekly $4.9 high. In anticipation, the next key level to watch for a surge is $6, $8 and $10. If by any chance the price slips back to yesterday’s low with a break below the white support trendline, the immediate support level to watch would be $2.973, followed by the $2.37 level. Below it lies $1.77.

Deaton quoted the video, saying it is why Elon Musk-led D.O.G.E. is “necessary.” Stewart highlighted the disconnect between the Pentagon’s budget and the realities faced by service members. “ We got out of 20 years of war, and the Pentagon got a raise ,” Stewart remarked. “I can’t figure out how $850 billion to a department means that the rank and file still have to be on food stamps. To me, that’s f*cking corruption. ” Dragonchain attorney and pro-crypto Republican John Deaton quoted a TikTok video that included an interview on his X account, saying, “If you think Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s D.O.G.E isn’t necessary, watch this.” Deaton, who also supports XRP, seemingly suggested that the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) could bring much-needed accountability to departments like the Pentagon. Legal tensions in the US SEC’s crypto cases Deaton’s criticism extended to the ongoing legal conflict between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and various crypto firms, including the case against Dragonchain. The SEC has accused Dragonchain of unregistered crypto asset security offerings, just like it had done to Ripple Labs and its token XRP. In a recent court filing related to the SEC’s case, Deaton lashed out at the agency’s aggressive tactics, claiming that certain SEC lawyers continue to bully American entrepreneurs, especially those in the crypto sector. “ Certain lawyers at the SEC are continuing their bully tactics in non-fraud crypto cases against American entrepreneurs ,” Deaton said on X. He added that Dragonchain, which originated from Disney, is “as American as it gets.” Certain lawyers at the @SECGov are continuing their bullying tactics in non-fraud crypto cases against American entrepreneurs. @dragonchain originated out of Disney. You don’t get more American than that. @GaryGensler and his cronies won’t do what’s right, so we fight. https://t.co/LsOT5E8WXj — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) December 21, 2024 The court filing also raised concerns about the SEC’s current approach to litigation, citing upcoming changes in leadership that could affect the agency’s strategy. “ There are fast-approaching changes to SEC leadership and enforcement priorities ,” the filing read. “ This case meets those criteria, ” referencing an expected shift away from litigation that does not involve investor fraud or imminent harm. Shifting SEC leadership As Deaton and other legal experts continue to challenge the SEC’s enforcement strategies, the agency itself is undergoing a period of transition. The departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has been heavily involved in crypto-related enforcement, has sparked speculation about the future direction of the agency. Gensler’s tenure has been marked by aggressive actions against cryptocurrency firms, including high-profile lawsuits against Ripple, Coinbase, and Binance. John Reed Stark, former chief of the SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, criticized Gensler’s approach, suggesting that the financial authority’s leadership has become too entrenched in aggressive enforcement tactics. Stark noted the promotion of several senior enforcement officers who have been at the forefront of the agency’s crypto crackdown. “ SEC Chair Gary Gensler is clearly attempting to pilot the SEC Enforcement Division from the grave, ” Stark remarked. “ Since Donald Trump’s election, Gensler has promoted five Senior Officers within the SEC Enforcement Division at SEC Headquarters. Four of these SEC enforcement staff cut their teeth as SEC crypto-enforcement superstars .” Stark speculated that the incoming leadership, expected to follow a pro-crypto agenda, could bring about significant changes in the way the agency handles crypto enforcement cases. However, he warned that seasoned enforcement staff might face challenges in adapting to new policies. However, the incoming pro-crypto agenda under the regulator’s chair nominee Paul Atkins may signal a shift in how the agency handles such cases moving forward. Under this new leadership, the SEC could change its approach to enforcement, particularly in cases involving companies like Ripple, Coinbase, and others embroiled in similar legal battles.

Losing momentum last week, it broke down to a month low and recovered with 8% gains in the last 24 hours. Following the November rally, which came without any major retracement, Dogecoin later faced resistance and formed a double-top pattern under the $0.5 level earlier this month. The bearish pattern led to a sudden fall last week before collapsing heavily into the $0.2 range this week. The $0.26 level provided support yesterday and the price recovered well with a strong daily close above the $0.3 level on the hourly chart. Today, volatility enhanced and the price increased to where it trades at $0.345. Doge’s recovery is currently reaching the $0.36 level that broke down as support in the mid-week. A rejection may occur when the price retests this mentioned level. This could trigger another reduction in the market. But if the price increases above the mentioned level, the leading meme coin may break out to a new high in no time. Looking at yesterday’s interception from the bulls’ side, we may see a bigger recovery in the upcoming week if they continue to show commitment daily. DOGE’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview If the price dips again, the $0.262 support could contain selling pressure. Failure to hold may lead to another breakdown of $0.22 and $0.18. A push above the immediate $0.365 resistance could rally the price to a minor resistance of $0.42, followed by the main $0.48 resistance level. A break above it may see us to a new high of $0.6 and potentially $0.75.

Historically, Bitcoin’s 30-day MVRV averages around 0% due to the zero-sum nature of markets.

The price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) rises and falls. It always has and likely always will—just as any stock or asset does. However, as of late, its jumps are far larger than its drops. In other words, crypto enthusiasts are enjoying their own version of the Roaring Twenties , an era of Western economic prosperity following the devastating Great War. You might also like: Launchpads are the key to decoding crypto’s investment complexity | Opinion Likewise, Bitcoin holders and crypto advocates are gleefully checking their digital wallets and watching token values take off just two years after the start of a down market. While crypto bros and decentralized maximalists toast to their chubbier portfolios, the elephant in the room is incoming US President Donald Trump . Trump’s upcoming second term in the White House could reshape the crypto landscape, but much like rising token prices, this remains purely speculative. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that Trump’s total embrace of digital assets provides plenty of upside for the industry. Some have pointed to a Trump quote from July stating that he would establish a “strategic national Bitcoin reserve” as a hint that Bitcoin as legal tender could be on the table. This is also just speculation, but it sure does fuel an industry that has been gaining momentum over the past year. Realistically, achieving the ultimate objective of mainstream adoption isn’t likely in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s inauguration—or even in the first year of his term. However, the industry’s sky-high optimism, along with tangible progress in notable areas such as real-world asset tokenization, spot Bitcoin ETFs , and burgeoning AI-powered use case, provide it with stronger roots. While technological advancements are wonderful (and needed), the path to mainstream adoption won’t be paved by a revolutionary autonomous liquid restaking platform. Instead, mainstream adoption will be achieved through meaningful association with name brands outside the financial and tech sectors. Sure, big-name brands like Nike, Starbucks, Louis Vuitton, and others may have embraced NFTs following their unprecedented success in 2021. However, jumping on a hype bandwagon that ultimately went south isn’t exactly a meaningful initiative. Thanks to the industry’s renewed success and Bitcoin’s gains, several big brands have announced plans to accept crypto payments. Two weeks ago, French department store Printemps announced it was working with Binance and French fintech firm Lyzi to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ) across all its stores in France. Earlier this month, luxury cruiseliner Virgin Voyages began accepting Bitcoin payments, while luxury goods producer S.T. Dupont said it would start accepting crypto payments in two Paris stores by Christmas. While this may be a PR stunt to come off as innovative and could even be a strategic business decision by some slumping luxury brands, it nevertheless pushes crypto into the mainstream. In addition to brick-and-mortar shops accepting crypto payments, fintech solutions like PayPal and WooCommerce are increasingly enabling online shoppers and merchants to integrate and make payments using digital assets. These payment gateways help close the gaps between crypto and the broader economic landscape. GT Protocol aims to achieve this exact goal by building AI agents capable of smoothly integrating into both crypto and non-crypto services. The AI executive technology platform has integrated its AI agents with major global brands, including Amazon, Shein, Nike, and more. As a project demonstrating the power of AI and crypto through its blockchain execution technology, GT Protocol sees the convergence of AI agents, crypto, and e-commerce as a way for its platform to onboard more users towards web4. There are many paths to onboarding new users, but collaborating or integrating crypto payment rails with mainstream brands seems like a shortcut. If crypto can maintain its momentum and continue innovating in the upcoming year, expect to see more brands across many key industries look for ways to bridge crypto and retail.

With Bitcoin ETFs debuting, a crypto-friendly U.S. president-elect, and the market cap doubling, 2024 has set the stage for unprecedented growth. Here are five key trends shaping the year, backed by data from @intotheblock: 1. Bitcoin’s Dominance Reigns Supreme The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January bridged the gap between crypto and traditional finance. Bitcoin’s market dominance surged from under 50% to 59%, a three-year high. Institutional investments poured in, exceeding $10 billion. Speculation about a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve further propelled its ascent. 2. Memecoin Explosion Memecoins experienced a massive surge, with their combined market cap growing by 400% and adding $100 billion in value. Dogecoin flourished, buoyed by Elon Musk’s initiatives, while Pepe skyrocketed by 1,200%, reaching a $7 billion valuation. Solana’s Pumpfun launchpad alone generated $300 million in revenue. 3. Ethereum Faces an Identity Crisis Lower transaction fees reduced ETH burning, causing a year-end increase in supply. Although Layer 2 solutions improved scalability, they weakened Ethereum’s “ultra-sound money” narrative. Meanwhile, activity shifted to emerging networks like Solana and Base, prompting Ethereum to reconsider its priorities for 2025. 4. DeFi Makes a Comeback Decentralized finance (DeFi) saw a renaissance as total value locked (TVL) returned to $150 billion, matching 2021 highs. Losses from hacks hit a four-year low, restoring trust in the sector. New protocols and enhanced regulations drew significant capital back on-chain. 5. Innovations Reshape the Landscape Restaking protocols attracted over $25 billion, enabling higher yields on existing networks. Stablecoins like Ethena democratized funding rate arbitrage. These advancements introduced sustainable earning opportunities, redefining the crypto space. 2024 has been the year crypto went mainstream Bitcoin ETFs, a US president-elect backing crypto, and a market cap doubling. But that's just the surface. Let’s explore the 5 key trends shaping the year wth data from @intotheblock — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) December 20, 2024 In 2024, crypto proved it’s no longer a niche industry but a cornerstone of global finance.

Historically, long-term holders in previous market cycles often accumulated more during bearish phases and took profits when prices peaked. Interestingly, while the number of long-term holders has declined slightly during this cycle, the drop isn’t as pronounced as in past cycles. This suggests that many investors remain optimistic about Litecoin’s potential for further price growth. The sustained confidence indicates that Litecoin continues to be a favored asset for long-term investment strategies, even in a volatile market. 78% of Litecoin addresses have held their $LTC for over a year, typically accumulating during bear markets and selling near peak prices.

This trend of holding through volatility could signal a growing maturity among investors, positioning Litecoin for potential price appreciation in the future.

The duo has risen as standout performers following Bitcoin’s rise to $108,000. According to data from Hedge Fund Research, cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds achieved gains of 46% in November, pushing their year-to-date returns to 76%. This performance outpaces the broader hedge fund industry, which recorded a more modest 10% gain in the first 11 months of 2024. You might also like: Michael Saylor is willing to advise Trump on the crypto policy Hedge funds capitalize on market momentum Brevan Howard Asset Management, with CEO Aron Landy at the helm, manages $35 billion in assets. The fund has seen its main cryptocurrency fund surge 33% in November alone. This contributed to a 51% gain for the first 11 months of 2024. Under billionaire Mike Novogratz’s leadership, Galaxy Digital has posted even more impressive results. Its hedge fund strategy has delivered a 43% return in November and a 90% gain in 2024. The New York-based firm has successfully expanded its assets under management to $4.8 billion. This was partly through strategic acquisitions of assets from distressed crypto companies. The recent rally gained additional momentum following Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election victory. Investors view this as a potential catalyst for more crypto-friendly regulatory policies. Trump’s appointment of venture capitalist David Sacks as cryptocurrency czar and the anticipated replacement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler with cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins has further helped market confidence. Still, it was under Gensler that the crypto sector received a major boost in January 2024 when the SEC approved 11 exchange-traded Bitcoin ( BTC ) funds. This move opened new channels for institutional and retail investment. However, the market experienced a slight pullback this week following the Federal Reserve’s announcement of lower-than-expected rate cuts for the coming year. Bitcoin’s price has surged 130% year-to-date, reaching approximately $108,000. However, the recent pullback saw BTC going as low as $92,175. At last check on Saturday, Bitcoin was trading at $97,232.

Over the past 24 hours, the whale spent $3.019 million in USDT to repurchase 134,433 LINK tokens at an average price of $22.461 after the token’s price dropped by 14.51%. Interestingly, just 21 hours prior, the whale had sold 120,814 LINK for $3.019 million USDT at an average price of $24.986. This sequence of transactions marked the completion of a successful sell-high, buy-low cycle, earning the whale a remarkable $3.53 million profit (+146%) over a 1.75-year holding period. This latest activity represents the whale’s third LINK trade, following the first two which netted a combined profit of $3.292 million (+71.4%), albeit with a win rate of 50%.

But the rest of the board? They’re fair game. And he knows it. So do they, which is why some are reportedly already looking for help to keep their jobs. The Federal Reserve Board is made up of seven members, each appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. With many Biden appointees in key positions right now, Trump might see it fit to clean house. Who’s sitting on the chopping block? First, let’s talk about Powell. Trump appointed him back in 2017, and his term as Chair doesn’t expire until 2026. Legally, Powell can’t be removed unless the president-elect finds a reason that meets the “for cause” standard. That means gross misconduct, not policy disagreements. Powell knows this. He’s defiant, and oddly very powerful. When asked if he’d resign if Trump asked, Powell replied with one word: “No.” He then allowed a few seconds to pass so everyone could take his response in. But Trump isn’t focused on Powell yet. He’s got a smaller fish to fry, starting with Michael Barr, the Vice Chair for Supervision. Barr’s job is to oversee bank regulation, and he’s a Biden guy. His term runs until 2026, but Trump’s advisers are already exploring ways to get rid of him. The argument? Barr’s role isn’t tied directly to monetary policy, so it might not carry the same protections as Powell’s job. Barr, clearly aware of the incoming storm, has lawyered up. He’s seeking advice from Arnold & Porter, a heavyweight law firm, in case Trump does pull the rug out from under him. Next, there’s Adriana Kugler. She’s another Biden appointee, and her term ends in January 2026. Trump doesn’t even have to get creative here — Adriana has a terrible reputation. Philip Jefferson and Lisa Cook, both appointed by Biden in 2022, are also in danger of losing their jobs. Trump’s allies on the board are safe though. Christopher Waller, who joined in 2020, and Michelle Bowman, appointed in 2018, are Trump picks. Waller focuses on monetary policy, and Bowman is all about community banking. These two aren’t going anywhere unless Trump wants them gone—and why would he? The legal loopholes Trump might exploit Here’s where it gets tricky. Federal law says a Fed governor can only be removed “for cause.” That sounds airtight, but the definition of “cause” isn’t crystal clear. Misconduct? Sure. Policy disagreements? Probably not. But Trump, being who he is, could test this in court. Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and former Vice Chair of the Fed, weighed in. He thinks the courts would likely side with Powell, but he’s not making any guarantees. “Trump could try and he might try,” Blinder said. If it goes to the Supreme Court, all bets are off. There’s also the option of demotion. Trump could leave Powell on the board but strip him of the Chair position. It’s never been done before, so there’s no precedent, but legal experts agree it’s a gray area. And if Trump doesn’t want to deal with the courts, he could go straight to the Republican-majority Congress. The Federal Reserve Act isn’t carved in stone. Congress can amend it, and Trump could lobby for changes that weaken the Fed’s independence. The president’s allies are already rallying behind him. Senator Mike Lee posted on X (formerly Twitter), “The Executive Branch should be under the direction of the president. Yet another reason why we should #EndTheFed.” Elon Musk, the guy the president calls “America’s First Buddy,” chimed in with a not-so-subtle emoji to Lee’s post. The Federal Reserve’s independence has always been a sensitive issue. It wasn’t until the 1950s that the Fed became truly independent, breaking away from the Treasury Department’s influence. Since then, presidents have largely respected the Fed’s autonomy. Trump, however, is not like most presidents. Attempts to remove Fed officials are rare, but they’re not unheard of. During Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency, a case involving the dismissal of an FTC commissioner set a precedent for protecting agency independence. Legal experts believe this case could be cited if Trump tries to oust Powell or any other board member. Why does this matter? Because the Fed’s decisions affect everyone. It has far-reaching effects for global economies and financial markets. Wall Street is already nervous. Any move to undermine the Fed’s independence could spook our markets, just as it did during Trump’s first term. Or a few days ago after Powell said his Fed wants nothing to do with Bitcoin ever, and it crashed by 8% in mere hours. Nothing is safe.

The updated policy, which comes into effect on January 15, 2025, is part of Google’s broader effort to align with local regulations and promote responsible advertising practices in the crypto space. The tech giant stated that it will only permit FCA-registered advertisers to promote crypto exchange services and software wallets in the UK. Additionally, advertisements for hardware wallets, which store private keys for cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), will also be allowed but with restrictions. These devices must not offer additional services such as buying, selling, or trading digital assets. Local Compliance Takes Center Stage Google stated the importance of adhering to local laws, reminding advertisers to comply with the financial regulations of jurisdictions where their ads will appear. “This policy will apply globally to all accounts that advertise these financial products,” the company clarified. The move reflects a growing trend among regulators worldwide to address concerns over crypto-related advertising. By enforcing stricter requirements, Google aims to mitigate the risks associated with misleading or unregulated promotions. The FCA has been actively monitoring unauthorized crypto promotions in the UK. On December 16, it issued a warning about a Solana-based memecoin and NFT project called “Retardio,” flagging the firm’s lack of registration. The FCA cautioned consumers that engaging with unregistered entities could leave them vulnerable to financial losses, especially if such companies go out of business. Global Crackdown on Crypto Advertising The UK is not alone in tightening oversight of crypto promotions . Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently introduced its own measures, requiring virtual asset service providers and influencers to obtain approval before marketing crypto products. This global regulatory shift highlights the increasing scrutiny faced by the digital asset industry as authorities work to safeguard consumers. Google’s new policy serves as a critical reminder for advertisers to stay ahead of compliance requirements. As the January 2025 deadline approaches, crypto firms targeting UK audiences will need to ensure their operations meet FCA standards.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 13:24:00

The momentum was short-lived, as SUI experienced a significant retracement on Friday, plummeting nearly 30% to $3.49. However, the token rebounded swiftly, stabilizing at approximately $4.55, representing a 12.8% increase from the week’s low and just 8.9% shy of its record price, SUI Surges Amid Market Volatility In stark contrast, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have continued to experience downward corrections following the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed)0 recent decision regarding interest rates. The Fed’s dovish stance has negatively impacted risk assets, contributing to a generally bearish sentiment in the market that led the market’s leading crypto, to retrace almost 10% from the record high of $108,000. The volatility surrounding SUI led to nearly $14 million in liquidations across both long and short positions on centralized exchanges, with Binance reporting the highest liquidation rates within the past 24 hours, according to data from Coinalyze.

Notably, recent analysis has indicated that Sui ranks third in net inflows over the past three months, with close to $1 billion entering the network, highlighting the growing investor interest in SUI, further bolstered by a new partnership with Phantom wallet. Crypto analyst Route 2 FI noted in a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), that the bullish reversal in SUI’s price indicated strong investor sentiment, culminating in the token’s record peak at the beginning of the week. Analyst Targets $6 As Market Momentum Builds Michael van de Poppe, another respected analyst, pointed out the substantial daily candle movement in SUI, emphasizing that the price dipped into support before quickly bouncing back. He expressed optimism that this trend is far from over, suggesting that SUI could continue its upward trajectory with a target of $6 in sight. The recent surge in SUI’s price is also expected to attract Bitcoin liquidity into its ecosystem, further enhancing the token’s bullish prospects. Technical analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that SUI has effectively executed a post-breakout retest from its re-accumulation range. Rekt also noted that strategic partnerships with Babylon Labs and Lombard Finance would facilitate the integration of Bitcoin liquidity, which could significantly benefit the Sui platform.

The researcher contends that the Sui Network has started to captivate institutional investors, a trend attributed to its dominant technology, upcoming integrations with Phantom and Backpack, and a talented core and executive team. This is expected to continue throughout the current bullish cycle and into 2025, adding to the bullish sentiment for the altcoin as the year draws to a close.

In his latest post, he went after the United States government spending and the Federal Reserve, while praising Bitcoin as usual. In his post, Kiyosaki warned the financial market like he has always done, but this time revealing new things. In his post on X, Kiyosaki shot straight to the point, saying he does not trust the United States government. He discussed the excess spending that the country has made under the last few administrations. Aside from the government, he also claims he does not trust the Federal Reserve and the United States Treasury. He hailed traders that currently hold silver and gold, noting that he is still at a loss on why people are still not adopting them. Robert Kiyosaki rips into the United States government According to his post on microblogging platform X, Robert Kiyosaki said his distrust for the United States government started in 1965 after he noticed that silver coins were becoming alloys of copper. In addition, he reminded his followers about the acts of President Nixon in 1971, taking the US dollar off the gold standard. “In 1971 President Nixon continued the theft of our wealth via our money when Tricky Ducky Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard,” he said. THANK YOU gold, silver and Bitcoin HODLERS: I do not trust the US Giverment, the US Treasury, or the FED. If you trust these Den of Thieves that is your choice. I stopped trusting my government in 1965, when I noticed our silver coins were now alloys of cooper. In 1971… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 21, 2024 Kiyosaki revealed that it was during that period that he decided to start saving gold and silver before adding Bitcoin. He noted that the best assets that people need to save are real gold, silver, and Bitcoin. He said that way, their wealth will not be stolen through the fake money in the system. Kiyosaki said it has always been the same way, highlighting what people do with the dollars. “Keep being ignorant, working hard for fake money, and continue listening to financial planners who will tell you what to do with your fake money,” he said. Kiyosaki issues crucial warning, makes new Bitcoin prediction In typical fashion, Kiyosaki also signaled clear warnings to the general public, noting that things are about to crash. He noted that the imminent crash could be the biggest ever, using a similar tone as his previous warnings. As always, he also believes that only Bitcoin, silver, and gold can save people in the financial market. This present warning is in line with a long list of warnings that the Rich Dad Poor Dad author has sounded over the last few years. He claims to believe that Bitcoin, an asset that he has been championing can save the entire planet. It remains relatively unknown if this “big market crash” is going to come anytime soon. It is also unknown if it is a scare tactic to push people into adopting Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Kiyosaki still thinks Bitcoin could hit as high as $350,000 very soon. In his statement, Kiyosaki credited Trump’s influence while noting that his support for the asset could spell good things for the industry. With Trump eyeing a national Bitcoin reserve, there is optimism that favorable laws, something that the market has been lacking, would be created for the sector. Kiyosaki has advised the market to start buying bits of the asset. Bitcoin is presently trading at $99,160 after the asset dropped from $108,000 to around $92,000 on Tuesday. The 15% drop came after the Federal Reserve announced rate cuts next year, revealing plans to reduce its dovish policy.

Amp (AMP) is a decentralized collateral token facilitating fast and secure payment transactions on the Flexa network. Amp’s purpose is to enhance the adaptability of cryptocurrencies for day-to-day payments by addressing the issues of potential fraud and slow-speed transactions of typical cryptocurrencies. Amp also helps users stake tokens without physically transferring them to a smart contract. This function makes Amp suitable for any form of value exchange, including digital payments, traditional currency exchange, loan distributions, real estate transactions, and more. Will AMP reach new heights with more adoption as the network’s number of users increases? Let’s examine the Amp technical analysis and predictions.

On the other side, the market sentiment remains positive. If observed overall, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 7.33 percent of value. Technical indicators are giving out a neutral verdict regarding the current price movements. Whereas the price charts continue to present a bearish outlook of the market. Is AMP a good investment? AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggest that the approaching weeks can steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2024), potentially pushing the AMP above $0.01. Why is AMP down? AMP’s price has decreased today. Additionally, the coin has experienced a recovery of 7.33% if observed over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00791 as the coin is under a bearish spell for now, moreover, the bears remained on the lead this week. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.005; yet, a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn’t impossible, as the coin achieved this level on March 12, 2024. Will AMP reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan’s price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $204 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price will double in 2025 and reach $0.068 by 2030.

The proposal suggests that such a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve could generate between $16 and $81 trillion in wealth for the U.S. Treasury, potentially offering a path to offset the national debt. The proposal projects digital capital markets growth from $2 trillion to $280 trillion, with U.S. investors capturing the majority stake. A strategic digital asset policy can strengthen the US dollar, neutralize the national debt, and position America as the global leader in the 21st-century digital economy—empowering millions of businesses, driving growth, and creating trillions in value. https://t.co/7n7jQqPkf1 — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 20, 2024 You might also like: This emerging DeFi token could steal the spotlight in 2025 The framework advocates for practical compliance measures. These include standardized disclosures and industry-led compliance protocols. At the same time, it aims to reduce issuance costs and expand market access to 40 million businesses from the current 4,000 public companies. MicroStrategy’s addition to the Nasdaq 100, replacing IT firm Super Micro Computer, is expected to trigger buying activity from index-tracking funds. The company’s success is seen by its market position, trading at approximately double the net asset value of its Bitcoin holdings. This premium allows MicroStrategy to continue issuing stock above its intrinsic value, allowing more Bitcoin purchases. The recent developments validate the Bitcoin-focused strategy championed by Saylor. Saylor has risen as one of the most prominent advocates for Bitcoin since starting the company’s cryptocurrency investments four years ago. According to the data from Saylortracker , the company holds 439,000 Bitcoin now, with an unrealized gain of $16 billion. MicroStrategy’s last BTC purchase was on Dec. 16, when the company purchased 15,350 coins for $1.5 billion. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy has pushed the software company into the Nasdaq 100 index, with its market capitalization soaring to $88 billion despite holding Bitcoin worth approximately $43 billion. MicroStrategy has successfully raised nearly $20 billion from investors in 2024 through a combination of share sales and convertible bonds.

Saylor’s “Digital Assets Framework” outlines strategies to foster the growth of the sector, establish compliance standards, and protect the rights of cryptocurrency holders and companies. According to Saylor, the implementation of these measures will increase economic prosperity, strengthen the global dominance of the US dollar, and help tackle national debt. In the proposal, Saylor highlighted the potential of digital assets to fuel a “capital markets renaissance,” unlocking trillions in wealth and empowering millions of businesses. “By establishing a clear taxonomy, a legitimate rights-based framework, and practical compliance obligations, the United States can lead the global digital economy,” Saylor wrote. Under Saylor’s leadership, MicroStrategy has become the largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, with an estimated $42.6 billion worth of stock. Despite being known as a Bitcoin maximalist, Saylor’s framework includes proposals for regulating other digital assets, classifying them as commodities, securities or tokens based on their characteristics. Related News: Morgan Stanley Chief Economist Speaks: “The Fed Returned to a Hawkish Tone Today, But...” Saylor's taxonomy divides digital assets into different classes: Digital Commodities: Assets with no issuer and backed by digital power (e.g. Bitcoin). Digital Securities: Tokenized forms of equity or debt. Digital Currencies: Fiat-backed tokens. Digital Tokens: Unique categories such as NFTs and physical asset-backed tokens (e.g. gold or oil), as well as fungible tokens with a specific utility. The framework also introduces a “rights and responsibilities” model for issuers, exchanges and participants that emphasizes transparency, accountability and compliance with local laws. Saylor also advocates reducing the costs of issuing and storing digital assets. By limiting compliance expenses to 1% of a firm’s assets under management, Saylor claims the cost of issuing a token could drop from millions of dollars to as little as $10,000. One of the proposal’s core ideas, which has gained traction among crypto-friendly lawmakers like Sen. Cynthia Lummis and Trump, is the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve. Saylor argues that such a reserve could generate between $16 trillion and $81 trillion in wealth and significantly ease the $36 trillion national debt. *This is not investment advice.

However, a flurry of traders are also exploring the new crypto that could benefit from the growing momentum of the broader sector. So, let’s explore four new cryptocurrencies that can help traders turn $100 into $100K in the coming days. 4 Cryptocurrencies To Look As Market Momentum Holds Strong The crypto market momentum holds strong, especially as global leaders are shifting their focus towards the sector. Notably, Donald Trump’s pledge to make the US the crypto capital has fueled optimism toward digital assets recently, with a flurry of investors entering the market. Amid this, a flurry of investors are looking for the top early-stage cryptocurrencies to start with. So, here are the top 4 crypto that could continue to make headlines in the coming days while helping investors to turn $100 into $100K. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Hyperliquid (HYPE) is one of the newest crypto that has made headlines with its recent launch in the market. During writing, the HYPE price soared over 42% to $33.19, recording a surge of about 65% in the last seven days. Since its launch in late November this year, the crypto has surged about 940%. Notably, HYPE has also entered the top 20 rankings as its market cap soared to $10 billion. Meanwhile, despite the recent surge, the token has not been listed yet on the top crypto exchanges like Binance. Having said that, there’s a high possibility of such moves by the exchanges, given its increasing value currently. Usually, the listing or any other positive announcements from the top crypto exchanges boost the cryptocurrencies’ appeal towards traders, which in turn pushes the prices higher as well. Considering all these aspects and its recent run, the investors can explore the HYPE token to turn their $100 into $100K in the coming days. Nebula Stride (NST) Nebula Stride (NST) is another crypto that has received massive traction over the past few days. With soaring anticipation over its upcoming airdrop and the ongoing pre-sale, the investors are eyeing further developments of the project ahead. Notably, according to Nebula’s pre-sale page, the crypto is currently valued at $0.02. However, once it reaches the next level, the price will increase to $0.025. Having said that, many investors are buying the crypto at lower prices now. Meanwhile, Nebula Stride (NST) aims to revolutionize the decentralized financial landscape with its innovative ecosystem. The platform focuses on a Learn-to-Earn (L2E) approach with a comprehensive toolbox for crypto enthusiasts. In other words, the project aims to bridge the knowledge gap and lower entry barriers in the blockchain and DeFi space. This unique approach and the lower price of the NST tokens have also caught the eyes of many investors. Besides, it appears that the crypto would gain significant traction once it enters the market ahead. FARTCOIN The rising trend of memes on social media platforms has boosted market sentiment recently towards the top meme coins . Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin, and other meme cryptocurrencies, have recorded significant rallies recently, indicating the shifting market focus towards the segment. Amid this, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) has emerged as a leading player. Although the crypto has slipped about 11% today, showcasing the volatile nature of the broader segment, it has added 42% over the last seven days. Besides, the crypto has added 1400% since its launch in October 2024, reflecting the growing market confidence towards the asset. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is another leading player in the crypto space that marked its launch recently. The PENGU price was up more than 30% today to $0.030 while adding 506% over the last seven days. Notably, the crypto marked its launch recently, following which its price skyrocketed, showcasing increasing investors’ focus on the asset. Meanwhile, the top Solana meme coins have gained notable traction from market participants lately. Having said that, the crypto is likely to continue its run towards the north ahead. Besides, top analysts have also remained bullish towards PENGU’s run towards a $10 billion market cap in the coming days. What’s Next For These Cryptocurrencies These four cryptocurrencies look promising to many investors, as evidenced by their recent performances and upcoming visions. While projects like FARTCOIN, PENGU, and HYPE, have already made their successful market debut, promising projects like Nebula (NST) are also likely to follow a similar path. Besides, the lower prices of the assets could further aid investors to turn their $100 into $100K over the next few months. Meanwhile, the market optimism further solidified with Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20 approaching. With Trump’s recent support towards the digital assets space, the market highly anticipates a pro-crypto regulatory environment in the US, which could boost adoption. However, it’s worth noting that the new assets that promise high returns also possess volatility. Besides, the broader crypto market is also known for its higher returns as well as volatility. Considering that, the investors should exercise due diligence while putting their bets into the assets.

This new DeFi coin is the most talked-about project right now. It offers huge growth potential and utility. As such, it can easily outdo Solana (SOL) in this bull market. Experts also say that it will soon outperform Chainlink (LINK). With that in mind, they see the new DeFi coin as the most promising investment option in this bull market! SOL’s Price Recovers as Investors Buy the Dip Solana was recently swept up by a market-wide dip. Many altcoins recovered quickly, but Solana took its time. SOL’s price didn’t really move even when BTC went to a new ATH. This caused worry for Solana investors. However, SOL’s price is finally moving up now. Namely, right now, SOL’s price is valued at $222. This is a great level for Solana as it’s finally breaking out. Experts say that SOL’s price increase is largely driven by investors buying the dip. They also say that Solana will do well in the 2025 bull market. That’s because Solana has a growing investor base and a lot of utility to offer. As such, they see SOL’s price reaching over $300 in this bull market. However, there’s a new DeFi coin that will bring much larger profits than SOL. This new DeFi coin is also set to outperform Solana due to its native platform’s better transaction speeds. So, investors are focusing more on the new DeFi coin than SOL at the moment! Chainlink Has a New Partnership That Can Help LINK’s Price Grow LINK’s price is back below $30 at the moment. However, experts say that this isn’t concerning. Namely, Chainlink was also caught up in a market-wide dip. So, Chainlink’s price erased some of the increases it made before the dip started. But this is normal when the whole bull market dips. LINK’s price was quick to recover. This is a great sign for Chainlink. It shows that Chainlink is resilient despite a bearish pressure. It also shows that investors have confidence in LINK. These are all bullish factors for LINK. Also, Chainlink recently announced a new partnership. It teamed up with Hedera to bring better security and transparency to the DeFi coin market. Experts believe that this partnership will increase Chainlink’s market prominence. They say it will help boost LINK’s price in 2025. So, they expect LINK’s price to increase by at least 2x in this bull market. Even so, the new DeFi coin offers much more returns than this. So, it is a much more promising investment option than Chainlink! DTX Exchange: Bringing Great Utility and Perks for This Bull Market DTX Exchange (DTX) is coming at just the right time. As the bull market heats up, traders need a solid trading platform to maximize profits. And that’s exactly what DTX Exchange brings. Namely, it is a flexible trading platform that lets you trade over 100,000 crypto pairs. It also allows you to trade many other assets all from one place. Furthermore, you can trade with up to 1,000x leverage on DTX Exchange. This allows you to make massive profits with every trade. Also, you’ll have a much easier time managing assets. This is possible through DTX Exchange’s Phoenix Wallet. The wallet supports more than 10,000 assets and lets you manage them from one place. This will make trading much easier and faster for you. Also, DTX Exchange puts the “fair” in fair launches. Where most DeFi coin launches are backed by VCs and whales, DTX Exchange isn’t. It gives everyone an equal chance to join its current presale. Also, it has a great incremental price model. This allows its price to rise gradually throughout DTX’s lifecycle. So, no one will be able to dump the price over anyone’s head! DTX Exchange also offers unparalleled transaction speeds. Namely, you’ll get 100,000 TPS. This is much faster than Solana’s 600 TPS. With such transaction speeds, you’ll be able to get much better entries/exists on trades. This will help you make massive profits easily in this bull market! DTX: The Most Promising DeFi Coin You Can Buy! Right now, you can accumulate DTX while it's still in Stage 6 of its public presale. At this stage, DTX is selling for $0.12. This price will rise to $0.20 when DTX launches on multiple exchanges. So, early investors will already make over 66% gains on this new DeFi coin. However, experts say that DTX’s true price surge will come after the launch. They foresee DTX’s price rising by at least 50x in this bull market. Experts believe the rise will be fueled by DTX Exchange’s game-changing features and ease of use. Also, the bull market will help DTX rise even more and outdo many top altcoins!

The platform's Token Builder simplifies this process, allowing users to tokenize their assets seamlessly. Combined with the Rexas Launchpad, individuals can raise funds by launching tokenized projects. These features eliminate traditional barriers to entry, such as geographic restrictions and high capital requirements, offering endless possibilities.

RXS's tokenomics solidify its appeal. Of its 1 billion supply, allocations include 42.5% for the presale, 22.5% for staking pools, and 15% for liquidity. Marketing, team, and treasury allocations are optimized for sustainable growth. Rexas Finance's public presale strategy—opting not to rely on venture capital—ensures equitable access for retail investors. To further engage its growing community, Rexas Finance has launched a $1M giveaway, rewarding 20 lucky winners with $50,000 USDT each. This initiative not only promotes inclusivity but also demonstrates the project's focus on rewarding its early supporters. RXS holders gain multiple benefits, from staking rewards to governance privileges. Coupled with its listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, the token has garnered credibility and visibility, driving investor confidence. Why Solana Bulls Are Watching While Solana's network efficiency remains unparalleled, analysts are now considering the potential of alternatives like RXS, which focus on utility and tangible outcomes. Unlike speculative tokens, Rexas Finance delivers real-world impact. As RXS prepares for public launch on three tier-1 exchanges, demand is set to soar. Analysts predict a $15 price point by early 2025, reflecting a 100x increase from current values. This growth potential positions RXS as an appealing option for long-term investors seeking significant returns.

With its presale momentum, comprehensive utility, and an ambitious roadmap, RXS is poised to achieve top-20 status in the crypto market.

This came alongside a general recovery of the cryptocurrency market that saw the coin gain a lot of attention from traders. crypto analysts now monitor Dogecoin’s ability to reclaim key support levels, with projections hinting at a potential rally toward the $4 mark. Dogecoin Price Soars 25%; Is a Rally to $4 Next? A crypto analyst recently shared an X post predicting a potential Dogecoin price surge. According to analysis, every mid-correction phase for DOGE since 2017 has consistently lasted one month after falling below its all-time high (ATH). Considering this approach to the history, Analyst expects the beginning of a strong upward movement next week, which may drive $DOGE to $4 within a week. This positive outlook is consistent with the triangle shaped patterns visible on the asset’s chart and points towards a hyperbolic rise. Dogecoin price shows potential for a significant breakout as it eyes a critical resistance level at $0.337 on the daily chart. Analyst highlights that reclaiming this level could set the stage for Dogecoin price prediction to target $0.48 and $0.74 in the coming weeks. The suggestion is based on strong technical indicators and previous price movements, hinting at a bullish trajectory. However if bears makes another comeback, the meme coin could break below the $0.3 level. Market sentiment around Dogecoin remains optimistic as traders closely monitor its performance near the pivotal $0.337 threshold. A successful daily close above this resistance could signal a renewed uptrend, attracting more buyers to the meme coin. Source: X Is Dogecoin Price Poised For More Gain Ahead?

To elaborate, since July 2023, the currency has seen its value rise from $0.005 to $0.17, indicating a growth of 3,300% . $ZIG’s financial ascent over the last 18 months (source: Coingecko) $ZIG’s ongoing financial ascent can be traced back to a host of community-building initiatives and partnerships. For instance, on Nov 30, the ZIGChain team concluded its largest ever ‘Buyback & Burn’ to date, with over $146,000 worth of $ZIG (approx. 903,410 ZIG) being eliminated from the token’s supply pool — thus creating scarcity and augmenting demand for the asset. In fact, during November, a total burn volume of $268,000+ was witnessed while earlier this year, a sizable 6.4 million $ZIG Coins (worth approx. $80,000) were burnt, bringing the total $ZIG burned to date to 41,059,555. In a recent tweet explaining the purpose of these burns, co-founder Abdul Gafit Rafay explained:“[Zignaly’s] AUM is nearing new highs and it’s all a grand setup transitioning towardsZigchain with all this AUM set to become TVL”. ZIGChain is an L1 providing users with the required infrastructure for developers to build innovative wealth-generation protocols. Since October, the offering has witnessed an expression of interest from thousands of users, who have signed up for the testnet waitlist. Most recently, the first version of the ZIGChain Whitepaper was released to the public, revealing details of how the system’s governance structure, staking, and fees work as well as how the dev team plans on using its $ZIG reserves to fuel the ecosystem’s development Partnerships driving innovation and adoption Another area where ZIGChain has made significant strides recently is within the realm of strategic partnerships and innovative initiatives. For instance, the platform recently teamed up with Propchain to help meld blockchain tech with real estate investments — thus democratizing access to institutional-grade property investments and RWAs. To elaborate, Propchain brings a robust platform of $135 million in tokenized real estate and ZIGChain provides a purpose-driven L1 focused on wealth generation alongside a technical roadmap that includes the development of a dedicated interface to simplify complex financial transactions. Beyond real estate, ZIGChain has also entered the gaming sector by strategically integrating with Moon Tropica, a battle arena game. The collaboration seeks to enhance the latter’s in-game economy and elevate its general GameFi experiences. Furthermore, the project has also been actively sponsoring and participating in several global high-profile events, such as being the Gold Sponsor of CryptoFightWeek's CFN5 event in Dubai. Lastly, since the beginning of the year, ZIGChain has collaborated with numerous crypto entities including Web3Auth, HoudiniSwap, Enjinstarter, and SpectreAI. Not only that, to maximize user engagement, they've launched the innovative Wealth Generation Quest, offering 100 exclusive Wealth Passes that provide access to unique perks like private events, grants, airdrops, and giveaways across the ZIGChain ecosystem. Looking ahead toward an even brighter future? The growing anticipation around ZIGChain’s future seems to have not gone unnoticed by high-profile crypto investors, particularly notable whales who have been strategically accumulating $ZIG recently. For example, STILL K.A.P.O, a renowned trader with over 260,000 followers, publicly disclosed last month that he had been consistently purchasing 1 ETH worth of $ZIG daily for 30 days. Following suit, other prominent crypto personalities like Andrew Crypto, founder of CryptoAreaGlobal.com, and Stasher also announced similar token accumulation strategies, each committing to buying 1 ETH of $ZIG every day for approximately a month. Lastly, ZIGChain’s partnership with PureVPN , marked a significant milestone in ZIGChain's expansion, with the former serving as the first official validator for ZIGChain. Therefore, it will be interesting to see how the project continues to mature and grow in the near future. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite this sharp decline, key on-chain data from Santiment highlights that whales are capitalizing on the dip. According to Santiment data, large holders have accumulated an additional 110 million XRP in the last day, signaling strong confidence in the asset’s potential. XRP whale purchases – Source: Santiment The activity of whales during XRP’s price drop suggests a calculated approach to long-term gains. Historically, significant whale accumulation during periods of negative market sentiment has often preceded a recovery. Currently, per Coinmarketcap data, XRP’s price is consolidating within the range of $2.00 to $2.90, following a brief dip to $1.96. Analysts believe this consolidation could signal a potential breakout. However, XRP’s price remains 27% below its multi-year high of $2.90, echoing the challenges the asset faces in the short term. Analysts: XRP’s key support levels remain intact Ripple’s native coin has managed to hold above a critical support level of $1.90, which analysts regard as the bulls’ last line of defense. Maintaining this level is crucial for preserving the bullish structure that has defined XRP’s recent price action. The resilience of this support zone provides a glimmer of stability amid broader market uncertainty. The crypto’s recent price movement has been marked by sharp declines and subsequent recoveries. Over 36 hours, the asset plummeted to under $2.25, losing nearly 20% of its value. The situation worsened as the coin fell below $2 for only the third time since December 1, marking a 28% drop from Tuesday’s high of $2.72 to a low of $1.96 by the end of Friday. However, the bulls intervened at this critical juncture, halting further losses and sparking a rebound. The token has since recovered approximately 13%, currently trading between the $2.25 and $2.30 levels. XRP/USDT price chart.

Observations of a “double tap” on the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) and price, coupled with a “tremendous bullish pin” on the daily chart, suggest that the asset may have bottomed and could be poised for further gains.

When can XRP reach $4? Meanwhile, analysts have expressed varying opinions on XRP’s chances of reaching $5. Some experts like Antonio Di Giacomo of XS.com speculated that the asset could reach $3 by the end of 2024. Hani Abuagla, an analyst at the exchange platform XTB, highlighted the wide range of predictions for Ripple’s native coin future. While optimistic scenarios see the price soaring to $100, more conservative estimates project $5, a level that would still mark a doubling of XRP’s current value. Abuagla’s optimism stems from expectations that President-elect Donald Trump’s administration may ease regulatory scrutiny on digital assets and Ripple’s continued progress in cross-border payments. However, he also cautioned that the coin’s long-term price outlook remains highly uncertain, with significant volatility likely ahead.

Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, who has been actively pushing for this proposal has shared some details about the plan which involves a minimum BTC HODLing for 20 years by the US government. Implementing Strategic Bitcoin Reserve For US Earlier this year, Senator Cynthia Lummis presented bill for the United States to accumulate 1 million Bitcoins over the course of the next five years. Detailing further about her plans, Lummis wrote: “To be clear, the “strategic” purpose of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is to: explicitly, strategically, pay down gov’t debt hanging over the head of every American. Put future Americans on a better footing, unencumbered by debt that they never supported or benefitted from”. Senator Cynthia Lummis stated that the bill requires assets to be held for a minimum of twenty years and mandates proof of reserves. She added that by then, the appropriate next steps will become clear. VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets Research, Matthew Sigel, explored the potential impact of having a strategic Bitcoin Reserve and to what extent would it solve the issue of US National Debt. Sigel proposed a hypothetical scenario where the U.S. Treasury purchases 1 million Bitcoin over five years, starting at a price of $200,000 per Bitcoin. Under the assumption that U.S. debt grows at an annual rate of 5%—lower than the 8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) observed over the last decade—and Bitcoin’s price compounds at 25%, Sigel calculates that by 2050, a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would hold assets equivalent to 36% of the national debt. Courtesy: Matthew Sigel Apart from the US, European lawmakers pitched for a strategic BTC reserve for the EU . Earlier this week, a European MP also made a similar proposal amid the global acceptance of the asset class. The MP praised El Salvador’s significant investments in Bitcoin over the past few years. How a BTC Reserve Could Offset US National Debt In order to offset the US national debt, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju explained the feasibility behind building the Bitcoin Reserve. Ki Young Ju pointed out that over the last 15 years, $790 billion in realized capital inflows have driven Bitcoin’s market cap to $2 trillion. Reiterating Sigel’s stand, u proposed that if the U.S. government designated Bitcoin as a strategic asset, acquiring 1 million BTC by 2050 could offset up to 36% of domestically held U.S. debt, which accounts for 70% of the total. While foreign creditors, holding the remaining 30%, might resist such a move, the strategy does not aim to settle all debt with Bitcoin, making the proposal more practical. The CryptoQuant CEO also stated that gaining creditors’ consensus could be challenging given Bitcoin’s volatility compared to traditional assets like gold or dollars. He emphasized that Bitcoin must achieve global recognition and authority equivalent to gold for broader acceptance. Establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could serve as a pivotal first step toward this goal. MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor stated that the US can earn $81 trillion by building the Bitcoin reserve. Addressing potential risks, Ki Young Ju noted the possibility of long-term Bitcoin holders (“whales”) selling large amounts to undermine such a strategy. Yet, he expressed confidence that governments accumulating Bitcoin and a rising price trajectory would deter such actions.

Amid the recent drop, whales seem to have accumulated Ether at a discount. Their buy-the-dip activity adds credence to a potential recovery rally. Ethereum Price Prediction: Was ETH’s Recent Crash it’s Last Drop? Immortal, a crypto analyst and influencer, posted to X that the 14.60% crash witnessed between December 16 and 20 was the “last dip ever.” In his post, the analyst compares ETH’s recent drop to the early 2024 crash and the exponential rally that followed. Based on the expert’s prediction, if Ether rhymes with this previous fractal, the next leg could put ETH’s value in the five-digit category. ETH/USDT 12-hour chart Ethereum Whales Accumulate 160,000 ETH Regardless of whether this dip will be the last one or not, investors need to note that whales were busy buying ETH during the market turmoil. Data from Santiment shows that addresses holding between 10,000 to 100,000 ETH bought 160,000 between December 17 and 21. This activity from large holders often signals confidence in the long-term outlook of the underlying asset, in this case, ETH. Whales Buy 160K ETH President-elect Donald Trump Acquires $2.5M Worth of ETH President-elect Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial accumulated 759.361 ETH worth $2.5 million on December 20, on-chain data shows. This outlook aligns with the above mentioned bullish scenario. With such a strong demand for Ethereum, the drop could be short-lived. Hence, investors looking to panic sell, should reconsider and wait for proper signals before offloading their holdings. Donald Trump Buys ETH Will Ethereum Hit Five Digits? According to popular analyst, Michaël van de Poppe, Ethereum price prediction for 2025 includes a target of $15,000 to $25,000 per ETH. Another analyst Jelle noted that “all bets are off” if Ethereum’s fight with $4,000 ends with it as a support level. Providing a much more detailed outlook is “venturef ounder” who noted Ethereum consolidating between a three-year triangle. A breakout from this triangle could push ETH higher. Venturefounder’s target for Ethereum price is in the next seven years. Additionally, according to Venturefounder, the base case includes Ethereum price repeating this impulsive breakout it did after between 2016-2017 to shoot to new ATH with a target of $15,937 by May 2025. 3 years of triangle consolidation for #Ethereum and $ETH could enter a new paradigm which it consolidated for the past 7 years.

However, there are questions about the nature of these multi-million-dollar donations, whether they are strategic moves or borderline bribery. Cryptocurrency companies are donating a lot of money to President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration, with big names like Kraken, Coinbase, and Ripple pitching in. The crypto industry is hoping to build a good relationship with the incoming administration. But the big question is: are these donations a smart investment in the future of digital currencies, or are these companies just trying to gain favor to secure better regulations for themselves? Massive donations from crypto giants Ripple is winning the race with a donation of $5 million in XRP tokens to President Trump’s inauguration committee. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, said, “We believe in supporting initiatives that help drive innovation and technology forward.” Kraken, another major crypto exchange, also committed to donate $1 million. Ondo Finance follows the path by committing $1 million after a Trump-linked DeFi project invested $250,000 in the ONDO token. Founder Tim Drapper said, “We’re happy to support an administration that understands the value of digital assets.” Coinbase and MoonPay also joined in, with Coinbase donating $1 million even before the election results. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, said, “This donation shows our commitment to building relationships with policymakers who understand the future of finance.” Crypto companies started donating as far back as during the campaign. Elon Musk, who supports cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, played a major role in backing Trump. His support helped bring attention to digital currencies during the campaign. Ripple’s donations during the campaign were a strategic move to make sure the new administration understood the crypto industry. These donations were part of a larger effort that raised over $200 million for Trump’s inauguration, breaking previous fundraising records. While companies like Amazon and Meta also contributed majorly. Why the crypto industry is all in for Trump The main reason behind these donations is the crypto industry needs clearer rules. For a long time, crypto companies have faced uncertainty about the legal status of digital assets in the U.S. Agencies like the SEC have muddled up the regulatory waters. Trump’s pro-business approach and promises to reduce regulations make him a key figure for the crypto industry. Coinbase is committed to working with the Administration and both sides of Congress to create regulatory clarity for crypto, said Kara Calvert, Coinbase’s VP for U.S. Policy. “That’s why we committed to supporting President Trump’s transition and ultimately his inauguration well ahead of the election.” During his campaign, Trump hinted at making regulations less strict, which made him appealing to crypto leaders who feel that President Biden’s policies are restrictive. Many of the donations came in even before the election results were out, which could be interpreted as these companies strategically aligning themselves with Trump’s administration early on. Crypto-friendly appointments The crypto industry’s support for Trump has been repaid early with notable appointments in his administration. Trump has picked Paul Atkins, a known crypto supporter, to lead the SEC. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse praised the appointment, hoping it will lead to less strict regulation compared to the outgoing SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler. Trump also appointed David Sacks as the first-ever “crypto and AI czar,” showing that his administration is friendly towards digital assets. However, that appointment may face some uncertainties according to recent reports . With over $200 million pledged already, these donations show the crypto sector wants a strong relationship with Trump’s government. The timing and size of these donations suggest a strategic move to influence future regulations. While it’s unclear if this will lead to the changes they hope for, one thing is certain: the crypto industry is making its voice heard, investing heavily in securing a more favorable business environment under Trump.

33767162,[object Object],1734791433,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,ASIC Targets Binance Australia Over Groundbreaking Case in Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinist.com/asic-binance-australia-over-case-crypto-regulation/,"The Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s (ASIC) most recent action against Binance Australia marks a significant advancement in cryptocurrency regulation. The cryptocurrency community is in disbelief over this case, which will likely have a lasting impact on how digital currencies are governed in Australia and other nations. The Regulatory Measures of ASIC The main Australian financial regulator, ASIC , has become more vigilant in monitoring the cryptocurrency industry. The recent prosecution against Binance Australia is part of a broader effort to enforce compliance with contemporary financial norms. The commission has accused Binance of violating several laws related to counter-terrorism financing (CTF) and anti-money laundering (AML). This action demonstrates ASIC’s commitment to safeguarding investors from potential cryptocurrency risks and upholding the financial system’s integrity. Implications for Binance Australia This regulatory decision could have significant effects on Binance Australia. The business may face hefty fines, operational limitations, or even the suspension of its Australian operating license. Such outcomes could impact Binance’s brand and investor confidence internationally and its operations in the region. ASIC’s Deputy Chair, Sarah Court, criticized Binance’s compliance systems as “woefully inadequate,” stating that many clients suffered significant financial losses due to the lack of appropriate consumer protections. The ongoing legal proceedings could result in substantial penalties, declarations, and adverse publicity orders against Binance Australia. Such outcomes may adversely affect Binance’s brand reputation and investor confidence in Australia and internationally. This case serves as a clear warning to all cryptocurrency exchanges about the critical importance of adhering to legal requirements and implementing robust compliance procedures to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Broad Effects on Crypto-Regulation This historic case is likely to set a precedent in cryptocurrency regulation. Authorities closely monitor Australia’s actions worldwide, which may influence how cryptocurrencies are regulated globally. If ASIC’s prosecution is successful, it could encourage other regulators to target cryptocurrency exchanges that operate similarly within their jurisdictions. Supporters argue that the development and stability of the cryptocurrency market depend on a more consistent and stringent regulatory environment, which this case might help establish. What To Expect Next For Australia’s Crypto Regulation This lawsuit will likely significantly impact how cryptocurrencies are regulated in Australia in the future. According to industry analysts, ASIC will continue enhancing its regulatory framework to address the challenges posed by virtual currencies. Cryptocurrency exchanges may face stricter AML and CTF regulations, improved customer due diligence, and greater operational transparency as part of additional compliance obligations. These measures aim to protect investors, prevent illegal activities, and ensure the sustainable growth of the Australian cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, ASIC ‘s case against Binance Australia is a landmark moment in cryptocurrency regulation. It highlights the increasing need for robust regulatory frameworks to manage the rapidly evolving world of digital currencies. The outcome of this case will be closely observed by regulators, investors, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, as it has the potential to reshape the trajectory of cryptocurrency regulation in Australia and beyond.

Keiser framed the US dollar as “the ultimate proof-of-stake shitcoin,” emphasizing that it derives its value from control and exclusion rather than openness and neutrality. Max Keiser Slams Saylor’s Bitcoin Stablecoin Idea Max Keiser, a well-known crypto analyst and broadcaster, has offered a sharp critique of the global financial system, this time targeting the idea of a Bitcoin-backed US stablecoin. Commenting on Michael Saylor’s proposal for the US to create a $10 trillion Bitcoin-pegged stablecoin, Keiser dismissed the idea as unrealistic, citing the restrictive nature of US dollar policies. He described the USD as “the ultimate proof-of-stake shitcoin,” arguing that its value stems from centralized control and exclusion, rather than the transparency and neutrality championed by decentralized systems like Bitcoin. . @Saylor ’s idea, that the US creates a $10 trillion stable coin backed by Bitcoin is unlikely to happen because the US is extremely restrictive about who gets to use the USD. The USD is the ultimate proof-of-stake shitcoin, and the US government is never going to open-source… pic.twitter.com/nT5ckmP0K8 — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) December 21, 2024 Keiser contrasted the USD’s foundation of force with Bitcoin’s ethos of peace, referring to El Salvador’s adoption of a Bitcoin standard under President Nayib Bukele as a prime example of a peaceful financial revolution. Reaffirming its Bitcoin commitment with the promse to buy up another 20,000 BTC, Keiser says El Salvador is leading the way toward a more just and transparent monetary system. Max Keiser, further asserted that the US can’t create an SBR without collapsing the USD and ultimately losing world power. But El Salvador, on the other hand, is in a rare position to do so: under President Nayib Bukele, it has increased daily purchases, setting an ambitious short-term target of adding another 20,000 BTC to its reserves. This bold strategy underlines El Salvador’s commitment to the Bitcoin standard and the rewriting of its economic trajectory. Michael Saylor Urges US to Leverage Stablecoins to Strengthen the Dollar Max Keiser focused mainly on the recent interview with CNBC , where Saylor laid out a plan for how the US could leverage the incoming administration of President-Elect Trump to implement a digital assets framework that would cement the dollar as the premier digital currency. Saylor blasted the onerous US stance regarding cryptocurrencies and murky regulations, forcing companies like Tether to issue dollar-backed stablecoins offshore. He envisioned US banks one day issuing their own stablecoins and creating a multi-trillion-dollar global opportunity for the dollar. Even though he supports Trump’s plan on Strategic Bitcoin Reserves , Saylor explained that US-issued digital dollars could tap into a $10 trillion global market, boosting demand for US treasuries used to back these tokens. It would allow the US to extend the dollar’s dominance in the new digital economy. He further went on to explain how Russia, China, Africa, and South America already utilize stablecoins such as Tether to access dollars. This demand could be met with US banks under clear regulations, issuing stablecoins backed by treasuries and stored domestically. Saylor argues that the US should aim far beyond the $150 billion in offshore stablecoins, pushing for trillions backed by its financial infrastructure. He has gone as far as to suggest selling US gold reserves to buy Bitcoin for a strategic reserve, underlining his vision for how the nation should incorporate digital assets into its future.

Memecoins Surge As per data from Coingecko, BONK surged 30%, while Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Dogwifhat and Floki Inu surged as much as 20%. Notably, the dog-themed tokens, on average, saw an 8% increase in value over the past 24 hours, outpacing the overall market, which rose by 4.5% Memecoins characterized by high volatility, often outperforms major tokens during price rallies, acting as a leveraged bet on the overall crypto market sentiment. Recently, Floki was recognized by the U.S. CFTC as an example of a utility token. FLOKI – A Utility Token The token was noted during the Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) meeting on Nov. 21, where the focus was on providing clarity for digital asset markets. The committee highlighted Floki for its growing ecosystem, especially Valhalla, a blockchain-based metaverse game launching in 2025. FLOKI will be the primary currency in the game, enabling players to earn and spend it, which supports its classification as a utility token. Notably, tokens that provide immediate practical use like Floki’s role in Valhalla are being acknowledged as non-security commodities. The subcommittee outlined that utility tokens must offer “immediate, non-incidental consumptive use” to qualify. FLOKI Ecosystem Sees Growth Floki’s ecosystem has seen significant growth over the past year, with the launch of Valhalla, a metaverse game, and FlokiFi, a DeFi platform for asset locking. Besides, Floki’s developers introduced Floki University, an educational initiative aimed at enhancing blockchain literacy. Floki’s lead developer noted that this puts Floki on an entirely different level from other memecoins, especially when the market turns and people start to pay attention to fundamentals again. On the other side, Interest in BONK is rising as efforts to reduce its token supply gain momentum. BonkDAO burned 100 billion tokens in November and plans to burn a trillion tokens in December, which could increase the token’s value due to scarcity.

The notice raises concerns about the platform’s integration of its ERC-20 token with blockchain games and questions aspects of its activities, including its 2021 contract migration. The SEC’s Argument In a post on X, the CyberKongz team expressed their dismay with the agency’s handling of the situation, saying: “We are extremely disappointed at the approach the SEC has taken towards us, but we are going to stand up and fight for a brighter future that holds more clarity for NFT projects.” They disclosed that the issue began two years ago when the regulator first contacted them, during which time they operated quietly and under a lot of pressure. The post highlighted that the SEC’s main concern appears to center on whether ERC-20 tokens can function alongside blockchain games without being classified as securities. CyberKongz argued that this implication could have wide-ranging consequences for the Web3 gaming industry. They also said they are determined to contest the financial watchdog’s position and advocate for a clearer regulatory framework. Another point of contention involves the Genesis Kongz contract migration in April 2021, which the regulator reportedly interpreted as a token sale. The NFT project clarified that the migration was not a primary sale and criticized the SEC’s inability to differentiate between the two, stating: “If they cannot distinguish between a primary sale and a contract migration, what hope do we currently have for a clear regulatory pathway going forward?” The Wells Notice gives the platform 30 days to respond before the SEC decides whether to pursue enforcement action. While not a formal allegation of wrongdoing, such a notice shows that the agency is considering further legal steps. Broader Industry Issue This latest development adds CyberKongz to a growing list of blockchain and NFT entities under SEC scrutiny, including Coinbase, Consensys, Ripple, OpenSea, Uniswap Labs , and Bittrex , which have faced similar notices in recent years. Last month, Australian-based gaming company Immutable also reported receiving such a warning. At the time, they expressed frustrations over vague allegations and unclear regulatory guidelines.

In fact, this makes Hexarq only the second banking crypto operation in France to be licensed as such, following Société Générale’s Forge. This move is an important milestone for the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies in European banking. Hexarq: The Expansion of BPCE in Crypto Launched in January 2021, Hexarq focuses on the provision of cryptocurrency services and management of tokenized real-world assets. With its CASP authorization, Hexarq is now allowed to provide crypto custody, buying, selling, and trading services, including euro-crypto exchanges. The company will merge its services into BPCE’s top banking networks, Banque Populaire and Caisse d’Épargne, by 2025. This would make services accessible to BPCE’s 35 million customers, placing Hexarq among the key players in leading the adoption of digital assets among the European banking system. A Major Milestone for European Banking The foray of BPCE into cryptocurrency space reflects the increasing momentum in the traditional banking world embracing digital finance. Given that BPCE had $1.3 trillion in assets under management as of September 2024, many consider its involvement to accelerate cryptocurrency adoption across Europe. With the integration of Hexarq soon, millions of customers will be able to safely access and invest in cryptocurrencies through a trusted banking platform. Limited CASP Authorizations Signal Regulatory Caution Hexarq is the fourth crypto business to receive CASP authorization from the AMF. Other authorized entities include Société Générale’s Forge, Deblock SAS, and GOin SAS. The French regulator’s cautious approach emphasizes thorough vetting ahead of the full implementation of EU-wide Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, which will take effect on December 30, 2024. In August 2024, AMF began to take applications for CASPs in line with MiCA. The number of authorizations is still limited and thus indicates the regulator’s desire for compliance and consumer safety in an emerging industry . Conclusion The AMF approval of Hexarq marks a very important milestone not only for BPCE but for the entire financial industry in general. Such a blend of traditional banking with crypto services places BPCE in a position to drive great innovation in the European financial space, bridging conventional finance and the fast-growing digital economy.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-21 14:43:27

Here’s what Peter Todd suggested,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-cypherpunk-ideals-peter-todd/,"The debate about Bitcoin remaining faithful to its cypherpunk principles has heated up, as critics claim that its potential for decentralization and anti-control is disappearing. Meanwhile, Peter Todd, one of the coin’s developers, suggests “tail emission” as an alternative. The basis of the cypherpunk movement underlines strong cryptography and privacy tools to protect individual rights and promote a decentralized society. It combines the word “cypher” as in encryption, with “punk” as a symbol for a rebellious, do-it-yourself spirit. This movement has played an important role in shaping the internet, especially key technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s creation also brings the cypherpunk movement closer to its goal of building tech for digital privacy, security, and independence. Recently, BlackRock questioned BTC’s fixed 21 million supply limit. It contained a disclaimer: “There is no guarantee that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” Micro Strategy’s CEO, Micheal Saylor, who is one of the top BTC holders, also retweeted the video.

They're… pic.twitter.com/Xg3sQP9BJw — Joel Valenzuela (@TheDesertLynx) December 18, 2024 Doubts have poured in over whether Bitcoin’s fixed supply remains as inviolable as one thought after BlackRock issued a disclaimer. Serious questions have been raised over the cryptocurrency’s capacity to bear long to its ethos due to the growing capitalist influence of corporate players. Peter Todd suggested ‘tail emission’ for Bitcoin back in 2022 Another critic on X, @sebp888, criticized renowned Bitcoin developers, including Adam Back and Peter Todd, for remaining silent about these issues. He argued that Bitcoin’s community should fight back against the perceived growing corporate domination. Peter Todd shared the screenshot of the community note with his article. Source: X Peter Todd retweeted the tweet with a screenshot showing a community note under Sebastian’s post. The note pointed toward Todd’s article from 2022: “Surprisingly, Tail Emission Is Not Inflationary.” In this piece , Todd contemplated the threats Bitcoin could face when it ditches block rewards in favor of transaction fees for miners’ incentives. This could happen after all of the Bitcoin supply has been mined. He warned that such a shift could be unstable. “To date, no proof-of-work currency has ever operated solely on transaction fees, and academic analysis has found that in this condition, block generation is unstable.” He suggested an alternative like Monero’s implementation of tail emission, in which miners receive a fixed, small reward per block forever. Lost Bitcoins naturally balance out the continuously emitted coins According to Todd, this model doesn’t cause inflation but rather creates a stable supply. He also said lost coins naturally balance out the continuously emitted coins. Thus, in the long run, coins are created just as fast as they are lost,” Todd said. He explained it through mathematical modeling by which he proved that fixed rewards in combination with natural coin loss yield a stable monetary system. One user on X, @LibreHans , doubted Peter Todd’s prediction. He said, “You think you can predict the future? How could anybody take you seriously?” Todd replied rather sarcastically that losing coins can only “magically” stop in the future. However, his article also points out how difficult it would be to implement such changes on Bitcoin. Todd noted that a hard fork to enable it would likely mean not winning consensus from the large and diverse Bitcoin community. “While Monero was able to get sufficiently broad consensus in the community to implement tail emission, it’s unclear at best if it would ever be possible to achieve that for the much larger Bitcoin,” he wrote.

Capital flows into Bitcoin investment products have surged, with $4.7 billion in December alone, highlighting Bitcoin's dominance in digital asset investments. Cycle indicators suggest Bitcoin's price may not have peaked yet, but technicals show bearish divergences and potential risks, urging caution. Despite fundamental concerns, I believe the current dip below $100k is a buyable opportunity, with potential for new highs in 2025. 2024 has been a truly terrific year for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Bitcoin proxies like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). Of particular importance was that three-letter addition to GBTC's fund name back in January. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by a kicking and screaming US Securities and Exchange Commission truly opened the floodgates of liquidity. Recently Bitcoin officially hit a six-figure price as many of us expected . Where do we go from here? Data by YCharts In this article, we'll look at updated capital flow numbers, cycle indicators, and basic technicals to assess what (if any) upside remains in this monstrous Bitcoin 131% year to date rally. Capital Flows Q4 has been an absolute monster for capital flows in Bitcoin and other digital assets. Coinshares now has the month to date net flow into Bitcoin investment products at just under $4.7 billion through December 14th. Per data from The Block, we can see at least an additional $1.7 billion has come into US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs between December 16-18th. Daily Spot BTC ETF Flows (The Block) These are enormous numbers. Especially when considering GBTC outflow really hasn't stopped this month. To be sure, the outflow from GBTC has slowed down dramatically since May, but even with the lower-priced option of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF ( BTC ), Grayscale's original ETF continues to see outflow: BTC Supply Through Grayscale ETFs (The Block) Grayscale's spot Bitcoin products held 250.18k BTC on November 30th. As of December 19th, that figure was down to 249.6 BTC. Bitcoin presses on. Not only does capital keep flowing into Bitcoin and other digital assets, but Bitcoin's share of that net flow continues to be enormous. As of December 14th, Bitcoin's $38.6 billion share of $44.5 billion in YTD digital asset net flow is a staggering 87%. It seems clear to me that in the eyes of Wall Street and the larger investment community, Bitcoin is still very much the favorite. Cycle Indicators In this section, it is important to remember that these are not forecasts or price targets. They are just indicators that we can use to determine if the price of Bitcoin is getting extended based on historical averages and multiples. I like to use some of them, but I also think it’s important to be selective because these tools can provide very different signals. We’ll go through a few of the ones that I personally like. First, the MVRV, or market value to realized value: Bitcoin MVRV (BGeometrics) This shows the premium in market price over the average price paid per coin by holders. Bitcoin's market value to realized value is presently 255% - which implies the average holder has a 155% gain on their cost basis. What's also important to point out is the Z-score, or deviation, of the MVRV from statistical norms. At at Z-score of 3.2, Bitcoin's MVRV isn't quite as extended as it could be, but it is important to keep in mind that each peak in BTC price has resulted in a lower high in MVRV through the years. Something else to consider is 97.6% of BTC holders are currently in profit: Bitcoin Holders in Profit (IntoTheBlock) Percentage of holders in profit in the high 90's is generally always something that leads peaks in price, even when short term. If Bitcoin is a game, there are brief periods where everyone is a winner. This is obviously not reality and always corrects. As is generally the case when Bitcoin moves to the magnitude that it has this year, HODLer balance has been in decline for most of the year. HODLers are defined as wallet addresses that haven't moved supply in 12 months. HODLer Balance (IntoTheBlock) In January the HODLer balance was 13.8 million BTC. That figure is currently 12.3 million BTC. HODLer balance is down roughly 11% from the peak earlier this year. This is very typical. HODLer balance declined by 14% between 2020 and 2021 and by 23% between 2017 and 2018. It's certainly possible the decline will be less extreme between 2024 and 2025. But until we see that HODLer balance start to move back up, I don't think we've seen the high in Bitcoin's price just yet. Historically, HODLers don't start reallocating until after the price has topped out. Finally, I want to share Checkmate's 'Euphoria Zone' chart: Euphoria Zone Chart (Checkonchain) This is a pricing model that utilizes several different indicators to identify when the market is in the ""euphoria zone."" As one would expect, when the market is euphoric it's typically a good time to start thinking about exiting trades. Bitcoin entered the euphoria zone in November. The only question remaining is how long euphoria can last. Bitcoin spent most of 2017 in euphoria and about 7 straight months in euphoria between November 2020 and May 2021. It's important to remember that none of this means anything will happen again in the same way that it has in the past. We are simply using these models as tools to make our own assessments on where price may go. Technicals are also important. Technical Opinion From a technical standpoint, I like to keep my analysis mainly to daily and weekly charts. I have some concerns about what I'm seeing on the daily: TrendSpider Here we find numerous bearish divergences in the RSI going back to mid-November. There was a divergent high on November 21st, December 5th, and another on December 16th. This was a clear warning sign. The good news is Bitcoin has not given up the 50 day moving average and has actually responded very well from a short-lived test of that MA. TrendSpider The weekly chart shows a perfect back-test of the 8 week. However, there are several concerns here as well. First, unless Bitcoin pulls off a drastic recovery over the next several days, the current weekly candle is highly bearish in my view. It's engulfing to the downside and it comes with an RSI that is falling out of overbought. My view has generally been that the 8 and 20 week MAs will tell the tale. Until we see a weekly close below the 8 week, I think dips are still buys for now. Risks I've been writing about Bitcoin on this website since 2019. Despite literally hundreds of articles covering BTC and crypto-related assets, it's still difficult for me to say that any price for Bitcoin is justifiable based on fundamental usage or utility. For instance, monthly active addresses hit their lowest level since 2016 in October 2024. Bitcoin Monthly Fees vs DAAs (Token Terminal) Despite sporadic surges, network fees make up a very small portion of miner incentive - which remains a long term issue for a fixed-supply asset. L2 solutions like Lightning Network have generally failed to scale the network. I see serious issues. Bitcoin is not perfect and is still very much an idea, in my view. But I've generally remained bullish because people keep buying it anyway. Is that a great reason to buy something? Probably not. But that hasn't mattered yet. Number go up. Final Takeaways In my opinion, this fall back under $100k per coin has been a necessary pullback and it's one that I think offers a buyable dip. I expect Bitcoin bulls are going to enjoy yet another pump to new highs in 2025 before this thing tops out for the cycle. I'm not going to attempt to guess what that top price will be, but I think it's going to be many years before Bitcoin sees a seven-figure coin price - if it happens at all. In my view, the ease with which investors can now allocate to Bitcoin can absolutely be a double edged sword. These ETFs are powering Bitcoin higher very quickly because investors are bullish. Downside speed is likely to be evident as well when sentiment turns bearish. Again, I don't think we've seen the top yet for this cycle based on both sentiment and many of the indicators I've provided. But that is just my opinion. I do think it would be wise for Bitcoiners to, at minimum, entertain the possibility that we have already seen the top for this cycle. The market's response to the latest FOMC has not been a good one and Bitcoin has been highly correlated to risk assets like the Qs. My approach to Bitcoin and its proxies has always been to take small chunks off when the market is ripping hard. I have personally lightened up since the coin hit $100k. But that is not stopping me from buying this dip below $93k with swing capital. Be careful out there. Don't forget to take profit. I hope everyone enjoys the holidays and has a happy new year.

On Friday, December 20, the BTC price dropped to as low as $92,000. This abrupt Bitcoin price decline came following the US Federal Reserve’s rate cut, which also pushed other financial markets to the red. However, it is worth mentioning that the premier cryptocurrency is beginning to show signs of recovery, currently hovering around $97,000. Can Growing Demand Push BTC Price Back Above $100,000? In a recent December 20 report, market analytics platform CryptoQuant revealed an interesting on-chain development with the Bitcoin supply-demand dynamics. According to the blockchain firm, the BTC market seems to be enjoying renewed investor interest. Related Reading: How Low Can Dogecoin Go Before It Rebounds? Expert Forecasts The relevant indicator here is the Total OTC Desk Balance, which tracks the amount of Bitcoin held in addresses associated with Over-The-Counter (OTC) desks. This metric provides an insight into the supply of BTC readily to large investors and institutional players. According to data from CryptoQuant, the OTC desks are witnessing their largest monthly inventory decline of 2024, declining by over 26,000 BTC so far in December. This decline has been even more significant in the past 30 days, with the balance dropping by 40,000 BTC since November 20. This decline in the Total OTC Desk Balance is a bullish indicator, which reflects the soaring demand for Bitcoin and the concurrently shrinking supply. Typically, the contracting BTC supply on the open market could set the stage for a period of significant price appreciation. CryptoQuant noted that the price of Bitcoin rallied from $40,000 to around $74,000 in the 2024 first quarter after demand growth caused the Over-The-Counter desks’ inventories to fall. According to the market intelligence, the OTC desk’s inventory is beginning to near the levels seen during the first-quarter rally. Data from CryptoQuant shows that Bitcoin’s apparent demand is currently growing at a monthly rate of 228,000 BTC after entering the expansion territory in late September. At the same time, the balance of accumulation addresses is swelling at a record-high rate of 495,000 BTC per month. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $97,655, reflecting a 0.1% decline in the past 24 hours. The premier cryptocurrency is down by nearly 4% on the weekly timeframe, according to data from CoinGecko.

This time, the renowned economist has proposed an alternative that the US could adopt instead of implementing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Peter Schiff Proposes Alternative To Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In an X post, Peter Schiff stated that the US could save a lot of money by creating a ‘USA Coin’ instead of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Interestingly, he said just like Bitcoin, the USA coin’s supply can be capped at 21 million. He added that the coin should run with an upgraded blockchain to make it actually viable for use in payments. The renowned economist, who happens to be a Bitcoin skeptic, has made it clear on several occasions that he is against the idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Recently, Schiff stated that the best thing Biden could do before leaving office was to sell the US Bitcoin holdings. According to him, that would end all the “nonsense” about creating a Bitcoin Reserve. His latest comments look to be his way of once again taunting the Bitcoin faithful. However, despite Peter Schiff’s skepticism, the creation of a US BTC Reserve looks to be gaining ground. Moreover, Senator Cynthia Lummis, the sponsor of the Bitcoin Act of 2024 bill, has proposed a plan for the BTC Reserve to reduce the $36 trillion national debt. VanEck’s Matthew Sigel also explained a scenario where the reserve could offset 36% of the national debt by 2050. A Case Against The BTC Reserve Like Peter Schiff, Castle Island Ventures’ Nic Carter also looks to be against the idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Carter explained that a BTC Reserve would undermine and not support the Dollar. He explained that the US issues the Dollar as the global reserve currency. Therefore, acquiring Bitcoin and assigning it a monetary role could imply that the US is losing confidence in the current dollar-based system. However, despite objections from individuals like Nic Carter and Peter Schiff, the focus looks to be on how Bitcoin can strengthen the US economy. CryptoQuant’s CEO, Ki Young Ju, also agreed that a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to offset the US debt is a feasible approach.

If you’ve been following the meme coin space, you know how quickly things can explode. The BTFD Coin presale has already raised over $4.2 million and continues to build momentum, offering early investors opportunities that could pay off handsomely.

So, if you’re looking for the best new meme coins to invest in today, keep reading as we dive into the most promising projects, including the incredible presale of BTFD Coin. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Meme Coin to Watch in 2024 Let’s kick things off with BTFD Coin, an emerging star in the meme coin universe. While the presale is ongoing, BTFD Coin has already caught the eye of crypto enthusiasts with its unique features. As of now, the coin is in Stage 12 of its presale, priced at $0.00013, and the presale has already raised a staggering $4.2 million. That’s some serious traction! With over 57 billion coins sold to over 6,100 holders, the BTFD Coin presale is proving to be a hot ticket. Why is BTFD Coin generating so much buzz? Well, it’s not just about the price or the hype. BTFD Coin is bringing some serious value to the table. For starters, the Play 2 Earn game launched its beta version during Stage 10 of the presale. While rewards aren’t available in the beta, the game itself gives a sneak peek into what’s to come. The full launch of the P2E game will likely bring significant attention, especially as it ties into the overall vision for the project. The idea of earning while you play is always a big draw for investors and gamers alike, and BTFD Coin has capitalised on this trend in a big way. On top of the gaming aspect, BTFD Coin offers up to 90% APY through staking. Imagine staking your coins and earning passive rewards—sounds pretty tempting, right? This feature went live on December 2 and has already caught the attention of those looking to maximise their crypto holdings. Furthermore, BTFD Coin has a fantastic referral program, rewarding users who help spread the word. With all these benefits rolled into one, BTFD Coin has certainly carved a niche for itself. Why did this coin make it to this list? The combination of its presale success, innovative features like Play 2 Earn, high staking rewards, and an active referral program makes BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to invest in today . With so much happening, it’s clear that this project is gaining momentum quickly, and it’s only a matter of time before BTFD becomes a major player in the meme coin space. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) – The OG Meme Coin with Endless Potential Dogecoin (DOGE) isn’t exactly “new” by meme coin standards, but it’s one of the most well-established and widely recognised names in the meme coin world. Originally launched in 2013 as a joke, Dogecoin quickly found a massive following thanks to its lovable Shiba Inu mascot and strong community. Over the years, it has steadily gained in value, making it a serious player in the meme coin market. Despite its somewhat cheeky origins, Dogecoin has become a household name in crypto circles. It has even been endorsed by none other than Elon Musk, who frequently tweets about the coin and its potential. But what really makes Dogecoin stand out among the best new meme coins to invest in today is its resilience and community-driven growth. The Dogecoin community has always been active, with a group of passionate supporters who believe in the long-term success of the coin. Why did this coin make it to this list? While Dogecoin may not have the same flashy features as newer meme coins, its strong brand recognition, loyal community, and status as a frontrunner in the meme coin movement make it a solid choice for those looking to invest. It’s been around for over a decade, and its potential continues to grow as new projects and platforms adopt it for payments, tipping, and more. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – The “Doge Killer” That’s Gaining Traction Shiba Inu (SHIB) is another heavy hitter in the meme coin space, and it has positioned itself as a direct competitor to Dogecoin. Often referred to as the “Doge Killer,” SHIB has built a massive ecosystem around its token, with numerous projects and initiatives supporting its growth. The coin has attracted millions of investors, drawn by its promise of high returns and a strong, vibrant community. One of the major factors contributing to SHIB’s success is its burn mechanism, which helps reduce the total supply of coins over time. This deflationary approach is designed to create scarcity, which could potentially increase the value of each coin. SHIB has also launched several initiatives like the ShibaSwap, allowing users to stake their tokens and earn rewards. Additionally, SHIB has a significant presence in the world of NFTs, further solidifying its place in the crypto landscape. Why did this coin make it to this list? SHIB’s explosive growth and continued innovation have made it a major contender among the best new meme coins to invest in today. With its strong community, creative projects, and long-term vision, Shiba Inu is poised to continue attracting new investors. Final Thoughts: Is BTFD Coin the Next Big Thing? As meme coins continue to surge in popularity, there’s no shortage of exciting opportunities. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain stalwarts of the meme coin world, BTFD Coin is making waves with its innovative approach and presale success. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to invest in today, BTFD Coin’s presale offers an incredible chance to get in on the ground floor before it hits exchanges. With features like staking, Play 2 Earn, and a strong referral program, BTFD Coin is undeniably an exciting new player in the meme coin market.

The dog-themed Solana-based coin has become one of the most recognized meme coins, with its market capitalization reaching $2.7 billion in May. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 66 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem.

Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a huge surge in SOL’s price, attributed to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2030, Bonk will reach $0.000292, which is approximately 15 times its current price, making it a good investment to consider. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a substantial portion of its value over the last 24 hours. In the last few hours, its value decreased by $0.000003094. Today’s decreasing pressure triggered a massive descent in the coin’s value. Will Bonk Recover? Bonk is currently trading in its middle price range. Considering the current situation, the coin’s price has initiated a recovery as the crypto pair has secured support at the $0.00001812 level. The recovery can continue as long as buyers remain consistent. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.0000255. However, just a few days ago, Bonk saw some price action above this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by mid-2026. Will Bonk reach $0.000100? Cryptopolitan’s Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.000100 and surpass it by 2028. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to Cryptopolitan’s price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the cryptocurrency, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000292 by the end of 2030, which is quite a bit above its current price. Recent news/opinion on Bonk This month, Bonk aims to achieve its goal of burning 1 trillion BONK tokens by Christmas. The team has encouraged users to contribute to the burning process through specific engagement activities. For example, users can help burn 1,000 BONK tokens simply by posting #LetsBONK on their X platform timeline.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 15:26:38

According to a filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, 8,358 customers at Citizens Bank – which is the 16th-largest bank in the US by total assets – are impacted. The breach is attributed to “insider wrongdoing” believed to have happened on October 23rd of 2023. Citizens Bank says the breach involves highly sensitive customer information. “Information that may have been involved includes your Citizens account number(s), social security number, date of birth, or identification details.” The bank is offering affected customers a two-year membership to an identity theft credit monitoring service. The incident comes two months after the bank suffered a separate security breach. In October, Citizens Bank detailed a data breach that exposed the personal information of approximately 100 customers to an unauthorized party. The Providence, Rhode Island-headquartered bank currently has about $220 billion in total assets, according to the Federal Reserve.

Rumble is the closest competitor to YouTube and is famous for its uncensored content. Rumble will use $250 million of the money to support operations and the remainder to fund a tender offer for up to 70 million shares of its common stock at a price of $7.50, according to a Friday evening press release. That $7.50 is the same price per share Tether is paying for its stake. Tether CEO Paolo Ardonio, through his commented on the investment on X.

YouTube has been censoring content that violates its policy, and some people claim that it rides on the policy to censure voices that are against particular narratives, limiting freedom of speech. So Tether, in a bid to reinforce fundamental values, including freedom of speech and financial freedom, has settled on Rumble, citing that they don’t censor content. Rumble to use part of the investment for funding a self-tender According to Rumble, the partnership won’t interfere with their structures much. Chris Pavlovski, Rumble’s chairman and CEO, will remain in charge of the company as he retains control. Tether’s investment will ensure it owns a minority position in Rumble’s outstanding common stock. The agreement means that Tether has no rights to designate any Rumble board member. Rumble will also use part of the investment to fund a self-tender offer for up to 70 million of Rumble’s common stock. The board of directors also gave a green light to investing excess cash reserves in Bitcoin to the tune of $20 million. Crypto frenzy has risen with the election of the US President, Donald Trump. His clear position in cryptocurrency and his ambitions to establish a Bitcoin reserve are motivating investors. Beyond shareholding arrangements, Tether hopes to carry out meaningful advertisements and enhance its cloud and crypto payment solutions relationship with Rumble. Tether investment to drive Rumble’s next step of growth Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski believes that the partnership with Tether is what they need for their next phase of growth. The platform aims to outdo its competitors by offering alternative and credible avenues for sharing uncensored information. According to Google Finance, the partnership announcement led to a 51.6% surge in Rumbles’ (RUM) share price to $10.90. The deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, is exciting. Rumble may break its ceiling and consolidate users, and Tether will immensely benefit from adverts—a win-win solution. What will be interesting to watch is how Rumble will fare in its competition with YouTube.

Ethena ( ENA ) token retreated to $1.10, down from an intraday high of $1.2240. It has dropped by over 16% from its highest level this month. Data by Nansen shows that Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, moved 7 million tokens worth $8.47 million to Binance. Moving a cryptocurrency from a self-custody wallet is usually a sign that a crypto investor is selling. According to Arkham , Hayes now owns 7.19 million ENA tokens worth over $8.5 million. His other portfolio assets include Ethereum ( ETH ), Wilder World, Pendle ( PENDLE ), and Ethena Staked USDe. Hayes’ selling came a few days after Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance acquired 741,687 ENA tokens valued at $823,000. Ethena has now proposed a deeper collaboration with WLFI , a move that could see sUSDe integrated in the upcoming DeFi platform. The total value locked in Ethena’s ecosystem in the form of USDe stablecoin jumped to over $6 billion for the first time.

This new regulation represents an update to the previous rules governing the industry. Per the new development, all crypto platforms must obtain a license from the body before they can carry out any promotional activities. This includes promotion across TV, radio, social media, and other print media. As part of the requirements, crypto influencers are mandated to disclose any financial benefits they enjoy for promoting a platform or asset. The statement revealed that non-compliance could land perpetrators a 10 million naira fine or up to three years in jail. The new regulation will take effect on June 30, 2025. The new SEC laws have been seen as a needed purge for the crypto industry in Nigeria, removing exploitative practices. Nigeria SEC law on crypto influencers explained According to the document titled “Specific Requirements for Third-Party and Social Media Promotions,” any crypto company that wants to engage the services of influencers must first forward a written letter to the commission. The SEC also said the influencers must adhere strictly to the rules set out, noting that the platform must ensure that the rules are followed. The commission mentioned that the influencers involved must first provide a detailed copy of the agreement letter before it is endorsed. They must also ensure that the products and platforms that they intend to influence have obtained all the needed license from the needed licenses from the commission. Influencers are also mandated to reveal to their followers if they were paid for their services or kit before carrying out the said service. Finally, the SEC said it will continue to monitor promotional activities in the sector to ensure that they are in line with the Commission’s regulations. In the case that any company or influencer is caught in violation of its rules, the SEC said it will sanction the affected parties which will include financial penalties and other sanctions. The commission also promised to carry out a periodic review of its rules to ensure they are in line with global trends, promoting innovation in the industry. Industry experts discuss the Nigeria SEC’s new rule Prominent crypto analysts have discussed the new rule, with most of them giving their honest reviews about its flaws. One such is crypto educator Rume Ophi. According to Ophi, the new laws will ensure integrity in the industry, noting it as a step forward. “Before now, the industry had seen numerous instances of bad actors exploiting the lack of regulation, leading individuals to significant financial losses. Introducing a policy that requires promotions to come from licensed entities will significantly reduce the number of questionable projects being advertised,” Ophi said. According to Ophi, there is always a case of most technology industries being threatened by bad actors, and the crypto industry is not an exception. As such, there is a need to establish the needed laws to check the activities of the people promoting entities and products in the sector. In addition, the SEC Chairman has expressed his gratitude to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his pro-crypto stance and support for the industry. He mentioned that his appointment as the SEC Chair was made possible through the influence of the president. According to the SEC, two crypto firms, Busha and Quidax are the first firms to secure a license of operation in the country, highlighting a new crypto atmosphere in the country. Meanwhile, the government’s perception of crypto remains relatively unknown. While there is a ban on the assets, the country has ranked as one with the highest adoption rate in the continent. However, most of these transactions happen via peer-to-peer, with most banks unwilling to provide their services to crypto platforms citing the government’s orders.

The Funding Rate, which reflects the balance between buyers and sellers, tends to rise when optimism dominates the market. A high Funding Rate usually indicates an increase in long positions as traders expect further price increases. However, Alphractal’s analysis points to an interesting deviation in current market behavior. While the Funding Rate remains high, Bitcoin’s price has begun to fall. The company outlines three possible explanations for this phenomenon: Over-Optimism: A wave of longs entered the market during Bitcoin’s recent price rally, inflating the Funding Rate. However, the lack of sustained buying pressure triggered a price correction. Selling Pressure: Long holders taking profits or strategically entering short positions at high Funding Rate levels may have caused prices to pull back. Short-Term Support: Despite the decline, a positive Funding Rate indicates market confidence. A stabilization or further decline in the Funding Rate could provide clues about a potential shift in sentiment. Related News: Big Bull Michael Saylor Shares Draft to Spark Bitcoin Revolution in the US Alphractal warns that the combination of a persistently high Funding Rate and falling prices could increase the risk of liquidation in the market. Tracking the trajectory of the Funding Rate could be crucial to predicting Bitcoin’s next moves. *This is not investment advice.

Pepe coin shows signs of potential rebound amid market volatility Pepe (PEPE) has experienced notable price fluctuations, currently trading between $0.00002106 and $0.00002779. Over the past week, the coin’s price has decreased by 35.07%, and it’s down 22.21% for the month. However, looking back six months, PEPE has gained 34.55%. Technical indicators show a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 33.01 and a Stochastic value of 18.52, both suggesting that the coin may be oversold. The nearest support level is at $0.00001798, with resistance at $0.00003144. If the price holds above support and gains upward momentum, it could challenge the resistance levels. Market participants are closely monitoring these indicators for potential shifts in the coin’s trajectory. Dogecoin nears oversold territory: Potential for bullish reversal ahead Dogecoin is trading between $0.3588 and $0.4603, consolidating after recent declines. The Relative Strength Index is below 40, approaching oversold levels, hinting at a possible rebound. The price is near the 100-day Simple Moving Average around $0.3701, which may act as support. Breaking the nearest resistance at $0.5145 could propel DOGE toward the next level near $0.6160. Despite a drop of nearly 30% in the past week, Dogecoin has gained over 130% in the last six months. This pullback might be a prime opportunity before a bullish run in the upcoming altcoin season. Conclusion While PEPE and DOGE show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With a 700% ROI potential during its presale, triple utility features, and a mission to unite enthusiasts against crypto villains, Catzilla invites participation to achieve new heights together.

However, he is also involved in controversies over various topics and events. One such controversy connected him to crypto scams, and another is underway for the Beast Games. Beast Games Controversy Over Loan App Collaboration Besides its extravaganza challenges and massive rewards, Mr Beast’s new Amazon series, Beast Games, has become the talk of the town for controversies. The talks begin with candidates suing the Mr Beast and his show for work abuse. However, something big happened as the second episode of the series went live. Along with a fun-filled episode, the program revealed another $4.2M sweepstake opportunity, in which the users need to complete simple steps to earn millions. Although this is an opportunity for people to earn from sitting at home, the Beast’s series collaboration with MoneyLion became concerning. The second episode revealed the steps to enter this opportunity, where people just need to scan the given QR code and create their accounts on the MonyeLion application. Although the guidelines cleared that no deposition or transactions are required, the consumer advocates showed concerns as a larger portion of Beast’s audience is teenagers who can splurge extensively with such unguided applications with high-interest loans. Lauren Saunders, the associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, commented on the situation. She claimed that the sweepstake is just a trap to draw people into debt traps. Offering the sweepstakes and something like that to get the excitement of young people is just a way of drawing people into debt-trap loans that increase overdraft fees and put them behind in their financial goals. Only For Adults, Claims MoneyLion Spokesperson Amid backlash and people targeting the Fintech app, a MoneyLion spokesperson came up front to clear the air on the situation, explaining that the app focuses on assisting people with their financial needs. Additionally, that application is for adults, as only people 18 and above can access the loans, per USA Today interview. MoneyLion’s mission is to give everyone the power to make their best financial decisions and achieve better outcomes. We remain focused on ensuring that our products and services terms are accessible, fair, and designed to create the best outcomes for our customers. Despite that, people’s nervousness persists as the influencer fails to consider the viewer’s concerns. However, Mr Beast is not the only one; the Hawk Tuah girl , another influencer, got in trouble with a Memecoin scam after her launched token crashed, impacting her followers heavily. Things You Should Know About Beast Games Jimmy Donaldson, known as Mr. Beast, has a massive fan following across every age group. Interestingly enough, there are 337M followers on YouTube and millions of others on various other social media platforms, where people enjoy Beast’s massive challenges and events, with hefty rewards. Now, he is expanding his fun act events and challenges from YouTube videos to Amazon Prime with 1,000 contestants and 10 episodes. Similar to any of these challenges, the contestants will go through some very challenging physical and mental situations to earn $5 M, Lamborghinis, and even a private island. Till now, only two episodes have gone live, and a new episode will come every Thursday till Feb 13 at noon EST. Mr Beast has not commented on the Beast Games controversy yet. Regardless, the show is trending in the US and will continue to launch new episodes on set timelines. Bottom Line It has only been a few weeks since the people declared Mr Beast’s role in crypto scams , but the focus is now on Beast Games controversies, an Amazon Prime show hosted by Mr Beast himself. First, candidates sued the host and platform, but now the focus has shifted to shows’ collaboration with MoneyLion, a financial services and loan application. Consumer advocates asserted that promoting such applications to the younger generation puts them at financial risk. Although the Fintech application’s spokesperson clarified that this is only for adults, the concerns still exist. With that, the people are awaiting any possible explanation for this decision.

These playful yet promising tokens are catching attention with their explosive growth potential. Some fresh contenders are already making waves, hinting at gains that could skyrocket beyond imagination just in time for the holiday season. Curious? The details might be surprising.

That’s the DOGEN lifestyle — a realm where winners reign supreme. Those who’re always leveling up and thriving on the next big move, DOGEN is their token.

As the new alpha on the Solana blockchain, DOGEN is poised to outshine big names like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, which have all delivered massive 1000% gains. Currently flying under the radar, DOGEN is on the verge of setting new benchmarks in this bull run. Don’t blink — interested inventors wouldn’t want this opportunity to pass them by.

With a bull run on the horizon, DOGEN holders are destined to lead the charge into a new era of crypto dominance. POPCAT: A new meme coin with market revival potential POPCAT is a meme-based cryptocurrency aiming to attract attention in a slow market. It claims to offer an alternative for users who missed out on previous big gains like BONK. The project presents itself as a fresh opportunity in a space often filled with inactive wallets and failed projects. POPCAT positions itself as a fun, engaging coin while highlighting its potential for significant market growth. Its appeal lies in capturing user interest during uncertain cycles. Whether it stands out or not depends on community backing and market trends. Turbo token: AI-created memecoin with community focus Turbo Token is the first memecoin designed using AI. It was created as an experiment by using GPT-4, aiming to show how artificial intelligence can be applied in cryptocurrency. The coin builds on the popularity of memecoins by combining AI innovation with community-driven value. Turbo Token’s unique origin makes it a standout in the market, particularly for those interested in AI’s role in finance. Its success depends on community adoption and current market conditions. The idea of an AI-created cryptocurrency attracts attention, especially in a market cycle where innovation is emphasized. Turbo Token represents an intersection of technology and culture within the crypto space. Mew: A unique cryptocurrency with a feline focus Mew is a cryptocurrency themed around a cat navigating a market dominated by dog-related coins. It aims to stand out with a distinct identity and engage users through its creative concept. The coin seeks to build its own ecosystem while addressing gaps in the current market of meme coins. Its potential lies in offering differentiation and novelty in an oversaturated meme coin space. Whether Mew is an attractive option depends on market conditions, competition, and development progress. BOME: A memecoin merging culture and decentralized tech BOME, or the Book of Meme, is an experimental project combining memes, blockchain storage, and cryptocurrency trading. It uses decentralized platforms like Arweave, IPFS, and plans to expand to Bitcoin inscriptions for permanent storage. The project aims to preserve and celebrate meme culture through its BOME token on the Solana blockchain. By creating an unstoppable collection of digital content, it explores new possibilities for decentralized social media and online culture. The unique blend of creativity, technology, and community engagement positions the coin as an intriguing concept in the crypto market. Its appeal largely depends on user interest in meme culture and the broader market’s performance. Conclusion POPCAT, TURBO, MEW, and BOME show some promise but may offer limited short-term potential. DOGEN, however, stands out as the ultimate token for those pursuing excellence. With expected 700% growth during the presale and massive returns ahead, it combines luxury, success, and community strength, following the footsteps of past winners like BONK and WIF .

His strategy revolves around creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to boost economic growth, strengthen the US dollar, and open new opportunities in the digital asset market. This proposal coincides with MicroStrategy expanding its Board of Directors, adding three influential figures in crypto and finance. The company, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, currently holds 439,000 Bitcoin worth over $43 billion. Saylor explained his vision on December 20, outlining how an SBR could solve economic challenges and help neutralize national debt. He claims this policy could create a digital asset market worth $10 trillion, driving demand for US Treasuries and encouraging innovation. According to Saylor, this shift could elevate the valuation of the digital economy from $1 trillion to $590 trillion, generating between $16 trillion and $81 trillion in wealth for the US Treasury. He believes this approach would empower businesses, create jobs, and ensure America leads the global digital revolution. “A strong digital asset strategy can boost the US dollar, reduce debt, and unleash massive economic growth,” Saylor stated. However, critics are skeptical of his ambitious claims. Prominent venture capitalist Nic Carter argues that Bitcoin’s volatility and the lack of a clear framework for the SBR could destabilize financial markets. Bitcoin’s recent price drop from $108,000 to $92,000, Carter says, highlights its unreliability as a reserve asset. He also warns that such a move could weaken the dollar’s global dominance instead of enhancing it. “I don’t support this idea, and neither should anyone else,” Carter said. To strengthen its crypto focus, MicroStrategy has appointed three new board members with significant expertise in the field. Brian Brooks, former CEO of Binance US and an experienced crypto regulator, joins the board alongside Jane Dietze, Chief Investment Officer at Brown University, and Gregg Winiarski, Chief Legal Officer at Fanatics Holdings. These members bring a diverse mix of skills in finance, technology, and emerging markets, aligning with MicroStrategy’s broader vision for digital assets. Brooks, known for his leadership roles at Coinbase and BitFury Group, brings invaluable regulatory experience. Dietze has also served on the board of Galaxy Digital, a leading crypto asset management firm. Winiarski offers insights from the digital sports industry, adding another layer of expertise to the board’s strategic direction. While Saylor’s plan aims to position the US as a leader in the digital economy, it remains controversial. Supporters see potential for massive growth and innovation, but critics warn of significant risks due to Bitcoin’s price instability and uncertain regulatory environment. The debate underscores the complex challenges of integrating digital assets into traditional economic systems.",,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-21 16:30:50

Table of Contents DTX Exchange price soars 500%, exciting traders Del Crxpto: The price of Shiba Inu may reach $0.01 Cardano price goes in the red, analyst remains bullish What may the future bring for DTX Exchange, Shiba Inu & Cardano? While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) face challenges in the volatile crypto space, one token is bucking the trend. This token is DTX Exchange (DTX) , a phase six presale sensation that has given early buyers a 500% return. While analysts like Del Crxpto and Sssebi have made bold price predictions for SHIB and ADA, DTX has some advantages over them. Many experts even predict a potential 5x growth for this crypto coin in 2025. You might also like: Last chance to get DTX Exchange before it soars, set to follow ETH, XRP DTX Exchange price soars 500%, exciting traders While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) are in a bearish trend right now, DTX Exchange is only seeing price growth. Those who bought this altcoin early on now see a 500% return. Moreover, since this presale is now in phase six and more stages are left, this percentage will not stop growing soon. DTX Exchange offers something new: participation in the $133T bonds market and many more markets through a hybrid CEX/DEX platform. It will allow traders to use the maximum capability by providing them with 1000x leverage and access to over 120,000 assets (bonds, CFDs, crypto coins, and more). Those who hold the DTX token will get up to 15% APY in staking rewards, governance voting rights, and more. With over $10M raised and 300K users onboarded, the future appears bright for this altcoin. It costs just $0.12, but phase seven of its presale will jump to $0.14. Not only that, a top-tier crypto exchange like Uniswap listing DTX is expected to trigger a rally to $0.20. This could result in a 66% return for all who buy DTX now. Del Crxpto: The price of Shiba Inu may reach $0.01 Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a powerful force in the meme coin space. However, its price performance has not been so good recently. CoinMarketCap shows that the Shiba Inu price fell nearly 20% in the past 30 days. During that time, its value moved between $0.000024 and around $0.000020. However, crypto analyst Del Crxpto remains optimistic for Shiba Inu. In a recent X post, he told his followers that the $0.01 dream for this meme coin could come true. This Shiba Inu price prediction has excited many traders in the market. Nevertheless, the Shiba Inu market cap of over $10B may slow its growth. This high market cap means that the Shiba Inu coin will need a lot of new money for its price to skyrocket. On the other hand, crypto coins like DTX will not face this issue. Cardano price goes in the red, analyst remains bullish Cardano (ADA) is another altcoin showing some red price charts. On the one-week chart, the price of Cardano has sunk from around $1 to below $0.80. In other words, nearly a 25% drop as per CoinMarketCap. Market expert Sssebi, however, is still bullish on this altcoin. According to his X post, he will not be selling Cardano. He also announced he is waiting for the 10x surge that will come after this dip in his Cardano price prediction. Although the Cardano crypto may see a price gain soon, other experts think it may not be so big. This crypto coin has seen a YTD price increase of nearly 40%, which may have been its highest upswing. Therefore, some investors are turning to DTX Exchange instead. What may the future bring for DTX Exchange, Shiba Inu & Cardano? While Shiba Inu and Cardano face challenges, they could rebound soon as they have strong community backing. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange is demonstrating what real-world utility and creativity can bring. With a surge of over 500% so far, experts are very bullish about it. Its ties to the growing $133T bonds market could also give it long-term stability. Therefore, they forecast a potential 5x surge for this crypto coin in 2025. For more information, visit the DTX Excha n ge presale website and join the online community.

The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies dropped from over $3.7 trillion to $3.37 trillion. The rebound is likely due to the US’s encouraging Personal Consumption Expenditure report. The headline PCE, the Federal Reserve’s favorite inflation gauge, softened from 0.2% in October to 0.1% in November. Core PCE dropped from 0.3% to 0.1%, a sign that inflation in urban and rural areas was slowing. American stocks also reacted positively to the PCE report on Friday, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 indices rising by over 1.18%, 1.10%, and 0.85%, respectively. These numbers came a few days after a hawkish Fed decision triggered a sell-off in risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. The bank slashed rates by 0.25%, bringing the yearly cuts to one percent, and hinted that it would deliver two more cuts in 2024. The last meeting’s dot plot pointed to four cuts. The Fed justified its hawkish view to the stubbornly high inflation. Recent data showed that the headline Consumer Price Index rose to 2.7%, while the core CPI remained at 3.3%. The bank also suspects that some of President-elect Donald Trump’s policies (i.e., tariffs) will be inflationary. You might also like: Meme coins crash: why are Brett, PNUT, Popcat falling? Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Pepe rise could be a dead cat bounce Meme coins like Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Bonk also likely jumped as crypto investors bought the dip after they dropped for three consecutive days. A potential risk for the ongoing rebound is that this could be a dead cat bounce. A DCB is a situation where falling asset prices stage a brief rebound and then resume the downward trend. For example, Shiba Inu dropped by 15% on Dec. 9 and by 1% on the following day. It then formed a DCB by rising by 6% on Dec. 11 and then resumed its downtrend, reaching a low of $0.00001855 on Dec. 20. Shiba Inu price has formed dead cat bounces in the past | Source: crypto.news The other potential risk for these coins, especially Shiba Inu, is that some of them have formed a head and shoulders chart pattern. An H&S pattern is a popular bearish reversal sign made up of a head, two shoulders, and a neckline, which is at $0.00002280. That is a sign that the coin may continue the downtrend.

The PI price could potentially 3x before the year 2024 concludes, supported by strengthening technical indicators and the market recovery. However, rising volatility remains a critical factor to monitor closely. The recent bullish rally highlights growing investor confidence, suggesting Pi Network might continue its upward momentum in the coming months. Will Pi Network Price 3x By End of December? The Pi Network price is currently hovering above $48, recording a notable surge within the past 24-hours, fueled by growing excitement around its forthcoming mainnet launch. This milestone transition, set for December 31, 2024, could potentially redefine the project’s trajectory and expand its utility. Since its inception in 2019, Pi Network has attracted significant attention for its unique approach to cryptocurrency mining and community-driven growth. The shift from testnet to mainnet marks a pivotal development, enabling users to migrate their Pi coins to a fully operational blockchain. With the mainnet’s launch, the ecosystem aims to unlock complete functionality, paving the way for real-world transactions and token trading. The move could solidify Pi Network’s place among notable blockchain projects. The broader crypto market recovery , highlighted by Bitcoin hovering above $97,000, has added to the bullish sentiment. As Pi Network prepares to unveil its open mainnet, market analysts speculate its price could triple, bolstering optimism among investors and users alike. PI Price Gains Momentum, Eyes Key Resistance Levels The PI price has experienced notable movement, reflecting growing market interest. As of the latest data, the token is trading at $47.43, marking a 4.52% increase on the day. Analysts are closely monitoring the token’s trajectory within its established ascending channel. The chart highlights a critical resistance at the $67 level, which has historically acted as a turning area for the token. Breaking this level could propel the price further into bullish territory. However, failure to sustain momentum might lead to a pullback toward the channel’s midline. The histogram of MACD is seen to go upward insignificantly which is signal for a cautious optimism. Yet the RSI is neutral 47.89 implying that the tape could still trend higher or cast a pause. The upper boundary of the ascending channel near $184 is being eyed as a potential long term target of market participants. Levels above this would mean a 254.80% rally from current prices. Support on the flipside comes in near $44, just above the channel’s lower boundary. This trend indicates strong market activity as traders weigh the token’s potential in the coming months.

Whales Purchase 250 Million DOGE However, the post on X noted that this substantial accumulation occurred during the recent market dip, which followed Jerome Powell’s anti-crypto stance, as reported by CoinPedia.

According to CoinMarketCap, the meme coin has surged over 25% in the past 48 hours. It is currently trading near $0.32, with an 8% increase in the past 24 hours. Despite this notable gain, long-term holders appear to be continuously accumulating the token, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm CoinGlass . Data from DOGE’s spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $519.19 million worth of DOGE in the past 7 days. The outflow is an on-chain metric that indicates the withdrawal of assets from exchanges to long-term holders’ wallets. This potentially signals upside momentum and suggests an ideal buying opportunity. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, the meme coin is currently facing strong resistance near the $0.346 level. Based on recent price action, if DOGE breaches this resistance and closes a daily candle above $0.36, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 25%, reaching the next resistance level at $0.44 in the near future.

Rexas Finance (RXS), Avalanche (AVAX), Polkadot (DOT), and Sui (SUI) are four remarkable crypto projects that will bring massive returns for early adopters. Here is why these cryptocurrencies deserve a position in your portfolio. Crypto Whales Purchased RXS Token Rexas Finance (RXS): A New Era for Tokenization Rexas Finance has attracted much attention in the crypto circle because it aims to tokenize real assets. This ERC-20 token enables people to undertake fractional ownership of real estate, fine art, and precious metals, thereby opening doors to iconic markets they could not previously access. The presale of Rexas Finance is ongoing, with more than 352 million tokens sold, which has already seen the project raise over $29 million. The pulse of the presale success indicates the belief that exists in the project. RXS tokens are currently valued at $0.15, and investors seeking to take advantage of the project are now presented with the best entry-priced token. The Rexas platform has numerous features, including the Rexas Token Builder, which allows users to create custom tokens, Rexas Launchpad—a decentralized project funding platform—and the Rexas Treasury, which ensures financial stability. Such characteristics guarantee that Rexas Finance is a versatile tool and a platform for the future. Community engagement is what differentiates Rexas Finance from its rival projects. Early adopters are eligible to participate in the giveaway program and claim a slice of its $1 million fund; there will be 20 winners who will each get $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. Also, the project has been fully audited by Certik; hence, the ecosystem is reliable and secure. In early 2025, Rexas Finance will be available on all major exchanges at a rate of $0.20. To join the presale, visit the Rexas Finance website and simply connect your wallet and buy RXS tokens with Ethereum or USDT. Avalanche (AVAX): Best Platform for NFTs and DeFi Avalanche is an eco-friendly blockchain project taking its place alongside the most developed crypto networks in the world. It has quick and cheap transactions, which is why DeFi and NFT projects like to utilize this blockchain. Currently valued at $50.54 with a market cap of $20.7 billion, AVAX looks promising to increase. Owing to the growth of blockchain technology, the space is rich with possibilities and innovation. Due to its distinct consensus mechanism, Avalanche is a fierce competitor with its ability to conduct thousands of transactions every second. The ever-increasing popularity of DeFi and NFT markets will definitely push Avalanche in the adjacency of each other, boosting its price range further. Polkadot (DOT): Makes Blockchain Networks Interconnected Polkadot is a multi-chain network designed to allow the connection between other networks. The ability to join more than one network allows developers to build more powerful decentralized applications that operate more efficiently than conventional apps. Polkadot has a market cap of $13,507,879, which makes them an established player with a price of $9.06. There has been good interest and investment in its parachain auctions, which allow developers to rent a space on its network. Now, with the joining of hundreds of projects on the Polkadot network, additional projects will elevate its value and return plenty to early investors. Youtube AI Predicts $RXS Will Hit $7 by 2025: Ethereum Whales Are Bullish on Rexas Finance (RXS) Sui (SUI): Revolutionizing the Scalability Needs for Blockchains Sui (SUI) is a highly scalable and pace-efficient blockchain. Its sophisticated design allows it to manage intricate experiments effectively; hence, it is fit for decentralized apps as well as gaming projects. Sui is trading at $4.61 with a market capitalization of $13.48 billion. Its groundbreaking design permits it to execute transactions concurrently, resulting in higher efficacy and cost cuts. Since the need for effective and scalable blockchain solutions is evolving, Sui will be in the right place to provide value for investors. Conclusion The altcoin market will garner considerable attraction and funds with a rise in BTC prices to almost $120,000. Rexas Finance is at the top for top places due to its new tokenization approach and excellent features. Backed by Polkadot's interoperability, Sui's performance-based design, and Avalanche's scalability, these coins are good for a portfolio. Analysts suggest these four coins are ideal for someone wishing to multiply $100 within as little time as possible. Rexas Finance being the forerunner, it is best to emphasize portfolio diversification to get hefty returns.

Bitcoin’s ecosystem is experiencing waves of doubt. According to fresh data from analytics company Santiment, there has been a decline of more than 211,000 non-empty Bitcoin addresses in three weeks alone, which has sparked the interest of observers in the market. Such a steep drop in active addresses has been observed to be succeeded by price recoveries, and market observers are keenly watching. Market Uncertainty Dampens Bitcoin Activity Bitcoin is quite accustomed to fluctuations and exacerbations that occur during significant events. Nevertheless, weeks after the US elections have caused turbulence in both traditional and crypto markets in the past. Given the controversies concerning policy focus, funding, and additional changes, some Bitcoin traders seem to be reinforcing their bets. Santiment data reports that Bitcoin active addresses have dropped to 54.38 million, which is associated with increased fear among owners. This change highlights the “fear, uncertainty, and doubt” (FUD) that often coincides with election cycles, causing shifts in investor behavior. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1853513818833666063 Bitcoin’s price movement has echoed these market jitters, dropping under $95,000 before bouncing back above $97,500. With volatility evident in the market, some traders are bracing for more fluctuations while keeping a close watch on Bitcoin’s next move. IntoTheBlock’s data also highlight a shift in the strategy of long-term Bitcoin holders. Unlike previous cycles, where volatile markets often see seasoned investors exit en masse, this cycle appears to show a tempered response. Long-term holders adjust their positions at a moderate pace, suggesting a desire to reduce exposure while keeping skin in the game. This shift reflects an evolving investor sentiment, where caution is balanced by confidence in Bitcoin’s longer-term potential. Bitcoin Holders Balance, Source: IntoTheBlock Bitcoin’s history shows that declines in non-empty addresses, especially during uncertain periods, can often foreshadow a bounce once tensions ease. Santiment notes that previous downturns in active addresses were followed by recovery phases, fueled by renewed buying interest once selling pressure subsided. If the broader market clears its current uncertainty this week, we could see a similar bullish rebound for Bitcoin—one that might propel its price past key resistance levels. Other Crypto Assets Display Mixed Signals Santiment’s analysis also points to contrasting trends in other crypto assets. USDC, the popular stablecoin, witnessed an 11,600-wallet drop in a single day, indicating a similar pullback in stablecoin interest. Meanwhile, Dogecoin bucked the trend with a surge of 46,400 new wallets in just one week, reflecting fresh speculative interest in meme coins. These shifts hint at a market in flux, with investors selectively choosing where to park funds during this politically charged period. In the coming days, Bitcoin’s performance may serve as an indicator of broader market sentiment. If history repeats itself, this drop in wallet activity could be the precursor to a renewed price push, transforming today’s FUD into tomorrow’s gains.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-21 16:47:35

Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the price has been gradually rising over the last few weeks, creating a new record high above the $100K mark. However, in the past few days, the market has failed to continue its bullish momentum, falling below $100K and even dropping to as low as $92,000. If the market fails to reclaim this area soon, a deeper correction toward the $90K level and even the $80K support zone could be expected in the short term. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour timeframe, the price action looks a bit more tricky to anticipate. The market has been making higher highs and lows inside an ascending channel but has been rejected from the higher boundary of the channel around the $108K mark. The $100K level has consequently been broken to the downside, and the RSI is also showing values below 50%, which indicates that market momentum has shifted to bearish. Yet, the lower trendline still holds, which could lead to a quick recovery above the $100K level and a bullish continuation. However, if the pattern is broken to the downside, a drop below the $90K level could be expected. Source: TradingView On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Active Addresses (100-Day MA) Analyzing on-chain metrics can yield valuable and interesting information about the underlying market dynamics. One of these key metrics that can offer insight beyond the price action is the active addresses metric. Bitcoin’s network activity is one of the fundamental factors that can help in BTC valuation. The chart shows that the 100-day moving average of active addresses has been recovering rapidly during the recent uptrend and breakout above the $70K zone.

With the crypto ecosystem trading at a very high premium, exchanges require high liquidity to meet growing demands. Of its findings, CryptoQuant singles out Binance and OKX as platforms to watch out for. What Makes Binance Stand Out from Centralized Exchanges? According to CryptoQuant, it analyzed the leverage levels of top centralized exchanges. It conducted this exercise to evaluate their liquidity, default risk and how crypto reserves backs trading activity. The analysis also employs leverage ratio calculation to estimate trader’s exposures. Based on this, the analytics firm singled out Binance as an exchange with robust reserves. The trading platform maintains this reserve despite the significant growth in open interest this year. This is signficant, considering how Binance Futures list new tokens to fuel this expansion including Solana’s Fartcoin . “Its reserves in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT comfortably exceed its open interest. Binance also reported the lowest and most stable leverage ratio among major exchanges, with a ratio of 12.8 in December 2023, rising slightly to 13.5 in December 2024,” the CryptoQaunt report reads. As pointed out, this stability and the 2.6x expansion in Bitcoin open interest on the platform from $4.45 billion to $11.64 billion implies that the exchange can handle unexpected liquidations.

Centralized Exchanges and Avoiding the FTX Saga In addition to the Binance spotlight, CryptoQuant also mentioned Gate io, Bybit, and Deribit. However, the report noted that these trading platforms have the highest leverage ratios in the market pegged at 106, 86, and 32, respectively. Notably, this figures show open interests for Bitcoin and Ethereum is higher than the existing reserves available on these centralized exchanges. The analysis concluded by flagging the impact of high leverage trading, one of the major causes of the FTX Derivatives Exchange collapse. This report serves as an eye opener that can help traders manage risk per platforms they trade on. Meanwhile, FTX is at the tail end of its bankruptcy proceedings.

However, the cryptocurrency has now reached a significant support zone, where a rebound followed by consolidation is anticipated. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ethereum’s $4K price region has proven to be a critical resistance zone over the past year, consistently halting bullish advances due to strong selling pressure. Most recently, the price faced another rejection at this level, triggering a significant sell-off. This decline was further fueled by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s remarks, suggesting the central bank might pause its current policy of lowering key interest rates. Despite this setback, ETH has found support at the $3K level, a crucial price zone, leading to a rebound above the $3.5K threshold. Currently, the cryptocurrency is consolidating within the $3.5K–$4K range, with expectations of a potential bullish attempt to retest the $4K resistance following this consolidation phase. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum’s rejection at the $4K resistance triggered a sharp decline, breaking below the ascending wedge pattern—a clear indication of sellers’ dominance. This bearish momentum pushed the price lower, leading to a pullback before resuming its downtrend. At present, Ethereum is trading within a significant support zone, defined by the 0.5 ($3.2K)–0.618 ($3K) Fibonacci retracement levels. This is expected to provide stability in the short to mid-term, with the likelihood of continued consolidation and minor retracements. If this support holds, buyers may re-enter the market, setting the stage for another attempt to challenge the $4K resistance. Source: TradingView Onchain Analysis By Shayan Ethereum’s failure to reclaim the $4K threshold triggered significant liquidations in the futures market, followed by a flash crash that appears to have substantially cooled the broader sentiment. The chart illustrates the funding rates metric, a reliable indicator of futures market sentiment. While Ethereum’s aggregate funding rates saw a sharp spike last week, the rejection at $4K led to substantial liquidations, bringing funding rates back to levels conducive to a bullish trend. This cooling effect could pave the way for a more sustainable rally in the coming weeks. A similar pattern was observed in January 2024 when a sharp decline in funding rates calmed the futures market, setting the stage for Ethereum’s next major impulsive rally. This historical precedent suggests that the current market reset could mark the beginning of another bullish phase.

However, the unexpected turn of events is pushing other strong altcoins to dominate the start of altseason, which analysts predict for Q1 2025.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK.

The suspects, who included 148 Chinese, 40 Filipinos, and several other foreign nationals, were caught during a surprise raid at an imposing seven-story structure known as Big Leaf in the affluent Victoria Island neighborhood. Sophisticated Scam Network Unveiled According to information shared by the agency, the operation followed intelligence reports, which indicated that Big Leaf was a hub for fraudulent activities targeting victims around the globe. Investigations revealed a highly organized network where foreign operatives collaborated with local accomplices to swindle unwitting individuals through romance and investment hoaxes. The Nigerian recruits, chosen for their proficiency with computers, were reportedly trained for at least two weeks on how to impersonate foreign women and engage victims in romantic and business conversations. They then created fake profiles on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram, and Telegram, which they used to lure targets to invest in bogus crypto schemes hosted on a platform called Yooto[.]com. The website required users to pay an activation fee starting from $35, with promises of high returns. Per investigators, after the Nigerians initiated contact with potential victims and built their confidence, they handed over communication to the foreign operatives who then executed the scams. This division of labor ensured that the local accomplices were kept in the dark about the full extent of the criminal enterprise. During their inquiries, authorities found at least 500 SIM cards and high-end computers on the premises, which were presumably used to maintain anonymity and target individuals primarily from North America and Europe. Further, they stated that the Nigerian recruits received cash payments for their part in the con, with no documentation, helping to obscure the identity of the operation’s masterminds, who remain at large. The agency is working with international partners to uncover the full extent of the scheme and any connections it may have to organized crime networks. Large-Scale Crypto Fraud Schemes Crypto scams have been on the rise recently, with a study by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) revealing that Australians had lost nearly $270 million to fake investments. Elsewhere, South Korean law enforcement apprehended 215 people accused of perpetrating a $232 million crypto rip-off. Among those arrested was a popular YouTuber with more than 600,000 followers who allegedly ran a phony investment consulting firm pushing a purported digital asset product promising 20-fold returns. Also, in October, Hong Kong police dismantled a huge cross-border fraud operation that used deepfakes to lure men into deceptive crypto investments. Like in the Nigerian case, the Hong Kong group, consisting of at least 27 individuals, operated from a building in the city’s Hung Hom area. Upon raiding the facility, authorities recovered computers, mobile phones, and about $25,000 in suspected criminal proceeds.

Despite the widespread sentiment, XRP holds key support levels, which could see it resume an uptrend. XRP was trading at $2.24 at the time of writing after a 0.6% dip in the last 24 hours. Analyst Brett on X notes that XRP’s price movements have seen the coin break out of a symmetrical triangle pattern. If the bulls continue to dominate the price movement, XRP will likely continue to soar, with the next key levels to watch being between $3.62 and $4.3 per analyst. A rally beyond this breakout point could see XRP aiming for $5.73. XRP Price Hints at a Possible Bullish Divergence XRP’s technical indicators are currently showing a bullish divergence. Amid the recent drop in price, some traders took advantage of the low prices to accumulate more. The Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) line has sharply moved north and crossed above the signal line. This hints at possible gains ahead if bulls continue to overpower bears. However, the RSI is at 46, showing that sellers still have the upper hand and are inhibiting the price action. For the uptrend to resume, buying pressure needs to build up. The Awesome Oscillator also proves the bullish divergence. The AO histogram bars have flipped positive but remain in negative territory. The indicator shows that while XRP shows signs of a reversal, more buyers are needed to confirm the uptrend. Traders should also watch out for the crucial support level at $2.2 A slip below it could stir panic and cause XRP to drop lower. Data from Whale Alert shows that many XRP tokens from the Ripple ecosystem have been on the move. The transfers have stirred uncertainty, and whales are preparing to sell. Per Whale Alert, a well-known whale has just moved $11M worth of XRP to the Bitstamp exchange.

By bringing liquidity to illiquid markets, this new asset management approach is accessible to people worldwide. The more investors realize the potential of tokenization, the higher demand is expected for the RXS token, which will heighten its price.

Rexas Finance’s disruptive business model will interest people looking to invest in untapped markets. As it gets more adoption, the value of the RXS token is predicted to follow up, and many predict that 2025 can break $15.

Rexas Finance Presale Stages Sell Out Quickly The first nine stages of the presale for Rexas Finance have all sold out quickly. At $0.15 in the current presale stage, with 42.5% of total tokens allocated to public participation, RXS looks like a solid investment opportunity.

To this end, this approach has shown to be successful in generating attention for the project and investors who want to ride the ship of growth in this RXS token. To spark further interest in Rexas Finance, the team created an extremely successful giveaway campaign with a $1 million giveaway, which has been gaining traction from over 381,000 active participants. This campaign rewards the token holders, the promotional task completers, and the people that they refer. The giveaways encourage people and make them viral marketing, and the project gets awareness about itself. This has seen Rexas Finance set a community-driven momentum that can push RXS token up to its $15 target in no time.

However, the focus is shifting to a rising star Lightchain AI (LCAI). With whales accumulating this presale token priced at just $0.003, many are wondering if LCAI could overshadow the gains of TON and SOL. Let’s explore what’s driving the hype and the potential for these tokens to break records in the near future. You might also like: How Lightchain AI’s roadmap is winning over Solana enthusiasts Toncoin aiming for new heights Toncoin (TON) the home token of Telegram Open Network has been getting a lot of speed due to its easy joining with the Telegram message app. As Telegr͏am keeps growing its blockchain world TON is getting more and more useful. A big reason for this rise is the growth of its system. With TON’s joining in Telegram wallets, more than 700 million folks can simply send and get cryptocurrency, really helping adoption. Also, the TON chain is spreading its use by starting DeFi tools and NFT shops, widening its charm. Body interest is also doing a big part, with more looks from backers helping to steady TON’s cost moves and adding to its far-off chances. While Toncoin’s path to a new peak has some bumps, its special spot in the Telegram world makes it a strong player to see. Solana recovering for a bullish breakout Solana (SOL) , known for its high-speed transactions and minimal fees, has experienced a volatile year but is now showing signs of recovery. As its ecosystem continues to expand, investors are increasingly optimistic about SOL reclaiming its former glory. Solana is gaining traction in NFTs, gaming, and DeFi, with several high-profile projects launching on its blockchain, fueling its growing ecosystem. Recent network upgrades have also addressed concerns about downtime, improving stability and boosting investor confidence. Additionally, Solana’s partnerships with web3 gaming and decentralized payment platforms position it as a leader in creativity. With its focus on speed and scalability, Solana is poised as a strong contender for a breakout rally, particularly as the broader market trends upward. Lightchain AI, the whale magnet While Toncoin and Solana gear up for potential breakouts, Lightchain AI is swooping in like the hero of a blockbuster presale. At just $0.003, LCAI is turning heads with its game-changing marriage of blockchain and AI. Why Are Whales Falling for LCAI? Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) – Forget basic dApps — LCAI’s AIVM lets developers unleash AI-powered dApps that could disrupt industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. Think Skynet… but friendly. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) – Mining? So last decade. LCAI rewards nodes for meaningful AI computations, creating a network that actually does something useful. Who said blockchains can’t multitask? Scalable and Sustainable Design – With privacy-preserving tech and federated learning, LCAI is built for businesses looking to play it big. Enterprise-ready? Check. Intriguing to institutional investors? Double check. Deflationary Tokenomics – A piece of every transaction gets burned, making LCAI more scarce—and potentially more valuable — over time. Scarcity meets savvy. LCAI price prediction Analysts are calling it 15,000% gains by 2025. That’s right, LCAI may just go from underdog to market MVP faster than the next big thing. Don’t blink, or you’ll miss the rocket. Comparing the Potential TON, SOL, and LCAI Toncoin is emerging as a strong contender for a new all-time high, thanks to its integration with Telegram and its growing utility. Solana is also positioned for a bullish breakout as its ecosystem continues to expand and its network stability improves. However, the standout option for exponential growth is Lightchain AI . With its unique blend of AI integration, scalability, and an attractive low entry price, LCAI presents a compelling opportunity. While TON and SOL boast established use cases and robust ecosystems, LCAI’s innovative approach to combining AI and blockchain technology sets it apart as a potential game-changer in the market. A new leader in the making? As Toncoin and Solana work to reclaim their all-time highs, Lightchain AI is emerging as a leading force in the crypto market. Its presale price of $0.003 and unique features make it a whale magnet, positioning it as a potential leader in the next crypto bull run. For investors looking to diversify, TON and SOL remain strong contenders, but LCAI offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for exponential growth.

Coutts says on the social media platform X that the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector could go up by between 4x and 5x as a result of the traditional finance (TradFi) sector entering the space. Amid the massive growth, Coutts predicts that some DeFi protocols could outperform Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ). He also sees the start of an entanglement between DeFi and TradFi next year. “Big Trends For 2025 1. TradFi starts catching up – expect CEX (centralized exchange) acquisitions and more crypto integrations (Robinhood/Arbitrum) 2. Several CEXs file and list on TradFi exchanges. 3. Several CEXs build out their own DEX platforms (L2s) or multichain integrations 4. RWA (real-world asset) pumps the sector valuations as financial asset tokenization ramps up (esp stocks and fixed income) 5. TradFi growth investors start adding crypto sleeves – DeFi sector a priority because they can be modeled on cashflows 6. DeFi sector goes up by a 4-5x. Several protocols outperform ETH/SOL/BTC.” Coutts adds the numbers show that crypto is quickly gaining ground against the more established TradFi industry. “This is wild. Crypto is eating TradFi’s lunch. 1. Coinbase: 11% of global exchange revenue, ranked 5th, ahead of Nasdaq. 2. DEXs (decentralized exchanges): 5%, outranking HKEX (The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong) and CBOE. 3. Total CEX revenue could hit parity with TradFi in 2024. 4. CEX and DEXs are growing 2.5-4x faster than TradFi. 5. DEXs are some of the most ‘profitable’ applications in the world. 6. If you value the CEX sector on Coinbase’s P/S (price to sales) multiple: total market cap would be $749 billion vs TradFi’s $610 billion.” At time of writing, the total DeFi market cap stands at $152.616 billion.

With innovative technologies and rapid growth potential, these emerging coins could deliver returns that surpass those of Bitcoin by 2025. This article delves into five promising cryptocurrencies that might redefine investment strategies in the coming years. CYBRO’s 260% Jump After Gate.io and MEXC Listings Signals Massive Rally Ahead CYBRO is taking the crypto world by storm. Fresh off its launch on Gate.io and MEXC, the token’s price shot up from $0.06 to $0.16 in just 24 hours—a whopping 260% gain. The trading volume hit an impressive $15 million at its peak. This explosive debut is backed by CYBRO’s solid fundamentals and the buzz it built before the launch. During its presale, CYBRO raised $7 million and attracted almost 20,000 early investors, showing strong market interest even before going public. 🚀 Still Early—Massive Potential Ahead Despite this incredible rally, $CYBRO is still at a low price point, leaving room for higher highs. In the medium term, the token could add more 500-600% to its value, depending on broader crypto market conditions and adoption within its ecosystem. In the most optimistic scenario, $CYBRO could surge 1100%. Grab the Undevalued Gem Now Before It Surges 1100% What Makes CYBRO Special? CYBRO is a multichain DeFi platform that uses AI to optimize earnings. Whether you’re new to DeFi or a seasoned pro, CYBRO makes investing easier and more effective. Here are the privileges for $CYBRO holders: Earn by Staking: Lock up your CYBRO and earn passive income Airdrops & Rewards: Get cashback and loyalty bonuses just for being part of the community Shape the Future: With just 100 CYBRO tokens, you can join the CYBRO DAO and vote on key decisions Save on Fees: CYBRO holders enjoy reduced transaction costs Community-Driven Vision and Ambitious Roadmap CYBRO is staying true to its promise to early investors and already delivering real results. Looking ahead, the team is gearing up to roll out new AI features, open more vaults, and develop additional one-click strategies to streamline DeFi investing. Combined with its strong launch performance and ambitious roadmap, CYBRO is shaping up to be a leader in decentralized finance. Join CYBRO Now Before the Next Big Jump Solana's SOL: A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a foundation for decentralized applications, competing with Ethereum and Cardano. Solana stands out with its design that aims for faster transactions. Developers can build on it using multiple programming languages. SOL is Solana's native cryptocurrency. It is central to the ecosystem. It facilitates transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The SOL coin holds value because it underpins the operation of Solana's network. It rewards participants and allows users access to a suite of projects on Solana. Unlike some platforms, Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions. It aims to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network. Avalanche (AVAX): Layer-1 Blockchain with Customizable Subnets Avalanche (AVAX) is a Layer-1 blockchain known for its eco-friendly approach, low fees, and efficient transactions. It can process up to 4,500 transactions per second and allows users to launch customizable subnets. Avalanche uses a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto consensus principles, achieving transaction finality in less than 2 seconds. The platform consists of 3 interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—which facilitate various operations like transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, serving important roles in the ecosystem such as transaction fees, network security through staking, and enabling the creation of custom tokens and blockchains. Exploring Polkadot: Connecting Blockchains for Seamless Interoperability Polkadot is a decentralized protocol that lets different blockchains communicate securely. It enables value and data to be shared between networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without the need for intermediaries. By using parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin or Ethereum. The DOT token is at the heart of this network, used for governance and staking. This allows holders to participate in the development of the protocol and help verify transactions. Developed by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and supported by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot aims to make blockchains more interconnected and efficient. Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL): Powering the Polygon Network The Polygon Ecosystem Token, or POL, is a utility token central to the Polygon network. It enables various functions within the ecosystem. Holders can stake their tokens to help secure the network and earn additional POL in return. This involves locking up tokens and participating in the network's consensus. POL also grants voting rights, allowing holders to influence decisions about the network's development. Additionally, the token provides access to exclusive services and features within the Polygon ecosystem. As the network expands with more services and applications, POL plays a key role due to its wide range of uses. Conclusion While coins like SOL, AVAX, DOT, and POL show potential, their short-term growth may be limited. In contrast, CYBRO offers investors exceptional opportunities to boost their earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With benefits such as high staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO delivers a superior user experience with easy deposits and withdrawals. Focusing on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO emerges as a promising project attracting strong interest from crypto whales and influencers.

It also features DCA/TWAP strategies for automated trading over time, a Bridge Comparator to evaluate cross-chain transfer options, and Perpetuals Trading for accessing derivatives markets. Jupiter's developments aim to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of DeFi services on Solana. Ondo Finance Tokenizes Real-World Assets on Blockchain Ondo Finance blends traditional finance with blockchain by tokenizing stable, income-generating real-world assets. This approach opens access to high-grade financial products, using blockchain to improve financial infrastructure and accessibility. Ondo has an asset management arm that creates tokenized financial products, and a technology arm that develops DeFi protocols to enhance functionality and scalability.

This upgrade improves ADA delegation, paving the way for the Cardano Constitution referendum and solidifying its position among altcoins to dominate in the 2025 bull run. The update introduces the ability to delegate voting power to Delegated Representatives (DReps), further strengthening Cardano’s governance framework. Additionally, Daedalus v7.0.0 offers automatic voting options, such as “abstain” or “no confidence,” allowing seamless community participation. In the past eight days, ADA experienced a 3% pump as the token price climbed from $0.98 to $1.01. Analysts predict ADA could reach $3 by January 2025. Hedera Takes the Lead: Chainlink Integration Fuels HBAR’s Rise Hedera recently announced that its mainnet now includes Chainlink Data Feeds and Proof of Reserve. This will allow for secure DeFi and tokenized real-world asset applications and equip developers to create tamper-proof and reliable dApps within its ecosystem. With increased network activity and enterprise-grade credibility, HBAR is well-positioned among altcoins to dominate the anticipated 2025 bull run. As HBAR sees more use in transaction fees and staking, demand is expected to rise, solidifying Hedera's position as a dominant force in the RWA ecosystem. In the last two days, HBAR gained 7%, rising from $0.27 to $0.29, and analysts are forecasting a potential price of $0.70 by January 2025. INTL Leads the Top Altcoins to Dominate the Market in 2025 According to experts, INTL, SUI, ADA, and HBAR are the top four altcoins to dominate and shape the future of the crypto market thanks to their unique characteristics, robust communities, and cutting-edge technologies, setting the stage for the 2025 bull run. INTL is now available for purchase in Stage 8 of its public presale, priced at $0.073 per token, with projections indicating a launch price of $0.110. This offers investors a potential 50% ROI. Having already raised over $4.9 million in its presale, analysts anticipate that this AI coin could deliver a 100x gain post-launch, positioning it as one of the altcoins to dominate the market in the future.

At the same time, a lesser-known token, DOGEN, has shocked the market with an eye-popping 5,000% surge. These contrasting developments have left investors questioning what’s next for both assets in an already unpredictable market. DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump’s Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk’s moon mission soon? DOGEN, the boldest meme coin for alpha males, is gearing up for take-off as Trump's victory in the recent US election has the entire market euphoric about the prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins. Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump’s love for crypto is no secret — he’s promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign. And joining him is none other than Elon Musk, the ultimate Dogecoin (DOGE) fan who’s backed the crypto movement and even aligned with Republicans earlier this year. With these two icons fueling the fire, meme coins are set for a wild ride! DOGE Soars 130% in Just One Week! DOGEN will be the Next Star with 500% Surge Following the US election results, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been on a steady rise: from $0.15 to $0.39 in just one week. DOGEN follows the same upward trend, starting at $0.0003 and now trading at $0.0013, a staggering 333% leap.

Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Chainlink and the Potential of LINK Token in Blockchain Networks Chainlink is a system that connects blockchains to real-world data and applications. It enables smart contracts to use external data securely and accurately. This is done through oracles, which fetch and verify external information for blockchains. Chainlink works with both on-chain and off-chain components to handle data efficiently. The LINK token plays a key role in the network. It rewards those who run nodes, supports staking for security, and is used as payment for services. The technology has strong potential, especially as the need for reliable data in blockchain grows. LINK's appeal depends on market conditions and demand for decentralized applications needing real-world data. Conclusion LINK and other coins show slower short-term potential, while DOGEN stands out with its luxury-driven appeal and high growth expectations. Designed for achievers, DOGEN targets a 700% rise by the presale's end and boasts massive long-term possibilities. Inspired by past successes, DOGEN is set to foster a strong community focused on excellence and unique advantages for early supporters.

Developers reveal key details,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/whats-new-for-ciri-in-the-witcher-4/,"The Witcher 4 developers CD Projekt Red have announced changes to Ciri’s abilities. Her teleportation powers and ability to zip around will be drastically toned down or completely removed. Ciri will have new strengths in The Witcher 4. This includes full access to Trial of the Grasses potions and even more advanced magic combat abilities than Geralt’s signs. In an interview with GamesRadar , executive producer Małgorzata Mitręga discussed new adjustments to Ciri’s skills. “If you’re asking me whether we want to raise the bar again, the answer is yes,” said Małgorzata Mitręga. However, she acknowledged she had a challenge in matching the level of Ciri’s invincibility at the end of The Witcher 3, including her abilities in the new game’s trailer. Mitręga hinted that “something totally happened in between,” referring to the changes. The developers wanted The Witcher 4 to have an original story but also related to the lore of the books and the lore of the other games. Mitręga said this was one of the first challenges they solved in development, allowing them to base an interesting story around Ciri’s role as the protagonist. The Witcher 4 trailer shows Ciri using a spell called “Bolt” With her upbringing by Geralt, she will now be faster and far more agile, but her combat style will be dominated by advanced magic. One example that is shown in the trailer unveiled at the Game Awards is the spell “Bolt.” It is much better than Geralt’s signs and seems to go beyond anything Geralt is capable of. Mitręga pointed out that Ciri’s changes make her more different from a witcher-like character. Games director Sebastian Kalemba previously told Eurogamer that Ciri’s depowering is explained logically throughout the story. After keeping the details under wraps, Kalemba said that the team worked hard to give the fans a clear and satisfying explanation of the full story when it launches. These changes may ease fans’ fears about Ciri’s abilities in The Witcher 2. Her teleporting was flashy yet still too easy. Ciri’s spacetime powers have been lost throughout the entire series. Lore enthusiasts have been speculating the reason behind it. Some think she had willingly given them up, or they disappeared after the defeat of the White Frost. Therefore, the adjustments seem to ensure that The Witcher 4 will be a more balanced and fun take on Ciri.

Solana Platform and SOL Coin Overview Solana is a blockchain focused on high-speed transactions and decentralized apps. It uses unique architecture to scale without relying on sharding or extra layers. Solana supports development in several programming languages, making it appealing for developers. Its native coin, SOL, powers this ecosystem by processing transactions, running programs, and rewarding contributors. SOL also gives users access to various projects on the network. The platform’s ability to handle heavy activity positions it as a competitor to Ethereum and Cardano. Its efficiency in handling tasks and flexible environment make it a strong contender in the blockchain space. Whether SOL fits the current market depends on its adoption by developers, investors, and projects built within the network. Avalanche (AVAX): Efficient Blockchain with Custom Subnet Capability Avalanche is a scalable blockchain designed for fast and low-cost transactions. It processes up to 4,500 transactions per second with finality achieved in under 2 seconds. The network uses three chains (X-Chain, C-Chain, P-Chain) to optimize tasks like smart contracts and token transfers. Users can create tailored Subnets for specific applications. AVAX, the native token, is used for fees, staking, and maintaining network security. Its eco-friendly setup and diverse functionality make Avalanche appealing. The ability to create customizable networks could attract developers and projects. AVAX may stand out due to its strong utility and technological innovation, offering potential value depending on market trends and demand. Polkadot (DOT): A Protocol for Blockchain Interconnectivity Polkadot is a decentralized network enabling different blockchains to share data and value. It uses parachains to improve transaction processing speed and scalability compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is central to the system, supporting governance and staking, where users can help secure the network and influence its development. Created by Gavin Wood and launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot supports a vision of interconnected blockchains working together efficiently. Its ability to link blockchains gives it strong potential in the crypto space. DOT’s attractiveness depends on market conditions and its continued adoption within blockchain projects seeking interoperability. Polygon: Enhancing Ethereum with Low-Cost, Fast Transactions Polygon is a layer two solution for Ethereum, designed for faster and cheaper transactions. It allows users to bridge their assets to access various decentralized apps. POL, its native token, is used for fees, staking, and governance. Polygon uses proof-of-stake, where validators and delegators secure the network and earn rewards. The platform’s low fees and high efficiency support DeFi protocols and applications, scaling Ethereum’s ecosystem. Its adaptability and cost-effectiveness continue to draw attention in the market. Conclusion SOL, AVAX, DOT, and POL show steady long-term promise but offer limited short-term gains. In contrast, DOGEN stands out as the ultimate choice for high returns and exclusivity. With a bold community of leaders, unique perks, and an impressive presale growth forecast, DOGEN presents a rare opportunity to dominate this altcoin season and redefine success.

In its Quarterly Banking Profile report, the FDIC says the number of US lenders on its “Problem Bank List” rose to 68 in Q3. The figure represents the fifth quarterly increase in the number of banks receiving a rating of 4 or 5 on the CAMELS rating system since Q2 of 2023. A lender with a CAMELS rating of 4 indicates that the firm is experiencing financial, operational or managerial weaknesses – or a combination of such issues – that could reasonably threaten its soundness if unresolved. Meanwhile, a bank with a 5 score on the CAMELS system suggests it is critically falling short in one or more areas and requires abrupt remedial attention. “Total assets held by problem banks rose $3.9 billion to $87.3 billion. Problem banks represent 1.5 percent of total banks, which is within the normal range of 1 to 2 percent of all banks during non-crisis periods” Source: FDIC Meanwhile, the amount of unrealized losses on banks’ balance sheets has dropped. The FDIC says banks are burdened with $364 billion in paper losses as of the third quarter of this year, largely due to exposure to the residential real estate and Treasury markets. Unrealized losses represent the difference between the price banks paid for securities and the current market value of those assets. The banks’ paper losses declined in the third quarter by $148.9 billion from $512.9 billion reported in Q2. However, FDIC Chair Martin J. Gruenberg says the decrease in banks’ paper losses last quarter is only temporary. According to Gruenberg, changes in longer-term interest rates since the end of Q3 indicate that US banks are likely now holding unrealized losses at closer to half a trillion dollars. “Increases in longer-term interest rates since the end of the third quarter would likely reverse most of these improvements in unrealized losses if measured today.” While Gruenberg reiterates the resilience of the banking industry, the FDIC chair notes that a handful of headwinds continue to threaten US lenders. “The industry still faces significant downside risks from the continued effects of inflation, volatility in market interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. These issues could cause credit quality, earnings and liquidity challenges for the industry. In addition, weakness in certain loan portfolios, particularly office properties, credit cards, auto and multifamily housing loans, continues to warrant close monitoring. These issues will remain matters of ongoing supervisory attention by the FDIC.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The technology behind Sui has the potential to support the widespread use of blockchain applications. Its focus on scalability and user experience could attract developers and users alike. In the current market cycle, where scalability and ease of use are important factors, Sui is a platform to consider. Its approach to solving blockchain challenges positions it as a notable player in the blockchain space. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum blockchain as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie. The project aims to capitalize on the popularity of meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, positioning itself among the top meme-based cryptocurrencies. PEPE appeals to the cryptocurrency community through a no-tax policy and straightforward approach, embracing its identity purely as a memecoin without utility. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced a significant surge, with its market capitalization reaching up to $1.6 billion. This rapid growth attracted a strong community of followers and sparked interest in other memecoins, leading to increased market activity. The PEPE roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and plans for broader recognition through a “meme takeover.” Its performance reflects the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, and it continues to draw attention in the current market cycle.

Table of Contents Solana’s rise and the crypto market dynamics Rexas Finance changing real-world asset tokenization Presale success and token details Conclusion The crypto market has witnessed jaw-dropping returns, but few compare to Solana’s meteoric rise in 2021.

Now, a new contender, Rexas Finance (RXS) , is poised to replicate that performance, offering a unique opportunity for early investors. Currently priced at $0.15 in its tenth presale stage, RXS promises exponential growth by targeting real-world asset tokenization, a sector ripe for disruption. Crypto whales purchased RXS token Solana’s rise and the crypto market dynamics In early 2021, Solana began its journey with a market cap of $1 billion, supported by only 50 projects and a total value locked (TVL) of $150 million. Its appeal lay in high-speed, low-cost transactions that attracted developers and projects across decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and gaming. By December 2021, Solana’s market cap skyrocketed to $78 billion, with over 300 projects and $15 billion in TVL. This remarkable ascent, driven by strategic infrastructure and ecosystem development, turned early investments into unprecedented returns. Rexas Finance changing real-world asset tokenization Rexas Finance is spearheading the integration of blockchain with real-world assets (RWAs), creating a seamless bridge for investors worldwide. The platform enables tokenization of assets like real estate, commodities, and collectibles, unlocking new possibilities for fractional ownership and global accessibility.

The platform’s Rexas Token Builder empowers users to tokenize any real-world asset, simplifying the process and democratizing access. This tool allows individuals and businesses to convert physical assets into digital tokens, making them tradable and accessible to global markets. Rexas Finance’s launchpad offers a venue for innovators to raise funds for tokenized assets, fostering growth in this burgeoning market.

With such comprehensive solutions, Rexas Finance is reshaping the investment landscape. Presale success and token details Rexas Finance’s presale highlights its growing demand among investors. Stages 1 to 9 sold out quickly, raising $26,375,000. Now in its tenth stage, the presale price of RXS has climbed fivefold to $0.15 per token. Early participants are already positioned for significant gains, with a 1.33x return expected at launch. The total amount raised stands at $29,006,305, reflecting strong investor confidence. RXS, an ERC-20 token, has a capped supply of 1 billion tokens, allocated as follows: Presale: 42.5% Staking Pool: 22.5% Liquidity: 15% Treasury: 10% Marketing: 3% Team: 3% Giveaway and Partnerships: 4% Notably, Rexas Finance chose a public presale over venture capital funding to democratize access, allowing everyday investors to participate in its growth. Its listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko further enhances its credibility, boosting visibility among millions of users globally. Moreover, Rexas Finance’s CertiK audit underscores its commitment to security, ensuring robust smart contract performance and investor trust. With plans to launch on three Tier-1 exchanges, RXS is primed for broader adoption and liquidity. The $1 million giveaway adds to the excitement, with 20 winners set to receive $50,000 each by completing simple steps and referrals.

These four Altcoin to Hold stand out with potential for significant growth before 2025. Backed by promising fundamentals, they are strong contenders for a surge during the anticipated bull market. Altcoins to Hold: XRP XRP price has surged by 100% over the past month, reaching $2.24 during a strong market rally. Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which appears close to a favourable resolution, has significantly boosted investor confidence. Market bulls are defending the $2.05–$2.20 support range, a key area attracting substantial buyer interest. Analysts suggest a break above $2.60 could lead to more upside momentum, with $3.00 as the next psychological target. XRP continues to shine as one of the top altcoins to hold before 2025. Source: X DexBoss (DEBO) DexBoss (DEBO) , selling for $0.01 in its presale, is drawing attention from cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This memecoin stands out by combining humor with blockchain-based utility. Unlike typical short-lived memecoins, DexBoss offers a robust ecosystem featuring decentralized token swaps, staking opportunities, and exclusive NFT releases. Its unique approach appeals to both speculative investors and long-term holders. DexBoss’s foundation of blockchain technology positions it as more than a fleeting trend. The coin’s diverse features make it an intriguing option for those seeking innovation and potential in the cryptocurrency market. Sui (SUI) Sui (SUI) price has risen to $4.59, marking a 2% surge and highlighting its growing market appeal. The Layer 1 blockchain platform is gaining recognition for delivering fast, private, and secure digital asset management making it altcoin to buy. Known for its efficiency, Sui has seen a steady rise in Total Value Locked (TVL). Analysts view this momentum as a sign of investor confidence ahead of the anticipated 2025 altcoin season. With its innovative smart contract solutions, Sui continues positioning itself as a top contender among altcoins in the competitive blockchain ecosystem. Source- DefiLIama Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE), a prominent meme-based cryptocurrency, recently recorded a significant price surge despite slight market corrections. The DOGE price has climbed 250% over the past year, trading at $0.332 at the time of writing. This remarkable growth underscores its rising popularity among investors and its appeal as a potential altcoin to hold before the anticipated 2025 alt season. Notably, whale transactions involving Dogecoin have spiked, reflecting heightened activity among large holders. In late October, transactions exceeding $100,000 saw a sharp increase. This trend signals growing whale interest, which could further influence market dynamics and fuel continued momentum for DOGE’s price trajectory.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 18:03:00

While established tokens like Cronos (CRO) and Toncoin (TON) have gained traction, a new contender, FXGuys , is emerging as a game-changer. With its innovative ecosystem, lucrative staking rewards, and growing adoption, FXGuys’ $FXG token presents an opportunity for CRO and TON holders to turn a modest $100 investment into $10,000. Here’s what makes FXGuys stand out and why it’s being recognized as the best defi token and a leading Top PropFi Project . >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 1. FXGuys: Combining Real Utility With Profit Opportunities FXGuys differentiates itself from traditional crypto projects by offering real-world utility through its Trader Funding Program and Trade2Earn platform. This program allows traders to access up to $500,000 in trading capital after passing a simple evaluation process. For CRO and TON holders, investing in the $FXG token means not only gaining exposure to price appreciation but also tapping into FXGuys’ growing revenue streams. The unique blend of trading infrastructure and DeFi utility positions FXGuys as a top defi coin with exponential growth potential. 2. Staking Rewards: A Passive Income Powerhouse One of the biggest draws for investors is FXGuys’ robust staking mechanism. Holders of the $FXG token can stake their assets to earn double-digit annual percentage yields (APYs) while participating in revenue-sharing from FXGuys’ broker activity. Staking provides a reliable passive income stream, making FXGuys an attractive option for investors who value consistent returns. As staking participation increases, the token supply becomes scarcer, potentially driving up the value of $FXG over time. For Cronos and Toncoin holders looking to diversify their portfolios, FXGuys offers the opportunity to grow their investments steadily while enjoying passive income. 3. The Power of Early Adoption FXGuys is still in its early stages, making it a prime opportunity for investors to enter before mainstream adoption drives the price higher. Early adopters of projects like Solana and Avalanche witnessed staggering returns, and FXGuys could follow a similar trajectory. The best proprietary trading firms are revolutionizing the trading world, and FXGuys is leading the charge with its seamless integration of trading solutions and DeFi rewards. With the token price currently at a fraction of its potential, even a $100 investment could yield exponential returns as the ecosystem grows. 4.

By aligning the interests of traders, investors, and developers, FXGuys fosters a sustainable and thriving platform.

Half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the supply, raising SHIB’s profile.
