Early investors could see pennies transform into millions – so don’t miss your shot at crypto glory! Pepe Pepe (PEPE) has seen significant price changes over the past six months, rising by 67.15%. In contrast, the past week showed a drop of 24.02%, and over the past month, it decreased by 6.85%. The current price ranges between $0.00002 and $0.00002779, reflecting recent market volatility. The coin is nearing its nearest support level at $0.000018, which is about 25% below the current price. Falling below this could lead to the next support at $0.00001126, a further drop. On the upside, if demand increases, Pepe could reach the nearest resistance at $0.00003144, about 31% higher. Breaking past this could aim for the second resistance at $0.00003818, nearly 59% above the current price. Technical indicators suggest a possible rebound. The RSI is at 30.42, close to oversold, indicating the price may rise. The Stochastic indicator at 32.86 points to similar potential. The 10-day moving average is $0.00001929, below the 100-day average of $0.00002261, showing a recent downtrend. If momentum builds, the price could move above these averages. The negative MACD level could shift to positive, signaling upward momentum. Dogecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced notable price changes recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 12.87%, settling within a range of $0.36 to $0.46. The past month saw a smaller decline of 2.80%. Despite these short-term drops, Dogecoin has surged by 189.72% over the last six months, showing significant long-term growth. Technical indicators reveal mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.21, nearing oversold territory, which might suggest a potential price rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.36, while the 100-day SMA is slightly higher at $0.39, indicating a short-term downward trend. The MACD level stands at -0.00808, reflecting recent bearish momentum. Looking ahead, Dogecoin’s nearest support level is $0.31. If the price falls below this, the next support is at $0.21. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is $0.51. Breaking through this could lead to the next resistance at $0.62. Overcoming these resistance levels could result in price increases exceeding 10% to 20%. Given its substantial six-month growth, Dogecoin may have the potential for further gains if market conditions become favorable. Conclusion While PEPE and DOGE are notable, XYZ unites sports fans and meme culture, aiming for 20,000% growth and positioning itself as the next G.O.A.T of memecoins.

This comes after the case had been referred to the Commission by an Italian competition authority in September asking if the proposed acquisition would not result in competition concerns in the European Economic Area (EEA). EU gave thumps up to the Nvidia transaction After some rigorous screening, the EU said it approved the proposed acquisition of the Israeli startup saying it did so unconditionally, adding the transaction would raise no competition concerns in the EEA. According to a Reuters article , the EU’s probe into the deal focused on activities that could strengthen Nvidia’s control over GPUs, sought-after chips that could divide and process computer tasks. The EU, however, concluded that the deal would not raise any such concerns in the EEA. Nvidia designs and supplies GPUs for data center applications, while the Israeli startup – Run:ai is a supplier of GPU orchestration software that enables corporate clients to manage their compute infrastructure. “Since Nvidia is a leading producer of key hardware for AI applications used in the EU and beyond, it was important to carefully check whether its acquisition of start-up software company Run:ai may have negatively impacted competition in critical markets which are key for future competitiveness,” said Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for clean, just and competitive transition at the European Commission, in a statement. “But our market investigation confirmed to us that other software options compatible with Nvidia’s hardware will remain available in the market.” Ribera. The statement also emphasized that the two companies’ areas of activity do not overlap, while the EU Commission on the other hand has the authority to oversee mergers and acquisitions of large multinational corporations operating in the EU countries. The EU has scrutinized other big techs apart from Nvidia Nvidia announced the acquisition of the Israeli startup in April in a deal worth $700 million, a price tag that was to be reviewed by the bloc following requests by Italian regulators under the EU Merger Regulation (EUMR). When announcing its plans, Nvidia said the deal would help customers make more efficient use of their computing resources. “Run:ai enables enterprise customers to manage and optimize their compute infrastructure, whether on-premises, in the cloud or in hybrid environments,” Nvidia said in an April 24 blog post. Run:ai co-founder and CEO Omri Geller revealed the startup has collaborated with Nvidia since 2020, adding that both companies “share a passion for helping our customers make the most of their infrastructure.” However, regarding the proposed acquisition, the EU Commission revealed in October that Nvidia would need to get approvals and antitrust clearance for the transaction due to the raised concerns that the deal would undermine competition within the sectors in which the two companies operate. Responding to the EU’s concerns then, Nvidia spokesperson John Rizzo said back then that the company was willing to provide any information to regulators regarding the deal. “After the acquisition closes, we’ll continue to make AI available in every cloud and enterprise, and help customers select any system and software solution that works best for them.” Nvidia. These developments also come as the big tech industry has for years enjoyed minimal oversight on the takeover of smaller rival firms prompting regulators to pay more attention to these to ensure fair competition. Firms like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have also been scrutinized over their investments in AI startups or other tech firms as they expand their AI operations and stay ahead of peers. The EU has probed the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI as well as others like Google and Samsung.

Powered by blockchain and AI, this innovative low cap altcoin aims to transform property investment while offering substantial returns. With projections of significant growth by Q2 2025, the anticipation is growing. But what sets this altcoin apart, and why do the Solana expert believe it could deliver exceptional ROI? Let’s find out the key factors driving the excitement. Why Solana Expert Sets His Sight on this Low Cap Altcoin A Solana expert who turned an initial investment into millions during Solana’s rise from $0.50 to nearly $260 now sees similar potential in a low cap altcoin. Driven by high-speed transactions and low fees, Solana’s success has established itself as a blockchain powerhouse for decentralized apps and has become a benchmark. This expert predicts a new altcoin will deliver exceptional ROI by Q2 2025, driven by Solana’s market growth and trends now evident with this low cap altcoin. The focus is identifying transformative opportunities that mirror Solana’s exponential growth and real-world impact on the cryptocurrency market. PropiChain is Transforming Real Estate with Outstanding Blockchain Investment Features PropiChain is an RWA altcoin reshaping the real estate investment landscape by combining blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and the Metaverse to create a revolutionary platform for buying, selling, and managing property. Its unique features set it apart from traditional property investment methods, and it has started to generate significant attention in the industry. Real estate tokenization is one of the key innovations of this low cap altcoin. This process enables investors to buy digital tokens representing fractional real estate asset ownership. For instance, an investor with as little as $500 can own a share of a high-value property, earning rental income relative to their investment. This makes real estate investment accessible to a broader audience, from small individual investors to seasoned professionals looking to expand their portfolios. Another standout feature is PropiChain altcoin AI-powered predictive analytics tools. These tools provide users real-time data on market trends, property values, rental yields, and occupancy rates. For example, an investor considering a luxury rental property can access detailed insights about its financial performance, helping them make well-informed decisions. This AI-driven approach reduces the risks traditionally associated with property investments and maximizes potential returns. This altcoin also integrates Metaverse technology, allowing users to take virtual tours of properties from anywhere in the world. This feature adds convenience and opens up new investment opportunities by allowing investors to explore properties remotely. Smart contracts are central to this altcoin’s operations, automating key processes like rental payments and fund distribution. This eliminates the need for middlemen, streamlines transactions, and reduces administrative costs. This low cap altcoin blockchain ensures security and transparency in every transaction, preventing fraud and title disputes. With these innovative features, this low cap altcoin addresses the challenges of the real estate market while creating new opportunities for global investors. The Future of Real Estate Investment: A High-ROI Opportunity in a Low Cap Altcoin As Solana traders and crypto enthusiasts shift their attention to this low cap altcoin, PropiChain’s potential for massive growth becomes undeniable. With a projected 50,000% ROI by Q2 2025, altcoin is carving its path in property investment. Its innovative features stand apart from speculative altcoins. Having raised over $1 million in presale, PropiChain is poised for success, with tokens currently priced at $0.011 in stage 2. With a BlockAudit security audit ensuring the altcoin’s safety and a CoinMarketCap listing on the horizon, confidence in PropiChain continues to build. Early investment in this low cap altcoin could prove highly rewarding, particularly for those securing tokens at presale prices. For example, an investment of $800 at the presale price of $0.011 could acquire approximately 72,727 tokens. With projections of 50,000% growth, this investment could see a return of over $400,000 by Q2 2025. Now is the time to copy the Solana expert. Early adopters can gain a significant advantage as PropiChain moves closer to its full launch. Join a community of forward-thinking investors and secure your place in the future of blockchain-powered real estate investment.

This development is significant considering current market dynamics with massive price decline in the last 48 hours. Despite the rapid price decrease, investors have remained unwilling to sell. Low Bitcoin Liquidity and Rising Demand Hints at Looming Storm According to CryptoQuant , an on-chain analysis firm, the cumulative volume of Bitcoin readily available for sale, referred to as sell-side liquidity inventory, is low. Based on the figures, the current sell-side liquidity inventory is at a level last seen in October 2020. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that only 3.397 million BTCs are available for sale across different platforms. These include exchanges, miners, OTC desks, and GBTC. In 2024 alone, sell-side liquidity has dropped by 678,000 BTC. The shrinking supply will impact possible selling pressure and create a tighter market demand. This could lead to a price rally if it continues as demand surges. Will Accumulator Trigger Supply Shock? Meanwhile, Bitcoin demand has grown steadily since late September. Figures show Bitcoin has been growing at 228,000 BTC per month. Additionally, accumulator addresses- wallets that consistently buy Bitcoin but have never sold- are also strengthening their holdings. These addresses have increased their monthly accumulation to a record level of 495,000 BTC. Notably, accumulators are reckoned with in Bitcoin as they contribute to the liquidity crunch. This is because they lock BTC away from circulation. Market observers say their activities contributed to the recent all-time high (ATH) of $108,000 BTC attained this December. Market Chaos and the Path Forward On December 20, 2024, massive liquidation hit the crypto market as over $1 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated within 24 hours. Bitcoin price plunged to a low of $92,281, leaving many investors concerned about the next price trajectory of the asset. The market soon rebounded as BTC resumed its climb and found support at the $95,000 level. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $97,028. Market volume remains up by 8.09% at $116.76 billion. Analysts say this hints at the confidence among some investors who might be buying the dip , anticipating that the coin could reclaim its position above the $100,000 level .

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) says it’s suing the three banking giants and Zelle’s parent firm for allegedly failing to protect people from widespread fraud on the popular payments network. The lawsuit, which has been anticipated for months, alleges hundreds of thousands of the banks’ customers filed fraud complaints and were largely denied assistance, with some being told to contact the fraudsters directly to get their money back. “Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo also allegedly failed to properly investigate complaints or provide consumers with legally required reimbursement for fraud and errors. The CFPB is seeking to stop the alleged unlawful practices, secure redress and penalties, and obtain other relief.” The CFPB alleges widespread consumer losses and security failures on the part of the banks, stating the lenders limited identity verification measures, allowed repeat offenders to hop between banks, ignored red flag warnings from customers and abandoned customers after fraud occurred. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra says the banks, which co-own Zelle, rushed to launch the platform without properly addressing security concerns. “The nation’s largest banks felt threatened by competing payment apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle. By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fend for themselves.” Zelle says it’s fully prepared to defend itself in court. “The CFPB’s attacks on Zelle are legally and factually flawed, and the timing of this lawsuit appears to be driven by political factors unrelated to Zelle. Zelle leads the fight against scams and fraud and has industry-leading reimbursement policies that go above and beyond the law.” JPMorgan Chase has previously said it may sue the CFPB over the Zelle investigation, stating the agency is going “above and beyond what the law requires.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The company announced this in a December 20 post on X, adding that the repayment will be made from exercising its 12th series stock acquisition rights. Details of the 5th Series Ordinary Bonds In a separate post , Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said the money accrued from the offering will be used to push forward the buying of BTC initially planned for 2025 to before the end of 2024. “These funds will accelerate Bitcoin purchases originally planned for 2025 into the current year.” The bond issuance consists of ¥5 billion in total, divided into units of ¥250 million each. The offering will carry no interest and be redeemed at face value, with each bond worth 100 yen per 100 yen principal amount. The scheduled issuance date is December 20, 2024, with the maturity date set for June 16, 2025. The entire security will be allocated to EVO FUND, a private investment entity, and will be subject to redemption provisions. Further, the bonds can be redeemed early if EVO FUND gives written notice at least one business day in advance or if funds from the exercise of the Tokyo-listed firm’s 12th series stock acquisition rights reach a specified threshold. This development follows Metaplanet’s announcement on December 17, 2024, of a separate ¥4.5 billion ($28.7 million) bond issuance that will also mature on June 16, 2025. It means that in just a few days, the company has raised a total of ¥9.5 billion, or about $60.6 million. Bitcoin-Centred Approach Metaplanet’s Bitcoin-centred approach aligns with its strategic focus on adopting the asset as a hedge against economic instability. In June 2024, it acquired 23.351 BTC for approximately $1.6 million, followed by 42.4 BTC for $2.4 million, bringing its total holdings to 203.7 BTC. The company continued to increase its holdings, purchasing 57.273 BTC for $3.4 million and 106.976 BTC worth $6.6 million in October. Additionally, it made a significant purchase of 156.7 BTC in October, valued at $10.4 million. In addition to its buying strategy, the Japanese investment firm recently established a new Bitcoin treasury operations business line. This division will focus on purchasing, holding, and managing the cryptocurrency through various financial instruments, including loans, equity issuances, and convertible bonds. According to BitcoinTreasuries data, as of December 20, 2024, the outfit holds 1,142 BTC, valued at approximately $109.6 million.

The Trump-Vance inaugural committee reportedly confirmed it, and it’s the largest crypto contribution they got. The fund, which has already hit over $200 million, will fuel a three-day bash celebrating Trump’s win and VP-elect JD Vance. Coinbase and Kraken each pledged $1 million, while MoonPay chipped in too, though they haven’t shared how much. Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi told FOX Business said: “For the first time, we have a President who truly understands the potential of disruptive technology and embraces the crypto sector. We’re excited to continue to work with President-Elect Trump and his administration to push for long-overdue regulatory clarity and unlock this next wave of innovation.” Setting new records The inaugural committee has already smashed fundraising records. They’ve blown past the $107 million raised for Trump’s first inauguration in 2017 and Biden’s $62 million in 2021. Insiders say the total could hit $225 million by Inauguration Day. Major names in tech and crypto, like Jesse Powell from Kraken and Marc Andreessen from Andreessen Horowitz, are also on board. They see Trump as a leader who understands blockchain’s potential and are betting he’ll make policies that encourage innovation. The president has already proven that he meant everything he said during his campaign. The Trump administration is stacked. Former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, known for being an early Bitcoin believer, will take over from Gary Gensler as SEC Chair. He is expected to ease up on crypto regulations. David Sacks is also joining as the first crypto and AI czar. He’ll work on bridging the gap between regulators and the crypto industry while leading the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Other pro-crypto picks include Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary and Howard Lutnick as Commerce Secretary, both strong supporters of blockchain. Ripple’s moment and XRP’s rise This spotlight on Ripple brings XRP (XRP) back into focus. The token has had a strong year after its legal battle with the SEC ended in a win. A court ruled that XRP isn’t a security, restoring confidence in the token and pushing its price higher. As of press time, it is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, trading at about $2.30—up nearly 500% since the legal win. Analysts are watching resistance at $2.58, with targets of $2.92 and $4.50, while support levels sit at $2.35 and $1.96. Ripple also just launched RLUSD, its dollar-pegged stablecoin, on December 16. Approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services, it’s available on both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger.

During the Dec. 18 episode of the Open Interest show on Bloomberg Television, Saylor voiced his willingness to provide his advice on the digital assets policy to President-elect Donald Trump, either publicly or confidently, if he is asked to do so. Before expressing his willingness to advise Trump on the crypto policy, Saylor admitted that he had already met “with a lot of people” in the incoming administration but declined to specify the personalities nor mentioned if he already met Trump. Is Saylor fit for a position? Since the 2020s, Michael Saylor has been one of the key Bitcoin advocates and investors. Saylor is one who puts money where his mouth is, as he personally spent around one billion dollars on BTC. In 2020, Saylor took to X (Twitter at the time) to announce that he personally owns 17,732 bitcoins and that he acquired these coins before MicroStrategy (MSTR) made the first massive purchase of bitcoins. YahooFinance! reports that currently MicroStrategy owns around 440,000 BTC, which is close to a 2% share of the entire BTC supply. MicroStrategy made headlines on the eve of the latest BTC price peak when the company was included in the Nasdaq 100 index. Read more: MicroStrategy to join Nasdaq-100 Index following Bitcoin-driven stock surge Michael Saylor names Bitcoin an apex property of the human race and has an insatiable thirst for bitcoins. He compares Bitcoin to the territories like Manhattan or Alaska that were bought by the early colonist administration, specifying that Bitcoin is rather a kind of cyberspace. That’s why MicroStrategy aims to own bitcoins in bulk. According to Saylor, buying as much of this “space” as possible is crucial for the United States. This vision speaks to the statement posted by Donald Trump on the Truth Social platform. “We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!” the post reads . Saylor singled out Trump as the most crypto-friendly Republican politician. It seems that Saylor shares the President-elect’s views on Bitcoin. Although not an outright GOP supporter, in September, Saylor made claims that he sees Republicans as a more progressive party when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation. He names regulation pressure decrease, treating crypto as a tool to boost the U.S. economy, and encouraging individuals to pursue their economic aims using digital finance as progressive characteristics of the Republican approach to the crypto industry. What Do We Know About the Crypto Advisory Council? Trump proposed the creation of a crypto advisory council during his now famous speech at the Nashville cryptocurrency conference in July 2024. As of December, not much information about the preparations of this council has been made public. The participating companies’ lineup is not clear yet. However, it has been reported that such brands as Coinbase, Ripple Labs, Paradigm, and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) are seeking interactions with the incoming administration. Allegedly, an a16z rep was involved in advising the Trump team during the presidential campaign. On December 6, Trump introduced entrepreneur and venture capitalist David O. Sacks as the “White House A.I. and Crypto Czar” via the Truth Social post. It’s worth saying that, to say the least, before 2024, Trump wasn’t an avid crypto enthusiast. In the past , the President-elect made a series of anti-crypto remarks, calling Bitcoin “not money” and saying that the value of cryptocurrencies is based on thin air. However, the 2024 Presidential campaign saw a drastic change in Trump’s stance on crypto. He started to take donations in digital currencies, visited a major crypto conference in Nashville where he promised to make America “a crypto capital of the world,” and made several important proposals concerning the cryptocurrency policy. On top of tax cuts for the U.S. cryptocurrency companies, the removal of Gary Gensler from the SEC, and the creation of the strategic Bitcoin reserve, Trump announced the creation of the advisory body with the leading position granted to the richest man on Earth and his passionate supporter Elon Musk. This unofficial agency is called The Department of Government Efficiency, or simply DOGE, a reference to a legendary memecoin, a notorious soft place of a Tesla CEO .

The broader market is still bearing the brunt of Bitcoin’s crash, worrying both investors and speculators. Related Reading: SUI The Rising Star: Analyst Foresees Over $25 Breakthrough Market Overview: A Sudden Change The recent drop in the value of crypto assets has caused around $787 million to be lost through liquidations of different types of digital assets. Dogecoin, which is often considered as a joke, has been among the hardest hit. Approximately $29 million in DOGE liquidations were recorded recently, with bullish positions suffering the most losses, according to CoinGlass data. In a mere 24 hours, the price of Dogecoin plummeted to a low of $0.34 before ultimately stabilizing at approximately $0.365, a 6.05% decline. Macroeconomic issues influencing more general market movements can help to explain this fall. The Federal Reserve’s concern about interest rate cuts has aggravated bearish attitude. For example, Ethereum and Dogecoin followed suit after Bitcoin’s value dropped to the $94k level. A Closer Examination Of Liquidation Issues Approximately $24 million in bullish wagers on Dogecoin were liquidated in the past 24 hours, while $5.93 million in losses were attributed to short positions. The market’s present extreme volatility is underscored by this wave of liquidations. Dogecoin is currently approaching critical support levels, as noted by analysts. Some analysts have speculated that it could fall below $0.20 if adverse momentum persists. Key support levels for DOGE are being closely monitored by market analysts. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that Dogecoin may be oversold, which could indicate a potential rebound if traders are able to effectively defend the critical price zones. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Growth In 2025 With Record $173 Million Q3 Funding—Report The Road Ahead For Dogecoin Despite the present challenges, market watchers’ future expectations of Dogecoin remain high. Some analysts believe that DOGE’s capacity to maintain a weekly closing above $0.26 will help to create a recovery rally toward higher goals. Still, the reality of continuous market pressures and unpredictability helps to temper this hope. As they negotiate this stormy terrain, many traders are left wondering how low Dogecoin might fall before it finds solid ground. Given the expected significant price swings in the next days and weeks, all eyes will be on this famous meme coin as it tries to recuperate in the face of a difficult crypto climate.

Two days ago, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Binance, added support for Usual Protocol ( USUAL ). “Binance is excited to announce that Usual (USUAL) will be added to Binance Simple Earn, Buy Crypto, Binance Convert, Binance Margin, Binance Auto-Invest, and Binance Futures at the respective dates and timings listed below.” According to a post on the social media platform X from Usual in response to the Binance listing, the team says the protocol aims to usher in a “stablecoin renaissance”. “9 0% for the Community: Usual is built to empower, with the majority of tokens for users. No VC (venture capital)/Team Dumps: Just 10% allocated to insiders, cliffed for one year. 100% Revenue for the DAO (decentralized autonomous organization): Every $ of revenue belongs to USUAL holders” According to the Usual Protocol’s website , USUAL acts as a governance token performing two major functions: “1. Usual is a multi-chain infrastructure that aggregates the growing tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) from entities like BlackRock, Ondo, Mountain Protocol, M0 or Hashnote to transform them into a permissionless, on-chain verifiable, and composable stablecoin (USD0). 2. Usual is built around the redistribution of power and ownership to users & third parties, akin to a scenario where Tether’s TVL providers would own the company and the associated revenues.” USUAL is going for $1.43 at time of writing, up 17% on the day.

Ripple is contributing $5 million in its native XRP token, while Kraken has donated $1 million to the Trump-Vance inaugural committee managing the celebrations. Ripple and Kraken Pledge $6M For Donald Trump Inauguration According to a report by FOX Business , Ripple and Kraken are among the cryptocurrency firms contributing to the record-breaking $200 million inaugural fund. The contributions aim to support the three-day celebration marking the swearing-in of Donald Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance on January 20, 2025. Ripple’s $5 million donation will be made in its native XRP token. This reflects the XRP company’s commitment to advancing its presence in the political landscape. Similarly, Kraken, a top crypto exchange , has contributed $1 million in support of the inaugural events. This marks the first time many crypto companies have participated in funding a presidential inauguration. Additionally, President-elect Donald Trump has acted quickly to deliver on his campaign promises to support the cryptocurrency industry. Trump recently nominated Paul Atkins , known for his crypto-friendly stance, as the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Concurrently, David Sacks has been appointed as the first-ever crypto and AI czar, tasked with bridging the gap between the industry and regulators. Sacks will oversee policy initiatives and head the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Showcasing his crypto-friendly stance, the new crypto czar has already outlined plans to investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0 amid growing industry complaints. David Sacks has pledged to address the concerns highlighted by Coinbase’s release of FDIC “pause letters.” Tech and Crypto Leaders Join Record-Breaking Inaugural Fund The Trump-Vance inaugural committee has already raised $200 million, surpassing all previous records. Major contributions from tech giants like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Vlad Tenev, alongside cryptocurrency leaders, underscore the broad support for the event. Each of these tech executives has pledged $1 million or more to the fund. Stressing the importance of crypto industry support for the president-elect, Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi told FOX Business, “For the first time, we have a President who truly understands the potential of disruptive technology and embraces the crypto sector. We’re excited to continue to work with President-Elect Trump and his administration to push for long-overdue regulatory clarity and unlock this next wave of innovation.” These developments come as the US appeals court reveals key dates for the Ripple case. The opening brief is scheduled for March 6, 2025, and XRP company’s answering brief is due by April 7, 2025.

Here’s Where Its Headed Next,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-the-ethereum-price-crash-over-heres-where-its-headed-next/,"The Ethereum (ETH) price’s post-US Federal Reserve meeting rollercoaster continued on Friday with prices crashing as low as the $3,100 area before covering sharply to just above $3,400. That leaves the Ethereum price roughly flat over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap , but losses since last week’s peaks just above $4,100 currently stand at around 16.5%. The Fed rocked sentiment across traditional financial and crypto markets on Wednesday after they sounded the alarm about sticky inflation and revised their guidance for easing in 2025 to just two rate cuts from the four they had previously signaled. US equity marketed, which were arguably due a correction following their impressive run to new record levels since Trump’s election victory last month, were hammered at the time. S&P 500 FALLS 3% IN BIGGEST POST-FED DROP SINCE MARCH 2020 — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) December 18, 2024 It’s no surprise then that a risk appetite-sensitive asset like Ethereum (ETH), and cryptos more broadly, also took a beating. However, price action on Friday in suggests the worse might be over, and a period of stabilization and even a potential recovery into the year end could be on the cards. The Ethereum price looks on course to form a bullish dragonfly doji daily candle, which tends to form around the time of price bottoms. ETH also received super strong support as it neared its 200DMA, and there are strong signs that dip buyers are aggressively entering the market to support the price. Even Trump-affiliated crypto project World Liberty Financial’s wallet was spotted scooping up over $2 million in ETH. Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial ( @worldlibertyfi ) spent another 2.5M $USDT to buy 722.2 $ETH 2 hours ago, after the price dropped by ~6%! Since November 30, this fund has spent $47.5M on 6 crypto assets: $ETH , $WBTC , $LINK , $AAVE , $ENA , and $ONDO (tweet ). Of this,… https://t.co/8v3pGVG8Hr pic.twitter.com/Ix3h8Y1hxc — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) December 20, 2024 Assuming no further macro surprises hit in the coming weeks (unlikely given an absence of important US data or Fed events), focus should return to bullish themes such as the incoming Trump administration’s pro-crypto policy stance, and how a 2025 should bring a new golden era to crypto. That means the stage could be set for a gradual recovery for the Ethereum price into the year’s end, assuming the US dollar and US yields stop charging higher. Calls for new all-time highs before the year’s end may not be realistic, but a gradual recovery in the upcoming sessions back toward $4,000 certainly is. Ethereum Price – Wen New All-Time Highs? The Ethereum price’s strong rejection of its latest retest of yearly highs in the $4,100 area has some investors panicking. But they should relax. Firstly, the major theme in crypto right now is adoption – Wall Street gobbling up supply, talk of a crypto industry boom over the next for years in the US, and potentially even the establishment of Bitcoin national reserves, which would further legitimize the nascent industry. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says the Fed is ""not allowed to own Bitcoin"" They weren't allowed to own Corporate Bonds before Covid either. Rules change… pic.twitter.com/3UBBUuKtdF — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) December 18, 2024 So yes, maybe the Fed won’t cut as much as hoped next year, which isn’t as good for risk assets like stocks and crypto as if they cut more. But the adoption tailwinds are set to far outweigh anyway macro headwinds. And macro isn’t even really a headwind anyway – we remain in an environment of a strong US economy at the same time as a Fed that is still inclined to ease rates, which many longer-term minded investors think of as “Goldilocks” for risk assets. Secondly, ETH’s historic cyclical relationship with BTC also gives reason for optimism about the medium-term Ethereum price outlook. In prior cycles (like 2020/21 and 2017), Bitcoin has broken out to new record highs one to two months ahead of ETH. Bitcoin broke out in mid-November, meaning it’s not been just over one month. That sets the table for a potential January surge for the Ethereum price as it follows Bitcoin’s lead. FUD relating to ETH’s recent price underperformance versus BTC and its “poor tech” when compared to rivals like Solana or Sui shouldn’t deter investors. That’s not to say those blockchains won’t perform well, but Ethereum remains far and away the dominant blockchain in DeFi with around 56% of TVL, per DeFi Llama , and has US ETFs plus the backing of BlackRock , one of Wall Street’s biggest players. . @BlackRock buying $ETH while everyone panic selling: https://t.co/FYX6l6bJ9y pic.twitter.com/rB48lRarUj — Ethereum Daily (@ETH_Daily) December 12, 2024 One BlackRock executive recent commented that, rather than launching more crypto ETF products, their focus right now is on promoting their existing BTC and ETH ETFs to a wider investor base.

On a recent episode of the Coinage podcast, guest SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said that she is open to reconsidering in-kind redemptions for spot bitcoin ETFs.

If Peirce can work with the incoming SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, to facilitate the approval of in-kind redemptions then the spot bitcoin ETFs can serve as some of the biggest on-ramps to Bitcoin, as Bitwise co-founder Hong Kim put it , as opposed to simply existing as speculation vehicles. Bitcoin was born to exist in the wild. It wasn’t born to exist in a Wall Street zoo. In-kind redemptions would allow the bitcoin currently trapped within the zoo the ability to return to its natural habitat. This article is a Take .

This strategic move has sent Rumble stock soaring by 50% in aftermarket trading. The investment, valuing Rumble shares at $7.50 each, will boost the platform’s financial stability and growth prospects. Tether $775M Rumble Investment Sends Stock Soaring 50% Following a recent press release , Tether revealed its decision to acquire 103,333,333 shares of Rumble’s Class A Common Stock at $7.50 per share. The $775 million transaction marks a strategic move into decentralized communications. News of the investment triggered a sharp 50% increase in Rumble stock price during aftermarket trading, reflecting investor optimism about the collaboration. Rumble stock had been experiencing a downturn following Federal Reserve announcements on interest rates. However, the USDT issuer’s backing has restored market confidence, driving the share price upward. This highlights the growing ties between cryptocurrency initiatives and decentralized media platforms. Chris Pavlovski, Rumble’s CEO expressed enthusiasm stating, “This transaction provides an immediate liquidity event for all of our stockholders who elect to participate in the self tender offer. I truly believe Tether is the perfect partner that can put a rocket pack on the back of Rumble as we prepare for our next phase of growth.” These developments come just weeks after the video-sharing platform announced its intention to allocate up to $20 million of its treasury to Bitcoin. The decision reflects Rumble’s focus on diversifying its cash reserves and leveraging Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. $250M Allocated For Growth, $525M For Share Buyback In addition, the USDT issuer has earmarked $250 million from the investment to boost Rumble’s growth initiatives. These funds will expand the platform’s operational capabilities and strengthen its financial foundation, enabling it to compete in the video-sharing and cloud services markets. The remaining $525 million will fund a self-tender offer for up to 70 million shares of Rumble’s Class A Common Stock. This buyback program, offered at the same $7.50 per share as Tether’s investment, provides liquidity for existing stockholders. Rumble’s CEO, Chris Pavlovski, will retain his controlling stake in the company, committing to tender no more than 10 million of his shares in the offer. Additionally, the partnership reflects shared values of decentralization and free speech. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, emphasized the alignment between Tether’s mission to promote financial freedom and Rumble’s dedication to providing an alternative to traditional media. Meanwhile, the move comes as Tether diversifies its portfolio, leveraging profits from USDT’s backing assets, which generated $2.5 billion in net profit during Q3 2024. With this investment, the USDT issuer continues its expansion into sectors such as AI, decentralized messaging, and now, video-sharing platforms. Most recently, Paolo Ardoino revealed that Tether is targeting the end of Q1 2025 for the launch of its AI platform. While specific details remain limited, the platform is expected to integrate privacy-focused Peer-to-Peer AI Agents.

Despite that, 2024 still ended up as a win for the ARB ecosystem . Not only did it become the third-largest blockchain by stablecoin capitalization, it also achieved over $100M in Real World Assets (RWA) tokenization. RWA, stablecoin liquidity, and everything that went right for Arbitrum In 2024 Arbitrum’s stablecoin market cap significantly increased this year, thanks to the enabling environment the blockchain provides. According to reports , Arbitrum added almost $1 billion to its stablecoin market cap between November and this month, positioning it ahead of blockchains like Binance Smart Chain and Solana. As of December 20, Arbitrum has a stablecoin market cap of approximately $6.75 billion and is on track to surpass $7 billion in total value locked. When stablecoin market cap grows on a blockchain as it has on Arbitrum, it typically signals liquidity stacking ahead of activity on the network. There was also a noticeable uptick in the tokenization of RWAs on Arbitrum . At the start of this year, it had less than $100k in tokenized assets, but that stat has steadily grown to around $85 million as of mid-December. Major contributors to this growth include major asset managers like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock,, who deployed tokenized Money Market Funds on the platform. 99% of these tokenized assets are US Treasuries, which is unsurprising as tokenized equities and equity indices have always been a niche sector, with a combined AUM of merely $800k. Investors can access stocks and indices on Arbitrum, such as SPY, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, and COIN. While a majority of those assets are held by externally-owned accounts, the Arbitrum DAO treasury holds 18.4% of the chain’s RWAs, and 10.1% reside in DEX liquidity pools. Why is the Arbitrum DAO holding so much in RWAs? The goal is to create an alternative revenue stream with a different risk profile than ETH and ARB. Ecosystem development and community engagement Arbitrum’s ecosystem recorded significant growth across various parameters. The network’s TVL (Total Value Locked) hit $20 billion, proof of its capacity to scale and innovate. This is thanks to developments like the support for USDC as a gas token for Orbit chains, which facilitated broader adoption and new use cases for onboarding retailers into Web3. Another area that made Arbitrum more enticing to whales is its profitability for liquidity providers. It attracted more users and devs thanks to its shorter block times, which many have lauded. As it stands, Arbitrum One boasts an average block time of 250 milliseconds. However, with Arbitrum Orbit, block times can be configured to go as low as 100 milliseconds if transactions arrive that quickly. The efficiency contributed immensely to the competitive edge the blockchain now has over other blockchains, including Ethereum, which has an average block time of around 12 seconds. Arbitrum stuck around during the bear market, and unsurprisingly, the ecosystem’s community and developer activity have rewarded it with their support. Showcases of its active user base include surpassing a billion transactions on Arbitrum One and the 1 million Stylus NFTs mint milestone. Despite the already strong RWA growth on the chain this year, there’s still significant room for expansion. As it stands, 99% of RWAs on Arbitrum are US Treasuries , which means other industries like real estate are yet to be represented and could be the next in line. Real estate can offer higher yields and tangible value. There has always been global demand for premium properties, which makes it an untapped market with massive potential. Arbitrum’s low fees and scalability make it the ideal ecosystem for RWAs in crypto, and if it intersects with other use cases, it could be set for another great year in 2025.

Speaking in an interview, Scaramucci dismissed the fears of a financial collapse tied to MicroStrategy’s substantial Bitcoin holdings and debt structure, explaining that only a prolonged and systemic Bitcoin crash spanning several years would destabilize the company. Long-Term Debt Structure Shields MicroStrategy MicroStrategy’s financial strategy has attracted attention due to its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions , funded largely through convertible debt and equity sales. The company currently holds $46.02 billion worth of Bitcoin, with an unrealized profit of $18.9 billion. Critics argue that Bitcoin price volatility could jeopardize MicroStrategy’s ability to service its debt, potentially leading to forced Bitcoin sales and market disruptions. However, Anthony Scaramucci emphasized that MicroStrategy’s debt is structured for the long term, reducing the risk of immediate financial distress. “If you really study his balance sheet, he has long, long-term debt, and he has rolling long-term debt,” Scaramucci said, referring to Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s executive chairman. He added that a systemic Bitcoin crash would need to last six or seven years to pose a significant threat to the company’s financial stability. Market Concerns About Bitcoin Price Volatility MicroStrategy’s reliance on Bitcoin as a corporate asset has fueled skepticism among investors. The company’s shares have soared by over 400% this year, driven by Bitcoin’s record-breaking price surges. However, Bitcoin price has recently retreated from its all-time high of $108,000, leading to renewed concerns about MicroStrategy’s exposure to market volatility. Despite this, Anthony Scaramucci believes fears of forced Bitcoin sales are unfounded. “The narrative of him being forced to sell hundreds of thousands of tokens into the market, I think it’s a forced narrative,” he said. Scaramucci attributed this confidence to his Wall Street experience, adding that MicroStrategy’s debt structure is fundamentally different from situations like the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. MicroStrategy Temporary Halt to Bitcoin Purchases Rumors have surfaced that MicroStrategy may pause Bitcoin acquisitions in January due to potential blackout restrictions on share or convertible debt issuance. Such blackout periods are common for publicly traded companies, often imposed around fiscal quarter closings to comply with insider trading regulations. Speculation suggests that the restrictions could prevent Michael Saylor from issuing convertible debt to finance additional Bitcoin purchases. However, analysts believe the potential pause would have limited impact, given the company’s substantial existing Bitcoin holdings and its history of regulatory compliance. MicroStrategy’s next earnings report is expected between February 3 and 5, 2025, with analysts predicting that any blackout period would span January or begin mid-month. The company’s inclusion in the NASDAQ 100 index on December 23 has also raised theories that internal recommendations may have prompted this move. Bitcoin Outlook Remains Positive While Bitcoin’s recent price retreat has sparked concerns, Anthony Scaramucci remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. He acknowledged that Bitcoin could experience corrections of 30% to 40% next year, possibly dropping to $60,000–$70,000. However, he highlighted factors such as the introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and potential favorable legislation that could support Bitcoin’s price stability. “Could it get to $18 trillion dollars in market cap? We believe that it could,” Scaramucci said, while cautioning that the path to such a valuation would not be linear. He also noted that Bitcoin’s growing adoption and institutional interest could continue driving its appreciation over time.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

On Dec. 20, the company announced a $1 million investment in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Following the disclosure, QNTM’s shares on the Nasdaq dropped nearly 10%. Quantum BioPharma, also listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange and Frankfurt Stock Exchange, specializes in biotech solutions for treating neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and alcohol misuse disorders. “The company is now set up to receive financing in cryptocurrencies as well as executing other types of transactions in cryptocurrencies,” Quantum stated, though it did not reveal the specific tokens in its portfolio. More non-crypto businesses are embracing digital assets to diversify their holdings and hedge against inflation. In November, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-over-year, with a 0.3% monthly increase, marking the sharpest rise in seven months. Jiva Technologies, a wellness e-commerce firm, approved a plan to invest up to $1 million in Bitcoin last month, citing its inflation-resistant qualities. Similarly, video-sharing platform Rumble allocated $20 million of its cash reserves to Bitcoin in late November. Hoth Therapeutics, another biopharmaceutical company, added $1 million in Bitcoin to its treasury on Nov. 20. MicroStrategy, which adopted this strategy in 2020, remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 439,000 BTC as of December 2024. Think Tank Advocates Bitcoin Adoption The National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, has pushed major corporations like Amazon and Microsoft to adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies. Microsoft shareholders voted against the proposal during a Dec. 10 meeting, calling it “unnecessary.” Amazon’s shareholders are set to review the proposal in April 2025.

With its volatility remaining low, STX has been steady, aiming for a $3.80 value in 2025 after testing essential support levels. On the other hand, Shiba Inu’s technical analysis shows a decline in momentum as its burn rate plummeted by 99.84%, signaling reduced demand and wavering confidence. BlockDAG (BDAG) distinguishes itself with superior mining efficiency, having sold over 14,919 mining rigs and accruing over $6 million from these sales. The network’s X1 Miner, combined with the efficient X10 Miner, boosts rewards by 10x, presenting an exceptional chance for users to enhance their earnings effortlessly. This interesting pairing positions BlockDAG among the best crypto miners. Stacks Crypto Prediction: Will It Hit $3.80 by 2025? Stacks (STX) is progressing slowly but surely, consolidating around pivotal levels. Recent support at $2.06 demonstrates resilience, with Stacks crypto’s prediction foreseeing a rise to $3.80 by 2025. Its gradual ascent might not attract those seeking faster results. While the Stacks crypto prediction suggests the potential for sustained gains, its dependence on cautious, low-risk development may not captivate those drawn to swift innovation. Moreover, the current resistance at $2.31 acts as an impediment, stalling further advances. Shiba Inu Technical Analysis: Burn Rate Plummets by 99.84% Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces challenges as its burn rate has sharply fallen by 99.84%, with only 112,182 tokens recently burned. This significant drop indicates a slump in demand, as seen in its daily volume dwindling to $604 million, trailing behind its meme coin rivals. Recent Shiba Inu technical analysis points to possible recovery patterns, supported by an ascending channel and crucial moving averages. Although a rebound could occur, the diminishing demand and declining confidence question whether SHIB still stands as the best crypto to buy now. Combine BlockDAG’s X1 & X10 Miners for 10X Rewards! BlockDAG is revolutionizing the way we mine cryptocurrencies, captivating miners across the globe with its top-notch efficiency. For instance, the X1 Miner app is reshaping crypto mining, enabling even novices to extract up to 20 BDAG daily from their smartphones—without battery drain. The app boasts over 270,000 active users. In a recent AMA, BlockDAG’s CEO Antony Turner unveiled a thrilling update: linking the X1 Miner with the X10 device could increase mining output tenfold, allowing users to collect up to 200 BDAG daily. This combination promises to amplify your BDAG earnings, potentially reaching $200 daily once BDAG hits its anticipated $1 coin value. Moreover, BlockDAG’s superior rigs are capable of producing up to 2,000 BDAG coins daily. This breakthrough has reignited interest in BlockDAG’s mining solutions, rapidly driving miner sales beyond $6 million with over 14,919 units snapped up swiftly. This endeavor underscores the company’s commitment to delivering the best crypto miners for everyone, from newcomers to expert miners. Additionally, BlockDAG’s crypto presale has garnered over $170 million by distributing more than 17.4 billion BDAG coins. With an initial price of $0.001 in the first presale batch and a current rate of $0.0234 in batch 26, the price has escalated by 2240%. With BDAG coins in soaring demand and expected to hit a $1 valuation soon, mining them now might offer substantial returns. Miners keen on BlockDAG’s equipment must seize this opportunity before they sell out. The Top Crypto Miners & Coins to Keep an Eye On While the Stacks crypto prediction anticipates a gradual rise to $3.80 and Shiba Inu technical analysis shows a drastic 99.84% decline in its burn rate, BlockDAG continues to push the boundaries of mining productivity. With its impressive sale of over 14,919 mining rigs and $6 million in revenue from these sales, BlockDAG is fast becoming the preferred choice for both novice and experienced miners alike. BlockDAG’s ongoing presale, having raised over $170 million, remains a top choice for those searching for the best crypto miners. With its potential to reach the $1 mark in the near future, BlockDAG emerges as an exceptionally lucrative option.

Cardano (ADA) cratered as low as $0.76 on Friday, taking its pullback from recent highs to more than 40% at the time. The Fed triggered a major stock and crypto market sell-off when they issued more-hawkish-than-expected guidance for only two additional rate cuts in 2025 on Wednesday. What just happened? The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points which is exactly what 97% of market participants wanted. But, the S&P 500 just posted its largest post-Fed drop since March 2020, erasing $1.8 TRILLION of market cap. Why? Let us explain. (a thread) — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 18, 2024 Since the Fed’s bearish meeting, ADA futures positions worth nearly $20 million have been liquidated, per coin glass.com . However, Cardano’s strong recovery from intra-day lows in the $0.76 area to around $0.95, which has seen ADA also reclaim its 50DMA, suggests the worst might be over. ADA is currently on course to close out a bullish hammer candlestick for this session. And with macro set to take a back seat into the year’s end, with no further major US economic data releases or Fed events, focus is likely to return to bullish “adoption” talking points. And Cardano has a few highly bullish narratives running in its favor right now. Here is why the price is likely to reclaim $1.0 and start 2025 on the front foot. Cardano Is Likely to Retake $1 and Start 2025 Strong, Here’s Why Trump’s election victory last month sparked a major rally in crypto, but Cardano was one of the strongest performers. That’s because Cardano has been one of the most beaten down cryptocurrencies by the current SEC, who classified it as an unregistered security in 2023 in lawsuits versus Binance and Coinbase. The Trump administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history – the treasury secretary is pro-crypto, there is a new Crypto/AI czar and the incoming SEC chair is also a friend to the industry. Moreover, Cardano’s co-founder Charles Hopkinson may also end up advising the incoming administration. This is a game changer for Cardano, which has until now struggled to garner substantial adoption for its blockchain when compared to rivals like Ethereum and Solana . Cardano proponents are urging the Cardano Foundation to match Ripple’s massive donation to Trump’s inauguration to ensure their spot as a key player in future policy discussions. Cardano should absolutely be donating to Donald Trump’s inaugural fund Match Ripple Cardano needs to do everything possible to be a key player in all of the policy discussions about the future of finance This could encourage even more dialogue & cooperation with policymakers https://t.co/bt6sZJgQ5m — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 20, 2024 Meanwhile, Cardano hopes to accelerate the adoption of its blockchain by transforming itself into the go to BTC DeFi chain by mid-2025. BREAKING NEWS: BITCOIN IS COMING TO CARDANO MAY 2025 – CHARLES ""We're going to get Bitcoin on cardano at most likely may 2025"" Are you not excited? pic.twitter.com/i0SxJdpMhp — Mintern (@MinswapIntern) December 19, 2024 A lot of traders have lined up to short Cardano around $1, per a Tweet from Deezy.eth. That raises the risk of a short-squeeze that could see ADA quickly retake years highs in the $1.30 area should the current recovery accelerate. Looking into 2025, assuming the incoming pro-crypto administration and Congressional session delivers on all the talk, the arrival of a new golden age for crypto could send ADA skyrocketing. A retest of record highs above $3 is certainly a possibility. Cardano Alternative to Consider While Cardano could be setting up for 3x gains in 2025, investors looking to secure larger gains might instead want to consider getting involved in meme coin markets. Well-known meme coins like Dogecoin , Pepe and dogwifhat could all offer between 5-10x upside potential. Alternatively, newer and lesser-known meme coins , whilst riskier, could offer substantially greater upside potential. One meme coin that the team at cryptonews.com is a big fan of is a fun new gamified cat token called Catslap (SLAP) . This highly promising meme coin has already been able to reach a market cap of over $14 million per DEXTools . The meme coin is running a massive $1,000,000 giveaway to users who accumulate the most slap points. With a new meme season likely to hit as markets recover into the year’s end, SLAP could be one of the best-performing memes.

This Trending Meme Coin Presale Is Reviving the Trust in Bulls,https://thenewscrypto.com/neiro-feeling-stale-this-trending-meme-coin-presale-is-reviving-the-trust-in-bulls/,"Meme coins have long been the cheeky underdogs of the crypto world. What started with Dogecoin as a playful experiment has turned into a full-blown phenomenon, drawing millions of investors and community members worldwide. These coins don’t just rely on humour; they’ve evolved into serious contenders with real utility and innovative ecosystems. In 2024, meme coins are making headlines again, with BTFD Coin (BTFD) leading the charge. BTFD Coin is rewriting the rules of what meme coins can achieve. Its combination of a Play 2 Earn game, a generous referral programme, and a staking system offering a whopping 90% APY has positioned it as the trending meme coin presale to watch. With analysts predicting stellar returns, BTFD is raising the bar for what’s possible in the meme coin space. But how does it compare to Neiro, another community favourite? Let’s take a closer look. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Setting New Standards in Meme Coins BTFD Coin isn’t just riding the meme coin wave; it’s creating its own. With a presale that’s already raised over $4.2 million and sold more than 57 billion coins to over 6,100 holders, BTFD has surged to Stage 12 in record time. Each coin is currently priced at $0.00013, with a post-presale listing set at $0.0006. The potential for profit has investors clamouring to join before the presale ends. One of BTFD’s standout features is its Play 2 Earn game. The beta version launched during Stage 10, offering a glimpse into the engaging, reward-driven gameplay that’s on the horizon. While the beta doesn’t offer rewards yet, it’s building anticipation for the full launch. Add to that the referral programme, which rewards users for bringing in new investors, and you’ve got a community-focused ecosystem that’s primed for growth. Staking is where BTFD truly shines. With an APY of 90%, staking went live on December 2, giving holders an unmatched opportunity to grow their assets passively. The Bulls Squad, an exclusive group for top-tier investors, adds another layer of excitement by offering perks that go beyond the typical meme coin experience. To put the potential returns in perspective, imagine investing $100,000 in Stage 12 at $0.00013 per coin. That would secure you approximately 769,230,769 coins. When BTFD lists at $0.0006 post-presale, your investment would balloon to $461,538, a gain of $361,538. It’s numbers like these that have made BTFD the trending meme coin presale investors can’t ignore. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin is redefining meme coin potential with its robust ecosystem, impressive presale performance, and unmatched ROI potential. Neiro (NEIRO): A Community-Driven Contender Neiro emerged as a favourite among meme coin enthusiasts earlier this year. Rooted in community-driven innovation, Neiro focuses on fostering a decentralised ecosystem that empowers its holders. Its playful branding and loyal fanbase have helped it carve out a niche in the meme coin world. One of Neiro’s unique selling points is its community voting mechanism, which allows holders to influence the coin’s direction. This democratic approach has been a hit with investors looking for more transparency and involvement in their crypto projects. Neiro also introduced its own NFT collection, featuring playful designs that have resonated with its audience. However, Neiro has faced challenges in maintaining momentum. While its launch was met with enthusiasm, its utility hasn’t expanded as quickly as some investors had hoped. Analysts note that while Neiro has strong community support, it needs to innovate further to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market. Why did this coin make it to this list? Neiro’s community-focused approach and early success make it a worthy contender in the meme coin space. Conclusion: BTFD Coin or Neiro? Meme coins are no longer just about laughs; they’re about innovation, community, and opportunity. While Neiro has established itself as a community-driven project, BTFD Coin is taking things to the next level with its groundbreaking ecosystem and impressive presale performance. If you’re looking for a project that combines entertainment with real earning potential, BTFD Coin is the clear choice. Its Play 2 Earn game, 90% APY on staking, and referral programme make it the trending meme coin presale that’s capturing the crypto world’s attention. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin’s presale . Join now and be part of the future of meme coins.

Crypto All-Stars is nearing the end of its presale today, having raised an incredible $25M, making it one of the most successful meme coin presales of 2024. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu continues to push boundaries by integrating Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), expanding its tokens to 12 blockchains. But the coin everyone’s talking about is BTFD Coin, a fresh new entrant that’s creating a storm with its $4.2M presale and innovative features like 90% APY staking and a beta play-to-earn (P2E) game. With over 57 billion tokens sold to more than 6,100 holders, BTFD Coin is quickly gaining traction as the meme coin to watch. Let’s dive deeper into why Crypto All-Stars, Shiba Inu, and BTFD Coin are the best meme coins to buy this week and how each is reshaping the crypto landscape. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Are Running Wild First, let’s talk about BTFD Coin , the meme coin that’s quickly becoming the talk of the town. BTFD Coin’s presale, now in its 12th stage, has already raised $4.2M, selling over 57 billion tokens to more than 6,100 investors. With only 16 presale stages in total, time is running out to grab this coin at its current price of $0.00013. But why is everyone so excited about BTFD Coin? For starters, it’s not just a meme coin—it’s a community-powered movement. The coin’s branding, focused on helping investors “own the dip,” has struck a chord with those looking for smart investment opportunities. Its features, including a play-to-earn game in beta testing and 90% APY staking rewards , make it more than just another crypto. It’s a utility-packed asset with the potential for massive growth. Here’s a scenario to consider: If you invest $20,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’d receive approximately 153.8 million $BTFD tokens. Once the coin hits its post-presale price of $0.0006, your investment could be worth $92,307. That’s a jaw-dropping 361% return on investment! But it’s not just about the numbers. BTFD Coin’s growing community of over 6,100 “bulls” is a testament to its appeal. The coin has captured the imagination of investors worldwide, and its presale success shows no signs of slowing down, making it one of the best meme coins to buy this week. Crypto All-Stars: Presale Hits $25M and Ends Today If you’ve been following meme coins this year, you’ve probably heard about Crypto All-Stars. This project has captured the market’s attention with its MemeVault Protocol, a revolutionary staking platform that allows users to stake multiple meme coins like Dogecoin, PEPE, and Floki. It’s the first of its kind—a multi-token, multi-chain staking platform that rewards users for holding $STARS, the platform’s native token.

According to some market watchers, the flagship crypto’s recent performance resembles its December 2023 trajectory, suggesting that BTC might see a massive breakout soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Peak Between $160,000 And $290,000 If These Historical Patterns Repeat – Report Bitcoin Price Mirrors December 2023’s Performance On Wednesday, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market saw a massive correction after the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announced a 25-basis-point rate cut and signaled fewer cuts than expected in 2025. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped 9.2% from its $108,135 all-time high (ATH), briefly falling below the $99,000 on support before recovering. BTC quickly climbed back to $100,000, surging 2% on Thursday morning to the $102,000 resistance. After the dump, crypto trader Follis suggested that this month’s price action mirrored BTC’s 2023 trajectory. The trader stated that Bitcoin was “repeating the December playbook from last year,” forecasting that a pump to a new high is coming soon. Per the chart, BTC moved within the $40,000-$45,000 price range before breaking out in January 2024. The breakout was followed by a significant 20% correction to the previous consolidation zone, briefly dipping below this range. However, Bitcoin reclaimed the breakout levels in the following weeks and surged another 47% to its March ATH of $73,000. If the largest crypto by market cap continues to follow this “playbook,” then its price could see a correction below $88,000 by year-end before resuming its bullish run to new highs. Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that BTC’s performance in Q4 resembles its Q4 2023 price action. The analyst stated that Bitcoin will likely continue the “slow hoppy grind up before the actual breakout” happens. He recommended “zooming out” as the short-term chart “doesn’t look pretty” but noted that BTC’s price is still “trending up slowly.” Analyst Warns Of BTC’s Daily Close Other analysts suggested that the coming hours will be decisive for BTC’s short-term performance. Rekt Capital asserted that holding the $100,000 support was crucial, as failing to maintain this level could send Bitcoin below the previous key resistance of $98,000. Moreover, a daily close above the $101,000 mark would be necessary to prevent this range from turning into resistance again. The analyst emphasized that “doing so could kickstart a chain of events where BTC starts to lose support level by level.” Related Reading: Sentiment For Ethereum Hits 1-year Low, Analyst Says A Massive Run Is Coming He added that a close above this level would invalidate the short-term bearish outlook. Previously, the analyst explained that Bitcoin is amid the first “Price Discovery Correction,” which tends to happen between the 6thand 8th week of BTC’s post-halving “Parabolic Upside Phase”: As a result, over the next 3 weeks or so, I am going to be increasingly cautious about retest attempts, and given BTC’s history at this point in the cycle, I wouldn’t be surprised to see key levels get invalidated. However, he emphasized that the “Second Price Discovery Uptrend” will follow the big correction. As of this writing, Bitcoin has dipped below the $100,000 support level, registering a 5.1% 24-hour drop to the $98,900 mark.

The DOJ is currently seeking his extradition from Israel, where he was arrested. Panev was arrested in August following two guilty pleas in July from two Russian members of the group; Ruslan Astamirov and Mikhail Vasiliev. The LockBit gang , according to the US Department of Justice, has hit over 2500 victims in 120 countries around the world. These include small businesses, large multinationals, hospitals, schools, critical infrastructure, and government and law enforcement agencies. Notable victims of LockBit include Boeing Co., The Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, and the UK’s Royal Mail. The group has been connected to a string of ransomware attacks, with victims’ data locked up or their systems rendered inoperable until they extort a fee from them. LockBit developer arrested Rostilav Panev worked as a developer and coder for LockBit for approximately five years starting from its inception in 2019 to February 2024. The now-detained developer received approximately $230,000 in cryptocurrency transfers as payment for his work, according to the charges filed by the Department of Justice. LockBit and its affiliates extorted at least $500M in payments from victims and also caused significant losses in revenue. According to Panev’s lawyer, defense attorney Sharon Nahari, he developed tools for the group without any knowledge of the intended use of the software. The superseding complaint received by the DOJ alleges that Panev exchanged direct messages through a cybercriminal forum with LockBit’s primary administrator. His attorney, Sharon Nahari, maintains that Panev corresponded with the group solely through Telegram messages and had no idea about their identity. “The arrest of Mr. Panev reflects the Department’s commitment to using all its tools to combat the ransomware threat,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland also stated that three individuals allegedly responsible for the cyber attacks against thousands of victims are in custody and that the Justice Department will continue to hold all those who enable ransomware attacks accountable. Law enforcement crackdown The LockBit group emerged in 2019. The group was discovered in 2020 when its malicious software was discovered on a Russian cybercrimes forum. In February, law enforcement in the UK and the US seized websites and servers used by LockBit members and associates. The police also obtained victim data and thousands of decryption keys urging victims to reach out to the group for help in recovering their stolen data. LockBit quickly resurfaced after the seizure, stating threateningly, “I cannot be stopped.” Despite their bold stance, the efforts of law enforcement have significantly weakened the group’s ability.

The research firm Cerulli Associates says $105 trillion will be passed on to heirs by 2048, while charities will receive $18 trillion over the same period. Baby Boomers, the Silent Generation and other older generations will be the major benefactors. “Nearly $100 trillion will be transferred from Baby Boomers and older generations, representing 81% of all transfers. More than 50% of the overall total volume of transfers ($62 trillion) is expected to come from those who are currently high-net-worth (HNW) and ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW), which together make up only 2% of all households.” Over the short term, generation X will benefit more than Millennials from the Great Wealth Transfer. “Millennials will be inheriting the most of any generation over the course of the next 25 years ($46 trillion). However, Gen X stands to inherit the greatest portion of assets in the next 10 years, totaling $14 trillion to Millennials’ $8 trillion.” Widows in the Baby Boomer and the Silent Generation as well as other older generations are set to receive about 38% of the wealth before it can get to heirs and charities, according to the report. “Projections of horizontal, or intra-generational, transfers show that $54 trillion will be passed on to spouses before eventually transferring intergenerationally to heirs and to charities. Nearly $40 trillion of these spousal transfers will be going to widowed women in the Baby Boomer and older generations…” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK.

This sudden pullback has sent shockwaves across the crypto market, shifting sentiment from extreme bullishness to uncertainty and even fear. The sell-off has been particularly brutal for altcoins, many of which are bleeding hard as Bitcoin struggles to regain momentum. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal Cardano Whales Are ‘Buying The Dip’ – Details Key metrics from CryptoQuant highlight the gravity of the situation, with realized losses totaling $28.9 million—an alarming 3.2 times higher than the weekly average. This spike in realized losses suggests that some investors exit positions as the market recalibrates after weeks of aggressive upward movement. The big question now is whether this is simply a healthy correction in an otherwise bullish trend or the start of a larger downtrend. Traders are closely watching Bitcoin’s ability to hold critical support levels and the behavior of altcoins, which often amplify Bitcoin’s price movements. For now, the market remains at a crossroads, with the coming days likely to reveal whether Bitcoin can recover and resume its uptrend—or if this correction signals a more prolonged period of weakness. Bitcoin Facing Selling Pressure Bitcoin is under significant selling pressure after two days of aggressive bearish activity, marking a pivotal moment for the market. The sudden sentiment shift has caused many analysts and investors to turn cautious, with some flipping bearish as Bitcoin’s recent trend begins to lose momentum. This correction has left the market questioning whether the current price movement is a natural pause or a precursor to deeper losses. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared insights on X, supported by compelling on-chain data, highlighting that realized losses have surged to $28.9 million. This figure is 3.2 times higher than the weekly average, indicating heightened selling activity. Adler’s analysis underscores that while the sell-off might seem alarming, it’s consistent with a healthy market correction, especially following Bitcoin’s remarkable rally to $108,300. Adler notes that the current dip should not trigger panic but instead serve as a moment of patience for long-term holders. He emphasized that now is a time to HODL unless additional bearish signals emerge to suggest a more prolonged downtrend. Corrections like this often provide the market with the necessary fuel for the next leg up, as weaker hands exit and strong hands position themselves strategically.

Price action remains critical, with investors watching closely to determine whether this correction solidifies a strong foundation for future growth or signals further downside. BTC Holding Bullish Structure (For Now) Bitcoin is trading at $94,400 following three consecutive days of aggressive selling pressure. Despite the apparent bearish sentiment gripping the market, BTC has managed to maintain its footing above the key support level of $92,000. This support is crucial as it clearly defines the ongoing uptrend. Holding above this level suggests resilience and sets the stage for a potential strong bounce if buyers regain control in the coming sessions. While the recent price action reflects uncertainty, the decline has not been as severe as the market sentiment indicates. Negative emotions have driven many traders to adopt a cautious stance, but BTC’s ability to stay above $92,000 shows underlying strength in the market structure.

Restoring confidence will be essential for Bitcoin to reclaim higher levels and resume its bullish momentum. If sentiment does not improve and prices continue to drop, the risk of a deeper correction becomes more likely. Losing the $92,000 support could pave the way for a retest of lower levels, potentially causing additional volatility.

The surge in global cryptocurrency adoption is fueled significantly by heavyweight investors like Fidelity and BlackRock, who are actively enhancing the sector’s credibility. Remarkably, about 6.8% of the global population, over 560 million people, now engage with cryptocurrency. Amidst this explosive growth, utility coins like Solana and Tron are gaining traction, but the real game-changer could be Web3Bay, poised to command a larger ecosystem. Don’t Miss Out on Web3Bay’s Rise in Crypto E-Commerce As the pace of cryptocurrency adoption quickens, Web3Bay is rapidly becoming a dominant force in the e-commerce landscape, moving from theoretical utility to tangible, real-world impact. Supported by giants such as Fidelity and BlackRock, the crypto sphere is gaining unprecedented legitimacy. While platforms like Solana and Tron push the envelope with sophisticated blockchain solutions, Web3Bay distinguishes itself by focusing on decentralizing e-commerce. Operating on a robust Layer-1 blockchain, Web3Bay guarantees the privacy, control, and transparency demanded by today’s crypto users, empowering them to manage their data securely. The 3BAY token, central to Web3Bay’s operations, goes beyond mere transactions by offering governance rights, exclusive rewards, and discounts, thus directly involving users in shaping the platform’s future. Currently, Web3Bay’s presale introduces the 3BAY token at just $0.003, with prices set to climb 15% through 28 stages. By the final stage, the token price is projected to hit $0.1959, translating to a potential ROI of over 6000% for early participants. As cryptocurrencies become integral to finance and digital experiences, Web3Bay is establishing itself as a powerhouse, seamlessly integrating Web2 and Web3 to create a revolutionary decentralized shopping experience. Solana’s Impressive Growth & Future Outlook Recently, Solana has shown remarkable progress, trading around $221 and nearing its all-time high of $263.83 as of December 2024. Known for its ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second, Solana stands out in the blockchain community, particularly for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT applications due to its high speed and low fees. Market analysts predict that Solana could reach new peaks, potentially climbing to $300 in 2025 and possibly surpassing $900 by 2030. Tron’s Steady Market Performance Tron remains a strong player in a volatile market, with network activity showing that 97% of TRX investors were profitable as of December 2024—an indicator of robust market confidence. In October 2024, Tron’s blockchain processed a record-breaking 10 million transactions in a single day, with a user base that now exceeds 296 million accounts, indicating strong ongoing demand. Time to Invest in These Utility Altcoins While Solana and Tron continue to impress with their advanced transaction capabilities and active networks, Web3Bay is carving out a niche with its innovative approach to decentralized e-commerce. With a presale designed to generously reward early backers and a commitment to bridging conventional and crypto payments, Web3Bay is reshaping online shopping. As the need for more privacy, greater control, and enhanced utility in cryptocurrencies grows, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a leader, ready to define the future of Web3-driven commerce.

This AI altcoin has the potential to grow 70x in the first quarter of 2025. Investors are putting funds into WallitIQ (WLTQ) in whale-like motion, confident in its ability to deliver solid exponential returns. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin and XRP prices have recently shown signs of nearing the $5 mark. Despite this, many prominent investors are more interested in WallitIQ (WLTQ) as it is currently priced at an affordable $0.0243 in its ongoing presale. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Returns Dwarfs Potential Gains From Dogecoin And XRP Prices Hitting $5 Following a significant yearly peak of $0.47 last month, many analysts predict that Dogecoin, currently trading at $0.4063 , might hit the $5 mark soon as analysts are on the lookout for this increase in 2025. On Monday, the XRP price rallied further to test the resistance level at $2.58 after bouncing off the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. The maximum profit target from the pole’s length indicates that the XRP price could hit a new all-time high of $5. A high-volume move above the resistance levels at $2.58 and $2.92 could accelerate the rally to $5. With the XRP price currently at $2.69 , hitting $5 seems more plausible for Ripple (XRP) than ever. Yet, even if Dogecoin and XRP prices reach the $5 milestone, the returns are still very modest compared to what the new AI altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), offers. Currently priced at just $0.0243 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides an opportunity for investors seeking exponential growth. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) 70x potential dwarfs the gains from Dogecoin and Ripple (XRP). Unlike Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin, which are already mature assets with slower growth rates, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is a new project, and its ability to grow from its current presale price of $0.0243 by 70x in 2025 gives it an edge over Dogecoin and the XRP price. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Smart Choice for Forward-Thinking Investors Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin offer significant returns. However, AI altcoin WallitIQ (WLTQ) could soon outshine Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin. The project’s appealing features are driving fast adoption. WallitIQ (WLTQ) prioritizes security and user experience. It uses AI-powered anomaly detection to monitor transactions, offering enhanced protection by detecting potential threats in real-time. A thorough audit conducted by SolidProof verifies the reliability of its smart contract. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) AI altcoin provides significant benefits to its users, including staking rewards of up to 180% APY, premium features, unlimited referral bonuses, and transaction fee coverage within its ecosystem. Priced at an accessible $0.0243 during its presale, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents an attractive investment opportunity with the potential to deliver returns that rival or surpass those of Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is making a name in the AI market, valued at over $136 billion in 2023. Its integration of AI and blockchain ensures relevance in two of the fastest-growing industries, driving more rapid adoption. Its ongoing presale is drawing significant attention from retail and institutional investors, thanks to its low entry price of $0.0243 and sky-high upside potential. Dogecoin and Ripple (XRP) offer mere peanuts compared to this AI altcoin. Act Now or Regret Later While Dogecoin and XRP prices continue their journey toward the $5 milestone, their potential returns are limited compared to WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) 70x promise. The opportunity will not remain open forever. The AI altcoin is currently in its second presale stage, meaning the window for maximizing returns is rapidly closing. Early investors in projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum reaped life-changing rewards not because of luck, but because they acted decisively when the prices were low. Imagine seeing headlines about WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) price increase months from now, knowing you had the chance to buy in early but hesitated. Don’t wait until it’s too late. Buy the WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) AI altcoin at its presale price of $0.0243 and set yourself up for exponential profits soon.

Success often finds those who recognize potential early. Consider the remarkable journey of a Miami college student who, in 2013, used $5,600 to buy Litecoin (LTC) at $2 per coin. By 2017, Litecoin’s rise to $360 per coin transformed his initial stake into an astonishing $1 million, illustrating the impact of strategic early moves in the crypto world. Now, BlockDAG (BDAG) presents a similar prospect, poised to match or even surpass Litecoin’s success. How a Miami Student’s $5,600 Bet on Litecoin Became $1M Back in 2013, the crypto market was still emerging, but Bitcoin’s dramatic rise caught many eyes. A Miami student saw the potential in this space and, with a bold step and $5,600 in hand, he invested in Litecoin (LTC) at $2 per coin. Over four years, as Litecoin’s value increased, his patience and strategic thinking were rewarded. By 2017, his investment soared to $1 million as Litecoin reached $360 per coin. This story highlights how early, well-thought-out risks can lead to substantial rewards. For those who missed Litecoin’s impressive climb, BlockDAG, a pioneering layer-1 blockchain, offers a new opportunity for significant returns. BlockDAG: The DAG Pioneer with Unprecedented Growth Potential BlockDAG merges the robust security of blockchain with the flexibility of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, effectively addressing scalability, security, and decentralization issues faced by traditional blockchains. Its dual Blockchain + DAG architecture enhances transaction speeds, scalability, and reliability, establishing it as a leading Layer 1 project. BlockDAG’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus model upholds network integrity while promoting decentralized management, making it an appealing choice for those seeking long-term growth. The platform’s technological strength has attracted significant market interest, accumulating over $170 million through 26 presale rounds. Prices have escalated from $0.001 in the initial batch to $0.0234 in the latest, marking a substantial 2,240% increase. Experts now anticipate a potential 30,000x ROI for early participants. The continued momentum of BlockDAG’s presale indicates it is on course to reach its $600 million goal, reinforcing its status as a premier crypto acquisition. How BlockDAG May Surpass Litecoin in Future Gains While Litecoin has shown the benefits of early adoption, BlockDAG presents an even more promising opportunity. Its sophisticated technology offers unmatched scalability and security, essential for future blockchain demands. With a 2,240% increase in its value already, projections suggest a potential rise to $30 per coin by 2030. At the current presale price of $0.0234, these forecasts suggest growth that could far surpass that of Litecoin. BlockDAG is also tailored to modern needs with its low-code/no-code smart contract functionality, allowing users to develop and implement smart contracts with minimal technical expertise. This simplifies the application of blockchain technology for businesses, developers, and non-technical users, fostering wider adoption and enhancing the value of BDAG coins. The Next Wave of Millionaires Crypto success often arises from seizing opportunities before they become mainstream. While Litecoin has previously minted millionaires, BlockDAG stands as the top crypto presale with its state-of-the-art Layer 1 technology and potential for massive financial returns. For those considering this emerging leader, now is an ideal time to engage. BDAG coins are currently priced at just $0.0234, but as the sale of batch 26 nears completion, the shift to batch 27 could mean significant price increases. Immediate action is crucial to avoid missing out on what could be a transformative wealth-building opportunity.

After retesting levels below $2, the price is now maintaining bullish momentum. Bitcoin and other coins are also down right now, and some traders are taking advantage of the dip by buying more. The price of XRP has been consolidating around the $2 range, and this is where it could stay for a while, which is a good sign for holders. Overall, the market is seeing a lot of liquidations, with $680 million wiped out in the last 12 hours alone. Short-Term Price Range and Potential Movements Currently, XRP is trading between $1.96 and its all-time high of $3.30. The price remains squeezed within this range, and a potential upside movement could still emerge. A short-term bullish scenario could see one or two additional highs as part of a larger wave structure, similar to what is expected in other major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. Possible Elliott Wave Count and Structure There are two possible Elliott Wave counts on the XRP chart. The first suggests the top may already be in place, with the current price action forming a fourth wave triangle. If this count plays out, a final fifth wave could complete the current bullish cycle. The second wave count proposes that an additional 4-5% upside movement may occur before the cycle concludes. The focus remains on the current structure and its potential implications. Validation and Invalidations: Key Price Levels To keep the triangle scenario alive, XRP must stay above $1.90. If the price breaks below this level, it would invalidate the triangle count, suggesting a more direct ABC correction. This scenario would likely see XRP move lower before any potential recovery.

Recent reports highlight a significant influx of capital, with Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana collectively attracting $130 billion, signaling renewed investor confidence. Amidst this financial whirlwind, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves by addressing real-world challenges that have hindered blockchain adoption. Its innovative QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is set to simplify blockchain development, making it more accessible to developers of all skill levels. Qubetics ($TICS): Simplifying Blockchain Development with QubeQode IDE Qubetics is currently in its 13th presale stage, offering $TICS tokens at $0.0342. The project has already raised over $7 million, attracting more than 10,600 holders and selling over 355 million tokens. The QubeQode IDE is a game-changer in the blockchain space.

By addressing real-world challenges such as complex user interfaces and limited transaction scalability, Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in the blockchain space. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, representing a significant return on investment. To learn more about Qubetics, you can check this out: Watch the Video . Solana (SOL): Riding the Wave of Market Momentum Solana has been making headlines with its rapid growth and increasing market momentum.

Cardano (ADA): Steady Growth Amid Market Fluctuations Cardano continues to demonstrate steady growth, even amid market fluctuations. While Bitcoin recently dipped below $98,000, affecting the broader crypto market, Cardano has maintained its position, reflecting its resilience and the confidence of its community.

Its commitment to peer-reviewed research and a robust development roadmap further solidify its standing as a reliable blockchain platform.

As we edge closer to 2025, cryptocurrency markets are buzzing with activity, with investors closely monitoring the best cryptos to join in December 2024. From strategic acquisitions by whale investors to groundbreaking blockchain innovations, the latest developments have set the stage for an exhilarating year-end. Toncoin has captured headlines with its surging whale activity, while Render continues to intrigue analysts with its price forecasts for 2025 and beyond. However, the spotlight undoubtedly shines on Qubetics ($TICS), a project revolutionising blockchain technology with its unique presale structure and unmatched use cases. This article delves into the latest updates and opportunities surrounding these three cryptos: Qubetics, Toncoin, and Render. Let’s explore why Qubetics is leading the pack among the best cryptos to join in December 2024. Qubetics: Redefining Cross-Border Payments How do banks and financial institutions stay competitive in an increasingly interconnected world? Qubetics ($TICS) offers a revolutionary solution tailored to modern financial needs. Its cutting-edge blockchain network empowers institutions to perform near-instant cross-border payments and settlements, eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional systems. By forging strategic partnerships with the Qubetics Network, banks can achieve faster, more cost-effective, and transparent transactions. This advancement benefits businesses reliant on swift settlements to maintain operational efficiency and individuals seeking faster international remittances. Could this be the breakthrough that reshapes global finance?\ Adding to its momentum, Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session , engaging its vibrant community with insights and updates about the network’s vision and utility. With these developments, it’s no surprise that Qubetics is emerging as one of the best cryptos to join in December 2024. Toncoin: Whale Investors Fuel a 27% Surge Toncoin (TON), the cryptocurrency of The Open Network, has experienced a dramatic price surge, thanks to the involvement of major investors. By the end of November 2024, whales accumulated nearly $30 million worth of TON in just four days, driving a 27% price increase and pushing the token above $6.20. This bullish activity highlights growing confidence in Toncoin’s potential, amplified by recent regulatory changes such as the resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Its integration with Telegram’s 800-million-strong user base positions Toncoin as a frontrunner for mainstream adoption. With a market capitalisation of $13.96 billion, Toncoin is proving its relevance as a strategic asset in the evolving crypto market. Render: A Rollercoaster Year with Optimistic Projections The price of Render ($RENDER) currently sits at $7.71, reflecting a -3.14% decline this month. Despite this dip, long-term forecasts remain optimistic, with analysts predicting a potential high of $13.20 by the end of 2025 and a staggering $96.94 by 2030. Render has seen significant developments this year, with a 60.28% increase in GPU computing power usage during Q1 2024, leading to a strong rally in March. While its price has cooled since reaching a record high above $13.00, Render’s growing market cap of $3.02 billion underscores its resilience and potential for recovery. A Thrilling Opportunity: The Qubetics Presale What makes the Qubetics presale so compelling? In Phase 13, the presale boasts weekly phases with a 10% price hike, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. At just $0.034 per $TICS token, Qubetics has already raised over $7.3 million, attracted 10,900+ holders, and sold an impressive 363 million tokens. This unique structure rewards early participants and fuels anticipation with every phase. For investors seeking the best cryptos to join in December 2024 , Qubetics presents an unmatched opportunity. With its robust community backing and innovative approach, $TICS tokens are more than an investment—they’re a statement of trust in the future of blockchain. Conclusion: Why Qubetics ($TICS) Stands Out As December unfolds, Qubetics ($TICS), Toncoin, and Render each present unique opportunities for investors. While Toncoin benefits from whale activity and Render boasts strong long-term potential, Qubetics is redefining the crypto landscape with its revolutionary technology and presale strategy. For those seeking the best cryptos to join in December 2024, Qubetics offers an exciting chance to be part of a groundbreaking project at an early stage. With its momentum building and presale nearing completion, now is the time to secure your stake in $TICS tokens and position yourself at the forefront of blockchain innovation.

This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 02:25:24

The timing for the purchase couldn’t be less perfect, as the crypto market plunged after a hawkish Fed meeting on Wednesday where officials voted for the third and final interest rate cut of 2024 by 25 basis points. During the press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also addressed the prospect of the central bank building a strategic reserve of Bitcoin, one of Trump’s boldest campaign promises to the crypto industry. The official said that the central bank is legally not allowed to hold Bitcoin and is not looking for a law change. For context, in July 2024, Republican Senator Cyntia Lummis introduced a Bitcoin Act to create such a reserve, proposing to acquire 5 percent of the BTC supply funded by Fed bank deposits and gold holdings. Powell’s comments poured cold water on expectations that Bitcoin’s price will continue its upward trend fueled by optimism over Trump’s embrace of the crypto industry. Following the Fed meeting, Bitcoin saw a sharp decline, falling by 6% within hours to $98,900 after trading above $100,000 for the past week, during which it reached a new ATH of $108,135. Ethereum and other major altcoins mirrored the downturn, with ETH losing 11% since Wednesday and currently trading at $3,400. Despite backing from the president-elect, World Liberty Financial got off to a rocky start. The October public sale of WLFI tokens only managed to sell a little more than 4% of the coins. Because of lukewarm demand, the project had to slash its presale goal from $300 million to just $30 million. Besides stagnating sales, WLFI faces other behind-the-scenes issues, such as a lack of a well-defined roadmap, barriers to entry antithetical to the tenets of DeFi, and possible conflict of interest. The project, which was launched with the commitment to democratize and depoliticize finance through decentralized lending, directs the sale of WLFI tokens only to accredited investors who meet a certain wealth threshold, a criterion that excludes a broader audience from participating. WLFI scoops up alts and lends a helping hand to Justin Sun Besides Ethereum, World Liberty Financial has been actively shopping for other altcoins, including ETH, WBTC, AAVE, LINK, ENA, and ONDO. Meanwhile, the native token of CoW Protocol (COW) used by WLFI jumped nearly 35% over the last 24 hours due to investors’ speculative interest in the platform. On Thursday, World Liberty Financial swapped $10.4 million of cbBTC for wBTC, taking the side of a controversial crypto mogul Justin Sun in his brawl with Coinbase over wBTC delisting. The popular Bitcoin wrapper issued by BiT Global was delisted by Coinbase without much elaboration except its alleged incompatibility with the exchange’s listing standards. In response, BiT Global filed a lawsuit, claiming that the move was meant to give Coinbase’s own wrapper, cbBTC, an unfair advantage. Coinbase countered with the claim that Justin Sun’s control over BiT Global presented unacceptable risks for customers. While Justin Sun’s connection to BitGo may be less clear, his ties to World Liberty Financial are much more obvious. The $30 million investment in WLFI announced by Sun in November made him at the time the project’s largest investor. The following day, Sun was invited to join the advisory board, cementing the Sun-Trump alliance. Ethereum ETFs with record inflows in December Despite the market’s neurotic reaction to the Fed’s recent rate cut, Ethereum ETFs performed exceptionally well in December, The Block’s data suggests. This month has brought $1.66 billion in new investments to such products, which is 74% of the $2.24 billion total inflows since inception. The market structure of Ethereum ETFs remains highly concentrated, with BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) staying ahead of the competition by a wide margin. On December 5, ETHA recorded a single-day high of $292 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity's FETH as the second most popular choice. Other Ethereum ETF providers have garnered only modest investor interest compared to the broader distribution seen in Bitcoin ETFs.",News|Ethereum|Altcoins,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-21 02:29:49

Despite the recent waning performances, several key developments suggest that DOGE might be preparing for its next major rally to new heights in the short term. A Robust Rally To Higher Levels Incoming For Dogecoin Although Dogecoin is struggling to move upward, seasoned market expert and investor Kevin foresees a bullish outlook for DOGE in the near term. In his analysis, Kevin cited crucial indicators that point to the time frame that the much-anticipated next surge could begin for the meme coin. Referencing past cycle trends and present price conditions, the expert’s prediction implies that the current consolidation phase might be ending shortly. With key indicators showing rising momentum, the expected upswing may fuel a much larger rally, pushing the meme coin to unprecedented levels . Examining Dogecoin’s current price action, Kevin highlighted that DOGE has risen above the crucial level of 43 on the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI). According to the expert, Dogecoin never dropped below level 43 on the daily RSI during the last bull market. Specifically, the 43 level on the daily RSI is critical since this was the bounce zone that resulted in three consolidation phases that led to new highs. Recent data shows that the meme coin ‘s daily RSI has increased to level 47. Furthermore, Kevin noted that throughout the last bull market, Dogecoin never lost the zero line on the daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). This robust maintenance at the crucial indicator also served as a springboard to greater height when reached. Meanwhile, looking at the present price trend, the chart shows that the market will hit the zero line in about 3 to 4 days. Should the ongoing cycle mirror these past cycle trends, the market expert contends the current consolidation period is likely coming to an end in at least a week. As a result, Kevin is confident that DOGE’s next rally toward higher levels may begin around Christmas. Thus far, investors and traders are monitoring key support levels for a potential rebound as they anticipate the next significant leg-up. A Rebound On The Horizon? Dogecoin could be regaining its upside momentum once more as Trader Tradigrade, a crypto analyst, has predicted a potential recovery, noting that DOGE’s daily RSI has entered a critical rebound zone. Trader Tardigrade forecast is based on a previous scenario that triggered notable price spikes. The last time DOGE ‘s daily RSI reached the zone in September this year, the meme coin experienced a local bottom at $0.095. Following the development, DOGE rose significantly to the $0.48 price level. Given the same degree of gain prediction, Trader Tardigrade believes Dogecoin might surge to $1.35 from the zone.",Dogecoin|Consolidation Phase|Doge|dogecoin|Dogecoin's Daily RSI|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Kevin|MACD|meme coin|Moving Average Convergence Divergence|relative strength index|RSI|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-21 02:30:39

The SEC also accused Tai Mo Shan of unlawfully offering and selling LUNA, a cryptocurrency issued by Terraform, as unregistered securities. Misleading Investors About Terra USD Peg Stability The SEC alleged that Tai Mo Shan deceived investors by creating the impression that Terraform Labs’ algorithmic mechanism was maintaining the $1 peg of UST. When UST fell below its $1 value in May 2021, Tai Mo Shan entered an agreement with Terraform Labs to intervene in stabilizing the price. Under this agreement, Terraform incentivized Tai Mo Shan with discounted LUNA tokens to buy UST and attempt to restore its peg. On May 19, 2021, Tai Mo Shan made substantial purchases of UST, totaling over $20 million, which temporarily stabilized the stablecoin’s price. The SEC stated that these actions misled the market into believing that Terraform’s algorithm was maintaining the peg, while the stability was actually driven by Tai Mo Shan’s trades. This conduct was deemed negligent by the SEC, as investors were not informed about the reliance on external intervention to stabilize UST. Role as a Statutory Underwriter for LUNA The SEC’s findings revealed that Tai Mo Shan acted as a statutory underwriter for Terraform Labs by acquiring LUNA tokens with the intent to resell them on U.S.-based platforms. From January 2021 to May 2022, Tai Mo Shan offered and sold these tokens as securities without proper registration, violating U.S. securities laws. The SEC classified LUNA as a security, noting that Tai Mo Shan acquired the cryptocurrency from Terraform for distribution to the public. This activity further contributed to the SEC’s charges of unregistered securities offerings. As part of the settlement, Tai Mo Shan agreed to pay $73.45 million in disgorgement, $12.91 million in prejudgment interest, and a $36.72 million civil penalty. These penalties aim to address the illegal gains obtained through misleading actions and unregistered transactions. Tai Mo Shan neither admitted nor denied the findings of the SEC’s investigation. However, the company agreed to comply with a cease-and-desist order prohibiting future violations of federal securities laws. US SEC’s Statement on Investor Protection SEC Chair Gary Gensler emphasized the need for compliance in the crypto markets, stating, “Too many times in the crypto markets, we’ve seen investor losses due to fraud. Regardless of the labels, crypto market participants should comply with securities laws and not deceive the public. Otherwise, investors get hurt.” The SEC also highlighted that Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, were found liable for fraud and unregistered securities offerings earlier in 2024. Terraform and Kwon agreed to pay $4.5 billion to compensate harmed investors, demonstrating the widespread fallout from the Terra ecosystem’s collapse. This case marks another step in the SEC’s ongoing efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry and protect investors from deceptive practices.

While Ripple (XRP) grapples with regulatory challenges and Toncoin (TON) struggles to find its identity in a saturated market, Lightchain AI is emerging as a powerful contender with its unique approach to AI-powered blockchain technology. Let’s unpack why this token is causing such a stir in the crypto community. Where Ripple and Toncoin Fall Short Even with their set places, both Ripple and Toncoin are up against troubles that make them not so nice to smart investors. Ripple’s XRP stays favored, but its worth is greatly swayed by ongoing law fights with the SEC creating doubt about its long-term chance. On the other side, Toncoin, even with its link to Telegram, has a hard time finding who it is. Aside from its aim on growth, TON misses a clear story which makes it hard to get a loyal g͏roup of builders or gain wide use. On the other hand Lightchain AI shines as a forward-looking plan with its special focus on smart solutions and an open, good roadmap. A Deeper Look Into Lightchain AI’s Vision Lightchain AI is setting itself apart from other blockchain projects by focusing on the integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), rather than simply addressing scalability or payment solutions. Its mission is to go beyond decentralization and create an ecosystem where blockchain technology fuels advanced AI capabilities for real-world applications. At its core is the Adaptive AI Framework, powered by the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), which evolves with community input to stay on the cutting edge of AI innovation. Ethical AI development is another cornerstone of Lightchain AI’s vision. By leveraging Proof of Intelligence (PoI), the platform ensures energy-efficient and purposeful computations, addressing pressing concerns around AI ethics and sustainability. Additionally, Lightchain AI has already begun establishing partnerships in industries such as healthcare and finance, ensuring its technology is applied to practical, impactful use cases. Features Driving Lightchain AI’s Popularity Several key features make Lightchain AI a standout project. Its Dynamic AI Ecosystem Expansion emphasizes the creation of an open-source innovation hub, allowing developers from various industries to collaborate on groundbreaking projects. This dynamic approach contrasts with the static nature of other platforms. Data privacy is also a central focus of Lightchain AI. By using privacy-preserving technologies like homomorphic encryption, the platform ensures the security of sensitive AI data computations, which is particularly critical for industries like healthcare and finance. Furthermore, Lightchain AI is building strong global cross-industry partnerships. The platform is actively engaging with enterprises to implement its technology in areas such as logistics optimization, predictive analytics, and climate modeling—markets that remain unexplored by many other projects in the blockchain space. Why Smart Money Is Betting on Lightchain AI Institutional investors and crypto whales have started accumulating LCAI tokens, and for good reason. Lightchain AI addresses inefficiencies in traditional AI models while offering blockchain-backed decentralization. One area of focus is AI-driven decentralized finance (DeFi), where Lightchain AI enhances platforms with predictive models to enable smarter lending and borrowing mechanisms. The platform also provides advanced developer tools, such as APIs and SDKs, to streamline the development of AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps), which in turn attracts top-tier talent to the ecosystem. Sustainability is another major draw for investors, as Proof of Intelligence significantly reduces the platform’s carbon footprint, appealing to those who prioritize environmentally conscious investments. With its innovative approach and real-world applications, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to lead the way in the integration of blockchain and AI.

The controversy emerged following unsubstantiated claims by a Hedera community member that sparked intense discussion across digital asset markets. The initial assertions came from Shawn (@oroogle) on X. According to his statements , the president-elect’s team had developed plans to establish a national cryptocurrency reserve incorporating not only Bitcoin but also XRP and Hedera’s HBAR token. These digital assets were supposedly classified as “American Commodities” in a broader strategy to position the United States as a global leader in cryptocurrency innovation. The claims extended beyond reserve status, suggesting comprehensive integration of both Hedera and Ripple technologies into American electoral and financial infrastructure. Perhaps most notably, these statements included an alleged quote from Eric Trump suggesting his father’s intention to implement tax exemptions for domestically developed cryptocurrencies to reinforce American dominance in the digital asset sector. Will HBAR and XRP Join the Strategic Reserve? Donald Trump has shown notable support for cryptocurrencies, recently nominating a pro-crypto successor to Gary Gensler, current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and well-known anti-crypto figure. However, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson intervened to address what he characterized as misinformation circulating within the cryptocurrency community. According to Hoskinson, any consideration for a strategic reserve would be limited exclusively to Bitcoin, with no plans to include alternative cryptocurrencies. This isn't accurate. The reserve is only for Bitcoin — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 18, 2024 The cryptocurrency community’s response has been notably divided, as some participants commending Hoskinson’s effort to maintain factual accuracy in industry discourse. Others, however, questioned his motivations, suggesting potential bias due to Cardano’s absence from the purported reserve plans. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Further skepticism regarding the feasibility of any cryptocurrency reserve has emerged from prominent industry figures. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has published a detailed analysis arguing against the likelihood of such an initiative. Hayes emphasized that existing governmental priorities, particularly those related to social program funding, would likely preclude the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve. Hayes’ analysis also addressed potential market implications, warning of increased volatility in cryptocurrency markets. He specifically highlighted concerns about market instability around the anticipated presidential inauguration in January 2025, suggesting that the president-elect’s perceived cryptocurrency-friendly stance might overly influence current market optimism. However, with rumors that Trump wants to eliminate capital gains taxes on U.S.-based cryptocurrencies, the market could end up in a better place even if the Bitcoin reserve is not established as many expect.

For the Japanese, anything would beat being taxed at 55%, or in the case of inheritance tax, sometimes 110% on crypto gains, and being unable to offset losses. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Japan has finalized an outline for tax reform plans in 2025, in a meeting held on December 20. In a post to X , house member Junichi Kanda summarized the annual meeting of the nation’s tax commission, noting: “The LDP Tax Commission and Tax System Research Council general meeting finalized the outline of tax reform for fiscal year 2025. The report also included future considerations regarding the tax system for crypto assets.” The news is bullish for mainstream crypto investors, who have been suffering under tax rates as high as 55% on gains in the country, or even — in some cases — mind-blowing gouges to the tune of 110% (more than the value of the actual asset) where inheritance tax on crypto comes into play. House of Representatives member Junichi Kanda posted Friday about the development on social media platform X. Industry players and crypto holders alike have been urging politicians, such as Democratic Party for the People (DPP) leader Yuichiro Tamaki , to revamp the prohibitive system. But recently elected prime minister Shigeru Ishiba has been publicly doubtful of the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies as an asset class, ostensibly standing against such reform. Bitcoiners and crypto-heads in Japan are pushing for a separate 20% rate for crypto gains, which will include the ability to offset losses via a carryover system. According to local media , former minister for digital transformation (DX) and house member Takuya Hirai also submitted a proposal via the FSA (Financial Services Agency) to the minister of finance, to “make crypto assets an asset that contributes to the national economy.” The proposal, which included a separate tax scheme for crypto — instead of considering gains “miscellaneous income” as is currently the case — was reportedly well-received by Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato. Concrete movements toward reform are now expected, but as it stands for 2024, the tax law in the nation remains as convoluted as the Tokyo Metro subway, minus the efficiency and usefulness.

A crypto analyst has warned of an impending XRP price crash, urging investors not to get distracted as the RSI is still significantly above 50%. Discussing his predictions through short and long-term XRP price charts, the analyst shows that the cryptocurrency is firmly positioned in a bullish trend despite impending corrections. XRP Price RSI Hints At Potential Crash On the 4-hour XRP chart, a double tap structure is highlighted in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a technical indicator used to measure the momentum of a cryptocurrency. This double tap pattern typically signals further downward movement before a price stabilization. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash 2 Days Ago, Full Prediction Shows A Further 30% Decline According to Dark Defender, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), the RSI’s recurrent dips into oversold territory indicate that XRP could experience a price crash to new lows. The analyst disclosed that the XRP price had previously found strong support at $2.17; however, the cryptocurrency experienced a bounce to the upside. After hitting this support level, the XRP price is now consolidating, a pattern often associated with a potential uptrend after a correction. Despite the slight market recovery, the analyst has warned of another impending price crash in this same support zone as the RSI approaches oversold levels once more. Earlier in December, the RSI had hit oversold territories after dipping below 30%. Now XRP’s RSI is above 50% and signaling a potential to experience a price correction between the support levels at $2.17 and $2.18. Dark Defender has revealed that this price crash could occur soon as XRP is expected to enter oversold territory within a day. Despite this potential price correction, the analyst has acknowledged that the XRP’s broader outlook still looks bullish, with an uptrend continuation expected once the market consolidates following its projected price dip to new lows. Dark Defender has also predicted that XRP’s next price target after this projected correction is likely above $3, marking an almost 40% increase from the $2.17 support area. XRP 3-Month Chart Signals Strong Bullish Set Up Following his predictions that the XRP price could crash as it enters oversold conditions, Dark Defender also shared a 3-month chart analysis, painting a brighter outlook for the cryptocurrency. The chart shows that XRP has recently broken through a multi-year resistance level for the first time in over five years, signaling a strong bullish shift. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Not The End As Analyst Predicts Another 52% Jump The three-month green candle structure between October and December confirms strong buying pressure, setting the stage for a potentially bullish Q1 2025 from January to March. A rounded bottom pattern can also be seen on the XRP 3-month chart. This pattern is a classic bullish reversal structure that indicates a gradual move from a downtrend to an uptrend. Dark Defender has marked several Fibonacci levels as potential price targets for XRP. According to the analyst, XRP could see a 261.80% rise to the 5.8563 Fibonacci level between $5 to $9. After which, the analyst expects a 361.80% surge to the 18.2275 Fibonacci between $16 to $28. Support levels at the 0.6649 Fibonacci at $0.9 have also been highlighted, acting as a safety net for XRP during price corrections.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/78-of-litecoin-addresses-held-ltc-for-over-a-year-heres-the-significance/,"Recent data from IntoTheBlock highlights notable trends in Litecoin (LTC) holder behavior, offering insights into market dynamics and investor sentiment. According to the analysis shared on X, 78% of Litecoin addresses have held their LTC for over a year, demonstrating an accumulation pattern during bear markets and distribution near peak price levels. This provides valuable context for assessing market sentiment and potential future price movements. 78% of Litecoin addresses have held their $LTC for over a year, typically accumulating during bear markets and selling near peak prices. In this cycle, the slight decrease in long-term holdings is less marked than in past cycles, indicating that many holders are expecting… pic.twitter.com/nB7YuoYEKv — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 19, 2024 Litecoin (LTC) Accumulation in 2024 The data illustrates the consistent role of long-term holders in Litecoin’s market. Historically, these holders have exhibited patience, building positions during periods of low market activity. The accumulation during bearish phases aligns with strategic investment approaches, often reflecting confidence in Litecoin’s long-term value. Conversely, as market cycles progress toward price peaks, these same holders have tended to realize gains, contributing to short-term volatility. An intriguing aspect of the current market cycle is the relatively small decline in long-term holdings compared to previous cycles. This suggests a shift in market sentiment, with many long-term investors maintaining their positions despite price fluctuations. IntoTheBlock notes that this trend may indicate “expectations of further price growth,” signaling optimism regarding Litecoin’s future performance. Litecoin (LTC) Holders Beginning to Sell Although the hodlers have risen in 2024, the chart shows sell-offs during notable rallies. LTC experienced this in 2018 and 2021 when it reached new all-time highs. There was also a slight dip in early 2024 when Bitcoin rose to a new all-time high above $67,000, and Litecoin crossed $100 for the first time in almost a year. The end of the chart also shows this intriguing pattern, as the hodlers are beginning to drop. Litecoin recently experienced a massive resurgence, surpassing $120 for the first time since 2022, and it seems some investors are taking profits. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Is Litecoin About to Climb? Despite this dip, LTC hodlers are still the highest in the asset’s history. This fact, combined with the long period they have held the tokens, reinforces the point made by IntoTheBlock that these token holders are anticipating a bigger price surge. The incoming Donald Trump administration is bringing a crypto-friendly SEC Chair and pro-crypto policies and regulations that could help the market climb further. Litecoin has maintained a loyal base of long-term investors. This base has likely contributed to price stability, even during periods of heightened volatility across the broader cryptocurrency market, and it seems they might reap rewards for their loyalty.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB.

The SEC has charged Tai Mo Shan Limited, a subsidiary of Jump Crypto Holdings LLC for misleading investors about Terra USD stability and selling unregistered securities. The story doesn’t just expose a company but raises questions about the broader crypto ecosystem. How did things go so wrong? Let’s dig in. The Truth Behind Terra Terra USD was supposed to be a stablecoin. As the name suggests, such a token should remain stable as it should be pegged to $1. Tai Mo Shan played a role in assuring investors it was safe, claiming Terraform Labs’ algorithm kept everything in check. But things weren’t as solid as they seemed. When UST lost its $1 peg in May 2021, Tai Mo Shan stepped in. They made $20 million worth of trades to stabilize the price, temporarily. Could they save it? No. Behind the scenes, the company had an agreement with Terraform Labs. They’d stabilize UST in exchange for discounted LUNA tokens. Investors weren’t told the truth. The peg wasn’t held by some magical algorithm but by external interventions. The SEC calls this misleading. Hard to argue with that. SEC Labels LUNA Sales as Securities Here’s where it gets messier. From January 2021 to May 2022, Tai Mo Shan acquired LUNA tokens from Terraform Labs. Then they resold them on U.S. based exchanges. The SEC sees LUNA and most of the crypto tokens as a security, as we all know. So, by acting as a statutory underwriter and failing to register these offerings, the company broke securities laws. Tai Mo Shan agreed to pay over $123 million in fines , prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. They’re also under a cease and desist order now. But an important thing to note here is that they didn’t admit to the charges. They’re not exactly waving a white flag, just agreeing to move on. What to Expect For the crypto world, Terra collapse was a wake up call. And the SEC is tightening the reins on crypto. Gary Gensler, who is stepping down in January as the SEC chair, shared that protecting investors from fraud is a top priority. This case shows how fragile the systems can be and how much investors rely on trust. Though the new administration is focusing on creating a nurturing environment for the digital space, cases like this highlights the need for strict regulations.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Scam,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|LUNA|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-21 03:51:31

This is why so many investors continue to allocate toward the huge disruption of the Rollblock ($RBLK) GambleFi presale, which experts predict will return 50x this year on the strength of its growing community casino platform. Rollblock ($RBLK) Momentum Already At Fever Pitch During Presale Rollblock ($RBLK) is an opportunity that doesn’t come along very often in crypto, as this blockchain-backed betting platform seeks to disrupt the $450 billion online gambling industry with its focus on trust and transparency. Rollblock offers a fully functioning Web3 casino that includes over 7000 games alongside a sports betting league that opens up the huge world of esports to Rollblock gamers. The Rollblock community is currently rallying around this recent update on the Rollblock Discord server, sharing wins and adding to the massive hype. Everything is fully encrypted onto the Ethereum blockchain, meaning that all transactions can be verified to ensure a transparent gaming experience. This gives players peace of mind and prevents the house from manipulating bets. The $RBLK token runs the entire ecosystem and rewards its holders with exclusive VIP benefits, free spins, and staking rewards with hassle-free yield of up to 30%. Regular buybacks from Rollblock will ensure a deflationary supply, as 60% of these purchases are burned while the remaining 40% is placed back in the hands of community stakers. This lucrative rewards scheme will mean that demand will far outstrip supply in 2025 and boost the price of $RBLK up to 50 times higher than its current level of $0.043. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) Airdrop Meets With Market Apathy The Pudgy Penguins token was recently launched as members of the Pudgy Penguins NFT community were airdropped large numbers of coins, along with crypto OGs from various chains, including Solana and Ethereum. The Pudgy Penguins NFT floor price rose steadily in anticipation of this airdrop but has since fallen by 40% as the Pedgy Penguins token has not rallied as expected. Pudgy Penguins is down by 26% to trade at $0.02. Nonetheless, analysts believe that Pudgy Penguins could take its place as a leading NFT token as it represents one of the most recognizable brands in crypto. Magic Eden ($ME) Quests Fail To Propel Token Price Magic Eden has also failed to follow its early promise, falling from $10 on its initial launch at the start of December to its current level of $2.85. Magic Eden offers NFT and crypto token trading and can be staked for up to 4 years, requiring holders to lock up Magic Eden tokens for a set time frame. Magic Eden holders can perform quests to earn more rewards, a unique feature that should send Magic Eden into the top 100 next year. Rollblock Ready To Rock The Gaming World This Year While Pudgy Penguins and Magic Eden have yet to gain real momentum, Rollblock ($RBLK) remains the best bet for many investors to scale in early to one of the most promising projects in all of crypto gaming. Stage 9 tokens are selling out rapidly, and the price looks set for a further hike to $0.052 as it progresses to the next stage in the coming days.

Whales Loading Up for a Massive Bull Run,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/ethereum-price-prediction-eth-to-20k-whales-loading-up-for-a-massive-bull-run/,"The post Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH to $20K? Whales Loading Up for a Massive Bull Run appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum is struggling to maintain a level above $4k, even in a bull run, but where can Ethereum go? Coincodex has the Ethereum price prediction at quite bullish, but a $20k mark seems a ways off. This begs the question of whether Ethereum is a good investment or if there are alternatives like Lunex Network to set the market on fire. Ethereum (ETH): The Road To 20k? The market had a red week in the second week of December as investors took a well-deserved profit off the massive November gains. One of the tokens that underperformed was Ethereum. While Solana and Bitcoin – and a host of others – reached their ATHs during the November bull run, Ethereum maxed out at a hair over $4k, still almost $900 short of its ATH. The Ethereum price prediction is relatively bullish, and Coincodex predicts ETH will break the $4k mark by the new year. Is this enough, though? The Ethereum price prediction is said to max out this cycle at just under $7k in November next year before falling to about $4,700. But what about the mythical $20k mark for the Ethereum price prediction? Coincodex says that is a long time off. 2033, to be exact. That will mark a 5x return for Ethereum. The Bitcoin price prediction for the same timeline is over $700k for a 7x return. The Ethereum price prediction says it’s not a great investment. Lunex Network (LNEX): A Rising Star For The Next Bull Run The cryptocurrency market thrives on cycles, and during a bull run, savvy investors seek out opportunities with massive growth potential. While major tokens like Ethereum grab headlines, the real gains often lie with emerging platforms like Lunex Network . Lunex Network is a next-generation Web3 decentralized exchange offering users unparalleled ease of use, security, and scalability. Though utilizing non-custodial wallets, Lunex eliminates the need to keep tokens in exchange, which ensures complete user control over assets. Sporting over 50,000 trading pairs across multiple blockchains, it’s firing a warning shot across the bow of established exchanges like BNB and Uniswap: Lunex is coming! Unlike larger tokens that often plateau during bull runs, Lunex Network offers exponential growth potential. Its innovative technology, which combines on-chain and off-chain elements, ensures lightning-fast transactions while maintaining the decentralized integrity that crypto enthusiasts demand. Leveraging features such as a liquidity aggregator and a robust staking program, Lunex positions itself as the disrupting force in the DeFi and crypto exchange ecosystem. For investors looking to maximize returns, Lunex Network represents an opportunity to participate in a project designed for long-term scalability and user-focused innovation. While giants like Ethereum promise steady progress, Lunex could redefine expectations during the next bull run. Conclusion Investing in crypto can be highly lucrative, and the appeal to established tokens like Ethereum is undeniable. However, these big guns are not necessarily the best tokens to invest in, even in a bull run. The Ethereum price prediction is bullish, but it’s not bullish enough considering the growth potential of tokens like Lunex Network. Smaller undervalued tokens like Lunex Network can return 100x – even more – at the same time it would take Ethereum to make a mere doubling of value. It’s worth adding Lunex Network to a well-balanced crypto portfolio. Lunex Network is now available at $0.0046.

What 2025 Holds for Decentralized Exchanges",https://dailyhodl.com/2024/12/20/no-middleman-no-problem-what-2025-holds-for-decentralized-exchanges/,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post In 2024, DEXs (decentralized exchanges) snagged a greater portion of the crypto trading pie, demonstrating the future of finance is firmly headed toward decentralization. And Trump’s recent victory has only reinforced this trend, with Bitcoin’s price surging to nearly $91,000 . As monthly DEX trading volume soared above $250 billion in March and June 2024 for the first time since 2021, it’s clear that traders are increasingly opting for the benefits of autonomy and transparency these platforms offer. Over the past 12 months, several DEX platforms have refined their offerings to enhance the trading experience while prioritizing financial inclusivity and trust. This evolution indicates that the market is not just progressing – it has reached a level of maturity that some skeptics never anticipated. But these successes did not come without some hurdles. As 2025 approaches, 2024’s achievements and setbacks serve as a roadmap for where the market is heading. While no crystal ball can predict the future, one can assume that the steady shift from CEXs (centralized exchanges) to DEXs is just the beginning. DEX developments and challenges in 2024 This year, the DeFi (decentralized finance) landscape continued to grow significantly, particularly with the advancements in concentrated liquidity models. While these advancements enhance DeFi by providing greater capital efficiency and enabling users to concentrate liquidity in specific ranges, it’s no secret that this advancement was achieved at the expense of liquidity providers. On the governance front, 2024 saw the emergence of ‘DAO wars,’ where various DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) engaged in strategic maneuvers to assert dominance. These organizational rivalries add another layer of complexity to the DeFi ecosystem with DAOs fighting for control, leading to opportunities and risks for participants. As DAOs compete for influence, they have experimented with novel voting mechanisms, management strategies and community incentives to help attract and retain participants. This competitive environment has led to both innovation and volatility, with some DAOs forming alliances to strengthen their position, while others engage in aggressive tactics to undermine their rivals. In January 2024, a blockchain interoperability project launched a crypto bridge to allow a staked ETH token to move across multiple blockchains but did so without waiting for approval from the token’s governing body. This move sparked controversy, with critics accusing the project of overstepping its bounds and trying to lock in users ahead of its competitors. These challenges are especially significant because they expose the limitations and vulnerabilities of decentralized governance, specifically in areas like accountability and decision-making speed, further exposing cracks in the community. The rise of intent-based trading has also transformed the DeFi experience. These tools have invited users to implement sophisticated cross-chain strategies and facilitate wallet seeding, enhancing the overall multi-chain experience. This has streamlined functionality, allowing users to navigate DEX intricacies more efficiently without managing multiple networks. While we can’t know for sure what next year will bring, the past year can help guide DEX developers and users to anticipate what lies ahead. What to look out for in 2025 The rise of AI in trading strategies will likely enhance market dynamics, helping traders optimize their DEX performance. This integration has already taken off in the TradFi landscape, and as DeFi continues to see sustained growth, the technology’s inevitable integration will address challenges like limited liquidity, slippage and price manipulation. AI’s capabilities are certainly compelling. Its ability to predict price swings, identify arbitrage opportunities and mitigate risks will only improve with more data, making it a critical resource for DeFi and its participants. As DeFi protocols continue to evolve, its focus has shifted towards creating and utilizing aggregated assets to address long-standing liquidity and user experience issues. Aggregating liquidity from various sources similar to CEXs that accept deposits from different channels allows DEXs to offer more efficient trading experiences. For instance, protocols might allow users to deposit different stablecoins such as USDC into a unified liquidity pool, simplifying the user interface and expanding the trading pairs. This aggregation also improves the execution of the trades, reducing slippage and enhancing price discovery. However, as managing these complex assets becomes more difficult, so does the potential risk exposure across different types of assets. When multiple deposit types are integrated into a protocol, a single exploit in one of the bridges or smart contracts can ripple across the entire ecosystem. Ultimately, the vulnerabilities threaten a platform’s financial stability but also expose the ecosystem to larger systemic risks. Securing these aggregated assets will be one of the defining factors of growth and sustainability in 2025 and beyond. In regulation, up until now, the tax structuring for digital assets has been a poorly conceived policy, often resembling the taxation of unrealized gains in traditional markets. Under the Trump administration, the expectation is that taxes will be lowered and more nuanced in the US, leading to better relations between government agencies and decentralized organizations, and creating an environment that breeds opportunity and innovation rather than FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt). While many crypto builders and activists believe Trump will ‘make crypto great again,’ only time can tell if that will actually happen. While the future remains uncertain, the challenges of 2024 can serve as a roadmap for the advancement of DEXs as we enter the new year. While DEXs have their imperfections, their advantages far outweigh the drawbacks, positioning DeFi for a promising surge in the market . In the coming year, expect DEX developers to deepen their commitment to crafting a better user experience, focusing on building long-term solutions that support the ongoing goals of DeFi.

Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared across networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without the need for intermediaries. By employing a system of parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing transactions more efficiently than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The native token, DOT, is used for governance and staking within the network. Holders of DOT can participate in decision-making processes and contribute to transaction validation. Developed by Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, and maintained by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot launched on May 26, 2020. The protocol aims to create a more interconnected and efficient blockchain ecosystem. Its technology addresses key limitations of existing blockchains, such as scalability and interoperability. In the current market cycle, Polkadot continues to develop its technology and expand its ecosystem. Its focus on interoperability and scalability addresses significant challenges in the blockchain industry. As the demand for cross-chain solutions grows, Polkadot’s role may become increasingly significant. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that implements the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains that may orphan blocks created in parallel, GHOSTDAG allows these blocks to coexist and orders them in the consensus. This approach results in a block directed acyclic graph (blockDAG) rather than a single chain. Kaspa aims for secure operation while achieving high block rates—currently one block per second—with goals to increase this to 10 blocks per second and eventually 100 blocks per second. Confirmation times are minimized and are primarily affected by internet latency. Kaspa includes features such as Reachability for querying the DAG’s topology and block data pruning, with plans for block header pruning. It supports Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs and is preparing for future subnetwork support to ease the implementation of layer 2 solutions. These technological advancements focus on enhancing scalability and speed in cryptocurrency transactions. In the current market cycle, Kaspa introduces a unique approach to consensus and blockchain structure that contributes to ongoing discussions about the evolution of blockchain technology. Conclusion DOT and KAS are strong, but XYZVerse (XYZ) unites sports fans in a unique memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth, aspiring to be the G.O.A.T in the current bull run.

This Exchange Token Looks Primed for 1,000% Gains While Ripple & Ethereum Face Challenges",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/dtx-exchange-dtx-skyrockets-500-more-price-gains-ahead/,"The post Experts Say Don’t Miss the Next Big Thing! This Exchange Token Looks Primed for 1,000% Gains While Ripple & Ethereum Face Challenges appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) are seeing slight price dips at the moment. However, many analysts like Crypto Tony and Ali remain bullish on them. They have made some price predictions that have stunned the community. Meanwhile, experts are paying close attention to DTX Exchange (DTX) , a phase six presale phenomenon that may skyrocket by 1,000% in 2025. Since this altcoin has seen a 500% growth so far, this prediction has some merit. DTX Exchange (DTX) Skyrockets 500%, More Price Gains Ahead DTX Exchange (DTX) aims to revolutionize online trading while Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) experience hardships. This upcoming trading platform will launch in Q1 of 2025, combining the best features of CEX and DEX. On it, people will be able to trade over 120,000 asset classes, including FX and crypto. This will also come with a leverage of up to 1000x. Although people are excited about the DTX Exchange platform, its ecosystem will also include other products that have already been launched: VulcanX Blockchain: The testnet for this blockchain was launched and saw 100K TPS. Phoenix Wallet: A custody solution for crypto coins, stocks and more. CoinMarketCap Listing: The DTX native token, now in its presale, was listed on CoinMarketCap. Speaking of DTX, it will be the native token of this platform. Holding this altcoin will give traders governance voting rights, a portion of the trading fee revenue, and more. Currently, one DTX costs $0.12, which is a 500% growth from its starting price. However, this price will reach $0.14 after phase seven begins. Everybody is excited, as a Tier-1 CEX listing is expected to trigger a rally to $0.20. With over 300K wallets already owning DTX, it is clear that this altcoin may become a fan favorite for fast returns. Ripple (XRP) Shows Red Price Charts, Analyst Remains Optimistic Ripple (XRP) is among the top 5 cryptocurrencies, but it has seen some price dips. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Ripple fell over 10% on the weekly chart. In that period, its value saw movement between around $2.30 and close to $2. Nevertheless, market analyst Crypto Tony excited traders with his Ripple price prediction. In a recent X post, he told his followers that this altcoin looks healthy and that a pullback is good. He set $3.80 for Ripple (XRP) as a price target. Although the Ripple crypto may see a rebound soon, experts think its highest upswings have passed. This altcoin has seen a surge of nearly 250% on the YTD chart. Therefore, many traders are looking at DTX Exchange for noteworthy gains instead. Ethereum (ETH) on a Downtrend, Ali With a Bold Price Prediction Ethereum (ETH) has also seen some red price charts in the past week. On the one-week chart, its value has sunk from around $3,900 to nearly $3,100. This is nearly a 20% drop in just seven days, as per CoinMarketCap. But traders still have faith in the Ethereum coin, and many analysts are making exciting price predictions. For example, prominent market analyst Ali thinks that after Ethereum (ETH) passes the $4,100 resistance level, it may reach $6,000. Although this Ethereum price prediction has made some headlines, it is worth noting that its market cap now sits at $373B. This means the Ethereum price will need a large influx of new money to skyrocket. On the other hand, DTX will not face this issue. Can DTX Exchange (DTX) Outshine Ripple (XRP) & Ethereum (ETH)? While Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) are facing some turbulence right now, experts are growing more bullish for DTX Exchange (DTX). Demand is rising for this altcoin, with over $10M raised so far. As the demand rises, so will its price. Its smaller market cap could make a noteworthy price surge very easy to achieve. Thus, many experts foresee this crypto coin soaring by 1,000% in 2025.

It currently appeared bearish on the day with no sign of halting correction at the time of writing. In the first week, Gala advanced bullish rally but later faced rejection after registering over 100% gain in November. This rejection led to a halt in the rally and the price traded calmly for the rest of that week. Earlier last week, it lost grip above the $0.06 level and nosedived into $0.04. The price recovered briefly from there and later stopped buying at $0.055 due to a rejection. It remains indecisive for three days and broke down steadily until it tested $0.032 today for the first time in a month. The price is approaching the $0.03 level that flipped during last month’s rally. Locating support above this key level could fuel a new buy order capable of bringing the bulls back on track. As of now, the bears are still in charge of the market on the daily scale. While the latest price correction is healthy for the market, we can expect a bounce back anytime soon. A deeper correction from the current price level could reset the market back to the $0.02 level before rising back. It is currently down 36% in the past week of trading. Gala’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview As today turns out more volatile, the bears are now approaching $0.031. If they reclaim it, the $0.0263 support would be their next target. Lower supports considered for drops are $0.0216 and $0.017. Pushing back above the $0.0405 level, there’s a minor resistance at the $0.048 level. Reclaiming the $0.055 level could trigger a full recovery to the monthly $0.065 high before exploding to a new high. Key Resistance Levels: $0.0405, $0.055, $0.0666 Key Support Levels: $0.031, $0.0263, $0.0216 Spot Price: $0.0326 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Meanwhile, Lunex, a new crypto project, is gaining traction. Lunex is a Web3 multi-chain bridge network that helps you instantly swap your assets between blockchains without having to trust any third party. Solana price predictions have sparked excitement, but understanding what’s driving the market is key. Similarly, Lunex presents the dynamics of how innovation defines the crypto sphere. It can demonstrate the opportunities in the rapidly developing sphere. Let’s break it down. Lunex: The new crypto redefining rewards and convenience Lunex hasn’t taken long to gain traction in the crypto market, and for good reason. As a new crypto project, it combines innovation with practical solutions for everyday users. Among the features, it is necessary to mention the Lunex crypto card, which can perform the conversion process from crypto to fiat instantly. The Lunex black card, which is available only to VIP presale clients, is only valid for 200 users and provides great benefits. This traction has also been driven by the Lunex presale, which has attracted a lot of attention. Hence, with the token price of $0.0046, it had been able to raise over $5.3 million. This strong support shows that people are developing trust in Lunex. For early adopters, it is a possibility to invest in a potentially successful project from scratch. Another reason for Lunex’s success is its tokenomics. All merchant and token listing fees are paid in $LNEX, making it a deflationary asset. This creates natural buying pressure, helping to maintain a stable floor price. It’s a system designed to benefit long-term holders while supporting the overall ecosystem. For those looking to earn passive income, Lunex staking is a game-changer. By holding $LNEX for just 30 days, you can earn up to 18% APY. Better yet, you can grow your staking portfolio without lowering your initial returns. Lunex isn’t just a new crypto—it’s building a comprehensive system that rewards its users. With its deflationary model, innovative card, and attractive staking options, it’s no wonder Lunex is gaining momentum. Solana price prediction: paving the way for a $315 breakout Solana is currently in a pivotal consolidation phase, which has traders and investors eyeing a potential breakout. A bullish flag pattern has emerged, signaling a possible surge in the asset’s value. Analysts suggest this accumulation period could push Solana’s price to $315, fueled by growing market confidence and strategic positioning. Such patterns often precede significant price hikes, aligning with positive Solana price predictions. The outflow of $112.29 million in SOL from exchanges shows rising demand for Solana. This shift to private wallets limits circulating supply, increasing demand and price potential. This investment behavior shows long-term trust in Solana’s ecosystem. Additionally, Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) recently rose by $618.4 million, reflecting increased activity across its protocols. These developments reinforce optimistic Solana price predictions, underscoring its strong momentum in the crypto market. Solana sets big goals, but Lunex is making waves – which will you bet on? When it comes to crypto, there’s room for everyone to shine. While Solana’s ambitious price prediction has its fans excited, Lunex is making waves with its innovative features and growing momentum. Whether you’re cheering for Solana or diving into Lunex, you’re part of a thrilling era for digital assets!

This steep correction has mirrored the broader market’s turbulence, intensifying negative sentiment around XRP. However, notable developments are emerging beneath the surface of this bearish price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Reveals No Significant Panic Selling In The Market – Shakeout Or Trend Shift? Key on-chain data from Santiment reveals that whales are taking advantage of the dip. In the last 24 hours alone, these large holders have accumulated an additional 110 million XRP, demonstrating significant confidence in the asset’s long-term prospects. Historically, whale activity during negative sentiment often signals strategic positioning for future gains. This accumulation trend suggests that whales are undeterred by short-term price fluctuations, focusing instead on XRP’s potential in the coming months. As retail traders grow increasingly cautious amidst the recent drop, the actions of these large holders highlight a different perspective. While the immediate outlook for XRP remains uncertain, the notable whale activity is a bullish indicator for the long run. Whether this signals a bottom or simply positions XRP for a broader recovery remains to be seen, but it is clear that big players are looking beyond the current market turbulence. XRP Holding Key Levels XRP is currently trading 28% below its multi-year high of $2.90, but it has managed to stay above a critical support level at $1.90. This zone, regarded as the bulls’ last line of defense, has proven resilient amid recent market volatility. Holding above this level is essential to maintaining the bullish structure that has characterized XRP’s recent price action. Adding to the optimism, key metrics from Santiment, shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, reveal that XRP whales have accumulated actively during the pullback. Over the last 24 hours, these large holders have purchased an additional 110 million XRP, underscoring their confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. Historically, whale activity during price dips often signals preparation for a recovery. The next step for XRP to regain momentum is to push above critical supply levels that have previously stalled upward moves. A breakout above these zones could trigger a swift rally, bringing XRP closer to its multi-year high. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal Cardano Whales Are ‘Buying The Dip’ – Details The strong support at $1.90 and continued whale accumulation suggest a positive outlook for the weeks ahead. However, maintaining current levels and overcoming resistance will be crucial for XRP to capitalize on this potential and reignite its bullish trajectory. Technical Levels To Watch XRP is trading at $2.06, reflecting a loss of momentum after failing to reclaim the crucial $2.60 level. This inability to push higher has left the market uncertain, with XRP holding above the critical $1.90 low. For now, these levels suggest the asset could enter a prolonged period of range-bound trading, oscillating between $1.90 and $2.60 in the coming days. However, market sentiment remains fragile, and this indecision could tilt toward the bearish side if the overall mood doesn’t improve. With XRP trading just above the psychologically significant $2 mark, a continued lack of bullish momentum might lead to a significant selloff. If bears take control, the lack of strong support below $2 could pave the way for a deeper correction, eroding recent gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck Between $99K And $102K – Analyst Explains Macro Situation For XRP to break free from this indecisive phase, a clear reclaim of the $2.60 level is necessary to restore confidence among bulls. Until then, traders and investors are likely to exercise caution, closely monitoring price movements and sentiment shifts to gauge the next directional move. Without a decisive breakout, the price may face mounting pressure, risking a more pronounced downturn if support at $1.90 fails.

XRP’s surge of 20% to $0.83 signals a robust market confidence amid anticipated regulatory changes, including the speculated departure of SEC Chairman Gensler. On the other hand, Tron is solidifying its position with a stellar Q3, achieving revenues of $577 million and broadening its user network. However, Web3Bay steals the spotlight with its revolutionary approach to decentralized e-commerce. By eliminating middlemen and providing users governance rights via 3BAY tokens, Web3Bay is paving the way for the future of Web3 commerce. The presale, promising a massive 6430% ROI for initial backers, positions Web3Bay not just as another player in the crypto arena but as a trailblazer ready to lead. XRP’s Notable Uptick Amid Regulatory Changes Recently, XRP has experienced a significant uptick, gaining about 20% to reach $0.83. This increase is largely attributed to rumors of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s possible resignation, potentially fostering a more crypto-friendly regulatory landscape. This prospect has rejuvenated interest in Ripple’s native token, making it a strong candidate for an upcoming market surge. Furthermore, with platforms like Robinhood broadening their crypto offerings to include XRP, its market presence has strengthened, attracting more retail investors. Ripple’s continuous expansion in cross-border payment applications further supports XRP’s real-world utility. Increased on-chain activities on the XRP Ledger are also boosting investor optimism. Analysts believe that breaking the $0.85 resistance could lead to further gains, possibly reaching the $1 threshold. Tron’s Exceptional Market Performance & Expansion Tron is currently enjoying robust market momentum, recently peaking at $0.1914, buoyed by heightened trading volumes and revitalized investor interest after Bitcoin’s rally. With over 271 million accounts and 50 million transactions weekly, Tron’s growing ecosystem underscores its escalating adoption and influence. Financially, Tron has surpassed other major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, by recording a remarkable $577 million in revenue for Q3 2024. This achievement highlights Tron’s efficacy in generating stable revenue through its DeFi and dApp platforms, attracting both developers and users. Analysts are optimistic about TRX’s prospects, predicting it could soon test the $0.20 mark. 6430% ROI? Web3Bay’s Potential as the Year’s Major Crypto Venture Web3Bay is revolutionizing the e-commerce landscape by challenging traditional intermediary-dependent models, shifting control back to users through a decentralized marketplace. This transformation is not only about cost savings but also about influencing the platform’s trajectory with governance rights provided by the 3BAY token. In an exciting offer for early investors, Web3Bay’s presale lists tokens at an initial $0.003. With a structured 28-stage price increase plan, the final stage could see token prices at $0.1959. For early investors, this means an ROI of 6430% at launch, marking it as a highly promising pre-2025 crypto investment. As blockchain technology becomes integral to various industries, Web3Bay is not just participating in the Web3 movement—it’s at the forefront. Imagine being part of a platform with the potential to rival major market players like Amazon, but where you have a stake in its development. Web3Bay represents more than just a project; it’s a community-driven revolution. Summing Up While XRP leverages upcoming regulatory changes and Tron excels through ecosystem expansion and record earnings, Web3Bay is setting new benchmarks in e-commerce by utilizing blockchain to give users complete control over their data and financial transactions, thus removing expensive intermediaries. The 3BAY token extends beyond functionality by offering governance rights, special rewards, and the opportunity for investors to influence the platform’s future. Starting at just $0.003 per token, its presale offers an extraordinary ROI of 6430%, presenting one of the most enticing investment opportunities in the crypto space.

It may appear weak, but its short-term bullish trajectory is still intact. The first and second weeks of December saw CRV’s price through a consolidation phase after failing to push above $1.34 earlier this month. Breaking down from that phase, it lost the key $1 level on Wednesday and closed with an engulfing bar. This triggered more sell-offs yesterday and the price further fell off the $0.8 level to a low of $0.735 today. There are no signs of recovery yet as supply becomes heavy in intraday trading. The bears are now targeting the $0.7 level. If this price level holds, we can expect a small relief in the selling pressure. If not, it may enter the $0.5 range before bouncing back stronger. Looking at the last three days of trading, which marked CRV’s biggest drops since the crypto started to correct lower, it seemed to have reached an oversold condition in the hourly timeframe, though there’s still room for selling in the daily timeframe. So far, the overall market condition has been horrible following a 40% loss in the past week. Nonetheless, there’s still hope for the long-term bulls. A drop below $0.2 could trigger a serious bearish sentiment. CRV’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The next target support for the bears right now is $0.577.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 05:08:00

DEGEN is proof that when you double down on your niche, you can create something truly special. 6. Andy (ANDY): The Meme Coin with Heart Named after a fictional character who’s all about helping others, ANDY combines meme culture with philanthropy.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/early-shiba-inu-investor-cashes-in-9-5m-during-recent-shib-dip-heres-how/,"An early Shiba Inu investor sold nearly 400 billion tokens during the ongoing market downturn, earning a profit of $9.59 million. The transaction was shared by Lookonchain, a platform that tracks smart money movements. According to Lookonchain , the wallet involved in this transaction belongs to an investor who purchased the digital asset shortly after the project launched. On August 6, 2020, this user acquired 15.28 trillion SHIB for just $3,800, paying an average price of $0.000000000248 per token. By October 2021, when the token reached its all-time high, the value of these holdings surged to $1.22 billion. Since then, the investor has steadily sold portions of their holdings, significantly profiting from the asset’s price appreciation over time. Recent Shiba Inu (SHIB) Sale Details The latest sale, completed in several transactions, involved nearly 400 billion tokens transferred to the Gemini exchange. Data from Lookonchain indicates three initial transactions totaling 250 billion SHIB, broken down into 10 million, 99.98 billion, and 150 billion tokens. Shortly after these transactions, the investor transferred another 150 billion SHIB to the same exchange, bringing the total to approximately 399.99 billion tokens. With the asset trading at around $0.000024 at the time of the sale, the 400 billion tokens were valued at $9.6 million. This represents a staggering profit, as the investor acquired these tokens for just $99.19 in 2020. Etherscan data reveals that this user has also conducted other sales on exchanges like Crypto.com and Gemini in recent weeks. Despite these large sales, the wallet still holds a balance of 2 trillion tokens worth about $48 million. Market Conditions and Broader Trends The investor’s decision to sell comes amid a broader cryptocurrency market downturn, led by Bitcoin’s declining price. The asset has not been immune to the bearish trend, as its value dropped massively during the recent dip. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Amid this market volatility, many investors are converting riskier assets into stablecoins like USDT to protect their capital. In a related move, Lookonchain reported another significant transaction, where an investor moved 150 billion PEPE tokens, valued at $2.72 million, to Binance in response to the market decline. Investor Strategies Amid the Dip The user behind the PEPE transaction had previously purchased 150 billion PEPE tokens for $2.94 million and 60 billion SHIB worth $1.52 million on November 28. However, following the recent market drop, they incurred losses of $219,000 on their PEPE holdings and $136,000 on their SHIB investment. While the PEPE tokens were sold, the investor retained their 60 billion tokens, signaling potential confidence in a recovery for the token. This latest sale highlights the strategic moves of early investors during turbulent market conditions. While some continue to offload their holdings to lock in profits or mitigate losses, others remain confident in the asset’s long-term potential, even during the ongoing market challenges.

In the background, the hot new crypto Rollblock is getting a lot of attention because it could deliver a superior ROI compared to its established competitors. Is RBLK the next big opportunity you shouldn’t miss? Rollblock is the Hot New Crypto with Game-Changing Potential Rollblock is a promising contender in the crypto space. Positioned at the intersection of DeFi and online gaming, Rollblock’s innovative GambleFi model offers a compelling mix of utility and profitability. It already raised over $7 million in its presale. Rollblock’s ecosystem is designed to support over 7,000 games, live casinos, and sports betting, leveraging Ethereum-based smart contracts to ensure transparency and security. What sets Rollblock apart is its deflationary tokenomics, which include regular token buybacks and burns to create scarcity. Investors also benefit from lucrative staking rewards, adding to the token’s appeal. Analysts view Rollblock’s unique approach as a significant advantage, with its projected growth aligned with the $740 billion online gaming market. Early investors in Rollblock’s presale , priced at just $0.043 per token, stand to gain substantial returns as the platform gains traction. Hedera Keeps Gaining Ground Hedera ( HBAR ) has seen a lot of growth, its value soaring over 200% since the start of November. This surge highlights the appeal of its hashgraph technology, which is celebrated for its unmatched speed, energy efficiency, and scalability. Hedera ’s governing council, including industry heavyweights like Google, IBM, and Boeing, further cements its reputation as a trustworthy and forward-thinking blockchain project. Market analysts predict Hedera could climb to $0.566 in the near term. Long-term projections extend even further, with some estimates stating it could reach $2.19 by 2030. Polkadot’s ROI Struggles Because of Persistent Challenges Polkadot was once a favorite in the market, but its price has declined to around $3.98. This is well below its ATH of $55 in 2021. The recent descending triangle pattern in its price chart signals bearish sentiment, with potential support levels at $3.88 and $3.50. Technical indicators suggest that DOT is not done with challenges. Some experts are even concerned it might get back to its launch price of $2.69. Despite these setbacks, Polkadot ’s underlying technology remains robust. Its unique parachain system enables interoperability across blockchains, a feature that could drive future adoption. However, for now, the project struggles to attract the level of investor confidence required for a significant rebound. The Case for High ROI in Emerging Cryptos Hedera ’s bullish momentum demonstrates the potential of innovative technologies to capture market attention. However, Rollblock’s GambleFi protocol offers a fresh angle, blending blockchain transparency with real-world utility in a high-growth industry. Meanwhile, Polkadot faces an uphill battle to reclaim its former glory. For investors seeking strong ROI , the key lies in identifying projects with clear use cases and robust tokenomics. Rollblock, with its presale success and industry-first features, appears well-positioned to outpace established players like Polkadot. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Rollblock’s innovative model may lead the next wave of investor interest. Discover more about Rollblock’s presale and its potential for explosive growth.

Since the advent of the Internet, cloud mining has gradually gained attention as a more convenient way to mine cryptocurrencies. Cloud mining allows users to participate in mining projects of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum by simply renting the computing power of cloud servers without having to purchase expensive mining machines and perform complex technical operations. Such projects have attracted many people who hope to get rich quickly. What is Cloud Mining? First of all, we need to understand what cloud mining is. Cloud mining is a way of mining cryptocurrencies through remote servers. It allows users to participate in cryptocurrency mining activities without owning and maintaining actual mining equipment. Users only need to purchase a certain amount of computing power through cloud mining platforms. These platforms provide corresponding mining machines and computing power. Users only need to monitor and manage their mining income through the interface provided by the platform. Users no longer need to deal with hardware failures, equipment maintenance or power consumption. All of these tasks are taken care of by CrytocoinMiner . How cloud mining works: Renting computing power: Users choose the CrytocoinMiner cloud mining platform and purchase one or more computing power contracts according to their needs. Computing power is usually measured in hash rate (Hash). The higher the hash rate, the more mining benefits. 2.Mining operation: The rented computing power is connected to the mining pool, which is a network that concentrates a large number of miners and improves mining efficiency through division of labor and cooperation. The user’s computing power participates in the calculation of the network to mine cryptocurrency. 3.Obtain income: CrytocoinMiner shares the daily interest rate income according to the computing power contract rented by the user. These income will be distributed to the user’s account regularly. Platform maintenance: CrytocoinMiner will be responsible for providing hardware, operation and maintenance, data center management, and handling electricity costs, etc. Users do not need to buy expensive mining machines, nor do they need to worry about equipment failure or maintenance. https://crytocoinminer.com/xml/index.html#/product What is CrytocoinMiner? This is a cloud mining company founded in 2018. They designed a simple and easy-to-use page so that experienced or inexperienced miners can quickly get started, which also quickly made their global membership exceed 3.7 million. They are an FCA-regulated company (FCA Regulation: Financial Services, Companies and Markets), and CrytocoinMiner treats consumers fairly. According to statistics, the company contributes about 4.5% of the global hash rate. The advantage of CrytocoinMiner is that it is easy to make profits instead of losses. Simplified operation: No technical background or expensive mining machines are required, and anyone can participate. Cost saving: Users do not need to invest in infrastructure such as electricity, mining machines, and cooling equipment. No worries: The platform will be responsible for the operation, management, and update of the mining machines, and users only need to focus on profits. Cryptocurrency fluctuates greatly, and you can earn money when it goes up and lose money when it goes down. Users can mine through crytocoinminer cloud to obtain stable tokens for sale or collection. The following are recommended projects for earning cryptocurrency: Example: Invest $10,000 to purchase $10,000 worth of BTC [Advanced Computing Power], with a contract term of 50 days and a contract daily interest rate of 1.75%. The amount of passive income you can get every day after purchase = $10,000*1.75%=$175. After 50 days, your principal and income = $10,000+$175*50=$10,000+$8,750=$18,750 (Different contract computing power values, different investment amounts and terms, and different incomes, please log in to the CrytocoinMiner official website to view more contracts) To sum up, anyone who participates in the CrytocoinMiner cloud mining project can obtain good passive income. Warm reminder: Since its launch, CrytocoinMiner’s innovative business has been imitated by some companies and even used to create scams. Please be careful to identify it.

37912415,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52783,1734760748,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Shares Top XRP Investment Strategy Amid Market Downturn,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-shares-top-xrp-investment-strategy-amid-market-downturn/,"The cryptocurrency market faced significant turbulence following the Federal Reserve’s latest decision to cut interest rates by 0.25%. This announcement triggered sharp declines across major assets. XRP, in particular, saw its value drop by 6.75%, currently trading at $2.19. Federal Reserve’s Rate Cut and Market Reaction The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut the interest rates to stimulate economic growth but rather led to unexpected market volatility. Traditional and crypto markets experienced sharp declines, with the U.S. stock market losing $1.5 trillion. Cryptocurrency markets suffered $310 million in liquidations within a day, with XRP among the most affected assets. Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, emphasized the central bank’s current position on cryptocurrency, stating that it has no intention of holding Bitcoin or altering its policies to accommodate such assets. These comments contributed to negative sentiment, raising concerns about regulatory uncertainty in the crypto space. Performance Amid the Market Decline XRP’s price collapse erased gains made after the recent launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. After peaking at $2.72, XRP retraced to $2.23, marking a 17% decline within 24 hours. The asset initially recovered slightly, but is currently in a precarious position, with its trading value hovering around $2.19. Despite the recent downturn, cryptocurrency analyst Oscar Ramos suggested that the dip could present an opportunity for accumulation. In a recent video, Ramos highlighted the recurring nature of price corrections in the crypto market and encouraged investors to adopt long-term strategies rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations. Ramos pointed to a similar price drop on December 10, when the token declined following Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s interview on 60 Minutes. According to Ramos, the asset eventually rebounded. The analyst disclosed that he increased his XRP holdings during the latest drop, expressing optimism about the asset’s future. He emphasized the benefits of dollar-cost averaging and advised investors to remain focused on the long-term potential of the token rather than making decisions based on market panic. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin as a Positive Development Ramos also highlighted the recent launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin as a potential driver of XRP’s long-term value. Monica Long, Ripple’s President, described RLUSD as part of Ripple’s commitment to regulatory-compliant stablecoin solutions. She noted the increasing demand for such assets and projected that the market for stablecoins could grow to $3 trillion by 2028. Ripple’s diversification efforts, including its focus on stablecoins, are seen by some analysts as a promising strategy for supporting the asset’s future growth. The token’s struggles are part of a larger downturn across the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin fell from $108,000 to $96,762, while Ethereum faced significant liquidations, including a $4.7 million transaction in ETH perpetual futures on Binance. Ramos urged investors to remain calm in the face of widespread market uncertainty. While fear dominated the market following the Federal Reserve’s announcement, he emphasized the importance of adhering to long-term investment plans rather than making emotionally driven decisions. While the market remains unstable, Ramos and other analysts see opportunities for investors willing to adopt disciplined strategies.

Experts Weigh In On Bitcoin 13% Dip And Potential Recovery,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-this-the-bottom-experts-weigh-in-on-bitcoin-13-dip-and-potential-recovery/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing its first seven-day decline in eight weeks, prompted by hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) that have led traders to sell off the asset, which has more than doubled in value this year. Bitcoin Rebounds To $97,500 After Historic ETF Outflow The market’s leading cryptocurrency saw a drop of as much as 5.3% to $92,149 on Friday, following a record high of just above $108,000 earlier in the week. Since then the Bitcoin price has recovered the $97,500 mark, down approximately 5% since Sunday. This downturn has also affected smaller cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE), despite a generally positive performance in US equities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Loses Momentum: Could A Drop To $75,000 Signal The Final Correction? The shift in sentiment is further highlighted by a significant outflow from US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest directly in Bitcoin. On Thursday, these funds recorded a historic outflow of $680 million, ending a 15-day streak of inflows, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The heightened volatility in the crypto market follows a rally that began after Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election on November 5. Analysts from QCP Capital have noted that positioning in the market had become “overly bullish,” leaving digital assets susceptible to fluctuations in the Federal Reserve’s tone regarding inflation control. With the US Federal Reserve signaling a potential slowdown in its easing measures with its chair’s Powell announcement on Wednesday, the focus is shifting to the pace at which traditional financial institutions adopt cryptocurrency. Historical Patterns Suggest Potential Rebound For BTC’s Price Hani Abuagla, a senior market analyst at XTB, stated in a recent note that the interplay of monetary policy, institutional adoption, and political developments suggests that Bitcoin will remain sensitive to both macroeconomic and crypto-specific catalysts through 2025. This sentiment is echoed by Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group, who advised caution in the short term. Weston noted that while a collapse in price is not imminent, the momentum behind Bitcoin’s recent rally has diminished, indicating a shift in market control. Related Reading: XRP, Solana Among Altcoins Witnessing TD Buy Signal, Analyst Reveals Market expert Lark Davis on the other hand, weighed in on the current price action, reassuring investors that historical patterns could suggest a rebound in the coming days. The expert referenced December 2020, when Bitcoin experienced a 12% drop following a 77% rally in the preceding months but then surged from $17,000 to $41,000—a 136% increase—in just 23 days. Davis posits that a similar scenario may be unfolding now, with Bitcoin facing a 13% dip after a robust fourth quarter. While he acknowledges the possibility of an additional 10-15% correction, he remains optimistic about the potential for further upward movement in the cryptocurrency market.

It fell down to $92,000 as we predicted in our analysis yesterday . Though BTC has moved up by 5%, it still lies in a danger zone. Let’s analyse market metrics to understand what is happening and what to expect. The Bitcoin Chart Bitcoin is currently trading at $97,536 and is trying to move ahead. The presence of Moving Average 200 is active as the active resistance here. The RSI has also risen and has moved out of the oversold zone, however the danger of pullback remains. If the market does not get enough buying volume, the MA 200 can push the price back down. Earlier, it received support around $92k due to the presence of MA 50 on the daily chart, however that might not be enough this time. The Greed and Fear index is at 73, however the real market sentiment is still bearish. Source : Coinglass The MACD histogram shows reduction in selling pressure, however the average direction index has fallen to 33.62 which is not a good sign for Bitcoin. We can also see the moving average 20 has fallen below MA 50 and 100 which sends a negative impression to the market. If the price keeps on consolidating in this area or it moves a little down the smallest MA will go below the highest and it will trigger a panic in the market. This could send the price down to $90k or even bad. The Liquidation Data According to Coinglass’s crypto liquidation data, in the past 24 hours, 296,631 traders got liquidated. This caused a total of $831.74 million to wash out of the market. Yesterday this amount went over $1 billion. The last 4 days have been very bad for the long traders as the market kept on going down. Source : Coinglass The liquidation map shows that there are still traders who have opened long trades for Bitcoin with high leverages upto 100x. Taking some decisions in time of a bearish momentum shows there are still people out there who do not understand the gravity of the situation. The map also shows the short trades with high leverages. During such periods, the market has a tendency to suddenly move in the opposite direction to liquidate traders with bad risk management. Source : Coinglass What to Expect The very first thing we should be seeing now is Bitcoin price coming above the moving average 200. That will decrease the negative sentiment from the market and encourage more investors to jump in. However, for this to happen the market needs some buying volume. The market could make a sudden spike, just to liquidate the careless short traders, and this will give support to the market. Yes, not everything can be good for everybody, but let’s see the big picture here. If Bitcoin stays in this dangerous zone, it might fall down to $90k, triggering a panic sell resulting in altcoins rolling down as well. What do you think will happen? The market will rise or will it go down further?",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-21 06:02:45

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 06:24:00

Meanwhile, NEAR Protocol and innovative new crypto Rollblock challenge its momentum. Both projects have unique strengths that are fascinating investors globally. Rollblock: A New Crypto Poised to Disrupt the Market Rollblock is a game-changing project, having already raised $7.4 million during its ongoing presale. It leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize the online gaming industry and presents a unique value proposition that stands out in the crowded DeFi space. The platform offers seamless integration across over 7,000 games, live casino experiences and even sports betting, all secured by Ethereum-backed smart contracts that enhance transparency and security. Its innovative deflationary tokenomics system, which includes regular token buybacks, burns and staking rewards, reduces supply and incentivizes holding in the long term. Targeting the $500 billion global gaming industry, Rollblock provides tangible real-world applications that set it apart from competitors. Analysts highlight its potential to deliver substantial returns on investment (ROI), with some suggesting it could even outperform established projects like Litecoin and NEAR . Litecoin’s Momentum Builds on Miner Activity and ETF Buzz The performance of the Litecoin price has been nothing short of unimpressive. The token dropped 35% within just seven days, hitting a low of $90, buoyed by $18 million worth of LTC purchased by miners. These acquisitions, totaling 140,000 coins, reduced the supply of newly minted tokens entering circulation, driving demand and supporting upward momentum. The anticipation of a Litecoin ETF has only added to the excitement. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas recently identified Litecoin as a strong contender for ETF approval due to its regulatory clarity as a Bitcoin fork. Such an ETF could introduce significant institutional investment and push the Litecoin price toward $150. Technical indicators suggest that breaking resistance at $135 could trigger another rally, setting the stage for the Litecoin price to test new highs. NEAR Protocol Eyes $11 After 95% Price Surge NEAR Protocol has also been making waves, recovering from $3.50 to $6.83 in just three weeks—a staggering 95% gain. This V-shaped rally has been supported by strong buying pressure, resulting in a golden crossover between the 100-day and 200-day EMAs. Despite minor pullbacks, NEAR continues to demonstrate resilience, with its current resistance at $7.26 marking the next critical level to watch. Looking ahead, analysts are targeting $9.59 and $11 as potential price milestones for NEAR . The protocol’s innovative approach to decentralized applications and its robust technical indicators make it a strong candidate for further growth, even amid market volatility. Where to Focus? As Litecoin , NEAR , and Rollblock compete for investor attention, each presents a unique blend of opportunity and risk. Litecoin’s combination of strong miner support and the potential for ETF approval makes it an appealing choice for those seeking immediate market momentum. NEAR’s rapid recovery and robust technical indicators position it as a solid mid-term growth play, particularly for investors looking for consistent upward trends. However, new crypto Rollblock’s innovative approach and unmatched real-world utility firmly establish it as the standout option for long-term investment. It delivers practical applications and addresses tangible needs. It redefines expectations in DeFi and so positions itself as the project most likely to deliver sustained and significant returns.

Investors are also going all-in into Lunex (LNEX) , a new DeFi token handpicked by market pundits as the best crypto investment of 2025. Let’s examine why LNEX is expected to beat Cardano’s price hands down with an incredible presale performance. Analysts praise Lunex (LNEX) as the best crypto investment in DeFi The Lunex Network brings groundbreaking crypto trading solutions into the DeFi market. Featuring an innovative multichain bridge, this new non-custodial decentralized exchange brings together multiple blockchain networks, creating an all-in-one DeFi trading protocol. This cross-chain functionality enables seamless asset transfers across different blockchains, significantly reducing trading costs and transaction times. Traders and investors can now trade, swap, and transfer over 50,000+ crypto pairs across 40+ blockchains using the Lunex DEX. More impressively, a portion of the funds collected on the Lunex DeFi swapping dApp is allocated for investors’ rewards. The platform pays up to 18% APY to LNEX holders engaging in staking, making the asset a top crypto investment for DeFi degens seeking high ROI passive income streams. LNEX is also a solid investment option for growth investors. With the DeFi market tipped to continue growing exponentially, experts believe the Lunex crypto exchange is well-positioned to capitalize on the rising DeFi trading trends. Conservative predictions place LNEX presale returns at 18x, followed by staggering post-launch yields as the Lunex DEX develops into a multi-billion crypto exchange. Whales enter an accumulation spree as Cardano’s price drops Early December, the Cardano price was trading at $1.1, a slight pullback from its recent high of $1.32. Cardano whales have taken advantage of the price decrease to solidify their positions, scooping over 80 million ADA in the past few days. The recent buying spree aligns with broader trends observed over the past weeks, where large-wallet holders poured nearly $300 million into ADA . That indicates investors’ confidence in the smart contracts platform and could fuel further price appreciation. Is ADA a good crypto investment ? Cardano’s price broke out in November and has delivered a nearly 5x return from its $0.27 August dip. Per CoinMarketCap, ADA has delivered a 70% return year to date and was up over 90% monthly. ADA ‘s community sentiment was over 90% bullish, indicating there could still be more progress in store for Cardano in the coming months. The altcoin is expected to trade in the $1-$1.2 zone through December, giving investors enough wiggle to double up before the next leg up. Per CoinCodex data, ADA is expected to trade in a channel between $1.13 and $5.83 in 2025 for a 400% potential ROI, making Cardano a good crypto investment for solid yields. ADA is good, but LNEX is great Crypto shrimps looking for staggering yields have scooped up over 2.28 billion LNEX as the Lunex ICO surpasses $5.3 million. The presale is already past 283%, with only about 1.7 billion tokens left up for grabs. Tokens are selling out fast at $0.0046, so race over to load up your LNEX bag today!

Lunex Network (LNEX) Soars 283% in Crypto ICO Event, More Gains Incoming While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are seeing some red price charts right now, Lunex Network (LNEX) is riding a bullish wave. This DeFi project , now in its presale run, has given early buyers a 283% return. Moreover, it has raised over $5M. This shows the level of interest people have in Lunex Network. Hype is growing for Lunex Network as it will disrupt the DeFi market . It will launch a non-custodial crypto exchange that connects all isolated blockchains.

A Tier-1 crypto exchange listing is expected to trigger a pump to $0.0216 – a 369% return for anyone who buys LNEX now. This surge could make LNEX one of the best DeFi coins for fast returns. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price May See a Massive Pump, Analyst Predicts Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen some red price charts, although it is still one of the meme coin titans . Its value has dropped over 15% in the past week as per CoinMarketCap . In that period, the Dogecoin price has jumped from around $0.40 to nearly $0.35. But, crypto analyst CEO remains optimistic about Dogecoin (DOGE). In a recent X post , he told his followers that the next price pump for this meme coin will be massive.

Currently, this meme coin has a momentum indicator of -0.06, which is in the buy zone per TradingView . This suggests that a bullish trend may continue. The Price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) Could Rise, but Volatility Remains Shiba Inu (SHIB) is another meme coin experiencing volatility right now.

Nevertheless, market analyst InvestingHaven is still bullish on Shiba Inu (SHIB). According to his X post , this meme coin could surge to $0.0000998 in 2025. However, the path to this level may be volatile. Many traders are excited about this Shiba Inu price prediction . The Shiba Inu crypto also has some good technical signs. TradingView data points to this meme coin has a momentum indicator of −0.00000409, which is in the buy zone. With this indicator, a bullish trend may come for this Shiba Inu. Can Lunex Network (LNEX) Outpace Dogecoin (DOGE) & Shiba Inu (SHIB)? Though Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) may have been successful, Lunex Network (LNEX) offers more: real utility and a promising future. Thanks to its cutting-edge technology, privacy focus, and cross-chain capacity, it can become a strong player in the crypto market . Since it will also have a smaller market cap than its peers, LNEX could see faster growth with less money too. Therefore, experts predict a potential 3x growth for this DeFi coin in 2025.

(Terraform). Tai Mo Shan is further charged with trading securities in unregistered transactions. The SEC established that the firm acted as a statutory underwriter on some of its offers and sales of LUNA, which was also issued by Terraform and sold as a security. SEC chair Gary Gensler said: “This case reminds us that, too many times in the crypto markets, we’ve seen significant investor losses due to fraud.” ~ Gary Gensler He stated that Tai Mo Shan’s illegal activities affected the entire crypto market, leading to serious investor losses. Gary stressed the need for market players to comply with security laws and avoid deceiving the public about investors’ security. Tai Mo Shan agreed to settle the fine TerraUSD worked at a constant $1 value through a web of mixed algorithms and trader motivations involving LUNA . However, when the network was strained and seemed to be breaking, Tai Mo Shan made huge purchases that helped to stabilize the coin. According to the SEC, the impression from Tai Mo’s purchase was that the algorithmic mechanism was working, yet it was a deceitful tactic. Tai Mo made the purchases around May 2021, when the value of TerraUSD dropped below the $1 peg. The firm was motivated to purchase more than $20 million from Terraform. Tai Mo Shan agreed to pay $73,452,756 in disgorgement, $12,916,153 in prejudgment interest, and a $36,726,378 civil penalty as part of the settlement. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Tai Mo Shan agreed to cease and desist from violating the registration and fraud provisions it violated. SEC reveals Jump Crypto’s involvement in TerraUSD collapse According to SEC’s court filings, Jump Crypto had an arrangement with Terraform to bolster TerraUSD and earned up to $1 billion in profit. Later, Terraform agreed to pay around $4.5 billion to settle a SEC lawsuit on its collapse. Terra’s collapse shook the crypto world, wiping out $40 billion in investor assets and stock. Luna Foundation established a ring of people as its guard, and among those people was Jump Crypto’s intern-turned-president Kanav Kariya. Luna Foundation Guard was responsible for overseeing TerraUSD’s reserve. The SEC’s case against Jump Trading was initiated during the crypto winter and finally settled.

MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Thinks So! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Michael Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, has shared a bold idea: by using Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the United States could make up to $81 trillion. Saylor believes this move could position the U.S. as the leader of the global digital economy. Perhaps his idea faced criticism, with some saying it could weaken the U.S. dollar and harm the economy. US Could Unlock $81 Trillion With Bitcoin According to Michael Saylor, adopting a Bitcoin reserve would allow the U.S. to leverage the cryptocurrency’s scarcity and growing global value. He suggests that a strategic Bitcoin policy could strengthen the U.S. dollar, reduce national debt, and boost the economy by creating trillions in value. Saylor also outlined a scenario where global digital capital markets could expand from $2 trillion to $280 trillion, with the U.S. capturing a significant share of this growth. He also predicted that the Bitcoin reserve could generate anywhere from $16 trillion to $81 trillion for the U.S. Treasury, unlocking huge opportunities for U.S. companies. Some even believe that Bitcoin’s price could soar to $500,000 if this vision comes to life. Peter Schiff Slams Salyor’s Proposal While Saylor’s vision has its supporters, it has also faced strong criticism. Economist and long-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff called the proposal “complete bullshit, ” claiming it would harm the U.S. economy. This is complete bullshit. The proposal would do the opposite. It would weaken the dollar, exacerbate the national debt, and making America a laughing stock. It would deprive business of power, diminish growth, and destroy value. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 20, 2024 Schiff argued that adopting Bitcoin as a national reserve would weaken the dollar, increase national debt, and destabilize the economy. “This would deprive businesses of power, reduce growth, and destroy value.” Although, Schiff has always argued that Bitcoin is too risky and unstable to be a reliable financial asset.

The massive withdrawals from the crypto exchange Binance show that big players are confident of ETH’s future rally despite recent volatility. This sets the stage for a quick bounce back to $4,000, which has served as a strong resistance. Analysts believe that once ETH crossed $4,000, new all-time highs past $5,000 will come in no time. Ethereum Whales Turn Active Buying the Dips Following yesterday’s crypto market crash , there’s a brief recovery amid significant Ethereum (ETH) accumulation by whales amid the current ETH price dips. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain reported that ten newly created wallets collectively withdrew 17,698 ETH, valued at approximately $61.66 million, from Binance. The activity by Ethereum whales underscores renewed interest from large investors, who appear to be capitalizing on the market’s recovery momentum. On the other hand, Donald Trump’s DeFi Project World Liberty Financial has continued its ETH buying spree, spending a total of 2.5 million USDC stablecoin to acquire an additional 759 ETH. To date, World Liberty has purchased 9,587 ETH, valued at $35 million, with $3,651 as an average acquisition price per ETH. Despite market fluctuations, the entity has reduced its unrealized loss on ETH holdings to $3.4 million, reflecting a narrowing deficit as prices recover. Source: Lookonchain The good thing is that spot Ethereum ETFs have also seen inflows resuming on Friday, as institutional players jumped in to buy the dips. ETH Price Bounce Back to $4,000 Soon? On Friday, the ETH price touched a low of $3098 before bouncing back once again amid Ethereum whale accumulation. As of press time, the Ethereum price is trading at $3,480 levels with its daily trading volume above $61 billion. As per the Coinglass data , the 24-hour liquidations have soared to $170 million amid the current price volatility. For now, the immediate resistance is $3,500 for Ethereum, crossing which it could bounce to $4,000. Crypto market analysts remain bullish despite this current turbulence in ETH. Market analyst Crypto Patel expects ETH price to surge to $8,000-$10,000 level. He wrote: “I’m buying every $ETH dip, no matter how much it drops. Just holding strong and stacking up. Ethereum hasn’t hit its new all-time high yet, but it’s only a matter of time. Staying patient and ready for the rise! Still telling you my ETH Target is $8000-$10k”. Source: Crypto Patel Another crypto analyst venturefounder noted that Ethereum is still on track to new all-time highs in 2025, supported by whale buying. The analyst compared the current four-year cycle (2021–2024) to the previous one (2016–2020), highlighting striking similarities. According to the analysis, Ethereum’s performance in the year following a Bitcoin halving—such as 2017 and 2021—has historically marked significant growth phases.

The incoming AI and crypto czar said he will have a leadership role in establishing policies and regulations for technologies, such as AI and crypto. Earlier today, Fortune reported that the AI and crypto czar role initially expected to be a cut-and-dry leadership role is set to be more of a general advisory position. The legacy media cited two people familiar with the inner workings of the Trump Vance transition team. The reason for scaling back the role was reported to be Sacks not divesting from his investment firm Craft Ventures. “Not divesting, not taking a more formal government role, that makes it very complicated. Even if Trump and people in his administration usually see conflicts of interest as an afterthought, the situation with Sacks became an issue, even from a practical perspective.” However, Sacks said, “This is total nonsense.” Also, he expects to spend 50% of his time in Washington D.C. directing policy. The remaining 50% in Silicon Valley staying on the cutting edge technological advancements, he added. This is in line with what David Sacks requested .

Ripple CTO David Schwartz addressed the situation, attributing the pricing anomaly to economic factors related to supply and demand. RLUSD’s Launch and Early Impact RLUSD officially debuted on December 17 as a native stablecoin on the XRP Ledger network. Its release generated excitement among XRP holders, briefly sending its price above $2.70. However, in the days leading up to its launch, some wallets reported irregular valuations for the stablecoin, far exceeding its intended $1 peg. Screenshots shared on social media, including X, highlighted RLUSD being priced at 511.20 XRP on the Xaman wallet, equating to approximately $1,200. This abnormal valuation was particularly striking, given RLUSD’s classification as a stablecoin designed to maintain a fixed value. Community Reactions and Speculation The unusual pricing attracted significant attention from the community. Some users speculated that the inflated stablecoin’s value could drive XRP’s market price. Questions were raised about whether this valuation trend would persist until the stablecoin’s official release. One community member confirmed observing the elevated pricing and expressed optimism about its potential impact on XRP. Such sentiments underscored growing anticipation around the stablecoin and its possible role in shaping the broader ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple CTO Explains Price Spike In response to concerns, Ripple CTO David Schwartz provided insights into the price surge, citing basic economic principles. According to Schwartz, the pre-launch valuation spike was primarily driven by the limited supply of the coin combined with high demand. He explained that the XRPL system adjusts valuations based on the highest buy orders. In this case, a buyer willing to pay $1,200 for one RLUSD caused the system to reflect that price. Schwartz emphasized that such discrepancies are expected in the early stages of issuance but assured that market dynamics would stabilize as RLUSD’s supply increases over time. Costly Pre-Launch Trades It’s worth noting that some traders experienced significant losses during the price volatility. A user swapped 10,000 XRP for 100 RLUSD before the stablecoin’s official market debut. The token was trading at approximately $2.71 at the time, meaning the trader effectively paid $271 per RLUSD. Once the stablecoin launched and reverted to its $1 peg, the trader’s $27,100 investment dropped to just $100. Since its launch, RLUSD has settled closer to its intended valuation. As of now, CoinMarketCap reports that the stablecoin is trading at $1, with a total supply of 53.1 million. This stabilization aligns with Schwartz’s prediction, alleviating concerns over the extreme pre-launch fluctuations. The RLUSD rollout has highlighted the complexities of introducing new digital assets, particularly stablecoins, on blockchain networks. While the pre-launch pricing anomaly drew criticism and financial losses for some, the stablecoin appears to have achieved its intended function of maintaining a stable value. Ripple’s focus will likely shift to optimizing the stablecoin’s performance and utility within the ecosystem.

Concerns have surfaced about whether this downturn signals the conclusion of the current bull cycle or merely represents a temporary setback. While short-term holders face losses, long-term metrics provide a broader perspective on Bitcoin’s trajectory, as analyzed by CryptoQuant’s Avocado Onchain in a recent report. Related Reading: As Bitcoin Reclaims $100,000, Warning Signs Emerge from Long-Term Investors Opportunity Or End of The Bull Cycle? According to Avocado Onchain, the realized price for investors who entered the market during Bitcoin’s recent peak at $98,000 places them in a loss-making position. However, for those who invested between one to three months ago, the realized price is significantly lower at $71,000, offering a cushion against the current correction. Avocado pointed out that historical patterns from Bitcoin’s 2021 bull cycle reveal similar alternations between record highs and sharp corrections, suggesting that these dips may not necessarily indicate the end of the cycle. Instead, they have historically been “opportunities” for market rebalancing and subsequent growth. A key indicator analyzed is the 30-day moving average of the short-term SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio). This metric tracks whether recent market participants are selling at a profit or a loss. The current SOPR data reveals that recent short-term inflows into Bitcoin have yet to result in substantial profit-taking. Unlike previous cycle peaks characterized by aggressive selling, the ongoing correction appears subdued, indicating that the market may still have room for upward movement. Bitcoin Short-Term Dips vs. Long-Term Trends Additionally, Avocado Onchain highlights the importance of distinguishing between short-term corrections and broader cycle trends. Bitcoin’s tendency to rebound after corrections in past bull cycles reinforces the notion that the current downturn might not mark the cycle’s end. These insights align with the behaviour of long-term holders, who often use corrections to consolidate their positions, strengthening market resilience. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In For This Cycle? On-Chain Signals You Need To Know Avocado concluded the analysis, noting: For investors who have yet to enter the market, this may be an excellent opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a discount. Instead of succumbing to panic selling during short-term downturns, adopting a long-term perspective and a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy could be a more effective approach. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is seeing a gradual rebound in its price surging by 1.3% in the past 1 hour. Regardless, the asset still appears to be overshadowed by the bears as BTC remains down by 3.5% in the past day and 10.5% from its peak of $108,135 recorded last week.

This surge sparked what many call a “memecoin season,” with other meme-based tokens experiencing wild price swings. PEPE’s roadmap includes plans to get listed on major exchanges and aims for a “meme takeover.” While it’s uncertain if PEPE and other memecoins will reach new highs, many in the crypto community are hopeful, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle. In a market where memes can drive value, PEPE stands out as an attractive coin for those looking to ride the next big wave. Conclusion SUI and PEPE are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) leads as a sports-themed memecoin uniting fans, aiming for massive growth and blending meme culture with sports enthusiasm.

BTFD Coin: The Brightest Newcomer in Meme Coins BTFD Coin is redefining what it means to be a meme coin.

Its Play-to-Earn game is a standout feature, allowing players to engage in fun gameplay while earning rewards.

Mog Coin: The Once-Darling of Meme Coins Mog Coin burst onto the scene with a lot of fanfare, tapping into the meme coin craze that has captured the imagination of many.

Many investors who once believed in Mog Coin are now looking elsewhere, seeking opportunities that promise more substantial returns. While Mog Coin has managed to retain a dedicated following, it’s struggling to keep pace with newcomers like BTFD Coin. Analysts have been cautious about Mog Coin’s future, with some suggesting that its initial hype may not translate into sustainable growth. In a world where meme coins rise and fall based on trends, Mog Coin’s ability to adapt is under scrutiny. Recent developments indicate that Mog Coin is facing challenges in maintaining its relevance.

Solana and its role in blockchain technology Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and hosting decentralized applications. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, powers the network by facilitating transactions, running programs, and rewarding contributors. Solana’s design supports fast processing without requiring sharding or extra layers, attracting developers and projects. This architecture makes it suitable for building high-activity solutions and innovative services. SOL has utility within the system, supporting various projects and acting as an incentive for participants. In the current market, SOL’s appeal depends on interest in scalable platforms and decentralized app growth. Its performance potential may draw attention from developers and investors seeking alternatives to other established blockchains. Cardano: A scalable and sustainable blockchain platform Cardano is a blockchain platform known for its focus on sustainability, scalability, and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for value storage, payments, and staking. Cardano uses an energy-efficient proof-of-stake model called Ouroboros. The platform is divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This design improves speed and scalability. Cardano supports decentralized finance apps, token creation, and games, making it a competitor to Ethereum. Its unique setup allows secure and low-fee interactions. With high transaction potential and an environmentally friendly approach, ADA remains a strong contender in the evolving cryptocurrency market. Its technological advancements make it an appealing option in the current cycle. XRP: A digital currency for fast and borderless transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency created for quick, low-cost, and worldwide payments. It runs on the XRP Ledger, a decentralized system that ensures secure and irreversible transactions without requiring a bank account. Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz designed XRP with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple, the organization behind XRP, holds a significant portion and uses it for liquidity and ecosystem support. By operating without central control, XRP aims to simplify currency transfers and enable broader financial access. Its speed and scalability make it stand out in the cryptocurrency market. XRP’s performance in the current market depends on broader adoption and technological advancements driving its use case. BNB: Key cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem BNB is the main cryptocurrency of Binance, launched in 2017 as an ERC-20 token. It now operates on the Binance Chain and Smart Chain, supporting smart contracts and various transactions. It is used to pay fees, issue tokens, and transfer assets. Users get discounts on Binance and access to third-party services. Its supply is reduced quarterly through burning, aiming to decrease the original 200 million supply by half. BNB’s integration into Binance’s ecosystem and its utility in multiple areas make it appealing. Its role in smart contracts, staking rewards, and fee discounts adds value. The overall demand for Binance services influences its market appeal. Evaluation depends on market timing and broader cryptocurrency trends. Conclusion SOL, ADA, XRP, and BNB show modest short-term potential but may gain over time. However, DOGEN stands out as the ultimate choice for those chasing unparalleled success. With an expected 700% presale surge and ties to the success of tokens like BONK, it aims to dominate. DOGEN offers exclusive rewards and builds a community of leaders seeking true market impact.

Ripple Explodes 20% From $1.96 Lows,https://cryptopotato.com/is-xrps-bottom-in-ripple-explodes-20-from-1-96-lows/,"TL:DR; The entire cryptocurrency market went through a massive crash in the past few days, but Ripple’s cross-border token was among the poorest performers. Since then, though, XRP has gained roughly 20%, leading to the question of whether it has found its bottom. XRP Bounces Off The developments at the start of the business week couldn’t really foresee what would transpire just a few days later. On Monday, Ripple announced that its long-awaited stablecoin will finally see the light of day on the next day (December 17) after it was greenlighted by the NYDFS. XRP’s price reacted positively to both the announcement and the subsequent launch as its price skyrocketed from $2.35 to a multi-day peak of over $2.7 by Tuesday. After a minor retracement to $2.6, things went sour on Wednesday after the latest US FOMC meeting. XRP, alongside the rest of the market, plummeted to under $2.25, losing nearly 20% of its value in 36 hours. Although that was already a painful retracement, the landscape worsened on Thursday and Friday as the asset plunged to below $2 for just the third time since December 1. Thus, Ripple’s token had dumped by 28% from Tuesday to Friday, going from $2.72 to $1.96. The bulls finally stepped up at this point and didn’t allow any further declines. Just the opposite, XRP bounced off and has gained about 20% since then, currently sitting at $2.35. According to popular X analyst Dark Defender, XRP “double tap on 4-hour charts for both on RSI and Price,” which, alongside the “tremendous bullish pin” on the daily chart, suggests that the asset has already bottomed and is ahead of more gains. XRP double tap on 4-hour charts for both on RSI and Price. Additionally daily frame has a tremendous bullish pin bar. These are initial signals for momentum to continue. Time will tell pic.twitter.com/85zgnzOhvC — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 20, 2024 It’s About Perspective During the lows, many crypto commentators started to speculate whether the overall bull cycle had ended. After all, the entire crypto market cap lost roughly $500 billion in just days at one point. However, Moon Lambo outlined a different view for those retracements, including XRP’s plunge. The YouTuber talked about having a perspective, as XRP, for instance, stood below $0.5 less than two months ago. Consequently, going from over $2.7 to under $2 is indeed painful, but looking at it on a broader scale, it still shows that the asset is a lot higher than it used to be just weeks ago. As someone who has been holding $XRP for over 7 years, while the price has been well under $1.00 for almost 100% of that time, and having never sold a single $XRP ever, I must say… I find it amusing that people are freaking out that $XRP *dropped* to $2.15. Bitch it was 49… pic.twitter.com/1FoohjdxUv — Moon Lambo (@MoonLamboio) December 20, 2024 The post Is XRP’s Bottom In?

Kiyosaki Urges Investment in Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Robert Kiyosaki, a renowned businessman and the author of a highly successful financial book series, Rich Dad Poor Dad, in a recent post on X, warns about the possibility of a global financial crisis. He advises people to invest in gold, silver and Bitcoin to protect wealth. Here is what you should know. Why Kiyosaki Distrusts the US Financial System The popular financial author strongly criticises the US government, Treasury and the Federal Reserve, denouncing the established financial governance system as a ‘Den of Thieves’. The 77-year old business leader states that he lost his trust in the US established system when silver coins were replaced with alloys in 1965. He also presents the removal of the gold standards in 1971 by the Nixon regime as another reason for his distrust towards the US government and its established economic system dominated by the US dollar. https://twitter.com/therealkiyosaki/status/1870288365150781627?s=46 The Case for Gold, Silver and Bitcoin Dismissing fiat currency as fake money, the American businessman advises people to invest in gold, silver and Bitcoin. It is not the first time that he has openly questioned the credibility of fiat currency. In some of his recent interviews, he explained how fake money is used to loot people. Criticism of Financial Planners and Education System Emphasising how financial planners misguide people, Kiyoski recommends preparing by learning about money and investing independently using possibilities like YouTube videos. In conclusion, Kiyosaki’s message is clear: Protect your wealth by investing in real assets and educating yourself. As financial uncertainties loom, his advice to think independently about money has never been more relevant.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-21 07:18:58

Besides, the recent performance of XRP, as well as the broader crypto market, also signals that investors are once again entering the market after a recent pause. Simultaneously, the recent Ripple developments also indicate that the momentum remains strong for the future trajectory of the coin. XRP News: Ripple Whales Bag 80M Coins Amid Market Crash In the latest XRP news, Ripple whales have once again fueled speculations with their recent moves. According to reports, the whales have continued their buying spree as the broader crypto market crashed recently, giving investors a buy-the-dip opportunity. For context, Bitcoin and top altcoins have recorded sharp declines recently, which has created a buying opportunity at a dip for many investors. Prominent crypto market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the buying trend for XRP. He noted that the whales have accumulated 80 million coins since December 17, when the market started declining after a robust run over the past few days. In addition, other big transfers of the tokens have also fueled speculations in the digital assets space, especially amid the recent developments. Source: Ali Martinez, X Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s election win has already fueled market optimism this year. In addition, crypto has been crucial this year, with Trump pledging to make the US the crypto capital. This has also triggered speculations over a potential rally ahead for the crypto issued by US-based firms. Additionally, the blockchain firm also reportedly made a significant contribution to Donald Trump’s inauguration recently alongside other crypto firms. According to a FOX Business report, Ripple is reportedly planning to donate $5 million to the fund, with Coinbase and Kraken giving $1 million each. This has further fueled sentiments over a pro-crypto regulatory environment in the US after Trump’s inauguration on January 20. What Lies Ahead For Ripple? The recent launch of Ripple stablecoin RLUSD has already fueled optimism, and this XRP news is expected to continue to support the bullish momentum ahead. Market experts said the new stablecoin would help in increasing liquidity through XRPL, which in turn would improve its native crypto’s appeal as a bridge asset for cross-border payments. Notably, XRP price today jumped more than 4% and exchanged hands at $2.36, while its trading volume soared 27% to $26.34 billion. Notably, the crypto has declined below the $2 mark in the last 24 hours, indicating that investors are regaining confidence in the asset. However, despite the recent surge, its Futures Open Interest was down more than 30% during writing, CoinGlass data showed. In addition, in a separate post recently, Ali Martinez said that Ripple’s native crypto might face heavy liquidation of $20.50 million in short positions if it hits $2.62. Despite these short-term pullback concerns, experts remained confident about the long-term trajectory of the coin towards the $3 mark ahead.

The coin still has zero utility and still represents a joke, but it has grown into a massive crypto project with millions of fans all over the world. Dogecoin has risen to an all-time high above $0.6, which is quite impressive for the kind of origin and utility it has. And for many years, DOGE holders have wondered if the coin would hit the elusive $1 landmark. Will it hit this price level or will a new altcoin like Rollblock do so first? Read on to find out. Positive Dogecoin news indicate better future for DOGE Dogecoin picked up some big fans over the years. One of its prominent proponents is Elon Musk, who has incessantly tweeted about it and even suggested that DOGE would be used as a payment method in his company. Even Dogecoin news from the Financial Times are answering questions on the possibilities of Dogecoin becoming the US currency. What if Donald Trump fires Federal Reserves chair Jay Powell and makes this suggestion a reality? In essence, Dogecoin has a lot of goodwill around it at the moment. That is why there are shouts that it could hit a landmark $1. If this happens, it would fetch DOGE holders really decent profits. But are there other coins that would fetch investors a bigger ROI? New altcoin Rollblock leads the way Rollblock is a crypto pioneer like Dogecoin , but it is leading the way in a different manner. This new altcoin combines blockchain technology with iGaming to create a transparent online casino where honest gambling and fair gaming takes priority. In essence, Rollblock is a place where anyone can play exciting games, have an unforgettable experience, win big and cash out without any hassles. Its dedication to user empowerment and trustworthy practices makes it the go-to platform for most gamblers. As a result, Rollblock is home to thousands of active users and the number will keep growing. This is quite impressive, as Rollblock is still in presale. Having a working product takes it ahead of most presales, and the fact that it is at the forefront of provably fair gaming sets it apart from other platforms in the GambleFi space. Savvy crypto investors acknowledge Rollblock’s potential and that’s why they’re rushing its presale in droves. Over $7.4 million has been raised in its ongoing presale with more than 10 million tokens sold. The token itself is available for $0.043 and based on its precedents, there’s a real possibility of hitting $1. The bottom line Only hype can push Dogecoin above $1 and that is a defect in itself. When that hype dies down or there’s negative market sentiment, Dogecoin tanks. That is why DOGE depreciated by over 20% in the last month after crypto market sentiments turned sour. Rollblock, on the other hand, is a utility token, so it isn’t really affected by hype. Its aim is to dominate the online gaming market, which is worth over half a trillion dollars at the moment. The new altcoin has the capacity to achieve this feat, but realizing just 1% of this ambition will push its price above $1 and fetch early investors enormous gains. This is why no one should miss out on it. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Nabiullina said the central bank was considering three options: keeping the interest rate steady, raising it to 22% or increasing it further to 23%. Ultimately, the board decided that keeping the interest rate steady was a stronger signal for the economy. “From a forward-looking policy perspective, the stronger signal was that credit growth was slowing,” Nabiullina said. If this trend is confirmed at the February meeting, it could indicate that the desired level of monetary tightening has been achieved, she added. Addressing concerns about the ruble's performance, Nabiullina reiterated that Russia maintains its floating exchange rate policy and does not aim to keep its currency at a certain level. Related News: The Decline Also Hit Donald Trump: All 6 Altcoins He Bought Suffered Major Decline “Our exchange rate is floating, we do not have a goal of keeping it at a certain level,” he said. However, he explained that currency interventions are made in case financial stability risks that the central bank does not currently foresee arise. Nabiullina reaffirmed the central bank’s cautious approach to cryptocurrencies, distinguishing between domestic and international use cases. “We continue to believe that cryptocurrencies should not be used as a means of domestic payment,” he said. However, while he supports projects involving cryptocurrencies for external payments, he expressed his absolute opposition to their use within Russia’s domestic financial system.

The analyst further projects that breaking this level could pave the way for XRP to target $2.62, a critical resistance zone. If XRP closes above $2.62, EGRAG CRYPTO believes it would confirm the full bullish formation and signal the start of the next upward run. #XRP – As Expected – Trust The Process: In just 6 hours, #XRP will close the 3-day candle hopefully above $2.3 – this is a strong bullish signal!

We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 At the time of pr3ess, the digital asset is trading at $2.25 after dipping below $2 a couple of hours ago. This decline saw Bitcoin fall from above $108k to below $100k, and XRP briefly dip below $2. However, the asset is recovering. Experts have also shared bullish predictions , expecting a swift recovery and continued bullish momentum to close the year.

In the meantime, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is working to file its main brief before Chairman Gary Gensler leaves, but a potential government shutdown may cause delays. Here’s Why! Ripple Lawsuit: Key Dates Set The U.S. Court has ordered Plaintiff Bradley Sostack to submit a Mediation Questionnaire by December 23 similar to the US SEC appeals filing. Following that, the court expects the Appeals Transcript Order by December 31, and the full transcript by January 30. Meanwhile, Sostack will file his opening brief on March 6, 2025, outlining his claims against Ripple and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. Although Ripple Labs, XRP II, and Garlinghouse’s response is due by April 7, 2025. If either party fails to meet these deadlines, the appeal could be dismissed. Previous Court Rulings The recent announcement follows earlier court rulings that have been favorable to Ripple. Despite this, Bradley Sostack is still pushing forward with his claims. Judge Phyllis Hamilton recently approved a motion to amend the decision about judgment and the stay in the case Both sides proposed a new order, agreeing there was no need to postpone the judgment since the class claims were already settled.

The U.S. government is approaching a potential shutdown due to budgetary issues. The situation could delay the SEC’s response to the appeal, with some analysts predicting that the ongoing legal battle could be paused.

XRP Has Been The Top Traded Altcoin On Binance This Month In a new CryptoQuant Quicktake post, community analyst Maartunn has talked about how the altcoins currently compare against each other based on their monthly Binance futures trading volumes. The “trading volume” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset that’s becoming involved in trading on a centralized exchange. In the context of the current topic, the platform is Binance. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the monthly value of this metric for various top altcoins in the sector. From the graph, it’s apparent that during most months of this year, Solana (SOL) dominated the trading volume on the exchange. A shift has occurred in the market during the past couple of months, however, as SOL has lost its number one spot. Last month, it was Dogecoin (DOGE) that managed to surpass the asset to become the number one altcoin in this metric, while this month, XRP has overtaken both of them. So far, XRP has seen trading volume amounting to $116.6 billion on the exchange. This value is also certain to go even higher, as this month of December still has one-third of the way to go. While Binance doesn’t make up for the entire sector, the exchange is still the largest in terms of volume, so the trend on there can be representative of the wider market. “It’s important to track the top-traded coins on Binance, as they should be your main focus when trading altcoins,” notes Maartunn. During the last couple of days, the entire cryptocurrency sector has witnessed a crash. Based on the monthly Binance volume, though, the analyst says, “XRP seems to be one that could recover quickly.” In some other news, the market plummet in the last 24 hours has meant that the derivatives side of the cryptocurrency sector has registered a massive amount of liquidations, according to data from CoinGlass. Out of the $1.40 billion liquidations that have occurred inside this window, XRP-related contracts seem to have contributed for around $42 million, as the below heatmap shows. Interestingly, Dogecoin and Solana appear to have seen a larger flush than XRP. This may be down to the fact that both of these assets have also witnessed a deeper price drawdown. XRP Price During the latest crash, XRP briefly slipped under the $2.0 level, but it seems the coin has managed to recover back above the mark for now as its price is trading around $2.1.

In a new thread, Tapiero tells his 123,500 followers on the social media platform X that once the US government tightens up fiscal policy, the top crypto asset by market cap will skyrocket. According to Tapiero, the Federal Reserve is too focused on inflation, and interest rates in the US are still too high. “Danger in China. Do people understand? The second-largest economy in [the] world DEFLATING now. Fed concerns on inflation wrong. Interest rates [are] still too high in [the] US and now fiscal policy will tighten, USD strengthen. Liquidity coming to drive… Bitcoin. $200,000 next year [is] doable.” Tapiero – the founder of crypto venture capital firm 10T Holdings – says that the total market cap of digital assets will make a move toward $10 trillion sometime this cycle. “Back in mid-2019, I thought [the total market cap of crypto] could hit $10 trillion. Hence the fund name. Many Bitcoiners claimed I was too conservative. They have been right. Total market cap of cryptocurrency will challenge $10 trillion this cycle. Unique asset in the history of value and finance.” In a recent post, best-selling finance author Robert Kiyosaki predicts that the crypto king could hit even further heights in 2025 and that its design enables latecomers to make money as well. “The beauty of Bitcoin’s design is [that] it is never too late to start, regardless of how high Bitcoin’s price goes. Bitcoin is designed to make everyone rich, even those who start late. Just don’t get greedy… Bitcoin to $350,000 by 2025.” Bitcoin is trading for $97,082 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day.

Bitcoin, for example, went from $100,000 last Saturday to over $108,000 by Tuesday to reach a new record but then dumped by $16,000 to a multi-week low of $92,000 after the Fed’s hawkish comments for 2025. It has recovered about seven grand since then and is now close to $100,000 once again. Aside from causing billions of dollars worth of liquidations from over-leveraged traders, these enhanced fluctuations played with a lot of people’s emotions, with many speculating whether the bull cycle has ended. The Fear and Greed Index, a metric showing the overall sentiment in the crypto market toward BTC and the altcoins, went from deep ‘extreme greed’ of 87 down to just ‘greed’ – 73 in a couple of days. Such large differences only go to show the emotional part of the ever-volatile crypto market. Zooming out a bit, though, and it’s about perspective. Fear and Greed 7-Day. Source: Alternative.me The Emotional Part It’s obvious that we cannot exclude emotions from anything; otherwise, we wouldn’t be humans. The financial markets are no different, especially crypto, due to its substantial price fluctuations. One cannot just shut down their emotions when they see their portfolio going up and especially down by double-digits within a day or two. Julian Hosp, Bake’s CEO, outlined the importance of emotions but also perspective in a recent X post during the correction. He believes the most vital part of people’s perspective is the direction and not the actual numbers. “Here’s the crazy thing about crypto: It doesn’t matter if Bitcoin is at 30k, 60k, or 100k – it’s all about the direction. Price goes up? Everyone’s euphoric: 90k to 100k? Amazing. 108k to 100k? Disaster. Same price, totally different vibes.” Let’s analyze what happens during those massive green or red candle periods. When BTC’s price surges toward a new all-time high, euphoria kicks in. Remember what happened back in 2021? Bitcoin jumped toward $70,000, and people put laser eyes on X (then Twitter) as they were focused on its price going to $100,000. And what happened next – BTC dumped and went into a year-long bear market. Fear dominated during that dark period, especially when previous industry giants like FTX and Celsius went bust. The landscape changed once again in 2023 when BlackRock filed for a spot in Bitcoin ETF, which essentially guaranteed that the US SEC would finally greenlight such products. The same happened when Donald Trump, who made numerous pro-crypto promises during his campaign, won the elections, and BTC started pumping. The asset indeed went into six-digit territory, and the aforementioned euphoria started to kick in. People celebrated when it hit $100,000, but it then tapped $108,000 and went back to $100,000 – this time, the overall sentiment was not all that bullish, even though it seemed impossible just two years ago to be at this level. Mirror of Emotions Hosp concluded that the crypto market is a “mirror of emotions: greed, feat, hope – it’s all about the feeling of where the market is heading.” He noted that the ultimate utility is the price itself, and rationality goes away when that price and trends “dominate over facts.” He added that large green candles “generate more hype than any actual numbers ever could.” We know it’s impossible to leave emotions at the door when dealing with finances, especially crypto. However, one should zoom out during such violent corrections as the one from this week and look at the bigger picture – is your portfolio better now than it was a few months/years ago? If yes, then keep calm and keep doing what you have been doing. If not, then you need to analyze what went wrong and how you can improve.

37914929,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112666,1734768551,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BTC Dominance Shows Signs of Recovery After 6% Dip: CryptoQuant CEO’s Insights,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/btc-dominance-recovery/,"Bitcoin (BTC) , the flagship cryptocurrency, remains a focal point in market discussions as it recovers from a recent 6% dip in dominance. According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, this fluctuation doesn’t indicate a traditional altcoin season. Instead, the current market dynamics suggest that liquidity flows into select altcoins rather than the broader altcoin market. BTC Dominance Recovery in Focus In the cryptocurrency space, Bitcoin dominance refers to BTC’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market capitalization. Historically, significant changes in BTC dominance have often heralded shifts in the market, including altcoin booms or Bitcoin’s resurgence. Ki Young Ju shared on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin dominance is rebounding after a noticeable dip. He emphasized that the current conditions do not mirror the classic “alt season” narratives that have characterized past cycles. Instead, a handful of altcoins have outperformed, attracting liquidity, while the majority remain unaffected. What Is Driving BTC Dominance Recovery? The recovery of Bitcoin dominance can be attributed to several market factors: Institutional Interest: Recent developments show increased institutional adoption of Bitcoin, such as spot ETF applications and major partnerships. This continued interest fuels Bitcoin’s position as the leading cryptocurrency. Macro Conditions: As traditional markets grapple with economic uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to emerge as a hedge against inflation, reinforcing its dominance. Altcoin Saturation: Many altcoins have struggled to maintain investor interest due to oversaturation in the market, with only a select few showing promise. Why Is It Not a Traditional Altcoin Season? A “traditional altcoin season” typically occurs when Bitcoin’s dominance declines significantly, and the majority of altcoins experience widespread growth. However, this cycle appears different. According to Ki Young Ju, liquidity is flowing selectively to specific altcoins rather than spreading across the board. Some potential reasons include: Regulatory Pressure: Many altcoins face scrutiny from regulators, creating uncertainty for investors. Shift in Market Sentiment: Investors are favoring utility-driven projects over speculative tokens. Market Consolidation: The crypto market is maturing, leading to consolidation around proven assets like Bitcoin and select altcoins with strong fundamentals. Key Altcoins Benefiting From the Current Dynamics While the overall altcoin market is subdued, some tokens have managed to attract significant liquidity. Ju referred to this selective growth as “{your_outperformed_alt} season,” implying that the winners in this cycle are few but impactful. Among the notable performers are: Ethereum (ETH): With its robust DeFi ecosystem, Ethereum continues to draw attention from institutional and retail investors. Solana (SOL): Known for its high-speed transactions and developer-friendly environment, Solana has seen a resurgence in interest. Polygon (MATIC): As a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, Polygon remains a top choice for projects seeking scalability. Market Outlook: Bitcoin’s Next Moves As Bitcoin dominance rebounds, it raises questions about its next trajectory. Analysts suggest the following possibilities: Further Recovery: If Bitcoin continues to attract institutional investment, its dominance could strengthen further. New All-Time Highs: Positive macroeconomic trends and increased adoption might push Bitcoin towards new price milestones. Potential Consolidation: A stable dominance level could signal market consolidation, benefiting both Bitcoin and select altcoins. Implications for Investors For crypto investors, the current market dynamics offer valuable insights: Focus on Fundamentals: Given the selective nature of liquidity flows, investors should prioritize projects with strong use cases and proven track records. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin remains a safe bet, diversification into promising altcoins can provide opportunities for growth. Stay Informed: Regular updates from reliable sources like CryptoQuant can help investors navigate the evolving landscape. Conclusion Bitcoin dominance is making a recovery after a recent dip, signaling resilience in the face of market volatility. However, this recovery does not signify a traditional altcoin season, as highlighted by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju. Instead, a few select altcoins are leading the charge, reflecting a more targeted flow of liquidity. For investors, understanding these shifts is crucial for making informed decisions. As the crypto market continues to mature, Bitcoin’s role as the cornerstone of the ecosystem remains unshaken, while opportunities in altcoins require careful consideration.

Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg Television, Wood attributed her forecast to Bitcoin’s unique supply-and-demand dynamics, its capped supply, and the growing institutional interest driven by favorable regulatory developments. Bitcoin’s Supply Cap: A Key Driver of Price Growth At the heart of Cathie Wood’s prediction is Bitcoin’s immutable supply limit of 21 million coins. Unlike traditional commodities like gold, where higher prices incentivize increased production, Bitcoin’s supply is governed by a decentralized protocol that ensures no more coins can be minted beyond the cap. Wood explained, “Bitcoin’s capped supply makes it fundamentally different from other assets. Its scarcity increases as demand grows, driving value.” This Year’s Rally as a Case Study In 2024, Bitcoin surged past $108,000, highlighting the impact of scarcity on its price. The rally has reaffirmed investor confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value and hedge against inflation. Bitcoin vs. Gold: The Scarcity Factor Bitcoin has often been likened to digital gold, but Wood emphasized a key difference: Gold’s Supply Growth: Higher gold prices typically lead to increased mining activity, which boosts supply and moderates price increases. Bitcoin’s Fixed Supply: Bitcoin’s supply is finite, creating a “hard ceiling” that ensures scarcity as demand grows. This distinction has made Bitcoin an attractive alternative to gold, particularly among younger, tech-savvy investors. Regulatory Easing Under Trump Administration Wood also cited anticipated regulatory changes as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s growth. With Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency, the crypto industry expects a more favorable regulatory environment. How Regulation Impacts Bitcoin Institutional Adoption: Clearer regulations could pave the way for increased institutional investment, including Bitcoin spot ETFs. Retail Growth: A friendlier regulatory framework may encourage more retail participation in the crypto market. Global Adoption: U.S. policy often influences global crypto regulation, potentially leading to broader acceptance. Supply and Demand Dynamics in Action Cathie Wood’s prediction hinges on the principle that Bitcoin’s fixed supply, combined with rising demand, will create upward price pressure. Here’s why: Institutional Interest: Institutions are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Geopolitical Factors: Economic instability and inflation fears drive investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge. Adoption Trends: Growing adoption for payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications fuels demand. ARK’s Historical Bitcoin Advocacy ARK Investment Management has long been bullish on Bitcoin. The firm has invested heavily in crypto-related assets and has consistently advocated for the digital currency’s potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. Wood’s $1 million prediction aligns with ARK’s broader investment thesis, which sees Bitcoin as a transformative asset with long-term growth potential. Challenges to Bitcoin’s $1 Million Target While the prediction is optimistic, several challenges could impede Bitcoin’s path to $1 million: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite Trump’s expected easing, the global regulatory landscape remains fragmented. Technological Risks: Cybersecurity threats and network vulnerabilities could undermine investor confidence. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, which may deter risk-averse investors. Implications for the Broader Crypto Market If Bitcoin reaches $1 million, it could have a ripple effect across the crypto ecosystem: Altcoin Growth: Rising Bitcoin prices often boost the broader crypto market. Increased Innovation: A bullish Bitcoin market may encourage more blockchain innovation and investment. Global Adoption: Bitcoin’s success could accelerate adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology worldwide. What Investors Should Consider Cathie Wood’s prediction underscores the importance of understanding Bitcoin’s fundamentals and market dynamics. Here’s what investors should keep in mind: Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s price movements can be volatile, but its scarcity-driven growth is a long-term play. Diversification: While Bitcoin holds promise, diversification remains a prudent strategy. Stay Updated: Regularly monitor market trends, regulatory developments, and expert analyses to make informed decisions. Conclusion Cathie Wood’s forecast of Bitcoin surpassing $1 million by 2030 is rooted in the cryptocurrency’s fixed supply, rising demand, and anticipated regulatory easing. While challenges remain, the potential for Bitcoin to reshape global finance is undeniable. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction, investors must weigh the risks and rewards of participating in this transformative market. With its capped supply and growing institutional interest, Bitcoin’s journey toward $1 million could redefine the future of money and value.

37914989,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112672,1734768645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Japan’s LDP Pushes for Crypto Tax Reform with Proposed 20% Taxation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japans-ldp-pushes-for-crypto-tax-reform-with-proposed-20-taxation/,"The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan is advocating for a significant overhaul of the country’s cryptocurrency tax policy. According to reports by CoinPost and Japanese media outlets, the proposed reform includes a reduced, separate tax rate of 20% on cryptocurrency trading profits and the introduction of a loss carryforward system. This initiative could mark a pivotal shift in how Japan treats cryptocurrency income, potentially making the nation a more attractive hub for digital asset investors and businesses. The Current Tax System for Cryptocurrency in Japan Under Japan’s existing tax framework, cryptocurrency profits are classified as miscellaneous income , subjecting them to progressive tax rates of up to 55%. This classification places a heavy financial burden on individual investors, particularly those in higher income brackets. Key Features of the Current System High Tax Rates: Progressive rates can discourage active trading and investment. No Loss Carryforward: Investors cannot offset crypto losses against future profits, exacerbating financial risks. Limited Clarity: The lack of detailed regulations creates confusion among taxpayers and accountants alike. What the LDP’s Proposed Tax Reform Entails The LDP’s proposal aims to modernize the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies to align with global standards and foster innovation in Japan’s digital economy. Key Features of the Proposed Reform 20% Separate Tax Rate: Profits from cryptocurrency trading would be taxed at a flat 20%, a significant reduction from the current maximum of 55%. Loss Carryforward System: Investors could offset losses incurred in one tax year against future profits, reducing their overall tax burden. Streamlined Classification: A dedicated tax category for cryptocurrency trading would eliminate ambiguity and ensure uniform application of the law. These changes would align cryptocurrency taxation with other investment categories, such as stocks and forex trading, creating a fairer system for investors. Why the Push for Crypto Tax Reform? The LDP’s push for reform is driven by several factors: Boosting Competitiveness: Japan aims to strengthen its position as a leading crypto-friendly nation amid rising global competition. Encouraging Innovation: Lower taxes and clearer rules could attract blockchain startups and crypto-related businesses to set up operations in Japan. Investor Confidence: Simplified and fairer taxation would encourage more retail and institutional participation in the crypto market. The Global Context: How Japan Compares Japan’s current taxation policy is considered one of the most stringent among developed nations. Comparatively: United States: Crypto gains are taxed as capital gains, with rates varying based on income and holding period. Germany: Long-term crypto holdings are tax-free after one year, providing significant incentives for investors. Singapore: No capital gains tax on cryptocurrency transactions, making it a global crypto hub. The proposed reforms could help Japan remain competitive in the global crypto landscape. Potential Impact of the Reform For Individual Investors Reduced Financial Burden: A flat 20% tax would lower the tax liability for most investors, particularly high-income traders. Increased Market Activity: Lower taxes and loss carryforward provisions could encourage more frequent trading and investment. For Businesses and Startups Favorable Ecosystem: A friendlier tax regime would attract blockchain projects and crypto firms, fostering innovation. Talent Retention: Entrepreneurs and developers may find Japan more appealing, reducing the talent drain to countries with better crypto policies. Challenges and Considerations While the proposed reforms are a step in the right direction, they are not without challenges: Implementation Complexity: Transitioning to a new tax system requires clear guidelines and substantial administrative effort. Potential Revenue Loss: The government may face initial revenue shortfalls from reduced tax rates. Regulatory Oversight: Striking a balance between encouraging innovation and preventing misuse of cryptocurrencies remains critical. Japan’s Crypto Legacy and Future Outlook Japan has been a pioneer in cryptocurrency regulation, being one of the first countries to legalize Bitcoin as a payment method in 2017. The proposed tax reforms are part of its broader effort to maintain leadership in the blockchain and crypto space. By addressing investor concerns and creating a more equitable tax structure, Japan could pave the way for sustainable growth in its digital economy. Conclusion Japan’s LDP is making strides toward a more progressive cryptocurrency tax system with its proposal for a 20% separate tax rate and a loss carryforward system. These changes have the potential to transform the nation’s crypto landscape, making it more attractive for investors and businesses alike. While challenges remain, the proposed reforms signal Japan’s commitment to fostering innovation and maintaining its status as a global leader in the crypto space. If implemented effectively, these changes could position Japan as a top destination for digital asset activity in the years to come.

With an impressive HYPE price rally over the week, the token has entered its prime, and here is why. HYPE Price Hit ATH After 63% Rally Beating the crypto market crash’s odds, the HYPE token is constant on the bullish move. Over the week, the Hyperliquid price has increased 63%, pushing the token to an ATH of $34.71. More importantly, its market capitalization has hit the $10B mark, placing it right after the Polkadot in the top 20 cryptos. The layer one blockchain, Hyperliquid, launched its native token, HYPE, just three weeks ago and has followed a bullish trajectory. As a result, the HYPE price has risen 977% since then, impressing the community. At present, the HYPE is under a minor consolidation, currently trading at $34.47 with a 50% increased trading volume of $655.01M Notable, the token is still missing listings on the top crypto exchanges like Binance and others, but the current surge has increased the possibility of that. Hyperliquid’s Buyback Mechanism Fueling The Price Hyperliquid has implemented many unique feature that investors highly appreciate. The L-1 blockchain network has introduced a fee-to-buyback mechanism, which utilizes the 100% fees of the trades to purchase tokens. This buyback eventually creates buying pressure on the token, pumping the price. Interestingly, the firm utilizes every $10K revenue to buy back HYPE tokens, per a crypto analyst, who further revealed that the blockchain had recently spent $3M to buy more Hyperliqud token, resulting in the current HYPE price rally. Additional reports reveal that the firm has completed $16B in notional perpetual volume, which is almost 30% of the volume of Binance. With this, many users have called Hyperliquid ‘the decentralized Binance,’ where its lower perpetual fees and many other factors constantly increase demand. Interestingly, a few traders have begun urging other blockchain networks to follow similar features, especially Ethereum, as the ETH price is struggling on the charts. HYPE Airdrop Success Favored the HYPE Price Rally HYPE airdrop has become one of the biggest crypto airdrops in 2024 after distributing 270M HYPE among 94,000 users per ASXN data. The airdrop went live in late November and significantly pumped the token price during the launch. With that, the HYPE token surged 125% within a day. Analysts have called this a perfect marketing tactic, as they kept airdropped to limited people (94,000 only) compared to its competitor. On average, eligible users received 2881 HYPE, but a few more enormous whales have received as high as 508,985 tokens, worth $16M per current price. What’s In There For You? After a massive crash earlier, top altcoins began showing momentum today. However, the Hyperliquid token is way ahead of others, with a 63% surge over the week and HYPE price ATH at $34.71 after the firm spent $3M on buying back the HYPE token. The layer1 blockchain network has implemented quite a few interesting features, like the fee-to-buyback mechanism, which is constantly building the buying pressure of the token, eventually pushing the price. Moreover, the demand will likely grow with its low trading fees on perpetual contracts and constant development, further fueling its price rally.

(Nasdaq: MSTR), the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, is experiencing a sharp decline in pre-market trading. According to TradingView data, the company’s stock fell by 5.64%, trading at $308.04 as of December 20, 2024. This latest drop extends a worrying trend for the tech and Bitcoin-focused firm, marking a staggering 40% decline since its November 21 peak. MicroStrategy’s Relationship with Bitcoin MicroStrategy is widely known for its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which has made it a proxy for Bitcoin’s market performance. The company holds over 150,000 BTC, positioning it as a corporate leader in cryptocurrency adoption. However, the company’s reliance on Bitcoin has made its stock price highly sensitive to the cryptocurrency’s price fluctuations. Why Is MicroStrategy Stock Dropping? Several factors contribute to MicroStrategy’s current stock decline: Bitcoin Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price movements directly affect MicroStrategy’s stock. Recent BTC market corrections have likely influenced the sell-off. Market Sentiment: Investor confidence in tech and crypto-focused firms has wavered amid global economic uncertainty and regulatory scrutiny. Profit-Taking After November’s Rally: MicroStrategy’s peak stock price in November attracted profit-taking by investors, contributing to the subsequent decline. Stock Performance Metrics As of the pre-market session on December 20, 2024: Current Price: $308.04 Percentage Drop: 5.64% from the previous day. Peak-to-Current Decline: Nearly 40% since November 21. The steep decline raises questions about MicroStrategy’s strategy and its exposure to Bitcoin’s volatile market. Long-Term Implications for MicroStrategy While short-term volatility is causing concern among investors, the long-term outlook for MicroStrategy depends on several factors: Bitcoin’s Performance: A rebound in Bitcoin’s price could reverse the downward trend in MicroStrategy’s stock. Corporate Strategy: The company’s continued focus on Bitcoin acquisition could either be a boon or a risk, depending on market trends. Investor Sentiment: Rebuilding investor confidence will be key, especially as MicroStrategy remains a high-risk, high-reward investment. Market Analysts Weigh In Experts have varying opinions on MicroStrategy’s stock trajectory: Bullish Perspective: Analysts bullish on Bitcoin believe that MicroStrategy’s stock could recover alongside a broader crypto market rally. Bearish Perspective: Others caution that the company’s heavy reliance on Bitcoin introduces significant risk, particularly in uncertain market conditions. Impact on Cryptocurrency Markets MicroStrategy’s performance also affects perceptions of Bitcoin as a corporate asset: Positive Feedback Loop: When MicroStrategy’s stock rises, it often boosts confidence in Bitcoin adoption by institutions. Negative Sentiment: Conversely, stock declines can lead to skepticism about Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset. What Investors Should Know For investors, MicroStrategy remains a high-risk, high-reward option due to its unique position as a major Bitcoin holder. Here are some key takeaways: Diversification Is Key: MicroStrategy’s stock may not suit risk-averse investors due to its high volatility. Monitor Bitcoin Trends: The company’s fortunes are closely tied to Bitcoin’s price movements, making it crucial to stay informed about the crypto market. Long-Term Outlook: Despite recent declines, MicroStrategy’s bullish stance on Bitcoin positions it as a long-term bet on the cryptocurrency’s success. Conclusion MicroStrategy’s 6% pre-market drop reflects its susceptibility to Bitcoin price movements and broader market sentiment. While the company’s innovative strategy has made it a pioneer in cryptocurrency adoption, its reliance on Bitcoin exposes it to significant volatility. Investors should weigh the risks and rewards of holding MicroStrategy stock carefully. With a nearly 40% decline since November, the company faces challenges but remains a compelling player in the intersection of technology and cryptocurrency.
