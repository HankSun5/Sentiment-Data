Early investors could see pennies transform into millions – so don’t miss your shot at crypto glory! Pepe Pepe (PEPE) has seen significant price changes over the past six months, rising by 67.15%. In contrast, the past week showed a drop of 24.02%, and over the past month, it decreased by 6.85%. The current price ranges between $0.00002 and $0.00002779, reflecting recent market volatility. The coin is nearing its nearest support level at $0.000018, which is about 25% below the current price. Falling below this could lead to the next support at $0.00001126, a further drop. On the upside, if demand increases, Pepe could reach the nearest resistance at $0.00003144, about 31% higher. Breaking past this could aim for the second resistance at $0.00003818, nearly 59% above the current price. Technical indicators suggest a possible rebound. The RSI is at 30.42, close to oversold, indicating the price may rise. The Stochastic indicator at 32.86 points to similar potential. The 10-day moving average is $0.00001929, below the 100-day average of $0.00002261, showing a recent downtrend. If momentum builds, the price could move above these averages. The negative MACD level could shift to positive, signaling upward momentum. Dogecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced notable price changes recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 12.87%, settling within a range of $0.36 to $0.46. The past month saw a smaller decline of 2.80%. Despite these short-term drops, Dogecoin has surged by 189.72% over the last six months, showing significant long-term growth. Technical indicators reveal mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.21, nearing oversold territory, which might suggest a potential price rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.36, while the 100-day SMA is slightly higher at $0.39, indicating a short-term downward trend. The MACD level stands at -0.00808, reflecting recent bearish momentum. Looking ahead, Dogecoin’s nearest support level is $0.31. If the price falls below this, the next support is at $0.21. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is $0.51. Breaking through this could lead to the next resistance at $0.62. Overcoming these resistance levels could result in price increases exceeding 10% to 20%. Given its substantial six-month growth, Dogecoin may have the potential for further gains if market conditions become favorable. Conclusion While PEPE and DOGE are notable, XYZ unites sports fans and meme culture, aiming for 20,000% growth and positioning itself as the next G.O.A.T of memecoins.

This comes after the case had been referred to the Commission by an Italian competition authority in September asking if the proposed acquisition would not result in competition concerns in the European Economic Area (EEA). EU gave thumps up to the Nvidia transaction After some rigorous screening, the EU said it approved the proposed acquisition of the Israeli startup saying it did so unconditionally, adding the transaction would raise no competition concerns in the EEA. According to a Reuters article , the EU’s probe into the deal focused on activities that could strengthen Nvidia’s control over GPUs, sought-after chips that could divide and process computer tasks. The EU, however, concluded that the deal would not raise any such concerns in the EEA. Nvidia designs and supplies GPUs for data center applications, while the Israeli startup – Run:ai is a supplier of GPU orchestration software that enables corporate clients to manage their compute infrastructure. “Since Nvidia is a leading producer of key hardware for AI applications used in the EU and beyond, it was important to carefully check whether its acquisition of start-up software company Run:ai may have negatively impacted competition in critical markets which are key for future competitiveness,” said Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for clean, just and competitive transition at the European Commission, in a statement. “But our market investigation confirmed to us that other software options compatible with Nvidia’s hardware will remain available in the market.” Ribera. The statement also emphasized that the two companies’ areas of activity do not overlap, while the EU Commission on the other hand has the authority to oversee mergers and acquisitions of large multinational corporations operating in the EU countries. The EU has scrutinized other big techs apart from Nvidia Nvidia announced the acquisition of the Israeli startup in April in a deal worth $700 million, a price tag that was to be reviewed by the bloc following requests by Italian regulators under the EU Merger Regulation (EUMR). When announcing its plans, Nvidia said the deal would help customers make more efficient use of their computing resources. “Run:ai enables enterprise customers to manage and optimize their compute infrastructure, whether on-premises, in the cloud or in hybrid environments,” Nvidia said in an April 24 blog post. Run:ai co-founder and CEO Omri Geller revealed the startup has collaborated with Nvidia since 2020, adding that both companies “share a passion for helping our customers make the most of their infrastructure.” However, regarding the proposed acquisition, the EU Commission revealed in October that Nvidia would need to get approvals and antitrust clearance for the transaction due to the raised concerns that the deal would undermine competition within the sectors in which the two companies operate. Responding to the EU’s concerns then, Nvidia spokesperson John Rizzo said back then that the company was willing to provide any information to regulators regarding the deal. “After the acquisition closes, we’ll continue to make AI available in every cloud and enterprise, and help customers select any system and software solution that works best for them.” Nvidia. These developments also come as the big tech industry has for years enjoyed minimal oversight on the takeover of smaller rival firms prompting regulators to pay more attention to these to ensure fair competition. Firms like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have also been scrutinized over their investments in AI startups or other tech firms as they expand their AI operations and stay ahead of peers. The EU has probed the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI as well as others like Google and Samsung.

Powered by blockchain and AI, this innovative low cap altcoin aims to transform property investment while offering substantial returns. With projections of significant growth by Q2 2025, the anticipation is growing. But what sets this altcoin apart, and why do the Solana expert believe it could deliver exceptional ROI? Let’s find out the key factors driving the excitement. Why Solana Expert Sets His Sight on this Low Cap Altcoin A Solana expert who turned an initial investment into millions during Solana’s rise from $0.50 to nearly $260 now sees similar potential in a low cap altcoin. Driven by high-speed transactions and low fees, Solana’s success has established itself as a blockchain powerhouse for decentralized apps and has become a benchmark. This expert predicts a new altcoin will deliver exceptional ROI by Q2 2025, driven by Solana’s market growth and trends now evident with this low cap altcoin. The focus is identifying transformative opportunities that mirror Solana’s exponential growth and real-world impact on the cryptocurrency market. PropiChain is Transforming Real Estate with Outstanding Blockchain Investment Features PropiChain is an RWA altcoin reshaping the real estate investment landscape by combining blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and the Metaverse to create a revolutionary platform for buying, selling, and managing property. Its unique features set it apart from traditional property investment methods, and it has started to generate significant attention in the industry. Real estate tokenization is one of the key innovations of this low cap altcoin. This process enables investors to buy digital tokens representing fractional real estate asset ownership. For instance, an investor with as little as $500 can own a share of a high-value property, earning rental income relative to their investment. This makes real estate investment accessible to a broader audience, from small individual investors to seasoned professionals looking to expand their portfolios. Another standout feature is PropiChain altcoin AI-powered predictive analytics tools. These tools provide users real-time data on market trends, property values, rental yields, and occupancy rates. For example, an investor considering a luxury rental property can access detailed insights about its financial performance, helping them make well-informed decisions. This AI-driven approach reduces the risks traditionally associated with property investments and maximizes potential returns. This altcoin also integrates Metaverse technology, allowing users to take virtual tours of properties from anywhere in the world. This feature adds convenience and opens up new investment opportunities by allowing investors to explore properties remotely. Smart contracts are central to this altcoin’s operations, automating key processes like rental payments and fund distribution. This eliminates the need for middlemen, streamlines transactions, and reduces administrative costs. This low cap altcoin blockchain ensures security and transparency in every transaction, preventing fraud and title disputes. With these innovative features, this low cap altcoin addresses the challenges of the real estate market while creating new opportunities for global investors. The Future of Real Estate Investment: A High-ROI Opportunity in a Low Cap Altcoin As Solana traders and crypto enthusiasts shift their attention to this low cap altcoin, PropiChain’s potential for massive growth becomes undeniable. With a projected 50,000% ROI by Q2 2025, altcoin is carving its path in property investment. Its innovative features stand apart from speculative altcoins. Having raised over $1 million in presale, PropiChain is poised for success, with tokens currently priced at $0.011 in stage 2. With a BlockAudit security audit ensuring the altcoin’s safety and a CoinMarketCap listing on the horizon, confidence in PropiChain continues to build. Early investment in this low cap altcoin could prove highly rewarding, particularly for those securing tokens at presale prices. For example, an investment of $800 at the presale price of $0.011 could acquire approximately 72,727 tokens. With projections of 50,000% growth, this investment could see a return of over $400,000 by Q2 2025. Now is the time to copy the Solana expert. Early adopters can gain a significant advantage as PropiChain moves closer to its full launch. Join a community of forward-thinking investors and secure your place in the future of blockchain-powered real estate investment.

This development is significant considering current market dynamics with massive price decline in the last 48 hours. Despite the rapid price decrease, investors have remained unwilling to sell. Low Bitcoin Liquidity and Rising Demand Hints at Looming Storm According to CryptoQuant , an on-chain analysis firm, the cumulative volume of Bitcoin readily available for sale, referred to as sell-side liquidity inventory, is low. Based on the figures, the current sell-side liquidity inventory is at a level last seen in October 2020. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that only 3.397 million BTCs are available for sale across different platforms. These include exchanges, miners, OTC desks, and GBTC. In 2024 alone, sell-side liquidity has dropped by 678,000 BTC. The shrinking supply will impact possible selling pressure and create a tighter market demand. This could lead to a price rally if it continues as demand surges. Will Accumulator Trigger Supply Shock? Meanwhile, Bitcoin demand has grown steadily since late September. Figures show Bitcoin has been growing at 228,000 BTC per month. Additionally, accumulator addresses- wallets that consistently buy Bitcoin but have never sold- are also strengthening their holdings. These addresses have increased their monthly accumulation to a record level of 495,000 BTC. Notably, accumulators are reckoned with in Bitcoin as they contribute to the liquidity crunch. This is because they lock BTC away from circulation. Market observers say their activities contributed to the recent all-time high (ATH) of $108,000 BTC attained this December. Market Chaos and the Path Forward On December 20, 2024, massive liquidation hit the crypto market as over $1 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated within 24 hours. Bitcoin price plunged to a low of $92,281, leaving many investors concerned about the next price trajectory of the asset. The market soon rebounded as BTC resumed its climb and found support at the $95,000 level. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $97,028. Market volume remains up by 8.09% at $116.76 billion. Analysts say this hints at the confidence among some investors who might be buying the dip , anticipating that the coin could reclaim its position above the $100,000 level .

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) says it’s suing the three banking giants and Zelle’s parent firm for allegedly failing to protect people from widespread fraud on the popular payments network. The lawsuit, which has been anticipated for months, alleges hundreds of thousands of the banks’ customers filed fraud complaints and were largely denied assistance, with some being told to contact the fraudsters directly to get their money back. “Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo also allegedly failed to properly investigate complaints or provide consumers with legally required reimbursement for fraud and errors. The CFPB is seeking to stop the alleged unlawful practices, secure redress and penalties, and obtain other relief.” The CFPB alleges widespread consumer losses and security failures on the part of the banks, stating the lenders limited identity verification measures, allowed repeat offenders to hop between banks, ignored red flag warnings from customers and abandoned customers after fraud occurred. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra says the banks, which co-own Zelle, rushed to launch the platform without properly addressing security concerns. “The nation’s largest banks felt threatened by competing payment apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle. By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fend for themselves.” Zelle says it’s fully prepared to defend itself in court. “The CFPB’s attacks on Zelle are legally and factually flawed, and the timing of this lawsuit appears to be driven by political factors unrelated to Zelle. Zelle leads the fight against scams and fraud and has industry-leading reimbursement policies that go above and beyond the law.” JPMorgan Chase has previously said it may sue the CFPB over the Zelle investigation, stating the agency is going “above and beyond what the law requires.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The company announced this in a December 20 post on X, adding that the repayment will be made from exercising its 12th series stock acquisition rights. Details of the 5th Series Ordinary Bonds In a separate post , Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said the money accrued from the offering will be used to push forward the buying of BTC initially planned for 2025 to before the end of 2024. “These funds will accelerate Bitcoin purchases originally planned for 2025 into the current year.” The bond issuance consists of ¥5 billion in total, divided into units of ¥250 million each. The offering will carry no interest and be redeemed at face value, with each bond worth 100 yen per 100 yen principal amount. The scheduled issuance date is December 20, 2024, with the maturity date set for June 16, 2025. The entire security will be allocated to EVO FUND, a private investment entity, and will be subject to redemption provisions. Further, the bonds can be redeemed early if EVO FUND gives written notice at least one business day in advance or if funds from the exercise of the Tokyo-listed firm’s 12th series stock acquisition rights reach a specified threshold. This development follows Metaplanet’s announcement on December 17, 2024, of a separate ¥4.5 billion ($28.7 million) bond issuance that will also mature on June 16, 2025. It means that in just a few days, the company has raised a total of ¥9.5 billion, or about $60.6 million. Bitcoin-Centred Approach Metaplanet’s Bitcoin-centred approach aligns with its strategic focus on adopting the asset as a hedge against economic instability. In June 2024, it acquired 23.351 BTC for approximately $1.6 million, followed by 42.4 BTC for $2.4 million, bringing its total holdings to 203.7 BTC. The company continued to increase its holdings, purchasing 57.273 BTC for $3.4 million and 106.976 BTC worth $6.6 million in October. Additionally, it made a significant purchase of 156.7 BTC in October, valued at $10.4 million. In addition to its buying strategy, the Japanese investment firm recently established a new Bitcoin treasury operations business line. This division will focus on purchasing, holding, and managing the cryptocurrency through various financial instruments, including loans, equity issuances, and convertible bonds. According to BitcoinTreasuries data, as of December 20, 2024, the outfit holds 1,142 BTC, valued at approximately $109.6 million.

The Trump-Vance inaugural committee reportedly confirmed it, and it’s the largest crypto contribution they got. The fund, which has already hit over $200 million, will fuel a three-day bash celebrating Trump’s win and VP-elect JD Vance. Coinbase and Kraken each pledged $1 million, while MoonPay chipped in too, though they haven’t shared how much. Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi told FOX Business said: “For the first time, we have a President who truly understands the potential of disruptive technology and embraces the crypto sector. We’re excited to continue to work with President-Elect Trump and his administration to push for long-overdue regulatory clarity and unlock this next wave of innovation.” Setting new records The inaugural committee has already smashed fundraising records. They’ve blown past the $107 million raised for Trump’s first inauguration in 2017 and Biden’s $62 million in 2021. Insiders say the total could hit $225 million by Inauguration Day. Major names in tech and crypto, like Jesse Powell from Kraken and Marc Andreessen from Andreessen Horowitz, are also on board. They see Trump as a leader who understands blockchain’s potential and are betting he’ll make policies that encourage innovation. The president has already proven that he meant everything he said during his campaign. The Trump administration is stacked. Former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, known for being an early Bitcoin believer, will take over from Gary Gensler as SEC Chair. He is expected to ease up on crypto regulations. David Sacks is also joining as the first crypto and AI czar. He’ll work on bridging the gap between regulators and the crypto industry while leading the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Other pro-crypto picks include Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary and Howard Lutnick as Commerce Secretary, both strong supporters of blockchain. Ripple’s moment and XRP’s rise This spotlight on Ripple brings XRP (XRP) back into focus. The token has had a strong year after its legal battle with the SEC ended in a win. A court ruled that XRP isn’t a security, restoring confidence in the token and pushing its price higher. As of press time, it is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, trading at about $2.30—up nearly 500% since the legal win. Analysts are watching resistance at $2.58, with targets of $2.92 and $4.50, while support levels sit at $2.35 and $1.96. Ripple also just launched RLUSD, its dollar-pegged stablecoin, on December 16. Approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services, it’s available on both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger.

During the Dec. 18 episode of the Open Interest show on Bloomberg Television, Saylor voiced his willingness to provide his advice on the digital assets policy to President-elect Donald Trump, either publicly or confidently, if he is asked to do so. Before expressing his willingness to advise Trump on the crypto policy, Saylor admitted that he had already met “with a lot of people” in the incoming administration but declined to specify the personalities nor mentioned if he already met Trump. Is Saylor fit for a position? Since the 2020s, Michael Saylor has been one of the key Bitcoin advocates and investors. Saylor is one who puts money where his mouth is, as he personally spent around one billion dollars on BTC. In 2020, Saylor took to X (Twitter at the time) to announce that he personally owns 17,732 bitcoins and that he acquired these coins before MicroStrategy (MSTR) made the first massive purchase of bitcoins. YahooFinance! reports that currently MicroStrategy owns around 440,000 BTC, which is close to a 2% share of the entire BTC supply. MicroStrategy made headlines on the eve of the latest BTC price peak when the company was included in the Nasdaq 100 index. Read more: MicroStrategy to join Nasdaq-100 Index following Bitcoin-driven stock surge Michael Saylor names Bitcoin an apex property of the human race and has an insatiable thirst for bitcoins. He compares Bitcoin to the territories like Manhattan or Alaska that were bought by the early colonist administration, specifying that Bitcoin is rather a kind of cyberspace. That’s why MicroStrategy aims to own bitcoins in bulk. According to Saylor, buying as much of this “space” as possible is crucial for the United States. This vision speaks to the statement posted by Donald Trump on the Truth Social platform. “We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!” the post reads . Saylor singled out Trump as the most crypto-friendly Republican politician. It seems that Saylor shares the President-elect’s views on Bitcoin. Although not an outright GOP supporter, in September, Saylor made claims that he sees Republicans as a more progressive party when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation. He names regulation pressure decrease, treating crypto as a tool to boost the U.S. economy, and encouraging individuals to pursue their economic aims using digital finance as progressive characteristics of the Republican approach to the crypto industry. What Do We Know About the Crypto Advisory Council? Trump proposed the creation of a crypto advisory council during his now famous speech at the Nashville cryptocurrency conference in July 2024. As of December, not much information about the preparations of this council has been made public. The participating companies’ lineup is not clear yet. However, it has been reported that such brands as Coinbase, Ripple Labs, Paradigm, and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) are seeking interactions with the incoming administration. Allegedly, an a16z rep was involved in advising the Trump team during the presidential campaign. On December 6, Trump introduced entrepreneur and venture capitalist David O. Sacks as the “White House A.I. and Crypto Czar” via the Truth Social post. It’s worth saying that, to say the least, before 2024, Trump wasn’t an avid crypto enthusiast. In the past , the President-elect made a series of anti-crypto remarks, calling Bitcoin “not money” and saying that the value of cryptocurrencies is based on thin air. However, the 2024 Presidential campaign saw a drastic change in Trump’s stance on crypto. He started to take donations in digital currencies, visited a major crypto conference in Nashville where he promised to make America “a crypto capital of the world,” and made several important proposals concerning the cryptocurrency policy. On top of tax cuts for the U.S. cryptocurrency companies, the removal of Gary Gensler from the SEC, and the creation of the strategic Bitcoin reserve, Trump announced the creation of the advisory body with the leading position granted to the richest man on Earth and his passionate supporter Elon Musk. This unofficial agency is called The Department of Government Efficiency, or simply DOGE, a reference to a legendary memecoin, a notorious soft place of a Tesla CEO .

The broader market is still bearing the brunt of Bitcoin’s crash, worrying both investors and speculators. Related Reading: SUI The Rising Star: Analyst Foresees Over $25 Breakthrough Market Overview: A Sudden Change The recent drop in the value of crypto assets has caused around $787 million to be lost through liquidations of different types of digital assets. Dogecoin, which is often considered as a joke, has been among the hardest hit. Approximately $29 million in DOGE liquidations were recorded recently, with bullish positions suffering the most losses, according to CoinGlass data. In a mere 24 hours, the price of Dogecoin plummeted to a low of $0.34 before ultimately stabilizing at approximately $0.365, a 6.05% decline. Macroeconomic issues influencing more general market movements can help to explain this fall. The Federal Reserve’s concern about interest rate cuts has aggravated bearish attitude. For example, Ethereum and Dogecoin followed suit after Bitcoin’s value dropped to the $94k level. A Closer Examination Of Liquidation Issues Approximately $24 million in bullish wagers on Dogecoin were liquidated in the past 24 hours, while $5.93 million in losses were attributed to short positions. The market’s present extreme volatility is underscored by this wave of liquidations. Dogecoin is currently approaching critical support levels, as noted by analysts. Some analysts have speculated that it could fall below $0.20 if adverse momentum persists. Key support levels for DOGE are being closely monitored by market analysts. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that Dogecoin may be oversold, which could indicate a potential rebound if traders are able to effectively defend the critical price zones. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Growth In 2025 With Record $173 Million Q3 Funding—Report The Road Ahead For Dogecoin Despite the present challenges, market watchers’ future expectations of Dogecoin remain high. Some analysts believe that DOGE’s capacity to maintain a weekly closing above $0.26 will help to create a recovery rally toward higher goals. Still, the reality of continuous market pressures and unpredictability helps to temper this hope. As they negotiate this stormy terrain, many traders are left wondering how low Dogecoin might fall before it finds solid ground. Given the expected significant price swings in the next days and weeks, all eyes will be on this famous meme coin as it tries to recuperate in the face of a difficult crypto climate.

Two days ago, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Binance, added support for Usual Protocol ( USUAL ). “Binance is excited to announce that Usual (USUAL) will be added to Binance Simple Earn, Buy Crypto, Binance Convert, Binance Margin, Binance Auto-Invest, and Binance Futures at the respective dates and timings listed below.” According to a post on the social media platform X from Usual in response to the Binance listing, the team says the protocol aims to usher in a “stablecoin renaissance”. “9 0% for the Community: Usual is built to empower, with the majority of tokens for users. No VC (venture capital)/Team Dumps: Just 10% allocated to insiders, cliffed for one year. 100% Revenue for the DAO (decentralized autonomous organization): Every $ of revenue belongs to USUAL holders” According to the Usual Protocol’s website , USUAL acts as a governance token performing two major functions: “1. Usual is a multi-chain infrastructure that aggregates the growing tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) from entities like BlackRock, Ondo, Mountain Protocol, M0 or Hashnote to transform them into a permissionless, on-chain verifiable, and composable stablecoin (USD0). 2. Usual is built around the redistribution of power and ownership to users & third parties, akin to a scenario where Tether’s TVL providers would own the company and the associated revenues.” USUAL is going for $1.43 at time of writing, up 17% on the day.

Ripple is contributing $5 million in its native XRP token, while Kraken has donated $1 million to the Trump-Vance inaugural committee managing the celebrations. Ripple and Kraken Pledge $6M For Donald Trump Inauguration According to a report by FOX Business , Ripple and Kraken are among the cryptocurrency firms contributing to the record-breaking $200 million inaugural fund. The contributions aim to support the three-day celebration marking the swearing-in of Donald Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance on January 20, 2025. Ripple’s $5 million donation will be made in its native XRP token. This reflects the XRP company’s commitment to advancing its presence in the political landscape. Similarly, Kraken, a top crypto exchange , has contributed $1 million in support of the inaugural events. This marks the first time many crypto companies have participated in funding a presidential inauguration. Additionally, President-elect Donald Trump has acted quickly to deliver on his campaign promises to support the cryptocurrency industry. Trump recently nominated Paul Atkins , known for his crypto-friendly stance, as the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Concurrently, David Sacks has been appointed as the first-ever crypto and AI czar, tasked with bridging the gap between the industry and regulators. Sacks will oversee policy initiatives and head the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Showcasing his crypto-friendly stance, the new crypto czar has already outlined plans to investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0 amid growing industry complaints. David Sacks has pledged to address the concerns highlighted by Coinbase’s release of FDIC “pause letters.” Tech and Crypto Leaders Join Record-Breaking Inaugural Fund The Trump-Vance inaugural committee has already raised $200 million, surpassing all previous records. Major contributions from tech giants like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Vlad Tenev, alongside cryptocurrency leaders, underscore the broad support for the event. Each of these tech executives has pledged $1 million or more to the fund. Stressing the importance of crypto industry support for the president-elect, Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi told FOX Business, “For the first time, we have a President who truly understands the potential of disruptive technology and embraces the crypto sector. We’re excited to continue to work with President-Elect Trump and his administration to push for long-overdue regulatory clarity and unlock this next wave of innovation.” These developments come as the US appeals court reveals key dates for the Ripple case. The opening brief is scheduled for March 6, 2025, and XRP company’s answering brief is due by April 7, 2025.

Here’s Where Its Headed Next,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-the-ethereum-price-crash-over-heres-where-its-headed-next/,"The Ethereum (ETH) price’s post-US Federal Reserve meeting rollercoaster continued on Friday with prices crashing as low as the $3,100 area before covering sharply to just above $3,400. That leaves the Ethereum price roughly flat over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap , but losses since last week’s peaks just above $4,100 currently stand at around 16.5%. The Fed rocked sentiment across traditional financial and crypto markets on Wednesday after they sounded the alarm about sticky inflation and revised their guidance for easing in 2025 to just two rate cuts from the four they had previously signaled. US equity marketed, which were arguably due a correction following their impressive run to new record levels since Trump’s election victory last month, were hammered at the time. S&P 500 FALLS 3% IN BIGGEST POST-FED DROP SINCE MARCH 2020 — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) December 18, 2024 It’s no surprise then that a risk appetite-sensitive asset like Ethereum (ETH), and cryptos more broadly, also took a beating. However, price action on Friday in suggests the worse might be over, and a period of stabilization and even a potential recovery into the year end could be on the cards. The Ethereum price looks on course to form a bullish dragonfly doji daily candle, which tends to form around the time of price bottoms. ETH also received super strong support as it neared its 200DMA, and there are strong signs that dip buyers are aggressively entering the market to support the price. Even Trump-affiliated crypto project World Liberty Financial’s wallet was spotted scooping up over $2 million in ETH. Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial ( @worldlibertyfi ) spent another 2.5M $USDT to buy 722.2 $ETH 2 hours ago, after the price dropped by ~6%! Since November 30, this fund has spent $47.5M on 6 crypto assets: $ETH , $WBTC , $LINK , $AAVE , $ENA , and $ONDO (tweet ). Of this,… https://t.co/8v3pGVG8Hr pic.twitter.com/Ix3h8Y1hxc — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) December 20, 2024 Assuming no further macro surprises hit in the coming weeks (unlikely given an absence of important US data or Fed events), focus should return to bullish themes such as the incoming Trump administration’s pro-crypto policy stance, and how a 2025 should bring a new golden era to crypto. That means the stage could be set for a gradual recovery for the Ethereum price into the year’s end, assuming the US dollar and US yields stop charging higher. Calls for new all-time highs before the year’s end may not be realistic, but a gradual recovery in the upcoming sessions back toward $4,000 certainly is. Ethereum Price – Wen New All-Time Highs? The Ethereum price’s strong rejection of its latest retest of yearly highs in the $4,100 area has some investors panicking. But they should relax. Firstly, the major theme in crypto right now is adoption – Wall Street gobbling up supply, talk of a crypto industry boom over the next for years in the US, and potentially even the establishment of Bitcoin national reserves, which would further legitimize the nascent industry. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says the Fed is ""not allowed to own Bitcoin"" They weren't allowed to own Corporate Bonds before Covid either. Rules change… pic.twitter.com/3UBBUuKtdF — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) December 18, 2024 So yes, maybe the Fed won’t cut as much as hoped next year, which isn’t as good for risk assets like stocks and crypto as if they cut more. But the adoption tailwinds are set to far outweigh anyway macro headwinds. And macro isn’t even really a headwind anyway – we remain in an environment of a strong US economy at the same time as a Fed that is still inclined to ease rates, which many longer-term minded investors think of as “Goldilocks” for risk assets. Secondly, ETH’s historic cyclical relationship with BTC also gives reason for optimism about the medium-term Ethereum price outlook. In prior cycles (like 2020/21 and 2017), Bitcoin has broken out to new record highs one to two months ahead of ETH. Bitcoin broke out in mid-November, meaning it’s not been just over one month. That sets the table for a potential January surge for the Ethereum price as it follows Bitcoin’s lead. FUD relating to ETH’s recent price underperformance versus BTC and its “poor tech” when compared to rivals like Solana or Sui shouldn’t deter investors. That’s not to say those blockchains won’t perform well, but Ethereum remains far and away the dominant blockchain in DeFi with around 56% of TVL, per DeFi Llama , and has US ETFs plus the backing of BlackRock , one of Wall Street’s biggest players. . @BlackRock buying $ETH while everyone panic selling: https://t.co/FYX6l6bJ9y pic.twitter.com/rB48lRarUj — Ethereum Daily (@ETH_Daily) December 12, 2024 One BlackRock executive recent commented that, rather than launching more crypto ETF products, their focus right now is on promoting their existing BTC and ETH ETFs to a wider investor base.

On a recent episode of the Coinage podcast, guest SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said that she is open to reconsidering in-kind redemptions for spot bitcoin ETFs.

If Peirce can work with the incoming SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, to facilitate the approval of in-kind redemptions then the spot bitcoin ETFs can serve as some of the biggest on-ramps to Bitcoin, as Bitwise co-founder Hong Kim put it , as opposed to simply existing as speculation vehicles. Bitcoin was born to exist in the wild. It wasn’t born to exist in a Wall Street zoo. In-kind redemptions would allow the bitcoin currently trapped within the zoo the ability to return to its natural habitat. This article is a Take .

This strategic move has sent Rumble stock soaring by 50% in aftermarket trading. The investment, valuing Rumble shares at $7.50 each, will boost the platform’s financial stability and growth prospects. Tether $775M Rumble Investment Sends Stock Soaring 50% Following a recent press release , Tether revealed its decision to acquire 103,333,333 shares of Rumble’s Class A Common Stock at $7.50 per share. The $775 million transaction marks a strategic move into decentralized communications. News of the investment triggered a sharp 50% increase in Rumble stock price during aftermarket trading, reflecting investor optimism about the collaboration. Rumble stock had been experiencing a downturn following Federal Reserve announcements on interest rates. However, the USDT issuer’s backing has restored market confidence, driving the share price upward. This highlights the growing ties between cryptocurrency initiatives and decentralized media platforms. Chris Pavlovski, Rumble’s CEO expressed enthusiasm stating, “This transaction provides an immediate liquidity event for all of our stockholders who elect to participate in the self tender offer. I truly believe Tether is the perfect partner that can put a rocket pack on the back of Rumble as we prepare for our next phase of growth.” These developments come just weeks after the video-sharing platform announced its intention to allocate up to $20 million of its treasury to Bitcoin. The decision reflects Rumble’s focus on diversifying its cash reserves and leveraging Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. $250M Allocated For Growth, $525M For Share Buyback In addition, the USDT issuer has earmarked $250 million from the investment to boost Rumble’s growth initiatives. These funds will expand the platform’s operational capabilities and strengthen its financial foundation, enabling it to compete in the video-sharing and cloud services markets. The remaining $525 million will fund a self-tender offer for up to 70 million shares of Rumble’s Class A Common Stock. This buyback program, offered at the same $7.50 per share as Tether’s investment, provides liquidity for existing stockholders. Rumble’s CEO, Chris Pavlovski, will retain his controlling stake in the company, committing to tender no more than 10 million of his shares in the offer. Additionally, the partnership reflects shared values of decentralization and free speech. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, emphasized the alignment between Tether’s mission to promote financial freedom and Rumble’s dedication to providing an alternative to traditional media. Meanwhile, the move comes as Tether diversifies its portfolio, leveraging profits from USDT’s backing assets, which generated $2.5 billion in net profit during Q3 2024. With this investment, the USDT issuer continues its expansion into sectors such as AI, decentralized messaging, and now, video-sharing platforms. Most recently, Paolo Ardoino revealed that Tether is targeting the end of Q1 2025 for the launch of its AI platform. While specific details remain limited, the platform is expected to integrate privacy-focused Peer-to-Peer AI Agents.

Despite that, 2024 still ended up as a win for the ARB ecosystem . Not only did it become the third-largest blockchain by stablecoin capitalization, it also achieved over $100M in Real World Assets (RWA) tokenization. RWA, stablecoin liquidity, and everything that went right for Arbitrum In 2024 Arbitrum’s stablecoin market cap significantly increased this year, thanks to the enabling environment the blockchain provides. According to reports , Arbitrum added almost $1 billion to its stablecoin market cap between November and this month, positioning it ahead of blockchains like Binance Smart Chain and Solana. As of December 20, Arbitrum has a stablecoin market cap of approximately $6.75 billion and is on track to surpass $7 billion in total value locked. When stablecoin market cap grows on a blockchain as it has on Arbitrum, it typically signals liquidity stacking ahead of activity on the network. There was also a noticeable uptick in the tokenization of RWAs on Arbitrum . At the start of this year, it had less than $100k in tokenized assets, but that stat has steadily grown to around $85 million as of mid-December. Major contributors to this growth include major asset managers like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock,, who deployed tokenized Money Market Funds on the platform. 99% of these tokenized assets are US Treasuries, which is unsurprising as tokenized equities and equity indices have always been a niche sector, with a combined AUM of merely $800k. Investors can access stocks and indices on Arbitrum, such as SPY, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, and COIN. While a majority of those assets are held by externally-owned accounts, the Arbitrum DAO treasury holds 18.4% of the chain’s RWAs, and 10.1% reside in DEX liquidity pools. Why is the Arbitrum DAO holding so much in RWAs? The goal is to create an alternative revenue stream with a different risk profile than ETH and ARB. Ecosystem development and community engagement Arbitrum’s ecosystem recorded significant growth across various parameters. The network’s TVL (Total Value Locked) hit $20 billion, proof of its capacity to scale and innovate. This is thanks to developments like the support for USDC as a gas token for Orbit chains, which facilitated broader adoption and new use cases for onboarding retailers into Web3. Another area that made Arbitrum more enticing to whales is its profitability for liquidity providers. It attracted more users and devs thanks to its shorter block times, which many have lauded. As it stands, Arbitrum One boasts an average block time of 250 milliseconds. However, with Arbitrum Orbit, block times can be configured to go as low as 100 milliseconds if transactions arrive that quickly. The efficiency contributed immensely to the competitive edge the blockchain now has over other blockchains, including Ethereum, which has an average block time of around 12 seconds. Arbitrum stuck around during the bear market, and unsurprisingly, the ecosystem’s community and developer activity have rewarded it with their support. Showcases of its active user base include surpassing a billion transactions on Arbitrum One and the 1 million Stylus NFTs mint milestone. Despite the already strong RWA growth on the chain this year, there’s still significant room for expansion. As it stands, 99% of RWAs on Arbitrum are US Treasuries , which means other industries like real estate are yet to be represented and could be the next in line. Real estate can offer higher yields and tangible value. There has always been global demand for premium properties, which makes it an untapped market with massive potential. Arbitrum’s low fees and scalability make it the ideal ecosystem for RWAs in crypto, and if it intersects with other use cases, it could be set for another great year in 2025.

Speaking in an interview, Scaramucci dismissed the fears of a financial collapse tied to MicroStrategy’s substantial Bitcoin holdings and debt structure, explaining that only a prolonged and systemic Bitcoin crash spanning several years would destabilize the company. Long-Term Debt Structure Shields MicroStrategy MicroStrategy’s financial strategy has attracted attention due to its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions , funded largely through convertible debt and equity sales. The company currently holds $46.02 billion worth of Bitcoin, with an unrealized profit of $18.9 billion. Critics argue that Bitcoin price volatility could jeopardize MicroStrategy’s ability to service its debt, potentially leading to forced Bitcoin sales and market disruptions. However, Anthony Scaramucci emphasized that MicroStrategy’s debt is structured for the long term, reducing the risk of immediate financial distress. “If you really study his balance sheet, he has long, long-term debt, and he has rolling long-term debt,” Scaramucci said, referring to Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s executive chairman. He added that a systemic Bitcoin crash would need to last six or seven years to pose a significant threat to the company’s financial stability. Market Concerns About Bitcoin Price Volatility MicroStrategy’s reliance on Bitcoin as a corporate asset has fueled skepticism among investors. The company’s shares have soared by over 400% this year, driven by Bitcoin’s record-breaking price surges. However, Bitcoin price has recently retreated from its all-time high of $108,000, leading to renewed concerns about MicroStrategy’s exposure to market volatility. Despite this, Anthony Scaramucci believes fears of forced Bitcoin sales are unfounded. “The narrative of him being forced to sell hundreds of thousands of tokens into the market, I think it’s a forced narrative,” he said. Scaramucci attributed this confidence to his Wall Street experience, adding that MicroStrategy’s debt structure is fundamentally different from situations like the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. MicroStrategy Temporary Halt to Bitcoin Purchases Rumors have surfaced that MicroStrategy may pause Bitcoin acquisitions in January due to potential blackout restrictions on share or convertible debt issuance. Such blackout periods are common for publicly traded companies, often imposed around fiscal quarter closings to comply with insider trading regulations. Speculation suggests that the restrictions could prevent Michael Saylor from issuing convertible debt to finance additional Bitcoin purchases. However, analysts believe the potential pause would have limited impact, given the company’s substantial existing Bitcoin holdings and its history of regulatory compliance. MicroStrategy’s next earnings report is expected between February 3 and 5, 2025, with analysts predicting that any blackout period would span January or begin mid-month. The company’s inclusion in the NASDAQ 100 index on December 23 has also raised theories that internal recommendations may have prompted this move. Bitcoin Outlook Remains Positive While Bitcoin’s recent price retreat has sparked concerns, Anthony Scaramucci remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. He acknowledged that Bitcoin could experience corrections of 30% to 40% next year, possibly dropping to $60,000–$70,000. However, he highlighted factors such as the introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and potential favorable legislation that could support Bitcoin’s price stability. “Could it get to $18 trillion dollars in market cap? We believe that it could,” Scaramucci said, while cautioning that the path to such a valuation would not be linear. He also noted that Bitcoin’s growing adoption and institutional interest could continue driving its appreciation over time.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

On Dec. 20, the company announced a $1 million investment in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Following the disclosure, QNTM’s shares on the Nasdaq dropped nearly 10%. Quantum BioPharma, also listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange and Frankfurt Stock Exchange, specializes in biotech solutions for treating neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and alcohol misuse disorders. “The company is now set up to receive financing in cryptocurrencies as well as executing other types of transactions in cryptocurrencies,” Quantum stated, though it did not reveal the specific tokens in its portfolio. More non-crypto businesses are embracing digital assets to diversify their holdings and hedge against inflation. In November, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-over-year, with a 0.3% monthly increase, marking the sharpest rise in seven months. Jiva Technologies, a wellness e-commerce firm, approved a plan to invest up to $1 million in Bitcoin last month, citing its inflation-resistant qualities. Similarly, video-sharing platform Rumble allocated $20 million of its cash reserves to Bitcoin in late November. Hoth Therapeutics, another biopharmaceutical company, added $1 million in Bitcoin to its treasury on Nov. 20. MicroStrategy, which adopted this strategy in 2020, remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 439,000 BTC as of December 2024. Think Tank Advocates Bitcoin Adoption The National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, has pushed major corporations like Amazon and Microsoft to adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies. Microsoft shareholders voted against the proposal during a Dec. 10 meeting, calling it “unnecessary.” Amazon’s shareholders are set to review the proposal in April 2025.

With its volatility remaining low, STX has been steady, aiming for a $3.80 value in 2025 after testing essential support levels. On the other hand, Shiba Inu’s technical analysis shows a decline in momentum as its burn rate plummeted by 99.84%, signaling reduced demand and wavering confidence. BlockDAG (BDAG) distinguishes itself with superior mining efficiency, having sold over 14,919 mining rigs and accruing over $6 million from these sales. The network’s X1 Miner, combined with the efficient X10 Miner, boosts rewards by 10x, presenting an exceptional chance for users to enhance their earnings effortlessly. This interesting pairing positions BlockDAG among the best crypto miners. Stacks Crypto Prediction: Will It Hit $3.80 by 2025? Stacks (STX) is progressing slowly but surely, consolidating around pivotal levels. Recent support at $2.06 demonstrates resilience, with Stacks crypto’s prediction foreseeing a rise to $3.80 by 2025. Its gradual ascent might not attract those seeking faster results. While the Stacks crypto prediction suggests the potential for sustained gains, its dependence on cautious, low-risk development may not captivate those drawn to swift innovation. Moreover, the current resistance at $2.31 acts as an impediment, stalling further advances. Shiba Inu Technical Analysis: Burn Rate Plummets by 99.84% Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces challenges as its burn rate has sharply fallen by 99.84%, with only 112,182 tokens recently burned. This significant drop indicates a slump in demand, as seen in its daily volume dwindling to $604 million, trailing behind its meme coin rivals. Recent Shiba Inu technical analysis points to possible recovery patterns, supported by an ascending channel and crucial moving averages. Although a rebound could occur, the diminishing demand and declining confidence question whether SHIB still stands as the best crypto to buy now. Combine BlockDAG’s X1 & X10 Miners for 10X Rewards! BlockDAG is revolutionizing the way we mine cryptocurrencies, captivating miners across the globe with its top-notch efficiency. For instance, the X1 Miner app is reshaping crypto mining, enabling even novices to extract up to 20 BDAG daily from their smartphones—without battery drain. The app boasts over 270,000 active users. In a recent AMA, BlockDAG’s CEO Antony Turner unveiled a thrilling update: linking the X1 Miner with the X10 device could increase mining output tenfold, allowing users to collect up to 200 BDAG daily. This combination promises to amplify your BDAG earnings, potentially reaching $200 daily once BDAG hits its anticipated $1 coin value. Moreover, BlockDAG’s superior rigs are capable of producing up to 2,000 BDAG coins daily. This breakthrough has reignited interest in BlockDAG’s mining solutions, rapidly driving miner sales beyond $6 million with over 14,919 units snapped up swiftly. This endeavor underscores the company’s commitment to delivering the best crypto miners for everyone, from newcomers to expert miners. Additionally, BlockDAG’s crypto presale has garnered over $170 million by distributing more than 17.4 billion BDAG coins. With an initial price of $0.001 in the first presale batch and a current rate of $0.0234 in batch 26, the price has escalated by 2240%. With BDAG coins in soaring demand and expected to hit a $1 valuation soon, mining them now might offer substantial returns. Miners keen on BlockDAG’s equipment must seize this opportunity before they sell out. The Top Crypto Miners & Coins to Keep an Eye On While the Stacks crypto prediction anticipates a gradual rise to $3.80 and Shiba Inu technical analysis shows a drastic 99.84% decline in its burn rate, BlockDAG continues to push the boundaries of mining productivity. With its impressive sale of over 14,919 mining rigs and $6 million in revenue from these sales, BlockDAG is fast becoming the preferred choice for both novice and experienced miners alike. BlockDAG’s ongoing presale, having raised over $170 million, remains a top choice for those searching for the best crypto miners. With its potential to reach the $1 mark in the near future, BlockDAG emerges as an exceptionally lucrative option.

Cardano (ADA) cratered as low as $0.76 on Friday, taking its pullback from recent highs to more than 40% at the time. The Fed triggered a major stock and crypto market sell-off when they issued more-hawkish-than-expected guidance for only two additional rate cuts in 2025 on Wednesday. What just happened? The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points which is exactly what 97% of market participants wanted. But, the S&P 500 just posted its largest post-Fed drop since March 2020, erasing $1.8 TRILLION of market cap. Why? Let us explain. (a thread) — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 18, 2024 Since the Fed’s bearish meeting, ADA futures positions worth nearly $20 million have been liquidated, per coin glass.com . However, Cardano’s strong recovery from intra-day lows in the $0.76 area to around $0.95, which has seen ADA also reclaim its 50DMA, suggests the worst might be over. ADA is currently on course to close out a bullish hammer candlestick for this session. And with macro set to take a back seat into the year’s end, with no further major US economic data releases or Fed events, focus is likely to return to bullish “adoption” talking points. And Cardano has a few highly bullish narratives running in its favor right now. Here is why the price is likely to reclaim $1.0 and start 2025 on the front foot. Cardano Is Likely to Retake $1 and Start 2025 Strong, Here’s Why Trump’s election victory last month sparked a major rally in crypto, but Cardano was one of the strongest performers. That’s because Cardano has been one of the most beaten down cryptocurrencies by the current SEC, who classified it as an unregistered security in 2023 in lawsuits versus Binance and Coinbase. The Trump administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history – the treasury secretary is pro-crypto, there is a new Crypto/AI czar and the incoming SEC chair is also a friend to the industry. Moreover, Cardano’s co-founder Charles Hopkinson may also end up advising the incoming administration. This is a game changer for Cardano, which has until now struggled to garner substantial adoption for its blockchain when compared to rivals like Ethereum and Solana . Cardano proponents are urging the Cardano Foundation to match Ripple’s massive donation to Trump’s inauguration to ensure their spot as a key player in future policy discussions. Cardano should absolutely be donating to Donald Trump’s inaugural fund Match Ripple Cardano needs to do everything possible to be a key player in all of the policy discussions about the future of finance This could encourage even more dialogue & cooperation with policymakers https://t.co/bt6sZJgQ5m — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 20, 2024 Meanwhile, Cardano hopes to accelerate the adoption of its blockchain by transforming itself into the go to BTC DeFi chain by mid-2025. BREAKING NEWS: BITCOIN IS COMING TO CARDANO MAY 2025 – CHARLES ""We're going to get Bitcoin on cardano at most likely may 2025"" Are you not excited? pic.twitter.com/i0SxJdpMhp — Mintern (@MinswapIntern) December 19, 2024 A lot of traders have lined up to short Cardano around $1, per a Tweet from Deezy.eth. That raises the risk of a short-squeeze that could see ADA quickly retake years highs in the $1.30 area should the current recovery accelerate. Looking into 2025, assuming the incoming pro-crypto administration and Congressional session delivers on all the talk, the arrival of a new golden age for crypto could send ADA skyrocketing. A retest of record highs above $3 is certainly a possibility. Cardano Alternative to Consider While Cardano could be setting up for 3x gains in 2025, investors looking to secure larger gains might instead want to consider getting involved in meme coin markets. Well-known meme coins like Dogecoin , Pepe and dogwifhat could all offer between 5-10x upside potential. Alternatively, newer and lesser-known meme coins , whilst riskier, could offer substantially greater upside potential. One meme coin that the team at cryptonews.com is a big fan of is a fun new gamified cat token called Catslap (SLAP) . This highly promising meme coin has already been able to reach a market cap of over $14 million per DEXTools . The meme coin is running a massive $1,000,000 giveaway to users who accumulate the most slap points. With a new meme season likely to hit as markets recover into the year’s end, SLAP could be one of the best-performing memes.

This Trending Meme Coin Presale Is Reviving the Trust in Bulls,https://thenewscrypto.com/neiro-feeling-stale-this-trending-meme-coin-presale-is-reviving-the-trust-in-bulls/,"Meme coins have long been the cheeky underdogs of the crypto world. What started with Dogecoin as a playful experiment has turned into a full-blown phenomenon, drawing millions of investors and community members worldwide. These coins don’t just rely on humour; they’ve evolved into serious contenders with real utility and innovative ecosystems. In 2024, meme coins are making headlines again, with BTFD Coin (BTFD) leading the charge. BTFD Coin is rewriting the rules of what meme coins can achieve. Its combination of a Play 2 Earn game, a generous referral programme, and a staking system offering a whopping 90% APY has positioned it as the trending meme coin presale to watch. With analysts predicting stellar returns, BTFD is raising the bar for what’s possible in the meme coin space. But how does it compare to Neiro, another community favourite? Let’s take a closer look. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Setting New Standards in Meme Coins BTFD Coin isn’t just riding the meme coin wave; it’s creating its own. With a presale that’s already raised over $4.2 million and sold more than 57 billion coins to over 6,100 holders, BTFD has surged to Stage 12 in record time. Each coin is currently priced at $0.00013, with a post-presale listing set at $0.0006. The potential for profit has investors clamouring to join before the presale ends. One of BTFD’s standout features is its Play 2 Earn game. The beta version launched during Stage 10, offering a glimpse into the engaging, reward-driven gameplay that’s on the horizon. While the beta doesn’t offer rewards yet, it’s building anticipation for the full launch. Add to that the referral programme, which rewards users for bringing in new investors, and you’ve got a community-focused ecosystem that’s primed for growth. Staking is where BTFD truly shines. With an APY of 90%, staking went live on December 2, giving holders an unmatched opportunity to grow their assets passively. The Bulls Squad, an exclusive group for top-tier investors, adds another layer of excitement by offering perks that go beyond the typical meme coin experience. To put the potential returns in perspective, imagine investing $100,000 in Stage 12 at $0.00013 per coin. That would secure you approximately 769,230,769 coins. When BTFD lists at $0.0006 post-presale, your investment would balloon to $461,538, a gain of $361,538. It’s numbers like these that have made BTFD the trending meme coin presale investors can’t ignore. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin is redefining meme coin potential with its robust ecosystem, impressive presale performance, and unmatched ROI potential. Neiro (NEIRO): A Community-Driven Contender Neiro emerged as a favourite among meme coin enthusiasts earlier this year. Rooted in community-driven innovation, Neiro focuses on fostering a decentralised ecosystem that empowers its holders. Its playful branding and loyal fanbase have helped it carve out a niche in the meme coin world. One of Neiro’s unique selling points is its community voting mechanism, which allows holders to influence the coin’s direction. This democratic approach has been a hit with investors looking for more transparency and involvement in their crypto projects. Neiro also introduced its own NFT collection, featuring playful designs that have resonated with its audience. However, Neiro has faced challenges in maintaining momentum. While its launch was met with enthusiasm, its utility hasn’t expanded as quickly as some investors had hoped. Analysts note that while Neiro has strong community support, it needs to innovate further to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market. Why did this coin make it to this list? Neiro’s community-focused approach and early success make it a worthy contender in the meme coin space. Conclusion: BTFD Coin or Neiro? Meme coins are no longer just about laughs; they’re about innovation, community, and opportunity. While Neiro has established itself as a community-driven project, BTFD Coin is taking things to the next level with its groundbreaking ecosystem and impressive presale performance. If you’re looking for a project that combines entertainment with real earning potential, BTFD Coin is the clear choice. Its Play 2 Earn game, 90% APY on staking, and referral programme make it the trending meme coin presale that’s capturing the crypto world’s attention. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin’s presale . Join now and be part of the future of meme coins.

Crypto All-Stars is nearing the end of its presale today, having raised an incredible $25M, making it one of the most successful meme coin presales of 2024. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu continues to push boundaries by integrating Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), expanding its tokens to 12 blockchains. But the coin everyone’s talking about is BTFD Coin, a fresh new entrant that’s creating a storm with its $4.2M presale and innovative features like 90% APY staking and a beta play-to-earn (P2E) game. With over 57 billion tokens sold to more than 6,100 holders, BTFD Coin is quickly gaining traction as the meme coin to watch. Let’s dive deeper into why Crypto All-Stars, Shiba Inu, and BTFD Coin are the best meme coins to buy this week and how each is reshaping the crypto landscape. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Are Running Wild First, let’s talk about BTFD Coin , the meme coin that’s quickly becoming the talk of the town. BTFD Coin’s presale, now in its 12th stage, has already raised $4.2M, selling over 57 billion tokens to more than 6,100 investors. With only 16 presale stages in total, time is running out to grab this coin at its current price of $0.00013. But why is everyone so excited about BTFD Coin? For starters, it’s not just a meme coin—it’s a community-powered movement. The coin’s branding, focused on helping investors “own the dip,” has struck a chord with those looking for smart investment opportunities. Its features, including a play-to-earn game in beta testing and 90% APY staking rewards , make it more than just another crypto. It’s a utility-packed asset with the potential for massive growth. Here’s a scenario to consider: If you invest $20,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’d receive approximately 153.8 million $BTFD tokens. Once the coin hits its post-presale price of $0.0006, your investment could be worth $92,307. That’s a jaw-dropping 361% return on investment! But it’s not just about the numbers. BTFD Coin’s growing community of over 6,100 “bulls” is a testament to its appeal. The coin has captured the imagination of investors worldwide, and its presale success shows no signs of slowing down, making it one of the best meme coins to buy this week. Crypto All-Stars: Presale Hits $25M and Ends Today If you’ve been following meme coins this year, you’ve probably heard about Crypto All-Stars. This project has captured the market’s attention with its MemeVault Protocol, a revolutionary staking platform that allows users to stake multiple meme coins like Dogecoin, PEPE, and Floki. It’s the first of its kind—a multi-token, multi-chain staking platform that rewards users for holding $STARS, the platform’s native token.

According to some market watchers, the flagship crypto’s recent performance resembles its December 2023 trajectory, suggesting that BTC might see a massive breakout soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Peak Between $160,000 And $290,000 If These Historical Patterns Repeat – Report Bitcoin Price Mirrors December 2023’s Performance On Wednesday, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market saw a massive correction after the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announced a 25-basis-point rate cut and signaled fewer cuts than expected in 2025. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped 9.2% from its $108,135 all-time high (ATH), briefly falling below the $99,000 on support before recovering. BTC quickly climbed back to $100,000, surging 2% on Thursday morning to the $102,000 resistance. After the dump, crypto trader Follis suggested that this month’s price action mirrored BTC’s 2023 trajectory. The trader stated that Bitcoin was “repeating the December playbook from last year,” forecasting that a pump to a new high is coming soon. Per the chart, BTC moved within the $40,000-$45,000 price range before breaking out in January 2024. The breakout was followed by a significant 20% correction to the previous consolidation zone, briefly dipping below this range. However, Bitcoin reclaimed the breakout levels in the following weeks and surged another 47% to its March ATH of $73,000. If the largest crypto by market cap continues to follow this “playbook,” then its price could see a correction below $88,000 by year-end before resuming its bullish run to new highs. Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that BTC’s performance in Q4 resembles its Q4 2023 price action. The analyst stated that Bitcoin will likely continue the “slow hoppy grind up before the actual breakout” happens. He recommended “zooming out” as the short-term chart “doesn’t look pretty” but noted that BTC’s price is still “trending up slowly.” Analyst Warns Of BTC’s Daily Close Other analysts suggested that the coming hours will be decisive for BTC’s short-term performance. Rekt Capital asserted that holding the $100,000 support was crucial, as failing to maintain this level could send Bitcoin below the previous key resistance of $98,000. Moreover, a daily close above the $101,000 mark would be necessary to prevent this range from turning into resistance again. The analyst emphasized that “doing so could kickstart a chain of events where BTC starts to lose support level by level.” Related Reading: Sentiment For Ethereum Hits 1-year Low, Analyst Says A Massive Run Is Coming He added that a close above this level would invalidate the short-term bearish outlook. Previously, the analyst explained that Bitcoin is amid the first “Price Discovery Correction,” which tends to happen between the 6thand 8th week of BTC’s post-halving “Parabolic Upside Phase”: As a result, over the next 3 weeks or so, I am going to be increasingly cautious about retest attempts, and given BTC’s history at this point in the cycle, I wouldn’t be surprised to see key levels get invalidated. However, he emphasized that the “Second Price Discovery Uptrend” will follow the big correction. As of this writing, Bitcoin has dipped below the $100,000 support level, registering a 5.1% 24-hour drop to the $98,900 mark.

The DOJ is currently seeking his extradition from Israel, where he was arrested. Panev was arrested in August following two guilty pleas in July from two Russian members of the group; Ruslan Astamirov and Mikhail Vasiliev. The LockBit gang , according to the US Department of Justice, has hit over 2500 victims in 120 countries around the world. These include small businesses, large multinationals, hospitals, schools, critical infrastructure, and government and law enforcement agencies. Notable victims of LockBit include Boeing Co., The Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, and the UK’s Royal Mail. The group has been connected to a string of ransomware attacks, with victims’ data locked up or their systems rendered inoperable until they extort a fee from them. LockBit developer arrested Rostilav Panev worked as a developer and coder for LockBit for approximately five years starting from its inception in 2019 to February 2024. The now-detained developer received approximately $230,000 in cryptocurrency transfers as payment for his work, according to the charges filed by the Department of Justice. LockBit and its affiliates extorted at least $500M in payments from victims and also caused significant losses in revenue. According to Panev’s lawyer, defense attorney Sharon Nahari, he developed tools for the group without any knowledge of the intended use of the software. The superseding complaint received by the DOJ alleges that Panev exchanged direct messages through a cybercriminal forum with LockBit’s primary administrator. His attorney, Sharon Nahari, maintains that Panev corresponded with the group solely through Telegram messages and had no idea about their identity. “The arrest of Mr. Panev reflects the Department’s commitment to using all its tools to combat the ransomware threat,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland also stated that three individuals allegedly responsible for the cyber attacks against thousands of victims are in custody and that the Justice Department will continue to hold all those who enable ransomware attacks accountable. Law enforcement crackdown The LockBit group emerged in 2019. The group was discovered in 2020 when its malicious software was discovered on a Russian cybercrimes forum. In February, law enforcement in the UK and the US seized websites and servers used by LockBit members and associates. The police also obtained victim data and thousands of decryption keys urging victims to reach out to the group for help in recovering their stolen data. LockBit quickly resurfaced after the seizure, stating threateningly, “I cannot be stopped.” Despite their bold stance, the efforts of law enforcement have significantly weakened the group’s ability.

The research firm Cerulli Associates says $105 trillion will be passed on to heirs by 2048, while charities will receive $18 trillion over the same period. Baby Boomers, the Silent Generation and other older generations will be the major benefactors. “Nearly $100 trillion will be transferred from Baby Boomers and older generations, representing 81% of all transfers. More than 50% of the overall total volume of transfers ($62 trillion) is expected to come from those who are currently high-net-worth (HNW) and ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW), which together make up only 2% of all households.” Over the short term, generation X will benefit more than Millennials from the Great Wealth Transfer. “Millennials will be inheriting the most of any generation over the course of the next 25 years ($46 trillion). However, Gen X stands to inherit the greatest portion of assets in the next 10 years, totaling $14 trillion to Millennials’ $8 trillion.” Widows in the Baby Boomer and the Silent Generation as well as other older generations are set to receive about 38% of the wealth before it can get to heirs and charities, according to the report. “Projections of horizontal, or intra-generational, transfers show that $54 trillion will be passed on to spouses before eventually transferring intergenerationally to heirs and to charities. Nearly $40 trillion of these spousal transfers will be going to widowed women in the Baby Boomer and older generations…” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK.

This sudden pullback has sent shockwaves across the crypto market, shifting sentiment from extreme bullishness to uncertainty and even fear. The sell-off has been particularly brutal for altcoins, many of which are bleeding hard as Bitcoin struggles to regain momentum. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal Cardano Whales Are ‘Buying The Dip’ – Details Key metrics from CryptoQuant highlight the gravity of the situation, with realized losses totaling $28.9 million—an alarming 3.2 times higher than the weekly average. This spike in realized losses suggests that some investors exit positions as the market recalibrates after weeks of aggressive upward movement. The big question now is whether this is simply a healthy correction in an otherwise bullish trend or the start of a larger downtrend. Traders are closely watching Bitcoin’s ability to hold critical support levels and the behavior of altcoins, which often amplify Bitcoin’s price movements. For now, the market remains at a crossroads, with the coming days likely to reveal whether Bitcoin can recover and resume its uptrend—or if this correction signals a more prolonged period of weakness. Bitcoin Facing Selling Pressure Bitcoin is under significant selling pressure after two days of aggressive bearish activity, marking a pivotal moment for the market. The sudden sentiment shift has caused many analysts and investors to turn cautious, with some flipping bearish as Bitcoin’s recent trend begins to lose momentum. This correction has left the market questioning whether the current price movement is a natural pause or a precursor to deeper losses. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared insights on X, supported by compelling on-chain data, highlighting that realized losses have surged to $28.9 million. This figure is 3.2 times higher than the weekly average, indicating heightened selling activity. Adler’s analysis underscores that while the sell-off might seem alarming, it’s consistent with a healthy market correction, especially following Bitcoin’s remarkable rally to $108,300. Adler notes that the current dip should not trigger panic but instead serve as a moment of patience for long-term holders. He emphasized that now is a time to HODL unless additional bearish signals emerge to suggest a more prolonged downtrend. Corrections like this often provide the market with the necessary fuel for the next leg up, as weaker hands exit and strong hands position themselves strategically.

Price action remains critical, with investors watching closely to determine whether this correction solidifies a strong foundation for future growth or signals further downside. BTC Holding Bullish Structure (For Now) Bitcoin is trading at $94,400 following three consecutive days of aggressive selling pressure. Despite the apparent bearish sentiment gripping the market, BTC has managed to maintain its footing above the key support level of $92,000. This support is crucial as it clearly defines the ongoing uptrend. Holding above this level suggests resilience and sets the stage for a potential strong bounce if buyers regain control in the coming sessions. While the recent price action reflects uncertainty, the decline has not been as severe as the market sentiment indicates. Negative emotions have driven many traders to adopt a cautious stance, but BTC’s ability to stay above $92,000 shows underlying strength in the market structure.

Restoring confidence will be essential for Bitcoin to reclaim higher levels and resume its bullish momentum. If sentiment does not improve and prices continue to drop, the risk of a deeper correction becomes more likely. Losing the $92,000 support could pave the way for a retest of lower levels, potentially causing additional volatility.

The surge in global cryptocurrency adoption is fueled significantly by heavyweight investors like Fidelity and BlackRock, who are actively enhancing the sector’s credibility. Remarkably, about 6.8% of the global population, over 560 million people, now engage with cryptocurrency. Amidst this explosive growth, utility coins like Solana and Tron are gaining traction, but the real game-changer could be Web3Bay, poised to command a larger ecosystem. Don’t Miss Out on Web3Bay’s Rise in Crypto E-Commerce As the pace of cryptocurrency adoption quickens, Web3Bay is rapidly becoming a dominant force in the e-commerce landscape, moving from theoretical utility to tangible, real-world impact. Supported by giants such as Fidelity and BlackRock, the crypto sphere is gaining unprecedented legitimacy. While platforms like Solana and Tron push the envelope with sophisticated blockchain solutions, Web3Bay distinguishes itself by focusing on decentralizing e-commerce. Operating on a robust Layer-1 blockchain, Web3Bay guarantees the privacy, control, and transparency demanded by today’s crypto users, empowering them to manage their data securely. The 3BAY token, central to Web3Bay’s operations, goes beyond mere transactions by offering governance rights, exclusive rewards, and discounts, thus directly involving users in shaping the platform’s future. Currently, Web3Bay’s presale introduces the 3BAY token at just $0.003, with prices set to climb 15% through 28 stages. By the final stage, the token price is projected to hit $0.1959, translating to a potential ROI of over 6000% for early participants. As cryptocurrencies become integral to finance and digital experiences, Web3Bay is establishing itself as a powerhouse, seamlessly integrating Web2 and Web3 to create a revolutionary decentralized shopping experience. Solana’s Impressive Growth & Future Outlook Recently, Solana has shown remarkable progress, trading around $221 and nearing its all-time high of $263.83 as of December 2024. Known for its ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second, Solana stands out in the blockchain community, particularly for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT applications due to its high speed and low fees. Market analysts predict that Solana could reach new peaks, potentially climbing to $300 in 2025 and possibly surpassing $900 by 2030. Tron’s Steady Market Performance Tron remains a strong player in a volatile market, with network activity showing that 97% of TRX investors were profitable as of December 2024—an indicator of robust market confidence. In October 2024, Tron’s blockchain processed a record-breaking 10 million transactions in a single day, with a user base that now exceeds 296 million accounts, indicating strong ongoing demand. Time to Invest in These Utility Altcoins While Solana and Tron continue to impress with their advanced transaction capabilities and active networks, Web3Bay is carving out a niche with its innovative approach to decentralized e-commerce. With a presale designed to generously reward early backers and a commitment to bridging conventional and crypto payments, Web3Bay is reshaping online shopping. As the need for more privacy, greater control, and enhanced utility in cryptocurrencies grows, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a leader, ready to define the future of Web3-driven commerce.

This AI altcoin has the potential to grow 70x in the first quarter of 2025. Investors are putting funds into WallitIQ (WLTQ) in whale-like motion, confident in its ability to deliver solid exponential returns. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin and XRP prices have recently shown signs of nearing the $5 mark. Despite this, many prominent investors are more interested in WallitIQ (WLTQ) as it is currently priced at an affordable $0.0243 in its ongoing presale. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Returns Dwarfs Potential Gains From Dogecoin And XRP Prices Hitting $5 Following a significant yearly peak of $0.47 last month, many analysts predict that Dogecoin, currently trading at $0.4063 , might hit the $5 mark soon as analysts are on the lookout for this increase in 2025. On Monday, the XRP price rallied further to test the resistance level at $2.58 after bouncing off the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. The maximum profit target from the pole’s length indicates that the XRP price could hit a new all-time high of $5. A high-volume move above the resistance levels at $2.58 and $2.92 could accelerate the rally to $5. With the XRP price currently at $2.69 , hitting $5 seems more plausible for Ripple (XRP) than ever. Yet, even if Dogecoin and XRP prices reach the $5 milestone, the returns are still very modest compared to what the new AI altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), offers. Currently priced at just $0.0243 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides an opportunity for investors seeking exponential growth. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) 70x potential dwarfs the gains from Dogecoin and Ripple (XRP). Unlike Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin, which are already mature assets with slower growth rates, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is a new project, and its ability to grow from its current presale price of $0.0243 by 70x in 2025 gives it an edge over Dogecoin and the XRP price. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Smart Choice for Forward-Thinking Investors Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin offer significant returns. However, AI altcoin WallitIQ (WLTQ) could soon outshine Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin. The project’s appealing features are driving fast adoption. WallitIQ (WLTQ) prioritizes security and user experience. It uses AI-powered anomaly detection to monitor transactions, offering enhanced protection by detecting potential threats in real-time. A thorough audit conducted by SolidProof verifies the reliability of its smart contract. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) AI altcoin provides significant benefits to its users, including staking rewards of up to 180% APY, premium features, unlimited referral bonuses, and transaction fee coverage within its ecosystem. Priced at an accessible $0.0243 during its presale, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents an attractive investment opportunity with the potential to deliver returns that rival or surpass those of Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is making a name in the AI market, valued at over $136 billion in 2023. Its integration of AI and blockchain ensures relevance in two of the fastest-growing industries, driving more rapid adoption. Its ongoing presale is drawing significant attention from retail and institutional investors, thanks to its low entry price of $0.0243 and sky-high upside potential. Dogecoin and Ripple (XRP) offer mere peanuts compared to this AI altcoin. Act Now or Regret Later While Dogecoin and XRP prices continue their journey toward the $5 milestone, their potential returns are limited compared to WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) 70x promise. The opportunity will not remain open forever. The AI altcoin is currently in its second presale stage, meaning the window for maximizing returns is rapidly closing. Early investors in projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum reaped life-changing rewards not because of luck, but because they acted decisively when the prices were low. Imagine seeing headlines about WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) price increase months from now, knowing you had the chance to buy in early but hesitated. Don’t wait until it’s too late. Buy the WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) AI altcoin at its presale price of $0.0243 and set yourself up for exponential profits soon.

Success often finds those who recognize potential early. Consider the remarkable journey of a Miami college student who, in 2013, used $5,600 to buy Litecoin (LTC) at $2 per coin. By 2017, Litecoin’s rise to $360 per coin transformed his initial stake into an astonishing $1 million, illustrating the impact of strategic early moves in the crypto world. Now, BlockDAG (BDAG) presents a similar prospect, poised to match or even surpass Litecoin’s success. How a Miami Student’s $5,600 Bet on Litecoin Became $1M Back in 2013, the crypto market was still emerging, but Bitcoin’s dramatic rise caught many eyes. A Miami student saw the potential in this space and, with a bold step and $5,600 in hand, he invested in Litecoin (LTC) at $2 per coin. Over four years, as Litecoin’s value increased, his patience and strategic thinking were rewarded. By 2017, his investment soared to $1 million as Litecoin reached $360 per coin. This story highlights how early, well-thought-out risks can lead to substantial rewards. For those who missed Litecoin’s impressive climb, BlockDAG, a pioneering layer-1 blockchain, offers a new opportunity for significant returns. BlockDAG: The DAG Pioneer with Unprecedented Growth Potential BlockDAG merges the robust security of blockchain with the flexibility of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, effectively addressing scalability, security, and decentralization issues faced by traditional blockchains. Its dual Blockchain + DAG architecture enhances transaction speeds, scalability, and reliability, establishing it as a leading Layer 1 project. BlockDAG’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus model upholds network integrity while promoting decentralized management, making it an appealing choice for those seeking long-term growth. The platform’s technological strength has attracted significant market interest, accumulating over $170 million through 26 presale rounds. Prices have escalated from $0.001 in the initial batch to $0.0234 in the latest, marking a substantial 2,240% increase. Experts now anticipate a potential 30,000x ROI for early participants. The continued momentum of BlockDAG’s presale indicates it is on course to reach its $600 million goal, reinforcing its status as a premier crypto acquisition. How BlockDAG May Surpass Litecoin in Future Gains While Litecoin has shown the benefits of early adoption, BlockDAG presents an even more promising opportunity. Its sophisticated technology offers unmatched scalability and security, essential for future blockchain demands. With a 2,240% increase in its value already, projections suggest a potential rise to $30 per coin by 2030. At the current presale price of $0.0234, these forecasts suggest growth that could far surpass that of Litecoin. BlockDAG is also tailored to modern needs with its low-code/no-code smart contract functionality, allowing users to develop and implement smart contracts with minimal technical expertise. This simplifies the application of blockchain technology for businesses, developers, and non-technical users, fostering wider adoption and enhancing the value of BDAG coins. The Next Wave of Millionaires Crypto success often arises from seizing opportunities before they become mainstream. While Litecoin has previously minted millionaires, BlockDAG stands as the top crypto presale with its state-of-the-art Layer 1 technology and potential for massive financial returns. For those considering this emerging leader, now is an ideal time to engage. BDAG coins are currently priced at just $0.0234, but as the sale of batch 26 nears completion, the shift to batch 27 could mean significant price increases. Immediate action is crucial to avoid missing out on what could be a transformative wealth-building opportunity.

After retesting levels below $2, the price is now maintaining bullish momentum. Bitcoin and other coins are also down right now, and some traders are taking advantage of the dip by buying more. The price of XRP has been consolidating around the $2 range, and this is where it could stay for a while, which is a good sign for holders. Overall, the market is seeing a lot of liquidations, with $680 million wiped out in the last 12 hours alone. Short-Term Price Range and Potential Movements Currently, XRP is trading between $1.96 and its all-time high of $3.30. The price remains squeezed within this range, and a potential upside movement could still emerge. A short-term bullish scenario could see one or two additional highs as part of a larger wave structure, similar to what is expected in other major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. Possible Elliott Wave Count and Structure There are two possible Elliott Wave counts on the XRP chart. The first suggests the top may already be in place, with the current price action forming a fourth wave triangle. If this count plays out, a final fifth wave could complete the current bullish cycle. The second wave count proposes that an additional 4-5% upside movement may occur before the cycle concludes. The focus remains on the current structure and its potential implications. Validation and Invalidations: Key Price Levels To keep the triangle scenario alive, XRP must stay above $1.90. If the price breaks below this level, it would invalidate the triangle count, suggesting a more direct ABC correction. This scenario would likely see XRP move lower before any potential recovery.

Recent reports highlight a significant influx of capital, with Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana collectively attracting $130 billion, signaling renewed investor confidence. Amidst this financial whirlwind, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves by addressing real-world challenges that have hindered blockchain adoption. Its innovative QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is set to simplify blockchain development, making it more accessible to developers of all skill levels. Qubetics ($TICS): Simplifying Blockchain Development with QubeQode IDE Qubetics is currently in its 13th presale stage, offering $TICS tokens at $0.0342. The project has already raised over $7 million, attracting more than 10,600 holders and selling over 355 million tokens. The QubeQode IDE is a game-changer in the blockchain space.

By addressing real-world challenges such as complex user interfaces and limited transaction scalability, Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in the blockchain space. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, representing a significant return on investment. To learn more about Qubetics, you can check this out: Watch the Video . Solana (SOL): Riding the Wave of Market Momentum Solana has been making headlines with its rapid growth and increasing market momentum.

Cardano (ADA): Steady Growth Amid Market Fluctuations Cardano continues to demonstrate steady growth, even amid market fluctuations. While Bitcoin recently dipped below $98,000, affecting the broader crypto market, Cardano has maintained its position, reflecting its resilience and the confidence of its community.

Its commitment to peer-reviewed research and a robust development roadmap further solidify its standing as a reliable blockchain platform.

As we edge closer to 2025, cryptocurrency markets are buzzing with activity, with investors closely monitoring the best cryptos to join in December 2024. From strategic acquisitions by whale investors to groundbreaking blockchain innovations, the latest developments have set the stage for an exhilarating year-end. Toncoin has captured headlines with its surging whale activity, while Render continues to intrigue analysts with its price forecasts for 2025 and beyond. However, the spotlight undoubtedly shines on Qubetics ($TICS), a project revolutionising blockchain technology with its unique presale structure and unmatched use cases. This article delves into the latest updates and opportunities surrounding these three cryptos: Qubetics, Toncoin, and Render. Let’s explore why Qubetics is leading the pack among the best cryptos to join in December 2024. Qubetics: Redefining Cross-Border Payments How do banks and financial institutions stay competitive in an increasingly interconnected world? Qubetics ($TICS) offers a revolutionary solution tailored to modern financial needs. Its cutting-edge blockchain network empowers institutions to perform near-instant cross-border payments and settlements, eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional systems. By forging strategic partnerships with the Qubetics Network, banks can achieve faster, more cost-effective, and transparent transactions. This advancement benefits businesses reliant on swift settlements to maintain operational efficiency and individuals seeking faster international remittances. Could this be the breakthrough that reshapes global finance?\ Adding to its momentum, Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session , engaging its vibrant community with insights and updates about the network’s vision and utility. With these developments, it’s no surprise that Qubetics is emerging as one of the best cryptos to join in December 2024. Toncoin: Whale Investors Fuel a 27% Surge Toncoin (TON), the cryptocurrency of The Open Network, has experienced a dramatic price surge, thanks to the involvement of major investors. By the end of November 2024, whales accumulated nearly $30 million worth of TON in just four days, driving a 27% price increase and pushing the token above $6.20. This bullish activity highlights growing confidence in Toncoin’s potential, amplified by recent regulatory changes such as the resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Its integration with Telegram’s 800-million-strong user base positions Toncoin as a frontrunner for mainstream adoption. With a market capitalisation of $13.96 billion, Toncoin is proving its relevance as a strategic asset in the evolving crypto market. Render: A Rollercoaster Year with Optimistic Projections The price of Render ($RENDER) currently sits at $7.71, reflecting a -3.14% decline this month. Despite this dip, long-term forecasts remain optimistic, with analysts predicting a potential high of $13.20 by the end of 2025 and a staggering $96.94 by 2030. Render has seen significant developments this year, with a 60.28% increase in GPU computing power usage during Q1 2024, leading to a strong rally in March. While its price has cooled since reaching a record high above $13.00, Render’s growing market cap of $3.02 billion underscores its resilience and potential for recovery. A Thrilling Opportunity: The Qubetics Presale What makes the Qubetics presale so compelling? In Phase 13, the presale boasts weekly phases with a 10% price hike, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. At just $0.034 per $TICS token, Qubetics has already raised over $7.3 million, attracted 10,900+ holders, and sold an impressive 363 million tokens. This unique structure rewards early participants and fuels anticipation with every phase. For investors seeking the best cryptos to join in December 2024 , Qubetics presents an unmatched opportunity. With its robust community backing and innovative approach, $TICS tokens are more than an investment—they’re a statement of trust in the future of blockchain. Conclusion: Why Qubetics ($TICS) Stands Out As December unfolds, Qubetics ($TICS), Toncoin, and Render each present unique opportunities for investors. While Toncoin benefits from whale activity and Render boasts strong long-term potential, Qubetics is redefining the crypto landscape with its revolutionary technology and presale strategy. For those seeking the best cryptos to join in December 2024, Qubetics offers an exciting chance to be part of a groundbreaking project at an early stage. With its momentum building and presale nearing completion, now is the time to secure your stake in $TICS tokens and position yourself at the forefront of blockchain innovation.

This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 02:25:24

The timing for the purchase couldn’t be less perfect, as the crypto market plunged after a hawkish Fed meeting on Wednesday where officials voted for the third and final interest rate cut of 2024 by 25 basis points. During the press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also addressed the prospect of the central bank building a strategic reserve of Bitcoin, one of Trump’s boldest campaign promises to the crypto industry. The official said that the central bank is legally not allowed to hold Bitcoin and is not looking for a law change. For context, in July 2024, Republican Senator Cyntia Lummis introduced a Bitcoin Act to create such a reserve, proposing to acquire 5 percent of the BTC supply funded by Fed bank deposits and gold holdings. Powell’s comments poured cold water on expectations that Bitcoin’s price will continue its upward trend fueled by optimism over Trump’s embrace of the crypto industry. Following the Fed meeting, Bitcoin saw a sharp decline, falling by 6% within hours to $98,900 after trading above $100,000 for the past week, during which it reached a new ATH of $108,135. Ethereum and other major altcoins mirrored the downturn, with ETH losing 11% since Wednesday and currently trading at $3,400. Despite backing from the president-elect, World Liberty Financial got off to a rocky start. The October public sale of WLFI tokens only managed to sell a little more than 4% of the coins. Because of lukewarm demand, the project had to slash its presale goal from $300 million to just $30 million. Besides stagnating sales, WLFI faces other behind-the-scenes issues, such as a lack of a well-defined roadmap, barriers to entry antithetical to the tenets of DeFi, and possible conflict of interest. The project, which was launched with the commitment to democratize and depoliticize finance through decentralized lending, directs the sale of WLFI tokens only to accredited investors who meet a certain wealth threshold, a criterion that excludes a broader audience from participating. WLFI scoops up alts and lends a helping hand to Justin Sun Besides Ethereum, World Liberty Financial has been actively shopping for other altcoins, including ETH, WBTC, AAVE, LINK, ENA, and ONDO. Meanwhile, the native token of CoW Protocol (COW) used by WLFI jumped nearly 35% over the last 24 hours due to investors’ speculative interest in the platform. On Thursday, World Liberty Financial swapped $10.4 million of cbBTC for wBTC, taking the side of a controversial crypto mogul Justin Sun in his brawl with Coinbase over wBTC delisting. The popular Bitcoin wrapper issued by BiT Global was delisted by Coinbase without much elaboration except its alleged incompatibility with the exchange’s listing standards. In response, BiT Global filed a lawsuit, claiming that the move was meant to give Coinbase’s own wrapper, cbBTC, an unfair advantage. Coinbase countered with the claim that Justin Sun’s control over BiT Global presented unacceptable risks for customers. While Justin Sun’s connection to BitGo may be less clear, his ties to World Liberty Financial are much more obvious. The $30 million investment in WLFI announced by Sun in November made him at the time the project’s largest investor. The following day, Sun was invited to join the advisory board, cementing the Sun-Trump alliance. Ethereum ETFs with record inflows in December Despite the market’s neurotic reaction to the Fed’s recent rate cut, Ethereum ETFs performed exceptionally well in December, The Block’s data suggests. This month has brought $1.66 billion in new investments to such products, which is 74% of the $2.24 billion total inflows since inception. The market structure of Ethereum ETFs remains highly concentrated, with BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) staying ahead of the competition by a wide margin. On December 5, ETHA recorded a single-day high of $292 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity's FETH as the second most popular choice. Other Ethereum ETF providers have garnered only modest investor interest compared to the broader distribution seen in Bitcoin ETFs.",News|Ethereum|Altcoins,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-21 02:29:49

33767162,[object Object],1734748239,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Rally Ahead: Expert Pinpoints Timing For Next Major Price Surge, Here’s When",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-next-major-price-rally-ahead/,"Days back, Dogecoin, the largest dog-themed meme coin, witnessed a notable setback, causing a sharp drop in its price to critical support levels. Despite the recent waning performances, several key developments suggest that DOGE might be preparing for its next major rally to new heights in the short term. A Robust Rally To Higher Levels Incoming For Dogecoin Although Dogecoin is struggling to move upward, seasoned market expert and investor Kevin foresees a bullish outlook for DOGE in the near term. In his analysis, Kevin cited crucial indicators that point to the time frame that the much-anticipated next surge could begin for the meme coin. Referencing past cycle trends and present price conditions, the expert’s prediction implies that the current consolidation phase might be ending shortly. With key indicators showing rising momentum, the expected upswing may fuel a much larger rally, pushing the meme coin to unprecedented levels . Examining Dogecoin’s current price action, Kevin highlighted that DOGE has risen above the crucial level of 43 on the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI). According to the expert, Dogecoin never dropped below level 43 on the daily RSI during the last bull market. Specifically, the 43 level on the daily RSI is critical since this was the bounce zone that resulted in three consolidation phases that led to new highs. Recent data shows that the meme coin ‘s daily RSI has increased to level 47. Furthermore, Kevin noted that throughout the last bull market, Dogecoin never lost the zero line on the daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). This robust maintenance at the crucial indicator also served as a springboard to greater height when reached. Meanwhile, looking at the present price trend, the chart shows that the market will hit the zero line in about 3 to 4 days. Should the ongoing cycle mirror these past cycle trends, the market expert contends the current consolidation period is likely coming to an end in at least a week. As a result, Kevin is confident that DOGE’s next rally toward higher levels may begin around Christmas. Thus far, investors and traders are monitoring key support levels for a potential rebound as they anticipate the next significant leg-up. A Rebound On The Horizon? Dogecoin could be regaining its upside momentum once more as Trader Tradigrade, a crypto analyst, has predicted a potential recovery, noting that DOGE’s daily RSI has entered a critical rebound zone. Trader Tardigrade forecast is based on a previous scenario that triggered notable price spikes. The last time DOGE ‘s daily RSI reached the zone in September this year, the meme coin experienced a local bottom at $0.095. Following the development, DOGE rose significantly to the $0.48 price level. Given the same degree of gain prediction, Trader Tardigrade believes Dogecoin might surge to $1.35 from the zone.",Dogecoin|Consolidation Phase|Doge|dogecoin|Dogecoin's Daily RSI|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Kevin|MACD|meme coin|Moving Average Convergence Divergence|relative strength index|RSI|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-21 02:30:39

The SEC also accused Tai Mo Shan of unlawfully offering and selling LUNA, a cryptocurrency issued by Terraform, as unregistered securities. Misleading Investors About Terra USD Peg Stability The SEC alleged that Tai Mo Shan deceived investors by creating the impression that Terraform Labs’ algorithmic mechanism was maintaining the $1 peg of UST. When UST fell below its $1 value in May 2021, Tai Mo Shan entered an agreement with Terraform Labs to intervene in stabilizing the price. Under this agreement, Terraform incentivized Tai Mo Shan with discounted LUNA tokens to buy UST and attempt to restore its peg. On May 19, 2021, Tai Mo Shan made substantial purchases of UST, totaling over $20 million, which temporarily stabilized the stablecoin’s price. The SEC stated that these actions misled the market into believing that Terraform’s algorithm was maintaining the peg, while the stability was actually driven by Tai Mo Shan’s trades. This conduct was deemed negligent by the SEC, as investors were not informed about the reliance on external intervention to stabilize UST. Role as a Statutory Underwriter for LUNA The SEC’s findings revealed that Tai Mo Shan acted as a statutory underwriter for Terraform Labs by acquiring LUNA tokens with the intent to resell them on U.S.-based platforms. From January 2021 to May 2022, Tai Mo Shan offered and sold these tokens as securities without proper registration, violating U.S. securities laws. The SEC classified LUNA as a security, noting that Tai Mo Shan acquired the cryptocurrency from Terraform for distribution to the public. This activity further contributed to the SEC’s charges of unregistered securities offerings. As part of the settlement, Tai Mo Shan agreed to pay $73.45 million in disgorgement, $12.91 million in prejudgment interest, and a $36.72 million civil penalty. These penalties aim to address the illegal gains obtained through misleading actions and unregistered transactions. Tai Mo Shan neither admitted nor denied the findings of the SEC’s investigation. However, the company agreed to comply with a cease-and-desist order prohibiting future violations of federal securities laws. US SEC’s Statement on Investor Protection SEC Chair Gary Gensler emphasized the need for compliance in the crypto markets, stating, “Too many times in the crypto markets, we’ve seen investor losses due to fraud. Regardless of the labels, crypto market participants should comply with securities laws and not deceive the public. Otherwise, investors get hurt.” The SEC also highlighted that Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, were found liable for fraud and unregistered securities offerings earlier in 2024. Terraform and Kwon agreed to pay $4.5 billion to compensate harmed investors, demonstrating the widespread fallout from the Terra ecosystem’s collapse. This case marks another step in the SEC’s ongoing efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry and protect investors from deceptive practices.

The controversy emerged following unsubstantiated claims by a Hedera community member that sparked intense discussion across digital asset markets. The initial assertions came from Shawn (@oroogle) on X. According to his statements , the president-elect’s team had developed plans to establish a national cryptocurrency reserve incorporating not only Bitcoin but also XRP and Hedera’s HBAR token. These digital assets were supposedly classified as “American Commodities” in a broader strategy to position the United States as a global leader in cryptocurrency innovation. The claims extended beyond reserve status, suggesting comprehensive integration of both Hedera and Ripple technologies into American electoral and financial infrastructure. Perhaps most notably, these statements included an alleged quote from Eric Trump suggesting his father’s intention to implement tax exemptions for domestically developed cryptocurrencies to reinforce American dominance in the digital asset sector. Will HBAR and XRP Join the Strategic Reserve? Donald Trump has shown notable support for cryptocurrencies, recently nominating a pro-crypto successor to Gary Gensler, current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and well-known anti-crypto figure. However, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson intervened to address what he characterized as misinformation circulating within the cryptocurrency community. According to Hoskinson, any consideration for a strategic reserve would be limited exclusively to Bitcoin, with no plans to include alternative cryptocurrencies. This isn't accurate. The reserve is only for Bitcoin — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 18, 2024 The cryptocurrency community’s response has been notably divided, as some participants commending Hoskinson’s effort to maintain factual accuracy in industry discourse. Others, however, questioned his motivations, suggesting potential bias due to Cardano’s absence from the purported reserve plans. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Further skepticism regarding the feasibility of any cryptocurrency reserve has emerged from prominent industry figures. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has published a detailed analysis arguing against the likelihood of such an initiative. Hayes emphasized that existing governmental priorities, particularly those related to social program funding, would likely preclude the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve. Hayes’ analysis also addressed potential market implications, warning of increased volatility in cryptocurrency markets. He specifically highlighted concerns about market instability around the anticipated presidential inauguration in January 2025, suggesting that the president-elect’s perceived cryptocurrency-friendly stance might overly influence current market optimism. However, with rumors that Trump wants to eliminate capital gains taxes on U.S.-based cryptocurrencies, the market could end up in a better place even if the Bitcoin reserve is not established as many expect.

For the Japanese, anything would beat being taxed at 55%, or in the case of inheritance tax, sometimes 110% on crypto gains, and being unable to offset losses. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Japan has finalized an outline for tax reform plans in 2025, in a meeting held on December 20. In a post to X , house member Junichi Kanda summarized the annual meeting of the nation’s tax commission, noting: “The LDP Tax Commission and Tax System Research Council general meeting finalized the outline of tax reform for fiscal year 2025. The report also included future considerations regarding the tax system for crypto assets.” The news is bullish for mainstream crypto investors, who have been suffering under tax rates as high as 55% on gains in the country, or even — in some cases — mind-blowing gouges to the tune of 110% (more than the value of the actual asset) where inheritance tax on crypto comes into play. House of Representatives member Junichi Kanda posted Friday about the development on social media platform X. Industry players and crypto holders alike have been urging politicians, such as Democratic Party for the People (DPP) leader Yuichiro Tamaki , to revamp the prohibitive system. But recently elected prime minister Shigeru Ishiba has been publicly doubtful of the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies as an asset class, ostensibly standing against such reform. Bitcoiners and crypto-heads in Japan are pushing for a separate 20% rate for crypto gains, which will include the ability to offset losses via a carryover system. According to local media , former minister for digital transformation (DX) and house member Takuya Hirai also submitted a proposal via the FSA (Financial Services Agency) to the minister of finance, to “make crypto assets an asset that contributes to the national economy.” The proposal, which included a separate tax scheme for crypto — instead of considering gains “miscellaneous income” as is currently the case — was reportedly well-received by Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato. Concrete movements toward reform are now expected, but as it stands for 2024, the tax law in the nation remains as convoluted as the Tokyo Metro subway, minus the efficiency and usefulness.

A crypto analyst has warned of an impending XRP price crash, urging investors not to get distracted as the RSI is still significantly above 50%. Discussing his predictions through short and long-term XRP price charts, the analyst shows that the cryptocurrency is firmly positioned in a bullish trend despite impending corrections. XRP Price RSI Hints At Potential Crash On the 4-hour XRP chart, a double tap structure is highlighted in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a technical indicator used to measure the momentum of a cryptocurrency. This double tap pattern typically signals further downward movement before a price stabilization. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash 2 Days Ago, Full Prediction Shows A Further 30% Decline According to Dark Defender, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), the RSI’s recurrent dips into oversold territory indicate that XRP could experience a price crash to new lows. The analyst disclosed that the XRP price had previously found strong support at $2.17; however, the cryptocurrency experienced a bounce to the upside. After hitting this support level, the XRP price is now consolidating, a pattern often associated with a potential uptrend after a correction. Despite the slight market recovery, the analyst has warned of another impending price crash in this same support zone as the RSI approaches oversold levels once more. Earlier in December, the RSI had hit oversold territories after dipping below 30%. Now XRP’s RSI is above 50% and signaling a potential to experience a price correction between the support levels at $2.17 and $2.18. Dark Defender has revealed that this price crash could occur soon as XRP is expected to enter oversold territory within a day. Despite this potential price correction, the analyst has acknowledged that the XRP’s broader outlook still looks bullish, with an uptrend continuation expected once the market consolidates following its projected price dip to new lows. Dark Defender has also predicted that XRP’s next price target after this projected correction is likely above $3, marking an almost 40% increase from the $2.17 support area. XRP 3-Month Chart Signals Strong Bullish Set Up Following his predictions that the XRP price could crash as it enters oversold conditions, Dark Defender also shared a 3-month chart analysis, painting a brighter outlook for the cryptocurrency. The chart shows that XRP has recently broken through a multi-year resistance level for the first time in over five years, signaling a strong bullish shift. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Not The End As Analyst Predicts Another 52% Jump The three-month green candle structure between October and December confirms strong buying pressure, setting the stage for a potentially bullish Q1 2025 from January to March. A rounded bottom pattern can also be seen on the XRP 3-month chart. This pattern is a classic bullish reversal structure that indicates a gradual move from a downtrend to an uptrend. Dark Defender has marked several Fibonacci levels as potential price targets for XRP. According to the analyst, XRP could see a 261.80% rise to the 5.8563 Fibonacci level between $5 to $9. After which, the analyst expects a 361.80% surge to the 18.2275 Fibonacci between $16 to $28. Support levels at the 0.6649 Fibonacci at $0.9 have also been highlighted, acting as a safety net for XRP during price corrections.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 03:46:00

The SEC has charged Tai Mo Shan Limited, a subsidiary of Jump Crypto Holdings LLC for misleading investors about Terra USD stability and selling unregistered securities. The story doesn’t just expose a company but raises questions about the broader crypto ecosystem. How did things go so wrong? Let’s dig in. The Truth Behind Terra Terra USD was supposed to be a stablecoin. As the name suggests, such a token should remain stable as it should be pegged to $1. Tai Mo Shan played a role in assuring investors it was safe, claiming Terraform Labs’ algorithm kept everything in check. But things weren’t as solid as they seemed. When UST lost its $1 peg in May 2021, Tai Mo Shan stepped in. They made $20 million worth of trades to stabilize the price, temporarily. Could they save it? No. Behind the scenes, the company had an agreement with Terraform Labs. They’d stabilize UST in exchange for discounted LUNA tokens. Investors weren’t told the truth. The peg wasn’t held by some magical algorithm but by external interventions. The SEC calls this misleading. Hard to argue with that. SEC Labels LUNA Sales as Securities Here’s where it gets messier. From January 2021 to May 2022, Tai Mo Shan acquired LUNA tokens from Terraform Labs. Then they resold them on U.S. based exchanges. The SEC sees LUNA and most of the crypto tokens as a security, as we all know. So, by acting as a statutory underwriter and failing to register these offerings, the company broke securities laws. Tai Mo Shan agreed to pay over $123 million in fines , prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. They’re also under a cease and desist order now. But an important thing to note here is that they didn’t admit to the charges. They’re not exactly waving a white flag, just agreeing to move on. What to Expect For the crypto world, Terra collapse was a wake up call. And the SEC is tightening the reins on crypto. Gary Gensler, who is stepping down in January as the SEC chair, shared that protecting investors from fraud is a top priority. This case shows how fragile the systems can be and how much investors rely on trust. Though the new administration is focusing on creating a nurturing environment for the digital space, cases like this highlights the need for strict regulations.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Scam,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|LUNA|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-21 03:51:31
