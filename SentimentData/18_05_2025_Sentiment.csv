According to the May 16 announcement from the rating agency, US lawmakers have failed to stem annual deficits or reduce spending over the years, leading to a growing national debt . The rating agency wrote: ""We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from the current fiscal proposals under consideration. Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat."" The credit downgrade is only one degree out of the 21-notch rating scale used by the company to assess the credit health of an entity. An overview of the US national debt. Source: US National Debt Clock Despite the negative short to medium-term credit outlook, Moody's maintained a positive outlook on the long-term health of the United States, citing its robust economy and the status of the US dollar as the global reserve currency as strengths, reflecting ""balanced"" lending risks. Related: Asia’s wealthy shifting from US dollar to crypto, gold, China: UBS Investors react to Moody's US credit revision Moody's announcement drew mixed reactions from investors and market participants, leaving many unconvinced by the agency's revised outlook. Gabor Gurbacs, CEO and founder of crypto loyalty rewards company Pointsville, cited the rating agency's previous credit assessments during times of financial stress as unreliable, signaling that the outlook was too optimistic. ""This is the same Moody’s that gave Aaa ratings to sub-prime mortgage-backed securities that led to the 2007-2008 financial crisis,"" the executive wrote in a May 17 X post . However, macroeconomic investor Jim Bianco argued that the recent Moody's credit outlook does not reflect a real downgrade in the perception of US government creditworthiness and characterized the announcement as a ""nothing burger."" Interest rates on the 30-year US Treasury Bond spiked to nearly 5% in May 2025, signaling reduced long-term investor confidence in US debt. Source: TradingView US government debt surpassed $36 trillion in January 2025 and shows no signs of slowing, despite recent efforts by Elon Musk and others to reduce federal spending and curtail the national debt. As the debt climbs and investors lose faith in US government securities, bond yields will spike, causing the debt service payments to go up, further inflating the national debt. This creates a vicious cycle as the government will have to entice investors with ever-greater yields to incentivize them to purchase government debt.

As the market braces for what could be a historic 2025 bull run, newer and more dynamic tokens are emerging as serious contenders. Leading the charge are PEPE, a viral sensation with an ever-growing cult following, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi powerhouse with real-world utility and explosive upside potential. The MUTM presale has attracted over 10,000 participants, and many anticipate that the token price will rise to $0.03 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 140% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. Investors have limited window since phase 4 is almost closing as over 80% has been sold. While Shiba Inu still holds nostalgic value, seasoned investors are shifting focus to what could be the next big cryptocurrency breakouts. If you’re scanning the horizon for the best crypto to buy now, these two might just be the spark that ignites the next massive rally. PEPE’s Viral Surge Positions It as a Meme Coin Powerhouse in 2025 Trading at $0.000014 with a market capitalization of nearly $6 billion, PEPE has rapidly ascended the ranks of meme coins, surpassing veteran favorites like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in recent weeks. Its 77% weekly gain is propelled by an incredibly passionate community and strategic exchange listings, which are signs of overwhelming investor confidence. While the crypto world awaits the 2025 bull run, the movement of PEPE suggests that it could be a force to be reckoned with among the top performers. For those investors searching for the next big thing in crypto, PEPE’s performance is notable, with future projects like Mutuum Finance holding promising potential within the crypto universe. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $8.5 million and accumulated 10,000 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.025 before their value will grow to $0.03 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 140% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Social media channels will release the results of an ongoing Certik smart contract audit after the completion of this audit by the team. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. Users who join early gain complete access to premium platform updates which encourages them to stay involved. Mutuum Finance leverages modern lending innovations and secure operational platforms to execute permanent changes within Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Mutuum Finance is more than a trending token, it’s shaping up to be one of 2025’s breakout stars. Over 80% of Phase 4 is already sold out, and once the price jumps to $0.03 in Phase 5, today’s $0.025 entry point will be gone forever. With a 140% return potential by launch and price targets as high as $5 by 2026, the upside is enormous, but only for those who act early. If you missed SHIB or PEPE at the bottom, this is your second shot, don’t miss it again. Lock in your MUTM tokens now before the presale window slams shut. Join the presale now.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing interest for solid reasons—well beyond just its affordable price point. With the presale heating up and the platform nearing launch, MUTM is quickly being recognized as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in right now. The numbers say it all. More than $8.5 million has already been raised, and the presale is over 83% through its fourth phase. With the price still at $0.025, it’s an accessible entry—but that opportunity is quickly slipping away. Once this phase closes, the price will rise to $0.03, and with a confirmed listing target of $0.06, early adopters could lock in a significant upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is structured to serve both passive investors and active users. The platform offers two ways to lend crypto: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users deposit digital assets—such as ETH, AVAX, or stablecoins—into liquidity pools managed by the protocol. In return, they receive mtTokens, which represent their deposit and automatically increase in value over time. These mtTokens reflect the growing interest paid by borrowers who access the pool’s funds. Users don’t need to negotiate or manage anything manually; once they deposit, they begin earning yield based on the pool’s usage rate. This setup allows anyone to earn passive income with minimal effort. The more the pool is utilized by borrowers, the higher the returns for depositors. It’s one of the simplest and most efficient ways to earn from crypto without trading or micromanaging positions. Mutuum also offers a P2P lending option, which gives users more control. Instead of contributing to a shared pool, lenders can choose to fund specific loan requests from individual borrowers. Terms like interest rate, duration, and collateral are all customizable. Here’s how it might look: A borrower offers AVAX as collateral and requests a loan in USDC. As a lender, you evaluate the request, propose an interest rate, and once both sides agree, the smart contract handles the rest. The borrower gets the funds, and you receive full repayment plus interest once the loan is repaid. This model is ideal for those who want to target higher returns or lend less common tokens. It opens up more strategic lending opportunities, while still being managed on-chain with full transparency. Mutuum enables borrowers to access liquidity while keeping full ownership of their existing assets. This is especially useful for investors who want to maintain exposure to their crypto but need short-term funds. Let’s say you’re holding LINK and expect its price to go up. Instead of selling, you can lock it as collateral and borrow USDC through Mutuum. You keep your LINK position while accessing the funds you need. There’s no fixed repayment schedule either—as long as your collateral-to-loan ratio stays above the required threshold, your position remains open. This feature gives borrowers a flexible way to participate in the market, cover expenses, or even take advantage of other opportunities without triggering taxable events or losing potential gains. One of the standout features of Mutuum is how it generates and redistributes revenue. Interest paid by borrowers is used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market, and these tokens are then distributed to mtToken holders who engage with the protocol’s reward system. Mutuum ties its reward model directly to platform usage. The more activity on the platform, the greater the buying pressure for MUTM—and the more rewards for engaged users. This design helps maintain value while encouraging long-term participation. As the protocol approaches its beta release, excitement around MUTM is rising. With utilities like lending, borrowing, and passive income already built into the design—and a stablecoin also in development—the foundation is clearly in place. For those wondering what crypto to invest in now, this project checks all the boxes: low entry price, working model, and early-stage demand. The presale is still open, but with more than 83% of this phase completed, time is running out to grab tokens at $0.025. Once the next round kicks in, that price increases by 20%, and momentum will likely continue to grow as the launch approaches. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy before the market’s next breakout, MUTM offers both opportunity and timing. While the rest of the market stalls, this one is moving—and it’s still early enough to enter before the curve steepens.

These DOGE Rivals Will Get Everyone Talking Soon,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-crypto-to-buy-today-these-doge-rivals-will-get-everyone-talking-soon/,"The crypto market pulses with opportunity, and three DOGE rivals—Cardano (ADA), XRP, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—are stealing the spotlight. Cardano’s integration with Brave’s 85 million users sparks chatter about its climb to $3. XRP’s failed bearish pattern signals a potential surge to $3.40. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing crowds with its presale, raising $8,500,000 and selling over 476 million tokens to 10,000 holders. These coins aren’t just riding trends; they’re carving paths in decentralized finance and cross-border payments. Investors are buzzing about which crypto to buy now, and these three top cryptocurrencies demand attention. Cardano’s Brave Leap Forward Cardano (ADA) is gaining traction with a bold move. The blockchain’s integration into Brave’s multi-chain wallet exposes it to 85 million users, a massive pool of crypto enthusiasts. Priced at $0.83, ADA has already climbed 60% from April’s $0.51 low. If an altcoin season ignites, analysts see it hitting $1.30 soon, with $3 in sight by late 2025. Yet, Cardano lags behind Ethereum and Solana in total value locked, limiting its immediate adoption. Still, projects like BitcoinOS and Midnight bolster its DeFi and privacy credentials. For investors eyeing the best cheap crypto to buy now, ADA offers long-term promise but requires patience. XRP’s Bullish Breakout XRP is charging forward after dodging a bearish trap. A head-and-shoulders pattern collapsed in April, but prices rebounded from $1.60 to above $2.50. Analysts now project $2.85 by June, with $3.40 possible in 2025. High trading volumes and a position above the 200-day moving average fuel this optimism. Ripple’s court wins and a crypto-friendly U.S. administration add tailwinds. However, XRP’s reliance on Ripple’s cross-border payment narrative narrows its appeal compared to broader DeFi platforms. For those asking what crypto to buy for short-term gains, XRP’s momentum makes it a top crypto to buy, though its ceiling may be limited. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor fervor in phase 4 of its presale, now 80% filled at $0.025 per token. Since the opening phase at $0.01, prices have jumped, and phase 5 will bring a 20% hike to $0.03, yielding a 20% gain for current buyers. The project’s lending and borrowing platform offers real utility, letting users earn passive income via mtTokens, like mtETH, which accrue interest. A buy-and-distribute system boosts demand by redistributing tokens to stakers. Recently, the team launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens. For those seeking the next big crypto, MUTM’s structured growth is hard to ignore. Security and Scalability in Focus The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is prioritizing trust, actively pursuing a Certik audit for its smart contract. An announcement will hit socials once finalized, boosting confidence. The presale’s tokenomics promise a 140% return at the $0.06 listing price, with analysts eyeing $2 post-launch for a 7,900% ROI. Phase 4’s rapid sell-out fuels FOMO, as investors rush to secure tokens before the price climbs. Unlike speculative coins, MUTM’s overcollateralized lending model ensures stability. This focus on security and scalability positions it as the best cryptocurrency to invest in for those chasing the next crypto to hit $1. Why These Coins Shine Cardano, XRP, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) each bring unique strengths to the crypto market. ADA’s Brave integration opens new doors, but its adoption trails competitors. XRP’s bullish breakout excites traders, yet its niche focus limits versatility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, blends DeFi utility with presale momentum, outshining its rivals. Its $8,500,000 raise and 10,000 holders signal fierce demand. Investors wondering what’s the best crypto to buy should act fast, especially with MUTM’s phase 4 nearing its end.

According to the data, in today's transactions, the crypto whale with the short address 0x6ea withdrew 1.79 trillion PEPE tokens worth $22.35 million via Binance. With the decrease in the price of PEPE after the whale purchased the wallet, at the time of writing this article, this whale has $21.9 million worth of PEPE in its crypto wallet. PEPE price has lost 8% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.00001222. The decline came during a general decline on the altcoin side, but PEPE was one of the biggest cryptocurrencies that was most affected by these losses. Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, Pi Coin lost the most value with 11%. The sharp declines were concentrated in memecoins.

Federal prosecutors confirm that Storm conspired to launder money, circumvent U.S. sanctions, and conduct an unlicensed money transfer business through Tornado Cash. The trial is set to begin in less than two months. Recent court documents show that prosecutors have agreed to drop the portion of the charge related to operating a money-transfer business without a license, acknowledging inconsistencies with federal regulations. In 2019, FinCEN clarified that ”non-custodial entities” such as Tornado Cash are not classified as money transfer operators. ”The provider of anonymizing software is not a money remitter. The rules exclude from the definition those persons who provide only delivery, communication, or network access services used to transmit funds,” the agency's guidance states. The proceedings against Storm continue despite an internal service memo circulated last month about the DOJ changing its approach to handling cases involving cryptocurrency mixing services. It indicated that the agency would focus on prosecuting individuals who use crypto tools for criminal purposes, rather than prosecuting the platforms themselves. Tornado Cash co-founder Alexey Pertsev was sentenced to more than five years in prison in May 2022 for laundering $1.2 billion through a mixer, but was released to electronic monitoring in February 2025 pending appeal. Tornado Cash found itself under OFAC sanctions in August 2022 due to its role in money laundering. According to the U.S. authorities, since the creation of the service, attackers have spent more than $7 billion through it. Tornado Cash was used in particular by the North Korean group Lazarus. Recall that on January 21, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit revoked the sanctions due to ”abuse of authority” by OFAC and sent the case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas for further proceedings.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-17 20:48:45

Why? Because the fundamentals go beyond hype. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just another trending presale — it’s a structured, politically resonant project with long-term strategy, real traction, and serious upside. XRP and ETH Gains Are Slowing — Investors Seek Next-Phase Growth XRP has seen major rallies this year, surging as high as $3.93 , but recent pullbacks to $2.45 have triggered warnings of a 50% correction. While Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin rollout and ETF chatter still support bullish long-term sentiment, short-term volatility is pushing XRP holders to rebalance. Ethereum , trading around $1,826 , is projected to climb above $1,895 this quarter, but growth is expected to be moderate compared to earlier cycles. Institutions remain committed, but retail investors are hunting higher-multiple opportunities. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture. MAGACOIN FINANCE Stage 8 Is Live — And the Clock Is Ticking MAGACOIN FINANCE recently passed $8 million raised , but this isn’t about milestones — it’s about what comes next. Stage 8 is live , and each phase is becoming more exclusive. With Stage 9 approaching , investors are securing allocations ahead of a series of major announcements , including integrations, media expansions, and roadmap updates. The project remains under $0.001 , and promo code MAGA50X offers a 50% token bonus — a key reason why whales are buying in now, not waiting for listings. Built for Longevity — Not Just Hype With no centralized exchange dilution yet, a scalable model, and politically driven branding, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as a top altcoin to watch — not just in presale charts, but across analyst dashboards. XRP and ETH holders see the writing on the wall: this is still early , and the upside is asymmetric. In a market full of recycled narratives and overextended tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out — not for what it’s promised, but for how it’s built. Stage 8 is open. Stage 9 is next. And XRP and ETH whales aren’t waiting.

This incident is part of a trend of violent cases targeting individuals connected to the crypto industry in France. Crypto Exec’s Family Targeted in Attack According to a BBC report , the attack happened around 8:20 a.m. in the city’s 11th district and was captured on video by an onlooker. Local media revealed that the woman and her husband were getting out of their car with their child when three men jumped out of a white van and tried to pull them away. The couple fought back, which resulted in the husband being hit several times on the head while trying to protect his family. Meanwhile, the wife managed to grab a gun from one of the culprits and threw it into the street. Police later confirmed the weapon was a replica air gun. Despite the busy street and children on their way to school nearby, passers-by hesitated to intervene at first. However, as more people began to react, the attackers abandoned the attempt and ran back to the van, where a fourth person was waiting inside. As the culprits drove away, one witness threw a fire extinguisher at the vehicle. Following the incident, the family was taken to a hospital and treated for minor injuries. Police sources confirmed that the woman is the daughter of a crypto company boss. AFP said the victims are relatives of the co-founder of French Bitcoin exchange Paymium. The Paris police unit that handles armed robbery is now investigating the incident. A Series of Crypto-Related Kidnappings This development follows a similar case just over a week earlier, where the father of a crypto millionaire was kidnapped in another part of Paris while walking his dog. In this instance, the abductee was held for ransom. After being in captivity for three days, he was released with one of his fingers cut off. Several people have been arrested in connection with the case. Another high-profile incident happened in January when David Balland, co-founder of crypto wallet firm Ledger, and his wife were taken at their home in central France, with the culprits demanding a 10 million euro ransom for their release. While they were later rescued, Balland was also found missing a finger. Around the same time, rumors spread about another abduction involving Ledger’s other co-founder, Eric Larchevêque. However, these claims were later denied by French media. Authorities have not confirmed whether the incidents are connected, but all victims involved had some link to crypto.

The last week, however, saw a slight drop of 4.49%, highlighting intermittent volatility. This suggests a pattern of quick surges interspersed with periods of consolidation, characterized by small pullbacks in weekly trading. Current values are fluctuating between $2.19 and $4.35, with immediate resistance at $5.19 and secondary resistance around $7.34. Support is positioned near $0.88. The market shows neither strong bullish momentum nor dominant bearish pressure, offering opportunities for traders to either aim for breakouts above resistance levels or look to accumulate near support. Avalanche Price Trends: Short-Term Rebounds Amid Long-Term Dips Avalanche posted a 21% gain in the past month while dipping about 34% over six months. A one-week decline of around 2.5% hints at recent downward pressure amid earlier rallies. The mixed movements indicate that, despite bursts of strength, the coin still struggles to recover from an extended slippage period. Current prices hover between $16 and $24 with resistance seen at roughly $28 and support near $11. Technical indicators like an RSI around 52 and a slightly bearish moving average suggest a cautious market. Traders might watch for a breakout above resistance or consider positions near support within this defined range. Conclusion SUI appears to have strong support near its neckline, suggesting a potential for upward movement. AVAX has shown significant strength with a strong breakout, indicating further gains may be possible. Both coins are worth watching closely for their next price moves in the market.

While meme coins like Shiba Inu had their moment, smart money is shifting toward real utility, and that’s where Mutuum Finance comes in. Positioned as a potential millionaire-maker crypto of 2025, this innovative DeFi project is gaining serious traction among altcoin enthusiasts and early adopters alike. The presale has raised more than $8.5 million and attracted over 10,000 participants, ahead of a token price rise to $0.03 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 140% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. Investors have limited window since phase 4 is almost closing as over 80% has been sold. If you’re searching for the best cryptocurrency to invest in today, don’t overlook this rising star in the world of decentralized finance. Why Shiba Inu’s Hype May Not Translate Into Long-Term Wealth Shiba Inu swept the world in the last bull run, turning early buyers into overnight millionaires and solidifying its position as one of the most hyped meme coins in crypto history. However, the coin’s astronomical growth was fueled less by inherent utility and more by social media hype and speculative mania. As the market matures and investor focus shifts towards long-term value and real-world use cases, Shiba Inu’s lack of innovation becomes more and more apparent. While it remains a cultural phenomenon in the market, investors looking to invest in the best cryptocurrency for the 2025 cycle will want to look at projects with stronger fundamentals, like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market.

According to the investigation, this notorious group moved over HK$118 million, worth about $15 million, through local banks and crypto exchange shops. Authorities say this operation is part of Hong Kong’s broader crackdown on digital asset crime. How The Criminal Syndicate Operates The Commercial Crime Bureau led the investigation. Officers arrested two Hong Kong residents who were key members of the group. They also arrested ten people from mainland China. In total, nine men and three women, ages 20 to 42, were reportedly taken into custody, The local members helped the mainland suspects open fake bank accounts in Hong Kong. These accounts were created in both regular and digital banks, and the goal was to hide the source of the money. Crypto Shops Used to Hide Funds Source According to Police Superintendent Shirley Kwok Ching-yee, the group also used other people’s bank cards to withdraw large amounts of cash. The cash was then taken to crypto exchange shops in Hong Kong, converted into cryptocurrency. This method made it harder to track where the money came from. The syndicate created around 500 fake accounts to carry out its activities. Police reported that 58 scams earned at least HKD 10 million, valued at around $1.3 million. These bad actors tricked victims and funneled the stolen money through the group’s accounts. Notably, authorities worldwide are increasingly cracking down on crypto exchange shops that engage in illegal activities . Rising Fraud Cases in Hong Kong The Hong Kong enforcement team also shared that fraud cases in the city are growing. Compared to last year, fraud reports are up by nearly 12%. So far, more than 10,000 suspects have been arrested for fraud-related crimes in Hong Kong. Similarly, in the U.S., crypto scams and illegal activities are on the rise. In April, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) shared in its 2024 report that digital asset scams have hit record levels. The IC3 received over 140,000 crypto-related complaints last year, with total losses reaching $9.3 billion. This is a sharp 66% increase from the $5.6 billion reported in 2023. While Hong Kong is working hard to promote the growth of digital assets, the government is also increasing its efforts to fight financial crimes. Officials say stopping money laundering is key to keeping the city’s economic system safe and trusted. Notably, many countries are doing the same by tightening crypto rules and increasing enforcement to prevent financial crimes and protect investors.

In a post on X, one of the popular members of the Pi Community, Dr Picoin, claimed that insiders have dumped millions of tokens. According to Dr Picoin , the sell-offs by insiders followed recent announcements about upgrades and improvements to the Pi Network at Consensus 2025. He claimed that the hype around these announcements pumped PI value, and insiders used that opportunity to sell. He said: “The Core Team sold tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of Pi at the peak — all while the community was distracted by announcements and the illusion of progress.” Interestingly, the users alleging rug pull and sell-offs point to blockchain data showing that a wallet allegedly controlled by the Pi Core Team transferred 12 million PI in the last 24 hours. Screenshot of transaction data shared by Dr Picoin as proof of sell-off (Source: Dr Picoin) However, some other users have pushed back against the claims, noting no rug pull. Pinewszone on X explained that the wallet that many claim is selling is a distribution wallet that the Pi Core Team uses to migrate user balances to the mainnet. They posted: “Don’t be misled by fake information circulating on X. Coreteam is not selling pi. You are just being influenced to panic sell so that they can buy at a lower price.” While community members are arguing about what is happening, the Pi Core Team has been quiet, further allowing the fear of uncertainty and doubt (FUD) to spread among users. PI token loses more than 50% within a week as users wait for mainnet Meanwhile, most of the concerns from users alleging rug pull appear to be tied to the sharp drop in PI price this week. The token reached $1.60 on May 12 but started dumping since then and is now at 0.679, representing around a 58% decline. Dr Picoin posted : “Don’t question me—demand an explanation from the Co-founders: why did the price suddenly drop from $1.60 to $0.70 when, in reality, the update from PCT should have been seen as a positive development?” However, the decline is mostly due to the disappointing wait for most users looking forward to the network transitioning to mainnet. A post from the official Pi Core Team account sparked excitement last week when it teased a huge announcement. Most people expected that the announcement would have something to do with the long-awaited mainnet launch, but it was about to be the launch of the Pi Network Venture fund. The news of a $100 million fund for a Pi Network-based project was underwhelming for most users. PI token daily trading volume for the past seven days peaked on May 13 (Source: CoinMarketCap) Interestingly, trading volume for PI declined 34% to $328.54 million in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Trading volume has also declined since peaking at $2.03 billion on May 13. This shows holders sold the rumor, i.e., they dumped the token when it was still pumping before the team announced the launch of the Venture Fund. Since the announcement on May 14, trading volume has fallen well below $1 billion. Pi Network announces new upgrades at Consensus 2025 Meanwhile, Pi Network has continued to evolve even as users wait for the mainnet launch, which has no scheduled date yet. The network founder, Dr Nicholas Kokkalis, disclosed at Consensus that Pi Network has now shut down its central node to enable full decentralization of the network. He added that its node operating software now has a new version called Horizon, which is available for node operators to upgrade. Horizon reportedly offers security, performance, and protocol. Interestingly, Kokkalis said in his talk titled “Unleashing Mainstream Adoption with Al + Blockchain Infrastructure” that Pi Network will integrate artificial intelligence. He called on AI companies to build AI apps on the network, adding that there is a plan to improve Pi Network’s technical infrastructure.

In line with the bullish rhythm of the crypto market, the prominent altcoin has recorded significant price leaps in the past month, resulting in a total gain of 61.92% in this period. However, price patterns indicate that Ethereum is headed for a major encounter at $4,000, a price level with potential to neutralize or validate the current price uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Multi-Year Consolidation Could Spark A Parabolic Move – Details ETH Must Surpass Long-Standing Resistance To Ignite Mega Rally In an X post on May 16, OKC partner and crypto analyst Ted Pillows highlighted an important price level for Ethereum amidst the ongoing bull trend. Notably, ETH has moved by over 60% in the past few weeks from $1400 to trade above $2,600. Based on the growing chart pattern and underlying market fundamentals, the altcoin is likely to maintain this uptrend in the short term. According to Ted Pillows, $4,000 can be described as a crucial price region for ETH bulls based on historical price data. Notably, Ethereum has been trading within a massive symmetrical triangle that began in Q3 2020 and has lasted over 1,500 days. The $4,000 price level currently sits just below the upper boundary of this triangle, representing a significant opposition to further price gains. In 2024, Ethereum popularly faced rejection thrice at the $4,000 price level, even amidst general market upswings, raising speculations over the altcoin’s long-term profitability. If the ETH bulls can sustain the current market demand, another encounter with this major resistance level is likely on the cards. To confirm the altcoin’s participation in a brewing crypto bull run and altseason, Ethereum must push past $4,000, flipping this price zone into an effective support level that could strengthen the current market structure with bullish targets set as high as $12,000. However, if ETH faces another rejection at this resistance zone, a price correction could occur with potential for price lows around $1,700 in line with the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle.

Institutional investments are strong bullish signals of long-term profitability for the ETH market as they indicate a strong demand from these traditional financial institutions with relatively high amounts of liquidity.

With altcoin narratives back in play and sentiment shifting, these three are back on the radar — but in a cycle increasingly driven by breakout timing and asymmetric entries, traders are asking: can these legacy tokens still deliver the explosive moves they once did? While SOL, ADA, and TRX build momentum, some investors are pivoting toward breakout-stage opportunities — tokens with more upside, stronger timing, and no legacy baggage. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE is now making a serious entrance. Solana and Cardano Reclaim Strength — But Capped by Expectations Solana has pushed back into its $170+ range, and Cardano is once again holding above $0.77 — both signs of resilience in a choppy Q2 market. TRON, meanwhile, has benefited from stablecoin inflows and network stability. Yet despite these gains, all three now face the same challenge: they’re expected to perform. With so many traders already positioned, and price caps well-known, the potential for fresh breakout energy is limited . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why Capital Is Rotating Into High-Potential Breakout Plays The prevailing trend in 2025 is unmistakable: traders are targeting tokens with clean technical setups, early-stage entry points, and compelling narratives. Rather than favoring stability, the market is flowing toward assets on the verge of breakout — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a clear beneficiary of this shift. Unlike Solana or Cardano, which have matured into infrastructure giants, MAGACOIN FINANCE is pursuing a different trajectory — one that combines grassroots momentum, scarcity-driven mechanics, and narrative strength. This unique positioning is allowing it to stand out amid a saturated market. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Entering at the Optimal Phase of the Cycle What gives MAGACOIN FINANCE its edge isn’t just pricing — it’s the lifecycle stage. While most top-tier tokens are well into their multi-year paths, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in its pre-listing phase — historically the window where asymmetric upside is most accessible. Traders are paying attention for several key reasons: The entry price is still under $0.001 , with a projected listing target of $0.007 45% of the supply is allocated to early backers, reinforcing exclusivity and scarcity It presents a second-chance setup for those who missed Solana’s early surge or Cardano’s 2021 rally The project is gaining recognition across altcoin communities and scanning platforms — signaling growing sentiment ahead of broader market exposure With these dynamics in play, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a favored early-stage entry for traders seeking breakout positioning ahead of the curve. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thought: Legacy or Lift-Off? Solana, Cardano, and TRON still have strong fundamentals — but fundamentals are not always what drives breakout cycles . In the current environment, fresh narratives and early entries are pulling the biggest moves. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t replacing these giants — it’s offering what they can’t right now: a clean chart, open upside, and cycle-perfect timing .

The executive explained: ""We have validators all around the world. Rotating leader schedules all the time. And then they switch from having to be massive consumers of data to extremely massive broadcasters of data. So that means that they need huge amounts of resources both on ingress and egress."" The executive added that the constraint posed by public internet infrastructure is now the limiting factor in blockchain performance and not compute power or software development.

The goal of the project is to reduce latency, the time it takes for data to travel in a network, and bandwidth — the maximum data traffic a network can handle at once. In April 2025, DoubleZero conducted a validator token sale to sell token purchase agreements to interested node operators seeking to become validators for the network. The token sale was only available to accredited investors and already active validators on high-throughput blockchain networks including, Solana, Celestia, Sui, Aptos, and Avalanche.

As the 2025 bull run approaches, attention is turning to high-potential XRP substitutes that offer stronger ecosystems, faster scalability, and more robust DeFi integrations. Whether you’re hunting for the next big cryptocurrency or simply want exposure beyond Ripple, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and the emerging Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are quickly becoming the top altcoins to invest in today, each offering unique value in a rapidly advancing crypto market. Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Phase 4 which is over 80% sold out, already raking in over $8.5 million with over 10,000 investors participating. With a public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 4 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 140% by the time the token hits exchanges. Why Solana and Cardano Are Outshining XRP in 2025 As XRP keeps venturing regulatory seas and making it on the world stage in terms of international remittances, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are gaining attention from investors but for distinctly different reasons. Solana’s fire-throughput capabilities and negligible fee costs have endeared itself to NFT websites and DeFi developers both, while Cardano’s academically-oriented bent and priority placed on peer-reviewed upgrades endears itself to those looking for sustained blockchain sustainability. Relative to XRP, centralised both in governance and use case, the two ecosystems are thriving in innovation and expanding bases. As altcoin buyers remain to consider their alternatives and make investments in this year’s hottest altcoins, SOL and ADA each offer robust alternatives, along with newcomer Mutuum Finance (MUTM) adding further added fuel to XRP alternative investors will need to keep an eye on. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance is being third-party audited, and their open-source smart contracts are secure in design while creating trust among users. The platform is also set to be compatible with non-EVM and EVM blockchains, and the gates swing wider with more liquidity in other ecosystems. Presale Momentum At today’s $0.025, the MUTM token is of huge interest to early investors. A Phase 5 20% price jump will give the token a boost to $0.03. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there’s plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance one of the most-watched low-market-price DeFi plays. XRP’s future remains clouded by regulatory hurdles and stagnating innovation, prompting savvy investors to pivot toward high-utility altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and the rapidly rising Mutuum Finance. Over $8.5 million has already been raised by more than 10,000 adopters, all anticipating serious upside as the presale races toward completion. Phase 4 is over 80% sold out, and the current entry price of $0.025 won’t last long. Phase 5 will jump to $0.03 and the public launch is set at $0.06, locking in up to 140% in potential gains. Analyst chatter points to post-launch prices as high as $3, making this one of the most talked-about DeFi tokens of the year. Act now or risk missing out, Mutuum Finance could be the altcoin breakout of the 2025 bull run.

Their mid-term price predictions spark curiosity, and their positions in the upcoming surge become a topic of debate. This article delves into which of these coins might be primed for a significant rise. Bitcoin Cash Price Trends: Monthly Surge Amid Semi-Annual Dip Bitcoin Cash showed a 23.06% gain over the past month with a notable jump in price, while the six-month performance slipped by 8.38%. The short-term rally indicates renewed market interest, contrasting with a broader decline over a longer period. Price movement has been volatile, reflecting bursts of optimism alongside persistent pressure evident over the last six months. Trading now falls within a range of $282 to $417, with immediate resistance at $469 and a secondary resistance at $605. Strong support appears at $197 and lower at $62. Bulls and bears are in a tug-of-war with no clear trend, making it worthwhile to trade cautiously within these levels while monitoring for significant moves. Litecoin Rally and Support Zones A monthly gain of 33.40% contrasts with a slower 6-month increase of 13.79%, suggesting a recent burst of activity amid overall steady progress. Weekly performance dipped slightly by 1.34%, reflecting some short-term hesitance in price movement. Price levels have oscillated within a moderate range over these periods, showing renewed energy compared to the past half-year. Current trading shows Litecoin positioned between a range of $68.29 and $93.67. The nearest resistance at $103.77 and support near $53.01 form key decision levels. Indicators hint at balanced energy, with neither bulls nor bears decisively controlling the market. Traders might explore opportunities on short-term moves towards resistance or cautious entries near support. Conclusion In 2025, BCH and LTC are expected to play key roles in the crypto market. BCH, with its strong transaction capability, and LTC, known for its fast processing times, could see significant growth. Both coins have established their positions and maintain active communities. They will likely be important players in the mid-term crypto rally. These two cryptocurrencies might attract more investors looking for reliable alternatives to other well-known options.

However, while established players continue leading, early buyers focus on something more promising. Web3 ai, the platform set to launch with a fully operational AI product suite has taken the spotlight where every feature relies on the $WAI coin. It has raised $500K within 24 hours and over $4 million in its presale. It prioritizes real utility instead of speculation. At its current price of $0.000365 in stage 5, with a locked listing price of $0.005242, the Web3 ai ($WAI) offers a 1747% ROI before launch. This is a rare opportunity for those looking to enter a promising crypto. Uniswap Trading Volume Hits $3 Trillion Uniswap has reached a major milestone by surpassing $3 trillion in trading volume, cementing its position as the top decentralized exchange. In response, the UNI coin surged to $6.89, marking a 41% increase over the past week, although some pullback may occur short-term. Uniswap also introduced a rewards tracking feature in its Web App, allowing liquidity providers (LPs) to monitor real-time earnings. Additionally, ERC-7683, a cross-chain liquidity standard, aims to unify markets. A court ruling that protects Uniswap Labs from third-party fraud strengthens its position, reinforcing Uniswap’s solid fundamentals. Dogecoin Price Target Reaches $2 Dogecoin’s price target has been set as high as $2 due to whale buys and ETF speculation. Currently priced between $0.23 and $0.26, analysts are keeping a close eye on the situation after Bitwise registered a “BITWISE DOGECOIN ETF” entity in Delaware, indicating growing institutional interest. Additionally, large holders acquired 590 million DOGE in one day, now controlling about 30% of the supply. Technical indicators, such as MACD crossover and rounded bottom patterns, suggest a bullish trend. Conservative predictions forecast a range of $0.24, while some models predict a rise to $0.57 to $2. Web3 ai’s Real-World Utility Drives Buyers Interest Web3 ai attracts significant attention because it’s geared to delivering results. The project has raised over $4 million, with $500K coming in just 24 hours, reflecting the growing interest from both retail and institutional buyers. The platform offers a range of AI-powered tools, including automated trading signals, portfolio tracking, DeFi yield recommendations, fraud detection, and risk monitoring. Every tool requires the $WAI coin to operate, creating a direct link between platform usage and increased coin demand. Currently, the presale is in Stage 5, priced at $0.000365, with a locked listing price of $0.005242. This offers a potential 1747% return on assets before the official launch. The presale consists of 50 stages, and as the supply becomes more limited, the opportunity to get in at these early stages is shrinking. What sets Web3 ai apart is its execution. The platform’s tools will go live once WAI lists on exchanges, with AI integrated as the core function. Fund managers recognize that the next major opportunity in the market isn’t about following trends but buying solid infrastructure. Web3 ai’s blend of utility and growth potential positions it as a strong candidate for long-term success, making it an appealing asset choice for those looking for real-world value in the crypto space. Final Thoughts Web3 ai stands out not due to speculative potential but because it is already providing real-world utility. The project has raised over $4 million, with $500K coming in just one day, attracting both retail and institutional attention. Its AI-powered tools cover automated trading, portfolio tracking, DeFi yield recommendations, fraud detection, and risk monitoring. Every tool relies on the $WAI coin, ensuring increasing demand as the platform grows. With the presale priced at $0.000365, Web3 ai offers a 1747% ROI at listing.

Daily RSI Shows Only Mild Bullish Momentum,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bull-run-on-daily-rsi-signals-bullish-weakness/,"The price of Bitcoin has been on quite the run since mid-April, finding its way from beneath the $85,000 mark to as high as $104,700 over the past month. The largest cryptocurrency market enjoyed a positive shift in investor sentiment and a fresh influx of capital, especially through the BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Interestingly, the premier cryptocurrency seems to be showing some signs of fatigue, especially after failing to break out of the $102,000 – $105,000 consolidation range over the past week. This sluggish round of price action has called into question the authenticity of the recent bullish impulse. BTC Still Missing Its Bullish Aggression: Crypto Expert Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Tony Severino took to the X platform to share an interesting insight into the price action of Bitcoin over the last few weeks. According to the crypto expert, the price of BTC might be missing a classic technical behavior, often correlated with aggressive bullish impulses. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones—What It Means for ETH The rationale behind this observation is the recent movement of the daily relative strength index (RSI) indicator on the Bitcoin price chart. The relative strength index is a momentum indicator used in technical price analysis to estimate the speed and magnitude of an asset’s price changes. The RSI oscillator is typically used to analyze whether a crypto asset is being overbought or oversold, signaling a potential trend/price reversal. An RSI reading of above 70 usually indicates an overbought market condition, while a relative strength index value below 30 signals an oversold condition. According to Severino, Bitcoin bull runs historically coincide with a rapid surge of the RSI oscillator above the 70 threshold, reflecting overwhelming buying pressure in the market. This pattern is noticeable in the chart below, as highlighted during the October 2023 rally and the November 2024 post-election breakout. However, Bitcoin’s current price action appears more cautious and less convincing. While the market leader has been recovering from its early-year blues, the relative strength index has yet to exhibit the clean upward break (above 70) typical of significant bullish expansions. Severino did note that the Bitcoin bullish impulse—signaled by the RSI break above 70—could emerge at any moment. If the bullish strength does come, investors could see the price of BTC break out of the current consolidation range and toward its all-time high. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, BTC is valued at around $103,676, reflecting no significant price movements in the past 24 hours. The past day’s sluggishness underscores the premier cryptocurrency’s performance in the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the Bitcoin price has increased by merely 0.8% in the last seven days.

With early momentum building faster than expected and volume accelerating daily, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly separating itself from other new entries. Investors are no longer asking if it will break out — they’re asking when — and many have already positioned for 40x+ gains ahead of listings. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! The Presale That’s Turning Heads Across the Market While other projects struggle to maintain attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE has done the opposite — it has gained speed with every stage . From trader forums to presale trackers, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing up as one of the most-watched early-stage entries of the cycle . Key reasons why early buyers are moving fast: A still-undervalued entry price below $0.001 A projected listing at $0.007 , offering built-in upside A hard supply cap of 100 billion tokens , with strong demand from politically driven and speculative traders alike This is not just about tokenomics — it’s about timing, narrative, and community alignment , all colliding at the right moment. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Outpacing Other Presales Presales are everywhere — but very few combine cultural relevance, sharp scarcity mechanics , and actual breakout energy . MAGACOIN FINANCE has managed to do all three. Unlike meme tokens that rely purely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as a serious early-stage altcoin setup with structure behind it. Buyers aren’t aping in blindly — they’re making timed entries based on breakout-stage signals . The project has now become a favorite among traders migrating from: XRP , looking for higher ROI SOL and AVAX , seeking new volatility plays DOGE and PEPE , chasing the next political meme breakout — but with stronger mechanics Analysts Are Already Flagging It as the Cycle’s Smartest Early Entry With listings expected to follow soon, analysts are starting to compare MAGACOIN FINANCE’s structure to early Shiba Inu or Trump Coin momentum phases — but with more control, better entry ratios, and tighter token distribution. Some forecasts now point to 40x–50x potential , depending on post-listing liquidity and community retention. What’s clear is this: the early window is closing fast . CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Word: The Standout Pre-Sale of 2025 In a crowded market filled with fleeting hype, only a select few tokens truly shape the early-stage narrative each year. MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving to be one of those rare cases. For investors seeking the most strategic entry or watching for the next major mover, this project is setting a new benchmark for politically themed, community-led altcoins. It’s not just building momentum — it’s becoming the defining story of the cycle .

SUI — Scalable Ecosystem, Surging Sentiment SUI has been one of 2025’s quiet giants, with a 302.57% gain over the past year and an 81.99% jump just this month . A minor token unlock this week hasn’t shaken investor confidence, as the project continues to attract strong volume and developer attention. With key support at $3.76 and bullish price targets as high as $5.21 in May alone, many traders see SUI as a breakout Layer 1 leader. With over $1.74 billion in daily volume and ecosystem momentum building, SUI has the scalability and market interest to push toward the top-10 market cap rankings in the next bull run. 2. Litecoin — Classic Asset With New Technical Strength Often overlooked in favor of flashier tokens, Litecoin is staging a strong comeback. Analysts forecast a potential pullback to $81.06 , but longer-term projections range from $199 to $255 if bullish momentum builds. The formation of a W-reversal pattern signals a potential breakout ahead — especially if LTC can surpass the critical $132.23 resistance level. Litecoin has held up better than many altcoins during market turbulence, and its simplicity, liquidity, and wide acceptance make it a reliable mid-cap bet for the next cycle. 3. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Early-Stage ROI Play With Breakout Potential With over $8 million raised and momentum accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025. Unlike many presales that fade after launch, this project is built on long-term scalability, politically resonant branding, and a viral narrative that continues to attract both whales and retail buyers. Stage 8 is live, and Stage 9 is approaching fast — making access increasingly exclusive. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE from the rest is its strategic timing: the token is aligned with a political cycle that could fuel mainstream media attention and cultural virality just as exchange listings go live. Analysts say the upside isn’t just in price — it’s in positioning. Promo code MAGA50X offers a 50% token bonus, giving early participants more allocation strength ahead of what insiders call a wave of key announcements. These include major integrations, updated roadmap milestones, and wider media exposure already in motion. There are no centralized exchange dilution risks at this stage. Instead, MAGACOIN FINANCE is growing organically through word-of-mouth, verified on-chain whale activity, and an increasingly active global community. It’s the kind of project seasoned investors recognise early — not just for what it is now, but for what it’s setting up to become.

The project’s unique combination of fixed supply, narrative appeal, and a tiered pricing model has helped create one of the most consistent presale performances of 2025. With the presale now advancing into later stages, urgency among buyers is climbing. Current prices remain below the public exchange target of $0.007 , offering projected returns of 25x to 40x for early participants. As each round fills, new buyers are entering at higher price points, reinforcing the growth trend. THE CLOCK IS TICKING FAST – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE Offers More Than Hype Backed by a HASHEX audit , MAGACOIN FINANCE maintains a clear structure and transparent rollout process. The token supply is deliberately limited, and the presale is designed to reward those who take early action. Community channels now exceed 20,000 members , with high levels of activity and ongoing discussion about future use cases. The project also continues to reward proactive investors through its MAGA50X bonus code, which provides a 50% token bonus for qualifying purchases. This has helped enhance investor confidence while fueling continued allocation ahead of the token’s official launch. Why Analysts Are Watching Closely Analysts are tracking MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top early-stage contender this quarter, citing its strong presale consistency and alignment with growing demand for political meme projects that offer real structure. While many meme tokens rely on short-term trends, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing signs of being built for sustainable growth through its phased rollout and steady engagement metrics. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Final Thought: The Window Is Narrowing As momentum builds and price stages rise, investors are locking in positions before the next jump. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly transitioning from a pre-sale project to a headline altcoin—and those entering now are positioning ahead of a major shift in market attention.

Eyes are turning to specific coins, hinting at significant opportunities. Kaspa , Raydium , and AAVE are emerging as strong contenders, possibly poised for impressive growth. This article delves into why these cryptos could lead the way, sparking keen interest for May 2025. Kaspa Breakout: Short-Term Gains Amid Longer-Term Corrections Kaspa experienced rapid gains with a 54% rise in one month and an 11% increase in one week. A six-month decline of nearly 23% reflects earlier bearish trends before the recent surge. Price movements show volatility with periods of strong recovery following earlier drops, highlighting the coin's quick rebound even after broader corrections. At present, Kaspa trades between $0.0585 and $0.1150 with key resistance at $0.1403 and a secondary barrier near $0.1967, while support holds at $0.0274. Bulls push the price in the short term, but a clear trend is yet to emerge. Traders might explore long positions on a sustained break above $0.1403 while staying alert to potential pullbacks toward support levels. Raydium RAY: Recent Surge Amid Long-Term Decline and Key Levels Last month RAY shows a notable rebound with an increase of nearly 40%, while the six-month trend reflects a sharper decline of almost 46%. Price movement illustrates a period of volatility where a short-term rally contrasts with a longer-term downward drift. Historical data reveals a mix of recovery dynamics driven by sudden upward momentum alongside a broader bearish sentiment. Current trading lies between a range of about $1.73 and $3.50, with a nearby resistance at $4.21 and support near $0.68. Bulls appear active, hinting at attempts to breach $4.21, yet the clear trend remains unformed. A cautious approach is advised, considering trades at key levels while respecting the existing range. Aave Surge: Rising Momentum with Key Price Zones in Focus Aave has experienced strong upward movements over the past month, with prices jumping by nearly 68% while recording a solid 40% rise over the last six months. A modest weekly increase of around 7% hints at renewed trading interest and dynamic market activity, reflecting a period of significant recovery and speed in price action. At present, the coin trades between approximately $125 and $191s. Immediate resistance appears near $218 with support around $87, and a further swing to resistance may target the $283 mark while deeper support lies near $22. The interplay of bullish pressure with occasional bearish signals creates a mixed trend environment, prompting strategies that favor cautious breakdowns above resistance or buying near established support levels. Conclusion Kaspa (KAS) , Raydium (RAY) , and AAVE show potential for strong performance by May 2025. Kaspa continues to gain traction with its novel technology. Raydium is making significant strides in decentralized finance. AAVE remains a powerful player with its lending and borrowing platform. These coins have promising futures.

With blue chips already rallying, savvy investors are scanning the market for cryptocurrencies that could explode in the next bull cycle. Projects like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) continue to prove their staying power with solid ecosystems, while Dogecoin (DOGE) rides renewed momentum in meme-driven investing. But beneath the surface, a newer altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is emerging as a potential XRP-level breakout candidate, offering both utility and growth potential. The project is already at Phase 4 of its presale and has already raised more than $8.5 million and more than 10,000 investors. With over 80% sold out during this stage, the price will go up by 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5 and with an expected launch price of $0.06. These four tokens are quickly becoming the top crypto to watch as the next wave of gains builds. Cardano, Solana, and Dogecoin: The Top Altcoins Shaping 2025 While the crypto market readies itself for a massive 2025 surge, Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are emerging as players for investors seeking high returns. Cardano’s research-driven approach continues to attract those in search of a reliable blockchain solution focused on security and scalability. On the other hand, Solana’s speed network and low costs have made it the go-to for developers and DeFi projects to scale quickly. Meanwhile, although Dogecoin did begin as a meme coin, its durability with a devoted following and increasing use cases beyond simple entertainment is nothing short of phenomenal. While these altcoins are causing a stir as among the most high-potential cryptos to invest in today, newer altcoins like Mutuum Finance are making a strong case to stay relevant in the DeFi market, setting the stage for the next cryptocurrency explosion. Mutuum Finance: A New Era in DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance is not just another DeFi wave-rider project. It provides a twin lending mechanism incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) capabilities. The hybrid system offers stability as well as control to users. P2C Lending enables investors to receive yield by providing stablecoins such as USDT to lending pools that are governed by smart contracts, providing a safe and automated means of earning passive income. In contrast, P2P Lending allows direct borrowing and lending relations between users with no middlemen. This aspect enhances privacy and allows for more personalized lending, giving users more control over the transaction. Through this novel setup Mutuum Finance is now a viable and scalable product within the DeFi ecosystem. It is also currently undergoing a third-party audit by Certik to further enhance transparency and investor trust. Fueling Growth Through Community and Rewards The platform is also developing a thriving community with reward-based mechanics. There is an active leaderboard that shows the top 50 token holders and rewarding them with additional MUTM tokens. In addition, there is a token giveaway with a $100,000 prize ongoing, in which ten winners will receive $10,000 each in MUTM. A referral program also incentivizes user growth by rewarding participants who refer new users to the platform. The combination of well-established altcoins like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) with the emerging potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) makes May 2025 an exciting time for crypto investors. With Mutuum already raising over $8.5 million from 10,000+ investors and over 80% of its Phase 4 presale sold out, the momentum is undeniable. As the price of MUTM is set to increase by 20% in the upcoming Phase 5, those who act now can capitalize on its early-stage growth. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next crypto win, join today before the phase passes you by.

Far from being a fleeting trend, it has carved out a leadership position within the political meme space, demonstrating real traction and breakout-level potential. While many imitators rely solely on virality, MAGACOIN FINANCE has taken a more strategic approach — building a community-driven ecosystem underpinned by strong growth metrics, early-access incentives, and clear market appeal. The result is a token that continues to attract capital from across the altcoin spectrum. From Meme Token to Market Contender — MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Rapid Ascent Unlike most meme coins that burn out after a brief wave of social hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing sustained acceleration — propelled by data-backed momentum rather than flash-in-the-pan attention. Key drivers behind its continued rise: A pricing model that rewards early participants with structured upside mechanics A unique blend of cultural relevance and growth-focused positioning Increasing visibility in real-time trading tools and scanner platforms, not just social media mentions This evolution from meme coin to market contender underscores MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growing stature — and positions it as a standout asset with staying power in an otherwise volatile sector. SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE vs. the Rest of the Political Meme Field TRUMP Coin and other political tokens have gained headlines, but many lack consistent volume, stable growth, or trusted mechanics. MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning a different reputation — as a strategic altcoin entry , not a flash-in-the-pan meme. Here’s what makes it stand out: Organic demand that continues to build, with engaged holders and real transaction activity A scarcity-focused supply model, creating urgency among buyers entering before listings Surging relevance in altcoin communities migrating from XRP, SHIBA, and SOL , where traders seek the next fast-moving opportunity CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just benefiting from political hype — it’s outpacing its peers by maintaining consistent upward pressure and capturing attention where it matters . Breakout-Stage Behavior Suggests Next Phase Is Close Technical traders are now spotting accumulation patterns and buy-side volume growth that mirror early breakouts seen in top 2021–2023 tokens. This is no longer a project with just “potential” — it’s becoming one of the most speculatively optimized setups of the year. As listing anticipation builds and market participation increases, many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering its most aggressive phase yet — fueled not by promises, but by real market structure and capital flow . Final Take: MAGACOIN FINANCE Is No Longer Just a Meme — It’s a Momentum Asset This cycle will see many coins pump. But very few will combine timing, traction, and early-stage appeal like MAGACOIN FINANCE is doing right now. It’s gone from being “the next political meme” to being the political meme that’s already delivering traction . For traders looking ahead, it may not just be the biggest meme coin of 2025 — it could be the one that defines the category entirely.

The syndicate was dismantled on May 15, resulting in the arrest of nine men and three women in mainland China and Hong Kong. The suspects allegedly recruited others to open bank accounts to receive proceeds from fraud cases, which were then converted into crypto at crypto exchange shops to launder the illicit funds, Hong Kong Commercial Daily reported on May 17. The criminal organization rented a residential unit in the Hong Kong neighborhood of Mong Kok to plan and carry out its money laundering activities. Of the $15 million laundered, more than $1.2 million was linked to 58 reported fraud cases. Caught in action The bust followed police surveillance on May 15, when two recruits left the syndicate’s Mong Kok base — one visiting a bank, the other an ATM — before both went to convert the cash into crypto at a crypto exchange shop in the neighborhood of Tsim Sha Tsui. Police arrested both individuals on the spot, seizing around HK$770,000 ($98,540) in cash before the funds could be laundered. The other 10 individuals, aged between 20 and 41, were arrested soon after. Police seized approximately HK$1.05 million ($134,370) in cash, over 560 ATM cards, multiple mobile phones, bank documents and records related to crypto transactions. Senior Inspector Tse Ka-lun of Hong Kong’s Commercial Crime Bureau claimed that the individuals often used bank accounts from their friends and family to launder the stolen funds. Hong Kong reported a 12% year-on-year increase in fraud reports in 2024, with authorities making more than 10,000 fraud-related arrests. Of those arrests, around 73% involved individuals who held stooge bank accounts.

Experts Predict Ruvi AI (RUVI) Will Turn a $2,000 Investment into $960,000 in 2025",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-cardano-ada-reach-1-00-experts-predict-ruvi-ai-ruvi-will-turn-a-2000-investment-into-960000-in-2025/,"Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.76 and is on the rise to $1 , a level many believe will make it a major player in the market. This optimism is fueled by bullish patterns like the inverse head-and-shoulders setup and an imminent Cardano ETF approval . While ADA is getting all the attention, another cryptocurrency is rising to the top – Ruvi . With its groundbreaking AI integration and high returns, Ruvi is carving out its own path to change the blockchain space. Cardano’s Journey to $1 Cardano has always been a pioneer, staying ahead of the curve as a trusted blockchain platform through innovation and market movements. Recent highlights of Cardano’s developments include: $0.75 Support Analysts say Cardano is defending a key support zone. A successful consolidation could take ADA to $1 and beyond . Bullish Patterns Breakouts from falling wedge patterns and the inverse head-and-shoulders setup mean ADA is ready to move up. Cardano ETF The upcoming Cardano ETF filed by Grayscale has increased the chances of ADA getting institutional exposure. Bloomberg analysts predict a 75% chance of approval, which will boost demand. With all these happening, it’s clear why Cardano is getting all the hype, but Ruvi is emerging alongside and that’s a whole different level of innovation in crypto. What Makes Ruvi a Game-Changer? Unlike Cardano’s focus on blockchain and smart contracts, Ruvi uses artificial intelligence to solve real world problems across industries. From predictive analytics to cutting edge applications in logistics and finance, Ruvi has more utility and a stronger narrative for future adoption. Why Ruvi Stands Out AI Powered Ruvi integrates advanced AI to provide actionable insights and optimized solutions, it’s more than just a digital currency. Limited Token Supply With only 5 billion tokens in supply, Ruvi’s deflationary model will create scarcity and drive price up over time.3. Real-World Use Ruvi’s application goes beyond traditional crypto trading, for businesses and individuals alike for wider adoption. Where Cardano is improving its technology to stay competitive, Ruvi is changing the way we think about AI cryptocurrency . Ruvi’s Record-Breaking Presale Getting in early on game-changing projects is where the big profits are and Ruvi is proving this true. The project has already completed a successful phase 1 presale, selling over 100 million tokens and raising $1 million . With over 1,000 investors on board, phase 2 is now open, offering tokens at just $0.015 – an entry point for massive returns. How Much Can You Earn with Ruvi? Ruvi’s presale is packed with bonus incentives . Here’s how your money can turn into life-changing returns: Entry-Level ($600) Tokens at $0.015 = 40,000 Bonus Tokens (20%) = 8,000 Total Tokens = 48,000 Value at $1 = $48,000 Mid-Level ($2,000) Tokens at $0.015 = 133,333 Bonus Tokens (60%) = 80,000 Total Tokens = 213,333 Value at $2 = $426,666 High-Level ($12,000) Tokens at $0.015 = 800,000 Bonus Tokens (100%) = 800,000 Total Tokens = 1.6 million Value at $3 = $4.8 million These numbers show how Ruvi’s model can generate huge returns, especially for those who act now. Ruvi AI vs Cardano Cardano’s strength is in its existing market presence and ecosystem upgrades like Ouroboros Leios to improve blockchain. While ADA is getting to $1, Ruvi is focused on AI and multiple use cases for long term growth. Where Cardano consolidates gains through tech innovation, Ruvi is disrupting the norm by adding artificial intelligence to the equation. Don’t Miss Out on Ruvi The cryptocurrency market doesn’t often give us a chance to be an early adopter of a future winner, and Ruvi is one of them. While Cardano’s ETF and $1 are milestones to watch, Ruvi is changing the conversation with its AI applications and deflationary tokenomics.

Powered by advanced algorithms and AI-driven analytics, experts are projecting Mutuum’s price to hit $2.5 shortly after launch, followed by a potential surge to $5 by the end of 2025. Looking even further ahead, many are optimistic that MUTM could reach a massive $25 by 2030, reflecting its utility and growing adoption in the crypto market. At $0.025 per token in Presale Phase 4, Mutuum Finance already has more than 10,000 investors and collected a total of $8.5 million. There are fast moving adopters in this phase with more than 80% of Phase 4 already sold. If you invest in phase 4, your investment will grow by 20% by phase 5 and up to 140% at launch. This is the time to enter. Investors are increasingly eyeing Mutuum Finance as one of the top cryptos to buy now, positioning themselves for the next big wave in decentralized finance. Mutuum Finance Gathers Steam Investor interest in Mutuum Finance is rising fast as its presale gains serious traction. At the current price of $0.025, buyers are positioning themselves for a 20% gain when Phase 5 launches and pushes the token to $0.03. With a planned market launch at $0.06, Phase 4 investors are eyeing a potential 140% ROI. Over $8.5 million has already poured into the project from more than 10,000 backers, and that number continues to grow. The platform diverges a lot from traditional methods since it embraces its buy and distribute strategy. Using this strategy, Mutuum Finance receives the market tokens allocated to stakers, which slowly helps to increase participation as well as improving overall project economics. Besides, a constant flow of incentives is provided in order to encourage ongoing engagement. Leaderboard Rewards System Boosts Engagement The Mutuum Finance platform now has a real-time leaderboard used to showcase the top 50 MUTM holders and community engagement. Keeping their position, gives users additional motivations, thus fuelling the atmosphere of rivalry as well as loyalty which increases the overall community involvement. Security continues to be a vital objective among the team behind Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance has tapped in blockchain security pioneer CertiK to carry out a comprehensive audit of the smart contracts. After the audit is complete, it will be possible to see on Mutuum’s social networks all results, providing the users to see for themselves the safety and credibility of their investments. MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance is also gamifying the user interface with a leaderboard of the top 50 holders of tokens, who are to be rewarded with additional MUTM tokens. On top of that, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on, with ten winners selected to each receive $10,000 in tokens. There is also a referral program running, which rewards users for helping to grow the platform through organic, grassroots outreach. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining attention as one of the most promising DeFi projects, and predictions for its price trajectory are creating serious buzz. AI-driven analytics forecast that Mutuum Finance could hit $2.5 shortly after launch, reach $5 by the end of 2025, and potentially surge to $25 by 2030. As Phase 4 is 80% sold out, the opportunity to buy in at $0.025 is slipping away. Investors who secure tokens now will enjoy a 20% price increase in Phase 5 and a potential 140% ROI at launch. Act fast, Phase 4 is almost gone, and this opportunity may not come again. Secure your position today before the price climbs.

While Stellar eyes a potential 126% breakout and Ethereum wrestles with inflation and slowing activity, Unstaked ($UNSD) is focused on performance over promises. Currently in Presale Stage 12, $UNSD is priced at $0.008997 with a projected launch price of $0.1819. That positions early participants for a potential 28x upside, grounded in an ecosystem that rewards measurable engagement, not speculation. Unstaked allows users to deploy AI agents that grow communities across X and Telegram, with every action recorded on-chain. Its $1 million campaign is also live, awarding 20 winners with $50,000 each for task completion, referrals, and a $100 purchase. With $2 million raised in 48 hours and no VC involvement, Unstaked is proving that real utility can still lead the conversation. Stellar Eyes $0.68 Breakout, But Volume Will Decide the Move Stellar (XLM) is gaining attention as it forms a promising bull flag alongside an inverse head and shoulders pattern. If confirmed, this structure targets a move to $0.681, a potential 126% increase from current levels. Analysts are watching for a breakout above $0.3021 with strong support zones between $0.25 and $0.26 offering a solid base. Momentum indicators add weight to the setup. The RSI is rising at 64 without signaling overbought territory, and MACD shows early signs of a bullish crossover. Still, Stellar has faced similar patterns in the past, and without consistent volume, timing becomes everything. Unlike Unstaked, the window here may not stay open long. Ethereum Faces Growth Pressure Despite 33% Rebound Ethereum (ETH) may have rebounded 33% this week, but its long-term strength is under scrutiny. The total ETH supply has reached a record 120.07 million, reversing the network’s deflationary trend. The Dencun upgrade reduced gas fees but also slashed the burn rate, raising new concerns about inflation. At the same time, on-chain activity is slowing as users shift to Layer 2 networks. Staked ETH has dropped from 35 million to 34.04 million, while ETF holdings have fallen by 400,000 ETH since February. As Unstaked introduces a reward-based AI utility, Ethereum’s broad narrative feels less aligned with high-growth potential. Unstaked Raised Over $6M in Presale Without VC or Hype Unstaked is not fueled by hype, it is built on verifiable action. At the heart of its system is the $UNSD token, which earns rewards only when deployed AI agents deliver real engagement across platforms like X and Telegram. These agents are not bots running on scripts. They interact, post, respond, and evolve. Every action is recorded on-chain, tying value to transparent output rather than passive holding. In just 48 hours, Unstaked raised more than $2 million, and total presale funding has now exceeded $6 million. That growth came without private allocations, seed deals, or VC padding. Every participant entered on equal terms. At a current Stage 12 price of $0.008997 and a fixed launch price of $0.1819, the potential upside sits at over 2,000% for early buyers. Adding to its momentum is the $1 million competition. This campaign will reward 20 participants with $50,000 in $UNSD each, but access is earned, not gifted. Users must refer others, complete engagement tasks, and purchase at least $100 worth of tokens to qualify. The structure promotes meaningful growth rather than empty exposure. With $20 million committed to launch liquidity, Unstaked is not offering vague promises. It is delivering a fully operational framework that aligns community action with measurable results. This is not a future vision. It is already working. Quick Recap Stellar has a strong technical setup and Ethereum continues to anchor the ecosystem, but both lack the early-stage advantage and performance-linked mechanics that Unstaked brings to the table. Their roles are established, while Unstaked is still expanding, giving it room to grow where others have already matured. With a $0.008997 entry price, over $6 million raised, up to a 28x upside window, and a $1 million giveaway in motion, Unstaked is more than a promising presale. It is proving to be one of the top crypto coins to buy in 2025 and possibly the most strategic early entry available right now.

Notably, the flagship cryptocurrency has seen a market cool-off in the past two weeks following a 10.7% price leap in early May. Interesting, a crypto analyst with X handle TATrader_Alan, popularly known as Trader Alan, has highlighted a bullish pattern that points to a price target around $115,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Strengthens Vs. Gold, Analyst Sees ‘Higher Than Expected’ Returns Bitcoin Climbs With Precision: $115,000 May Be The Next Stop Amidst an extended crypto market correction in 2025, Bitcoin prices crashed from $109,000 in January to less than $75,000 in mid-April. Since hitting the local bottom at $74,600, the premier cryptocurrency has recorded an impressive market rebound, rising by over 39.1% in the past month to hit a local peak of $105,800. In an X post on May 16, Trader Alan provided an interesting technical insight into this uptrend, highlighting that Bitcoin has repeatedly produced the same leap in dollar value, separated by a period of consolidation. The trading chart from the analyst explains that when Bitcoin surges approximately $10,000, it enters a 7-10 period of sideways consolidation before resuming its ascent. This bullish behaviour has been repeatedly seen with Bitcoin’s leap from $75,000 to $85,000, then to $95,000, and $105,000. Going by this pattern, the crypto market leader is tipped to hit the $115,000 target following a potential breakout from its current price consolidation. If this projection realizes, Bitcoin would achieve a 10.57% gain from current prices, breaking into a new price discovery. This kind of price movement is characteristic of a strong uptrend marked by healthy pauses. The consolidations typically allow the market to cool off after sharp runs, allowing traders to accumulate in preparation for the next leg higher. Importantly, these consolidation zones often act as new support levels, strengthening the bull market structure.

On May 15, the largest Bitcoin holders acquired an additional 2,180 BTC valued at $226,750,000, signaling a strong market confidence. Generally, large accumulations by Bitcoin whales are a typical bullish signal, especially amidst the current uptrend, signalling a strong potential for future price appreciation in line with Trader Alan’s prediction. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $103,281 following a 0.90% decline in the last day. In tandem, the asset’s trading volume is down by 15.76%, suggesting a decline in market interest.

In a sea of hype and speculation, CertiK-audited projects with actual products and traction stand out. As the calendar counts down to June 13, BlockDAG is stealing the spotlight with a massive reveal that could reshape its trajectory and investor portfolios. Here’s a curated list of the top 5 CertiK-audited crypto projects to keep on your radar right now, ranked based on momentum, utility, audit strength, and real-world activity. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) BlockDAG is hands-down the most talked-about crypto with real utility in 2025 right now. The hype is real and backed by numbers. With $253 million raised in presale funding, over 20.6 billion coins sold, and a staggering 2,520% ROI since batch 1, BlockDAG is charging into the market with unmatched momentum. It’s currently in batch 28, and the presale price is frozen at $0.0020 until June 13. But what makes BlockDAG more than just another coin is the delivery of real hardware. Miner shipments have begun, with delivery proof videos to be released soon. This isn’t a concept on a roadmap, it’s a functioning network that is putting hardware into users’ hands today. June 13 is when the big picture comes into full view. The GO LIVE reveal will unveil all 20 exchange listings, an upgrade from the original 10 promised in Keynote 1. Five exchanges, MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart, have already been confirmed. The remaining 15 top-tier listings will be announced during the event. Until then, the limited-time $0.0020 entry point is creating serious FOMO among early investors. Community engagement is spiking thanks to a growing referral program and heated Buyer Battles. BlockDAG is not just building hype, it’s rewarding participation and delivering results. For anyone searching for crypto with real utility in 2025, BlockDAG is the one to watch before the June 13 reveal. 2. Injective (INJ) Injective has consistently delivered strong DeFi infrastructure and maintains a clean track record with its CertiK audit. Its permissionless smart contract environment is tailored for decentralized finance applications, giving developers flexibility without sacrificing security. The native INJ token plays a central role in protocol governance and value capture, adding to its long-term appeal. Unlike many DeFi projects that are still in experimental phases, Injective has real adoption and product depth. It’s not just about the token price, this is a project with user-facing value. For investors looking at crypto with real utility in 2025, Injective sits comfortably on the shortlist. 3. Sui (SUI) Sui is built for speed. Backed by Mysten Labs and boasting one of the fastest transaction finality rates among Layer 1 chains, Sui is tailored for developers needing real-time responsiveness and low fees. Its infrastructure is CertiK-audited, and the ecosystem has steadily expanded to support tools, gaming, and smart contracts. While its price has seen fluctuations, the core technology is solid and increasingly attracting developer attention. With the narrative of scalable infrastructure gaining traction, Sui has carved a niche for itself as a crypto with real utility 2025 worth monitoring. 4. Kava (KAVA) Kava has been building steadily, integrating both Cosmos and Ethereum co-chains into its Layer-1 design. This dual support makes it compatible with a wide range of applications and tokens. Kava’s CertiK audit validates its security posture, and it’s already seeing traction in DeFi circles thanks to lending and yield farming products. Kava may not be the flashiest token on the market, but its slow and steady growth, coupled with a firm audit record, makes it a smart entry in the crypto with real utility 2025 category. 5. Aptos (APT) Aptos came in strong with backing from big names and a strong development team, and it passed CertiK’s rigorous auditing process. The network is known for its parallel execution model, offering high throughput potential. However, Aptos is still wrestling with adoption issues. Despite the technical horsepower, the ecosystem hasn’t grown at the pace investors expected. Still, with its secure foundation and development potential, Aptos remains a watch-worthy project. For those looking at early-stage upside within the crypto with real utility 2025 theme, Aptos could pay off if its user base grows. Final Take As the market sharpens its focus on tokens that offer more than promises, crypto with real utility in 2025 is the defining filter investors are applying. Projects with working products, security audits, and user growth are outperforming the rest. BlockDAG isn’t just checking the boxes, it’s rewriting the playbook with its June 13 GO LIVE event, real hardware deployments, and massive presale traction. If you’re not watching it now, you’re already behind.

While these assets still dominate headlines, investor behavior is shifting beneath the surface. The new beneficiary of that shift? MAGACOIN FINANCE — a smaller altcoin project that’s gaining serious momentum thanks to its community-first approach and powerful early-stage performance. Though not yet on major exchanges, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already attracting attention for one clear reason: ROI potential far above the market average . CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT XRP and Solana Remain Prominent — But Momentum Appears to Be Fading XRP entered 2025 buoyed by renewed optimism tied to regulatory developments, yet its growth trajectory has since moderated. Similarly, Solana (SOL), despite its robust ecosystem and consistent development pace, is beginning to show signs of liquidity fatigue — with much of the earlier upside already realized. In response, investors are recalibrating their strategies, seeking out early-stage assets that offer stronger entry points and more room to run. MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as one such opportunity — still in its early phase, attractively priced, and yet to reach broader market exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Lean Altcoin With Outsized Return Potential In contrast to major projects deploying extensive marketing budgets, MAGACOIN FINANCE has delivered notable performance with limited resources. On key campaign days when all elements align, its return per dollar spent has exceeded that of high-profile pre-sales — a rare achievement in a market often characterized by high funding and underwhelming delivery. This efficiency, combined with its grassroots-driven growth and strategic positioning, is reshaping investor perception. Rather than a fleeting hype cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as a calculated entry point with asymmetric upside — making it an increasingly attractive option in the current altcoin landscape. THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW Why Investors Are Turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE Before Listings MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early stages — and that’s exactly why many investors are beginning to reposition now. Key reasons for the shift include: Listing price set at $0.007 , with current prices offering steep discounts A clear multi-phase presale structure that allows for progressive growth Cultural relevance and narrative strength not often seen in early-stage coins Strong early results without institutional backing — proving organic demand As investors look to diversify away from saturated assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the rare combination of timing, narrative, and price flexibility . Final Thoughts In a market where many top coins are entering consolidation phases, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still expanding — with new holders joining daily, momentum accelerating, and investor sentiment steadily rising. For those watching the market closely, the story is clear : 2025 may not belong to yesterday’s leaders. It may belong to the smart entries being made today.

One standout altcoin, Mutuum Finance is drawing serious attention as a Solana alternative with DeFi functionality and long-term growth baked into its roadmap. Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Phase 4 which is over 80% sold out, already raking in over $8.5 million with over 10,000 investors participating. Investors have less time before this phase concludes. With a public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 4 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 140% by the time the token hits exchanges. This project is emerging as one of the best cryptos to invest in today, with market sentiment turning bullish and blockchain innovation accelerating. Analysts and early adopters alike are eyeing a potential surge to $5 by 2026, a move that could rival some of the top crypto gains of previous cycles. That altcoin is Mutuum Finance, a rising star that’s quickly becoming a top contender in the decentralized finance arena. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself through its innovative dual-lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, users can freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools where interest rates adjust dynamically. The P2P model, by contrast, removes intermediaries, giving users full control over their lending agreements. This combination creates a flexible and efficient lending system, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a strong coin for those considering what crypto to invest in or looking for the best crypto to invest in within the changing DeFi market. Security and transparency are built into the core of the project.

UNI token dropped below $6 on Sunday, down from this month’s high of $7.5500. It has also tumbled by over 70% from its highest point in December despite some notable tailwinds. This article explores whether the UNI price has more upside to go. Uniswap has numerous tailwinds Uniswap, the biggest player in the decentralized exchange industry, faces some notable tailwinds that may benefit the UNI token in the future. First, despite strong competition from other decentralized exchanges, it still maintains its robust market share. A good example of this is what happened in the last 30 days when it processed transactions worth over $64 billion , a bigger number compared to its top peers. PancakeSwap handled transactions worth $51.1 billion, while Raydium and Meteora processed $26 billion and $17.8 billion, respectively. This growth is likely because Uniswap exists in more chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, and Avalanche. Second, Uniswap launched Unichain earlier this year, a process that has become highly successful. Unichain is a layer-2 network that aims to be a market leader in the industry. A few months after launch, it has already attracted over 20 developers, and more are on the way. DEX networks in the Unichain project have continued to attract users and volume. For example, Unichain handled over $318 million in the last 24 hours, making it the seventh-biggest player in the industry. It has handled $3.5 billion in the last seven days, a 18% increase from the previous week. Also, Unichain has cumulatively handled over $10 billion since inception. These numbers mean that Unichain has already overtaken some of the oldest and most popular chains in the crypto industry. For example, it has handled more transactions than Cardano, whose cumulative volume is $4.93 billion. It is also beating some popular chains like Tron, Avalanche, and Polygon. The other top Uniswap tailwind is that the network is making a lot of money as volume in the network jump. Data shows that Uniswap has become the second most profitable player in decentralized finance this year. It has made $357 million so far this year, beating other top players in DeFi like Lido, AAVE, and PancakeSwap. Uniswap price analysis UNI price chart | Source: TradingView The 3-day chart shows that the UNI price peaked at $19.42 in November and then retreated to the current $5.7. Its recent attempt to rebound found substantial resistance at the 50-day moving average at $7.54. The coin remains above the important support at $4.6763, the lowest swing on August 1 last year. It is also higher than the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since June last year. Therefore, UNI price will likely remain under pressure for a while and then bounce back once the crypto bull run resumes. Such a move will push it to the next resistance level at $15. A drop below the ascending trendline will invalidate the bullish outlook.

While ADA cools off after a 3% drop, trader sentiment is still looking up, with on-chain signals hinting at a rebound. Meanwhile, the latest Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis shows bullish pressure building fast, with top analysts calling for a $20 breakout as trading volume surges and resistance thins. But there’s another crypto quietly building momentum, one that analysts say could become the best long term crypto pick of 2025. Web3 ai is not just another AI token. Its tools are already live, offering real-time trading signals, portfolio optimization, and price predictions. The $WAI token isn’t hype, it’s utility in action. With more than $3 million raised and predictions soaring past $1, analysts believe Web3 ai is on track to become a blue-chip AI asset in the top 50 cryptos. Web3 ai Targets $1: Analysts Say It’s Just Getting Started Web3 ai is building an AI-powered ecosystem focused on real-time tools for crypto traders. From trade signals to portfolio optimization and price predictions, it’s all designed to run through one interface backed by powerful machine learning. While some platforms are still working on what to build, Web3 ai already has its blueprint, and analysts say that’s why $WAI is catching serious attention. Currently in its presale phase, Web3 ai has 50 total stages, with the token priced at just $0.000365 right now. By the final stage, that price climbs to $0.003267, and then hits $0.005242 when it lists. That’s a projected ROI of 1747%, a number that’s making traders reconsider their picks for the best long term crypto to hold in 2025. What makes this run-up more compelling is that Web3 ai’s value doesn’t just come from hype. The tools it’s building are rooted in real use cases: smarter trading, better portfolio moves, and cleaner exits and entries. This isn’t a general-purpose AI coin, it’s targeted, and it’s built for people who want an edge. With crypto narratives shifting toward utility and AI-driven innovation, $WAI is being called a future blue-chip. Analysts predict it could break $1 after listing and secure a spot among the top 50 tokens. For those hunting the best long term crypto, Web3 ai is turning into the one to watch. Bullish Momentum Builds: Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Points to $20 Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis shows the token pushing toward a breakout, with analysts like Michaël van de Poppe eyeing $20 as the next big target. LINK is already trading above $14.70, and the momentum is picking up fast. Daily RSI is near 62, trading volume is up 15%, and on-chain activity has jumped 12% in a week, these are the kind of signals that often trigger fast upward moves. LINK is also benefiting from positive sentiment in traditional markets. As the Nasdaq posts gains, crypto assets like LINK are seeing renewed interest. A key level to watch is $16.50, breaking it could trigger a run straight to $20. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis is now closely tied to rising institutional interest in DeFi infrastructure, and that’s where LINK continues to play a central role. Trader Sentiment Rises Despite Cardano (ADA) Decline The Cardano (ADA) decline of 3% over the last 24 hours reflects a short-term pullback, but trader confidence hasn’t disappeared. On-chain metrics show that most holders are sitting at a loss, and that usually reduces sell pressure. Sentiment data from Santiment puts ADA’s weighted score at 1.33, still on an upward trend, suggesting optimism is quietly building. Technical charts show ADA stuck between $0.76 and $0.84, with resistance holding strong for now. But if sentiment keeps climbing and selling stays low, ADA could break past $0.84 and test $0.92. The Cardano (ADA) decline might just be a setup for a reversal, especially with buyers showing interest again around support levels. Traders watching for medium-term moves are keeping ADA on the radar. Why Web3 ai Could Be the Best Long Term Crypto Pick The Cardano (ADA) decline hasn’t shaken trader confidence, with positive sentiment and reduced sell pressure hinting at a bounce from the $0.76 support. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis points to a run toward $20, as volume rises and momentum builds above key resistance levels. But the real story may be unfolding in Web3 ai’s presale. With $WAI currently priced at $0.000365 and projected to hit $0.005242 at listing, the potential 1747% ROI is turning heads. Its AI-driven tools will have the power to shape smarter trades, forecasts, and portfolio optimization. Analysts say Web3 ai could soon be viewed as a best long term crypto and expect $WAI to break $1 and land in the top 50 market cap rankings. In a cycle filled with noise, this looks like one of the few tokens with real utility and breakout potential.

As ETH and XRP face mounting resistance and regulatory delays, attention is rapidly shifting toward a rising opportunity that is already dominating the altcoin conversation: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Ethereum Faces ETF Drag Despite Upgrade Momentum Ethereum recently surged over 43% in early May , powered by the Pectra upgrade and renewed on-chain activity. However, that momentum has begun to stall. Despite institutional optimism, ETF outflows and regulatory hesitation are holding back a sustained move past the $2,600–$2,740 resistance zone. Even with support from the “Trillion Dollar Security Initiative” and AI network integrations, many analysts believe Ethereum needs in-kind ETF creation and staking approval before it can retest the $4,000–$5,000 range. Until then, Ethereum holders may face diminishing returns amid increased volatility and slower growth. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW XRP’s Legal Victory Fuels Hype — But Is It Priced In? XRP soared to $2.65 this month after Ripple finalized a long-awaited SEC settlement, unlocking funds and clearing legal hurdles. The approval of XRP futures-based ETFs and a likely spot ETF decision in June have made headlines — and rightly so. Yet analysts warn that much of the bullish news may already be priced in. With short-term targets around $2.85–$3.40 , many investors believe XRP’s biggest gains may be behind it for now, especially given overbought indicators and slowing network activity. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Talk Among Smart Money While ETH and XRP consolidate, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as the breakout altcoin attracting serious capital. Within minutes of launching, MAGACOIN FINANCE saw instant traction — with early buyers jumping in amid growing excitement over its decentralized, no-middlemen structure . Its momentum has only intensified since, with MAGACOIN FINANCE being described by insiders as a pure financial freedom asset — no banks, no institutions, just ownership and opportunity. Why Investors Are Positioning in MAGACOIN FINANCE Ahead of Exchange Listings As Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) navigate technical hurdles and ETF-related stagnation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a compelling alternative — offering the kind of early-stage growth potential no longer available in these established assets. Analysts monitoring on-chain activity have noted an uptick in large wallet accumulation, signaling growing confidence in the project’s ROI prospects before it debuts on major exchanges. With no institutional overhead and a community-driven framework, MAGACOIN FINANCE is resonating with experienced altcoin investors who are targeting the market’s next breakout performer. The project’s early traction was unmistakable — with significant capital inflows from its inception, it has quickly solidified itself as a strategic entry for growth-focused traders. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST What’s Fueling the Market Rotation Ethereum and XRP continue to encounter resistance and overbought technical signals Institutional participation in ETH ETFs remains underwhelming, limiting near-term upside XRP’s ETF-driven momentum appears increasingly priced in MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a clean slate — early, agile, and powered by a rapidly growing community High-volume wallet activity is accelerating, pointing to coordinated accumulation As market participants scan for stronger ROI setups, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping in to meet that demand — offering a timely, high-upside entry while legacy coins fight for incremental movement.

In particular, GateToken is gaining traction as part of its growing exchange ecosystem, and Bitget Token continues to expand globally with notable liquidity milestones. But amid these developments, one name is increasingly surfacing in serious crypto conversations— Qubetics ($TICS). More than just another token, Qubetics offers infrastructure-level innovation that solves a real bottleneck in today’s digital asset environment: cross-border transactions across multiple blockchains. Paired with a structured presale nearing $18 million raised, Qubetics is now making a case for itself as the best crypto to get rich—not just by hype, but by utility, traction, and math. Qubetics Bridges Chains and Economies with Real-World Applications Most token projects position themselves as “solutions,” but few offer tangible pathways to actually replace or improve broken legacy systems. Qubetics does exactly that through its robust cross-border transaction architecture. It’s designed as a Web3 aggregator—the first of its kind—that allows assets, contracts, and users to move across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, and beyond, in real time and without centralized bottlenecks. Imagine a logistics company in Mexico paying suppliers in India and freelancers in Germany—all with digital assets. Using Qubetics, they can streamline multi-chain payments, reduce costs, and eliminate the need for third-party conversions or bridge risks. Likewise, a decentralized payroll startup in Canada can manage on-chain salaries across Solana and Avalanche in one unified dashboard—courtesy of the Qubetics backend. This multi-chain orchestration is where Qubetics separates itself. It doesn’t just theorize interoperability—it builds it. For users searching for the best crypto to get rich, the practical value of being positioned early in a project that solves a core Web3 hurdle is difficult to ignore. Qubetics Presale Nears $18M—Is It the Best Crypto to Get Rich at Entry Level? The Qubetics presale is currently in Stage 34, priced at $0.2532 per $TICS token. Over 512 million tokens have already been sold, with more than 26,500 participants onboarded. What’s turning heads is the precision in timing—each stage lasts only 7 days, and every Sunday at midnight, the token price increases by 10%. This isn’t randomness—it’s a formula designed to reward early entries and reflect real-time demand. At the current stage, a $100 allocation yields approximately 394.82 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits $1 after the presale, that turns into a 294.84% return. If it reaches $5, the ROI becomes 1,874.21%. At $10, the value climbs to 3,848.42%, and a future price of $15 after the Q2 2025 mainnet launch could result in a 5,822.63% ROI, or $5,922.30 from a $100 entry. Such math explains why the Qubetics presale is being viewed not just as a strong early-stage project, but as one of the best crypto pre sale opportunities on the market. The utility, structure, and velocity of funding all reinforce its status as a serious contender for those seeking the best crypto to get rich —especially with the mainnet just months away. Bitget Token Expands Global Footprint Amid Growing Futures Volume Bitget Token (BGB), the native utility token of the Bitget exchange, has made significant strides this year. According to recent announcements and platform updates, Bitget has expanded its user base to over 25 million globally, with its derivatives trading volume consistently ranking in the top five across all exchanges. BGB plays a central role in Bitget’s growing ecosystem. It offers fee discounts, staking opportunities, and priority access to new token listings and launchpad events. More recently, the exchange has also expanded its Launchpool offerings, which has driven higher demand for BGB tokens in liquidity farming activities. However, BGB remains closely tied to the growth and performance of the Bitget exchange itself. While that’s not inherently negative, it means token upside is dependent on exchange volume and product rollouts. For those seeking exposure to high-volume platforms, BGB offers solid short-term positioning. But for those scanning the horizon for the best crypto to get rich, its reliance on centralized infrastructure could cap its ceiling compared to infrastructure-level plays like Qubetics. GateToken Gains Utility as Ecosystem Activity Ramps Up GateToken (GT), the native asset of Gate.io, has also gained renewed attention as the platform accelerates product launches and ecosystem initiatives. Over the past six months, Gate.io has introduced several high-yield structured products and upgraded its smart contract insurance layer—each one reinforcing GT’s functional relevance. Users holding GT now gain access to lower trading fees, early participation in startup projects, and yield enhancements on staking programs within the Gate ecosystem. Notably, the Gate Grants Program has channeled over $10 million into early-stage blockchain development, driving GT adoption among new builders. Despite this growing utility, GT still trades below its 2021 highs and faces heavy competition from other exchange-based tokens. Its upside is respectable but limited to exchange growth and ecosystem retention. While it may appeal to short-term market participants, it lacks the explosive ROI structure that Qubetics offers through its presale and real-world application. For community members hunting for the best crypto to get rich, GT appears more of a supporting role than a breakout lead. Conclusion: What’s the Best Crypto to Get Rich in This Cycle? Bitget Token is expanding reach, and GateToken is layering in new utility at the exchange level. Both play important roles within their ecosystems and could see consistent upward movement tied to platform adoption. But when it comes to structured opportunity, real-world utility, and long-term scalability, Qubetics is delivering at every level. Its cross-border transaction application, Web3 aggregator status, and precise 10% weekly price model in the presale—backed by $17M+ already raised—create a compelling financial and technological case. With the Qubetics presale still active, and its Q2 2025 mainnet launch on the horizon, early participants are positioning themselves at what could be the ground floor of the best crypto presale this year. For those asking what’s the best crypto to get rich without relying on hype or market noise, Qubetics is standing tall—fully built, fully funded, and just getting started.

Qubetics is emerging as the best crypto to get rich due to its cross-chain application, structured ROI model, and presale growth momentum. How does the Qubetics presale work? Each stage lasts 7 days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday. The current price is $0.2532, with over 512M tokens sold and $17M+ raised. Are exchange tokens like Bitget and GateToken still worth holding? Yes, they offer steady growth tied to platform success. But they may lack the explosive potential of infrastructure-based projects like Qubetics.

Mutuum Finance Phase 4 presale which is over 80% sold, is currently offering tokens at $0.025, with strong investor support driving the acquisition by over 10,000 buyers, raising a total of $8.5 million. Investors participating in this phase stand to earn a 140% profit when the token reaches $0.06 at its exchange launch. As the market heats up again, traders are wondering which crypto to buy today for short-term gains, and more importantly, which could be the next to hit $1. Dogecoin, with its loyal fanbase, still dominates headlines, but Mutuum’s utility-driven model could give it the edge in the 2025 bull run. Mutuum Finance may get there first. Dogecoin’s Road to $1: Hype or Real Possibility? Dogecoin began as a joke, but its journey has been anything but funny. With the backing of an enthusiastic internet community, Dogecoin has surprised everyone and stayed one of the top cryptocurrencies even without a clear use case. Its price surges are usually fueled more by social sentiment than utility, so it’s a volatile but fascinating short-term trading vehicle. Even though meme culture continues to fuel crypto investment, others remain convinced that Dogecoin has a shot at the elusive $1 price target. But in an ecosystem that is increasingly obsessed with utility and DeFi advancements, newer players like Mutuum Finance offer a more pragmatic path to long-term appreciation. Mutuum Finance Presale The investor support for Mutuum Finance Phase 4 presale continues to grow steadily throughout its development cycle. Buyers are investing in the platform due to its sustainable DeFi solution, which is built on a more robust development scale than typical meme coin volatility. So far, the presale has collected more than $8.5 million from investors while gathering over 10,000 token holders, an early sign that it could be one of the best crypto projects to watch as momentum builds. Early participants find Phase 4 tokens highly appealing because they are available at $0.025 during the ongoing phase. The platform launch will raise token prices to $0.06 at launch thereby delivering a 140% profit to Phase 4 investors. Analysts anticipate MUTM will achieve a post-listing price of $2.50 which would significantly enhance its market value. Investors can anticipate a price enhancement to $0.03 in phase 5 which indicates future price growth for MUTM. A recently unveiled dashboard of Mutuum Finance presents a leaderboard ranking of token holders where top 50 holders who stay in their position earn bonus tokens to boost long-term investor interest. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Dual-Model System Mutuum has a special dual-lending system. It combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) methods. This offers maximum flexibility. P2C System: Smart contracts through P2C System regulate lending pools by modifying interest rates according to market trends which provides lenders with financial stability while securing loans for borrowers. P2P System: This decentralized system removes middlemen. It creates direct links between lenders and borrowers. This gives both borrowers and lenders full control over the process. Dogecoin may still win headlines through hype and celebrity endorsements, but smart capital is flowing into platforms delivering real innovation. Mutuum Finance has already attracted over 10,000 investors and secured $8.5 million during its presale, which is now over 80% sold out. The current price of $0.025 won’t last long, Phase 5 will bump it to $0.03, and launch is set at $0.06, offering a 140% return as it hits the open market.

Solana (SOL) continues to scale. Yet amid these large-cap movements, one emerging project is capturing sustained attention from seasoned market participants: MAGACOINFINANCE . As traders increasingly pursue early-stage entries with higher return potential, MAGACOINFINANCE remains at the forefront of the 2025 altcoin landscape . While ETH and SOL remain fundamentally sound, the data signals a clear trend — strategic capital is flowing toward MAGACOINFINANCE for its asymmetric reward profile and high-growth positioning. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Ethereum’s Recovery Is Not Without Limits Following a challenging start to the year, Ethereum is beginning to show signs of renewed strength. Growth in Layer 2 ecosystems and renewed focus on scalability, particularly from Vitalik Buterin’s latest proposals, have bolstered investor confidence. However, despite these developments, ETH’s price trajectory remains relatively constrained — influenced by its large market capitalization and mature valuation. In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE delivers what Ethereum currently cannot: meaningful upside potential. With a defined listing target and significant spread between current levels and projected highs, it is being positioned by traders as a rare-cycle opportunity that offers outsized return potential in a market that rewards timing and bold entry decisions. Solana Pushes Forward — But the Big Speculative Bets Are Still on MAGACOIN FINANCE Solana’s user base continues to climb, and DEX volume shows impressive strength. It is arguably the most efficient L1 on the market today. Still, the breakout potential is viewed as steady rather than exponential. That is where MAGACOIN FINANCE draws its strength — not from slow-and-steady adoption, but from being a high-momentum coin built for this exact kind of cycle . In a year where precision timing matters more than ever, it is no surprise that buyers are prioritizing entries that offer the clearest path to a 25x or 35x outcome — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is at the top of that list. MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Lead the 2025 Altcoin Rally Analysts reviewing altcoin trends across Q2 are already flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the few tokens that continues to build traction despite fierce competition. The reason? Its structure is intentionally designed to reward early positioning — and the market is responding. With limited supply access, clear ROI targets, and widespread visibility across trading circles, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to deliver the kind of setup that seasoned market watchers seek when the altcoin window opens . Its presence isn’t just about hype. It’s about precision timing, calculated entries, and a clear narrative heading toward listings — the same combination that has defined previous altcoin leaders. Final Take: Confidence Remains High While Ethereum and Solana deserve their recent gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in its own lane — and that’s exactly where many traders want to be. The confidence is not accidental. It is a reflection of the metrics, the mechanics, and the message behind MAGACOIN FINANCE. This is not a coin hoping to catch a wave. This is a project built to lead one . To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, please visit: Website: https://magacoinfinance.com Twitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance.

Although a short-term volatility is currently playing out, the long-term outlook is undoubtedly bullish. Related Reading: Analysis: Crypto Heats Up As $35 Billion Enters Market In Under A Month Some analysts are looking to long-term cycle indicators for direction. One such tool, the Golden Ratio Multiplier, which called the Bitcoin top in 2021, has resurfaced with another interesting top for the current Bitcoin cycle. Golden Ratio Multiplier Identified 2021 Top, Now Points To New Peak Taking to a post on social media platform X, popular crypto analyst CryptoCon highlighted the reliability of the Golden Ratio Multiplier in predicting Bitcoin’s price top in each cycle. The Golden Ratio Multiplier is a logarithmic model that incorporates Fibonacci-derived multipliers to anticipate Bitcoin’s macro trends. Notably, this metric was among the few to accurately call the April 2021 cycle top in real time, the same as the 2017 and 2013 price tops. This cycle, the model has already flagged a significant peak in March 2024, although the crypto analyst interpreted this not as the final high but as a mid-top. CryptoCon explained that Bitcoin’s price action has already hit Level 4 of the multiplier chart this cycle, but this isn’t the final peak. “We’ve already hit our cycle top level this cycle once, but this was for the cycle mid-top in March 2024, which means we’re bound to do it again,” he wrote. The Level 5 band now sits around $160,000 and continues to trend upward. Drawing a parallel to past cycles, CryptoCon noted that the structure of the current cycle shows strong similarities to the 2015 to 2017 period, when Bitcoin saw a gradual build-up followed by an explosive breakout. Based on this comparison, the current market phase is seen as equivalent to April 2017, right before Bitcoin went on a rally in the months that followed. Golden Multiplier Ratio Suggests $160k Is Next Major Target The chart accompanying CryptoCon’s post paints a familiar picture with the Golden Multiplier Ratio. Each band, ranging from Level 1 to Level 10, is based on a multiplier level derived from the 350-day moving average. Bitcoin has topped at various levels: Level 10 in 2011, Level 9 and 8 in 2013, Level 7 in 2017, and Level 6 in 2021. The current cycle’s peak should most likely be Level 5, but the Bitcoin price is yet to get there. Related Reading: ‘Judgment Day Is Coming’—XRP Set To Explode, Analyst Warns Should the market continue to respect this structure, Bitcoin could be preparing for a rally toward the Level 5 mark of $160,000 sometime later in the year, which could mark the final high of this cycle. The current range around $103,000 may well be the calm before the final breakout. “Slower buildup, then all at once,” the analyst said. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $102,971.

At its current price point, many are wondering whether this rising DeFi crypto has the potential to hit $5. With its innovative approach to decentralized finance and increasing adoption in the altcoin market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be on the brink of explosive growth. The project has reached Phase 4 of its presale surpassing $8.5 million in funding, backed by more than 10,000 investors. Currently priced at $0.025, MUTM will enjoy a 20% increase in the next Phase 5, reaching $0.03. Investors have already bought over 80% of Phase 4, meaning you have less time before it concludes. As MUTM continues to build momentum, it might not be long before it joins the ranks of the most talked-about projects, as investors eye it as a long-term investment in the crypto ecosystem. Mutuum Finance: Rising Star of DeFi Innovation Mutuum Finance is soon going to become a trendsetter in the field of decentralized finance (DeFi) with its path-breaking double-lending platform. By bringing Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models in an innovative manner uniquely, the platform has already caught a lot of attention. Already, over 10,000 investors have put in presale more than $8.5 million, depicting the very high confidence and appeal of the project. With the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token price of $0.025 during Phase 4, there should be a 20% appreciation in price when the platform enters Phase 5, with an early opportunity for meaningful profit prior to reaching the projected market listing price of $0.06. For those searching for the next crypto to explode, MUTM presents a strong case as a project with high upside potential. Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Lending Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) technological edge is its hybrid lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model permits users to make passive income by loaning the USDT to liquidity pools operated through the use of smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model on the other hand removes the middleman. It allows users to lend and borrow directly. This gives them more control and privacy. By combining these two systems, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as one of the best cryptos to invest in today. It offers decentralization, security, and efficiency. Gamified Ecosystem and Community Incentives Mutuum Finance is also gamifying the user interface with a leaderboard of the top 50 holders of tokens, who are to be rewarded with additional MUTM tokens. On top of that, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on, with ten winners selected to each receive $10,000 in tokens. There is also a referral program running, which rewards users for helping to grow the platform through organic, grassroots outreach. Mutuum Finance isn’t just another presale token, it’s shaping up to be a DeFi powerhouse as investors rush to secure positions before Phase 4 fully sells out. Over $8.5 million raised and 10,000+ backers signal growing market trust in MUTM’s vision. Early adopters buying at $0.025 could see a 140% return by launch and potentially a 20,000% surge if the $5 target by 2025 is reached, as some analysts predict. Momentum is accelerating fast, and presale slots are disappearing by the hour. Once Phase 4 ends, this price is gone for good, don’t wait until headlines announce the $1 breakout. Lock in your position now or risk watching others 10x while you’re stuck on the sidelines.

Dogecoin and Cardano are both making strides, one through price structure, the other via ecosystem investment, but it’s BlockDAG that’s capturing wider attention in early-stage strategies. With nearly $255 million secured in its presale and a fixed $0.0020 coin price until June 13, BlockDAG presents more than a bet, it offers a system backed by milestones. Its upcoming Go Live Reveal will confirm listings on 20 exchanges, five of which are already disclosed. Alongside this, miner shipments are already being fulfilled and the Buyer Battles campaign keeps driving participation by distributing 150 million BDAG daily. Unlike many passive presales, BlockDAG has built a campaign around transparency and ongoing delivery. While ADA and SHIB move forward with network progress, BlockDAG is presenting a compelling case as a next-generation Layer-1 network to watch. Dogecoin Aims for $0.27 as Technical Setup Strengthens Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to hold interest among short-term traders focused on technical signals. A familiar ascending triangle pattern is now taking shape, which often hints at a potential breakout to the upside. If DOGE manages to maintain its current support at $0.20, analysts suggest a move toward $0.27 could follow. Additional on-chain data adds weight to this outlook. Wallet activity has grown, and a rise in large transactions suggests whales are showing renewed interest. Historically, this kind of behavior has preceded wider retail entry, especially when chart patterns align. However, DOGE remains largely tied to market sentiment. For a breakout to sustain, the coin will likely need consistent optimism and possibly external triggers. Still, its renewed attention from traders makes it a key token to monitor in the short term. Cardano’s $225M Funding Push Highlights Long-Term Vision Cardano (ADA) is gaining traction following the reveal of a $225 million ecosystem development proposal. This funding is intended to drive forward protocol enhancements, decentralized apps, and governance improvements, further reinforcing Cardano’s efforts to stay relevant in the evolving blockchain space. Though some buyers are asking how the funds will be allocated and whether it may affect token supply, the market has responded with stability. ADA is currently holding around $0.78, with analysts identifying $0.80 as a key breakout point. If resistance at that level is surpassed, ADA may reach $0.85 in the short term. More importantly, the size of this funding round shows that Cardano is serious about competing with newer, faster-moving platforms by committing to its long-term development roadmap. BlockDAG’s Presale Framework & June Reveal Attract Serious Buyers While DOGE and ADA show signs of growth in their respective sectors, BlockDAG is emerging with a different kind of appeal, structure and clarity. With nearly $255 million already raised in its presale, BlockDAG is becoming one of the most heavily funded Layer-1 chains before launch. The upcoming Go Live reveal on June 13 is a critical moment, when all 20 exchanges supporting BDAG will be announced. So far, five exchanges have been confirmed: MEXC, LBank, Coinstore, XT.com, and BitMart. These names offer wide access and liquidity, which adds legitimacy to the listing roadmap. Unlike many early-stage coins that delay launches or hide exchange plans, BlockDAG is openly proving its progress before going live. It’s important to note that trading won’t start on June 13. The actual listing will occur once the $600 million presale target is reached. But with the coin price locked at $0.0020 until that reveal date, there’s a clear window for buyers to enter before market volatility begins. Beyond announcements, BlockDAG is actively engaging its community through a unique Buyer Battles system. Each day, 150 million BDAG are distributed among contributors, and if any coins remain unsold, the largest buyer receives them. This gamified structure keeps energy high and rewards those who commit early. Why BlockDAG Is Gaining an Edge in the 2025 Market Dogecoin and Cardano both present solid mid-year cases. DOGE’s bullish triangle pattern suggests an approaching move, while Cardano’s massive development budget underlines its growth ambitions. Yet BlockDAG offers something they currently do not, a confirmed, structured presale process backed by listings and real utility. With its price fixed at $0.0020 until June 13, five major exchanges already secured, and momentum building through both infrastructure and incentives, BlockDAG is fast becoming the most strategically positioned Layer-1 launch of 2025. For those seeking strong upside backed by measurable progress, the time to act may be right now, before this presale window closes.

While Ethereum (ETH) , Avalanche (AVAX) , and Cardano (ADA) maintain strong fundamentals, a wave of traders is now turning toward MAGACOIN FINANCE —the meme-powered altcoin drawing serious attention with real upside potential. Ethereum (ETH): Solid but Seeking Momentum Ethereum remains the dominant force in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 infrastructure, with a market cap nearing $291 billion . But with ETH consolidating in the mid-$2,400s and lacking short-term catalysts, traders are eyeing younger projects with sharper ROI prospects. CLICK HERE – CLAIM YOUR SPOT BEFORE 5000% RUN Avalanche (AVAX): Holding Strong, But Flatlining AVAX is currently rebounding within the $19–$19.85 range and aiming for a breakout above $23 . While its fundamentals remain intact, the growth pace has slowed—leading many investors to seek higher-beta altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE for better exposure to explosive moves. Cardano (ADA): Technically Sound, But Sluggish ADA is trading near $0.68 , supported between $0.63–$0.66 , yet lacks clear momentum. Long-term holders remain loyal, but fast-moving traders are chasing opportunities with immediate potential—and that’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the scene. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Altcoin Catching 2025’s Spotlight HIGH DEMAND — LOW ENTRY — DON’T MISS OUT With over $8 million raised and a presale price still under $0.001 , MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned for a listing at $0.007 , offering early participants up to 36x ROI potential.

While the session lacked a clear directional push, he noted that this kind of pause often precedes a sharper move. CRYPTOWZRD plans to monitor the intraday chart tomorrow for a potential reversal setup above the $15.85 mark, which he views as the first sign of bullish intent. However, a sustained move above $16.80 would offer a more confirmed breakout and a stronger long opportunity, indicating buyers are beginning to take control. Can Chainlink Break Free From Current Stagnation? In his latest analysis, CRYPTOWZRD pointed out that LINK and LINKBTC closed today’s session indecisively, with daily candles reflecting weakness in the price action. While the lack of a clear direction is notable, both assets will need to see a surge in buying pressure from these levels in order to establish a new bullish trend. Related Reading: Chainlink Flashes Daily Buy Signal – Breakout Next? Particularly for LINKBTC, CRYPTOWZRD suggested that a potential push higher could materialize as Bitcoin dominance nears its resistance target. This rise in Bitcoin dominance could provide the necessary tailwind for LINK to gain momentum and transition into a bullish phase in tandem with broader market movement. For LINK, the $16 level has become an important support zone as a bullish reversal from this area would add impulsive price action, potentially driving Chainlink toward the $19.50 resistance target in the near term. If Chainlink breaks decisively above $19.50, CRYPTOWZRD anticipates a more substantial rally that could propel the asset towards the $30 resistance level. However, these bullish outcomes hinge on a consistent upside pressure and a healthy price structure to support the move. At this juncture, the market is waiting for the formation of the next trade setup, whether it be a strong reversal off support or a clean breakout above resistance, to provide momentum for the next significant move. Watch For Breakout Or Consolidation In conclusion, the analyst observed that today’s intraday chart was characterized by choppy and slow price action, with no clear direction established. Given the lack of momentum, the expectation is heightened volatility as the market works through these levels. However, the price needs to break decisively above the $16.80 intraday resistance level to trigger a solid long entry. Related Reading: Chainlink Just Retested Key Support – Here’s Where Price Could Be Headed Next That said, there is also the possibility that price may move sideways in the near term, consolidating within a range. If that occurs, $15.85 will act as the key intraday support target, where the market could find temporary stability before deciding its next move. With the current indecisiveness in the market, the best course of action is to wait for a well-formed chart pattern or a clear setup that provides a high-probability trade entry.

Let’s take a closer look at the latest price analysis and what could happen next. XRP Price Analysis: Key Levels to Watch On the daily chart, XRP recently fell below an importan t support line around $2.44, which is a short-term bearish sign. Right now, the price is finding some support near $2.30. If XRP breaks below $2.30, the next support level to watch would be between $2.10 and $2.15. On the other hand, resistance is now sitting between $2.43 and $2.44. If the price manages to move up, another major resistance lies at $2.60. Fibonacci Levels Show Strong Resistance Ahead Looking at the Fibonacci retracement tool, a key resistance zone known as the golden pocket sits between $2.55 and $2.62. If XRP breaks above $2.62 with strong confirmation (meaning daily candle closes above this level), it could trigger a bullish rally towards $2.90. Is There a Bullish Pattern Forming? There’s a chance XRP might form a large inverse head and shoulders pattern, a bullish chart formation. However, this isn’t confirmed yet. For this pattern to complete: XRP would need to drop further towards $2.10-$2.15 Then bounce back up towards $2.60 And finally break above $2.60 with confirmation If this happens, it could set XRP up for a strong rally, possibly pushing the price above $3 and towards new all-time highs.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-18 03:53:53

The chances of an ETF centered on Cardano are rising, now at 55%. Amid these shifts, could emerging player XYZVerse be poised to outdo the market with expected growth of 1.5 times? This article explores these developments and what they could mean for investors. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $13 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333 . At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Cardano’s ADA: A Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain designed for flexibility, sustainability, and scalability. It supports smart contracts, facilitating the development of decentralized finance applications, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and participate in staking on the network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more energy-efficient compared to traditional proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This structure enhances its ability to process a high number of transactions, potentially up to a million per second. Introduced in March 2021, Cardano’s native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. The platform’s focus on scalability and energy efficiency sets a new benchmark for blockchain technology. In the current market cycle, ADA’s features may appeal to users and developers interested in sustainable and scalable blockchain solutions. The technology underlying Cardano positions it as a significant option for those looking to engage with decentralized applications and smart contracts. Conclusion While ADA targets a 15% rise, XYZVerse’s innovative sports memecoin aims for 20,000% growth, offering early investors a unique, community-driven opportunity.

Unstaked has emerged with strong momentum, securing over $6 million in funding and drawing widespread attention. Its expanding community, upcoming AI-driven tools, and a five-month $1 million Gleam contest with thousands participating are placing it firmly in discussions about standout 2025 crypto stories. The key question is whether Unstaked can outperform established top crypto coins like Aave (AAVE) and Hedera (HBAR) in the upcoming rally. While Aave continues on a steady path and Hedera struggles with investor confidence, Unstaked is gaining recognition as a unique contender. This article outlines how Unstaked measures up against these well-known coins, and whether its budget-friendly stage price and expanding visibility could drive it toward the $1 milestone by 2027. Aave (AAVE): Steady Lending Protocol with Slower Upside Aave is still a leader in decentralized lending protocols. As of May 2025, the platform holds over $40 billion in deposits, mainly in its v3 protocol. Most of its activity comes from Ethereum and related assets, highlighting strong borrowing and lending demand. Despite these numbers, Aave’s price outlook points to modest gains. With Ethereum recovering to $2,500 and AAVE up 25% in the past week, analysts see slow and consistent growth. However, for those looking for steeper price movement, newer names like Unstaked offer a more compelling outlook. This gap between Aave’s solid tech and limited price action has created space for other top crypto coins with stronger appeal to users and more accessible entry points. Hedera (HBAR): Strong Infrastructure, Limited Price Lift Hedera has long been promoted for its enterprise-ready design. Its fast confirmations, low fees, and secure Hashgraph base give it strong appeal to sectors like supply chain, identity, and payments. Still, the Hedera (HBAR) price prediction remains unimpressive. Even with a 30% gain in the past month, HBAR has not sustained prices above $0.5, and the $1 target remains uncertain. Years of low price movement have cast doubt over its growth expectations. Compared to other top crypto coins, Hedera has had difficulty gaining attention from everyday users. The price and adoption disconnect continues to be a major barrier. Unstaked: Real-Use Features, Rapid Growth, and a Clear $1 Target Unstaked is quickly picking up speed, moving from an early-stage project to a standout with $6 million raised by Stage 12. The current price of $0.008997 remains within reach for everyday users, with its launch price set at $0.1819. This offers nearly a 27x growth chance based on current numbers. What makes Unstaked different is its plan to deliver simple, useful crypto tools. It aims to launch AI-powered agents that assist users in managing returns and navigating DeFi without confusion. This approach appeals to those looking for easier ways to engage with crypto tools. Its biggest draw is the ongoing $1 million Gleam campaign, a five-month giveaway offering 20 prizes of $50,000 each. To qualify, users must take part in social actions, refer new participants, and hold $100 or more in UNSD. Thousands have already joined, making it one of the largest promotions in the 2025 crypto cycle. This isn’t just exposure, it’s fueling growth through community involvement and awareness. Projections suggest Unstaked could reach the $1 mark by 2027, representing a potential 100x increase from its current price. Compared to Aave’s more conservative forecast and Hedera’s unclear outlook, Unstaked shows a faster growth route. Aave focuses on financial protocols, Hedera caters to institutions, but Unstaked is designed for individuals. As attention shifts toward ease of use and community support in 2025, Unstaked may emerge as a frontrunner. Final Words! With $6 million secured and its headline Gleam campaign gaining traction, Unstaked is standing out. Priced at $0.008997 and aiming for a $1 target by 2027, the growth possibility is significant. Against Aave’s gradual path and Hedera’s uncertain prediction, Unstaked holds a more exciting potential. Among the top crypto coins of 2025 , few combine strong interest and low cost like Unstaked does. For those entering early and aiming for large returns, this project could be one of the top names to track.

After a volatile start to Q2, both assets are showing early technical strength , raising the question: can they revisit their 2023 highs in time — or will broader market forces keep them range-bound? With inflation data cooling and traders beginning to rotate back into altcoins, Cardano and Ethereum are benefiting from renewed interest , but another project is quietly entering the conversation — and potentially offering something both lack at this stage: early-stage upside and faster momentum . Ethereum Rebuilds as Scaling and Sentiment Improve Ethereum currently trades above $2,500, a level that has been heavily defended in May. While down from its 2023 peak, the asset is showing resilience. Several bullish factors are aligning, including: A sharp uptick in Layer 2 network usage Renewed community support behind Vitalik Buterin’s new scalability proposals Rising transaction volume across DeFi protocols Analysts see Ethereum reclaiming its 2023 highs near $3,700 if the broader market breaks higher. However, many agree that while the long-term outlook remains strong, short-term gains may be more limited due to its size and current valuation. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW Cardano Eyes $1.20 With Momentum From Airdrop and Technicals Cardano, meanwhile, has been one of the most active large-cap performers this quarter. After successfully defending the $0.75 support level , ADA has surged on the back of: A massive multi-chain airdrop targeting over 37 million wallets Strength in Japanese trading volume and Grayscale fund performance An increasingly active developer ecosystem With targets now set at $1.00 to $1.20 , Cardano is in a better technical position than it was throughout most of 2023. However, like Ethereum, its gains are seen as steady rather than explosive — especially compared to emerging altcoin contenders. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Emerging as a Premier High-Upside Opportunity While Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) continue to evolve on the back of solid network infrastructure and institutional interest, a growing segment of the market is focused on early-stage assets with stronger upside potential. In this context, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing significant attention. Designed to reward early participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE features a fixed token supply of 100 billion and is targeting a future listing price of $0.007 . Currently trading well below that mark, it has drawn interest from analysts projecting 25x to 36x returns, should momentum persist through the end of the year. In today’s fast-paced market cycle — where early positioning and trend momentum are as critical as technical fundamentals — MAGACOIN FINANCE is being evaluated as a credible, high-upside opportunity with real structural appeal. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST Closing Perspective: Speed vs. Stability Ethereum and Cardano remain long-term pillars in the market, with strong upgrade paths, growing ecosystems, and continued relevance among institutional players. However, for investors seeking near-term acceleration and higher returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a rare blend of early-stage access, exponential growth potential, and pricing that remains in the discovery phase — offering advantages that ETH and ADA currently do not.

Analyst Reveals Top Altcoin For 3x Gains,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-crypto-pump-or-dump-this-weekend-analyst-reveals-top-altcoin-for-3x-gains/,"The post Will Crypto Pump or Dump This Weekend? Analyst Reveals Top Altcoin For 3x Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the weekend approaches, traders are wondering whether the crypto market will see a pump, dump, or move sideways. On The Paul Barron Network , analyst Evan Aldo recently shared his thoughts on the market’s short-term direction. According to Aldo, the market could either move sideways or see a small pump over the weekend. If he had to pick, he leans towards a pump but admits sideways movement is also likely. If You’re New to Crypto — What Should You Buy? For those new to crypto, Aldo was asked what he would invest in if he were starting fresh today. His answer was clear: Ethereum (ETH). Why Ethereum? Aldo explained that Ethereum looks strong against Bitcoin and has likely hit a bottom. He gave it a 90% chance of having bottomed against Bitcoin. It also appears to have made a local low against the total altcoin market (known as Total 3, which includes all coins outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum). Aldo believes Ethereum will likely outperform smaller altcoins for the next few months. How High Could Ethereum Go? While some market watchers are predicting long-term price targets between $6,000 and $7,400 for Ethereum, a few even suggest it could climb as high as $10,000 to $11,000 if momentum builds. But for now, analysts like Aldo are focusing on the next major target — $3,200 — as the first key milestone. If Ethereum can break that, it may pave the way for bigger moves by the end of 2025. One particularly bullish signal Aldo pointed out is a rare trigger wave forming on the three-week chart. Similar patterns appeared before major rallies in the past, like in 2020. While a huge 10x move is unlikely this time, a 2x or 3x gain could still be on the cards. What’s Next for the Market? Once the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, Aldo expects a full-fledged altcoin season — where smaller coins could surge and outperform Ethereum. Until then, he considers Ethereum a must-have crypto during this transition phase.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-18 04:08:40

Their consistent price activity has held investor attention through the second quarter. Now, a new name is gaining quiet traction: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Analysts are beginning to highlight it as a compelling early-stage candidate, positioned to challenge the dominance of established players like Solana and XRP. With capital increasingly flowing into earlier-phase opportunities, this emerging project is drawing interest from those seeking strategic upside. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Solana Shows Stability — But Signs Point to Slowing Momentum Solana continues to attract developer interest due to its efficiency and transaction speed, making it a preferred network for NFT initiatives and decentralized applications. Its technical structure remains sound, and the ecosystem appears fundamentally robust. However, recent May price action has shown signs of consolidation, with buyers showing caution near resistance levels. While Solana remains well-positioned long term, some market participants suggest the strongest gains may already be priced in — leading them to explore new opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which currently offers a more favorable entry profile with significant upside potential. XRP Keeps Surging — But Is It Overheating? XRP’s recent rise to $2.65 has been one of the most impressive moves this quarter. Boosted by ETF rumors and continued legal clarity, the token reclaimed its place among the top altcoins. Analysts expect a potential push toward $3.40 , with some projecting $5.50 by year-end if current sentiment holds. That said, XRP’s technical indicators now show potential overbought conditions , and the risk of consolidation looms. While the long-term story remains compelling, traders are beginning to explore other options — including tokens that haven’t yet made their big move. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Now Entering the Spotlight Amid this rotation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping into view. Originally known for its political meme appeal, the project has transformed into a serious contender for short-term and mid-term upside . What’s driving the shift? A presale entry still below $0.001 , with a listing target of $0.007 Bold analyst forecasts of 25x–36x ROI A capped supply of 100 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to early-stage investors Increasing crossover interest from XRP and SOL communities The structure is designed to attract buyers who missed the early runs in Solana and XRP — and who are now searching for a project still in its asymmetrical growth phase . Why Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Outperform Unlike Solana and XRP — both of which are already mid-run — MAGACOIN FINANCE is early , which means it offers something rare: maximum upside with minimal historical resistance . This makes it particularly appealing to: Altcoin traders who rotate capital aggressively Early buyers looking for potential parabolic setups Those who favor tokenomics over hype More importantly, MAGACOIN FINANCE is moving without noise — building momentum steadily, not explosively, which some analysts see as a sign of real staying power . EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Final Thought: Rotation Season Has Begun Solana and XRP have already delivered — and may deliver more. But for traders looking ahead, the opportunity may not lie in what’s already risen… but in what’s just now breaking through .

With more traders stepping away from overpriced tokens, attention is turning toward earlier-stage assets with clear direction, smart tokenomics, and well-timed entries. One project making a quiet but meaningful climb is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a DeFi protocol currently available under $0.10 and projected by analysts to 20x within its first growth cycle. Still in presale, MUTM has started gaining traction as one of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in this month, thanks to its planned product rollout, structural design, and potential to deliver strong returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t priced low by chance—it’s still in the early stages of its lifecycle, and the team is actively building the foundation for real ecosystem utility. With a confirmed launch price of $0.06 and long-term forecasts ranging from $1.20 to $1.50. Unlike many early-stage cryptocurrencies that delay their product until after listings, Mutuum plans to launch a functional beta of its protocol shortly after the token goes live. This means that real activity—borrowing, lending, yield generation, and protocol engagement—will be in motion early, feeding directly into token demand. Imagine someone participating in the presale at a price of $0.025 per token. When the token reaches $0.50—a full 20x increase—a $1,500 investment would grow to $30,000. That’s a $28,500 return, earned by getting in early, before exchange listings and broader market exposure. It’s this kind of upside that has more investors viewing MUTM as one of the top cryptocurrencies to buy pre-launch. Mutuum Finance is focused on developing the foundation needed for sustained, long-term growth—well beyond just its current price point. The team has confirmed plans for: A Layer 2 deployment to help reduce gas fees and improve scalability once volume increases. A native, overcollateralized stablecoin that will be minted from protocol-secured collateral, helping drive consistent internal demand and liquidity within the ecosystem. A transparent security process, including an in-progress CertiK audit, giving both early investors and larger entities more confidence in the smart contracts powering the platform. These additions aren’t just technical upgrades—they’re core to what makes MUTM stand out from other new crypto coins. The stablecoin, in particular, adds a level of economic predictability and helps cement the token’s role in real financial activity—not just speculative movement. With the presale still ongoing and the token priced below $0.10, MUTM’s entry point remains one of the most attractive on the market. However, with each completed phase, the price increases—bringing new buyers in at higher valuations. Those who enter now are getting access before the token hits centralized or decentralized exchanges—meaning before public visibility scales and before price discovery begins. That early access is crucial. It gives investors time to build a position, understand the protocol, and benefit from the long-term upside that typically follows real product delivery and community growth. To reward early supporters, the Mutuum team is currently running a $100,000 giveaway. Information can be found on the official site, and anyone taking part in the presale by purchasing MUTM tokens becomes eligible. It’s a final incentive that adds to an already strong entry case—and another reason why this month may be the best time to move before wider adoption drives the price higher. MUTM isn’t a speculative meme token or a flash-in-the-pan trend. It’s a utility-first project building for users, with a system designed to grow based on protocol usage—not just attention. At under $0.10, it offers one of the most balanced risk-reward entries available today. With a clear roadmap, product near launch, and growing investor confidence, Mutuum Finance stands out as a top cryptocurrency to buy this month—especially for those seeking a strategic entry with real upside potential.

Everything from the user’s full name, home address and tax identification number will need to be collected and reported for every transaction, including the cryptocurrency used and the amount moved, the UK Revenue and Customs department said in a May 14 statement. Details of companies, trusts and charities transacting on crypto platforms will also need to be reported. Failure to comply or inaccurate reporting may incur penalties of up to 300 British pounds ($398.4) per user. The UK Revenue and Customs department said it would inform companies on how to comply with the incoming measures in due course. However, UK authorities are encouraging crypto firms to start collecting data now to ensure compliance readiness. The new rule is part of the UK’s integration of the Organisation for Economic Development’s Cryptoasset Reporting Framework to improve transparency in crypto tax reporting. The changes reflect the UK government’s aim to establish a more robust regulatory framework that supports industry growth while ensuring consumer protection. Related: Bitwise lists four crypto ETPs on London Stock Exchange UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves also introduced a draft bill in late April to bring crypto exchanges, custodians and broker-dealers within its regulatory reach to combat scams and fraud. “Today’s announcement sends a clear signal: Britain is open for business — but closed to fraud, abuse, and instability,” Reeves said at the time. A study from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority last November found that 12% of UK adults owned crypto in 2024 — a significant increase from the 4% reported in 2021. UK’s approach contrasts with EU’s MiCA The UK’s move to integrate the crypto rules into its existing financial framework contrasts with the European Union’s approach, which introduced the new Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation framework last year. According to the MiCA Crypto Alliance, one key difference is that the UK will allow foreign stablecoin issuers to operate in the UK without needing to register. There will also be no cap on stablecoin volumes, unlike the EU’s approach, which may impose controls on stablecoin issuers to manage systemic risks.

While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to headline the meme coin space, early movers are beginning to redirect their focus toward MAGACOIN FINANCE —a rising altcoin steadily gaining attention as accumulation picks up. Still flying under the mainstream radar, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a preferred early-stage play for value-driven traders seeking growth and reduced volatility ahead of the broader bull cycle. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE DOGE and SHIBA: Rotation in Motion Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently priced around $0.00002 , with a market cap of approximately $12.9 billion . Despite an impressive 2024 performance, confidence has wavered following the January 2025 departure of lead developer Shytoshi Kusama. Though the SHIB ecosystem remains vibrant, investor outlook is now more closely tied to market sentiment and speculation. Dogecoin (DOGE) , trading near $0.20 , remains a prominent meme coin. While Elon Musk’s periodic mentions continue to drive sporadic momentum, DOGE’s growth prospects lean heavily on hype rather than development. As such, seasoned holders are beginning to seek alternatives with stronger structural appeal. MAGACOINFINANCE – Early Accumulation & Rising Sentiment Against this evolving backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is exhibiting early indicators of breakout potential. Unlike meme coins reliant on celebrity backing, it’s being fueled by solid infrastructure, growing community traction, and credible positioning within the market. Investor activity has increased consistently throughout 2025 , supported by lower volatility and greater media visibility. A noticeable trend has emerged—capital rotating from high-risk meme plays into fundamentally sound projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE . Strategic Appeal and Analyst Confidence Though still in its development phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting attention from institutional circles. Several core factors are behind the optimistic forecasts: A fixed 100 billion token supply with robust pre-sale engagement A rapidly expanding community tied to roadmap milestones Structural upgrades boosting long-term scalability With capital inflows shifting from legacy meme coins to stronger emerging contenders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a key player in the upcoming altcoin rally. CLICK HERE – SECURE YOUR SPOT BEFORE 25x DISAPPEARS Conclusion: Sentiment Realigns Toward MAGACOIN FINANCE Investor focus is evolving—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a central beneficiary. While DOGE and SHIB remain relevant, the visible shift toward MAGACOIN FINANCE signals strategic recalibration by long-term participants. With accumulation steadily building and volatility remaining minimal, confidence appears to be strengthening. If the trend continues, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the defining success stories of 2025 .

Bitcoin has stagnated below $105,000, while the market cap of all cryptocurrencies has dropped by over 3% in the last few days to $3 trillion. This article provides a forecast for top altcoins like Onyxcoin (XCN), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Litecoin (LTC). Onyxcoin price analysis XCN price chart | Source: TradingView The Onyxcoin token has moved from obscurity into one of the best-performing players in the crypto industry. Its price jumped from a low of $0.00069 in September last year to $0.020 today, a 2,888% increase. The XCN token rally has caught many investors by surprise. For example, in January, Justin Sun warned that its performance was likely due to price manipulation, allegations that Onyxcoin rejected. Onyxcoin price has moved above the important support level at $0.0075, the lowest swing on April 7. It has also moved above the 50-day moving average, and most recently, is forming a bullish pennant pattern. This pattern comprises of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the Onyxcoin price rebounds and hits the important resistance level at $0.04923, the highest swing in January this year. It needs to cross that level to invalidate the double-top pattern whose neckline is at $0.00754. A move above that level will point to more gains, potentially to $0.1.

It then staged a strong comeback, moving to a high of $1.3115 on May 12 as the crypto market bull run intensified. Recently, however, there are signs that the WIF price has lost momentum and is trading at $0.9500. It is hovering at its lowest level since last Sunday. Dogwifhat price has remained above the 50-day moving average, a sign that bulls remains in control and that the ongoing pullback is merely a technical retracement. WIF price has also formed what looks like a cup-and-handle pattern, a common continuation sign. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the Dogwifhat price will continue rising as bulls target the initial resistance at $1.3115. A move above that level will point to more gains to $1.50. Litecoin price forecast LTC price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the Litecoin price has been in a slow uptrend in the past few weeks, moving from a low of $63 to a high of $106.90. Litecoin price moved above the important resistance level at $96.30, the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern. The head of this pattern is at $63, while the shoulders are at around $83. An inverse H&S pattern is one of the most bullish signs in technical analysis. Litecoin price has formed a break-and-retest pattern by moving back to the neckline at $96.30. Therefore, Litecoin price will likely have a strong bullish breakout, with the next point to watch being at $106.90 followed by $110. This rebound will likely happen as the LTC ETF odds jump.

Analysts are keeping a close eye on Bitcoin and altcoins, with signs pointing to a major rally just around the corner. Right now, Bitcoin is holding strong, and the chances of it falling back to $75,000 look slim. The market seems much stronger than before, and most people aren’t overly excited yet — which is usually a good sign for more growth. Altcoins Could Drop Slightly, Then Boom Altcoins have already seen a small drop, about 14%, but history shows they sometimes dip a little more before flying high. According to an expert, a quick correction of 10–20% might happen soon, but after that, altcoins are expected to surge in a big way. The good news? This dip won’t be as harsh as the ones we’ve seen in the past. There’s a lot of money sitting on the sidelines, waiting to jump in. That extra cash could help push prices up faster once the market turns around. Using historical fractals and timing analysis, the analyst sad that altcoins typically experience one final dip before surging in a bull run’s major leg. Drawing comparisons to market behavior from September 2024, he said that the altcoin index had previously dropped 18% before staging a 43% rally. “This time, the altcoin index has already dipped about 14%, suggesting there’s likely another 10–20% downside for altcoins before we enter a sustained uptrend,” he explained. Get Ready for the Next Big Move If the market follows the same pattern as before, there could be one final big move that takes prices to new all-time highs. It’s the calm before the storm, and those who stay ready could see big opportunities ahead. Right now might be a good time to clean up your crypto bags — drop the weak coins, hold onto the strong ones, and get set for what could be a powerful altcoin season.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-18 05:21:37

Meanwhile, XRP sits near $2.22 , with subdued movement amid waning ETF speculation and light trading activity. While long-term projections stay bullish, short-term action has prompted investors to explore more dynamic opportunities— MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one such alternative. 50% Bonus Active – Early ROI Outlook Signals Strong Entry Point Investor interest isn’t just reactive—it’s a proactive allocation. Projections indicate more than 3,000% return potential from current levels to the $0.007 target listing price. Contributing to that momentum: A 50% token bonus is currently available 100 billion token supply, with nearly half allocated to pre-sale Dynamic token pricing adjusts hourly amid increased demand Unlike many slower-moving projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE operates with a disciplined roadmap and precise milestones, attracting calculated entries.

That’s backed by: A global marketing strategy in full execution Agency partnerships and verified influencer deals Ongoing negotiations for centralized exchange onboarding It’s this structured path that’s drawing long-term ADA and XRP holders to reallocate into what’s being called one of 2025’s most promising early-phase altcoins .

According to the firm’s Q1 Earnings Report , its Bitcoin strategy contributed 88% to its revenue of 877 million Japanese yen ($6 million). Metaplanet’s consistent BTC accumulation has also earned it the spot of the 11th-largest public company by bitcoin holdings globally and number one in Asia. Metaplanet Posts Record Q1 Financials From January 1 to date, Metaplanet has added 5,034 BTC to its balance sheet, increasing its holdings by 3.9x to 6,796 BTC. These purchases were funded by a moving-strike warrant program, which enabled the company to issue equity without setting a fixed discount or strike. As of May 10, the hospitality entity had executed 87% of the program, raising 76.6 billion yen ($524.8 million) and becoming the largest public equity issuer in the country. With the funds raised, Metaplanet has achieved approximately 68% of its near-term 10,000 BTC goal at a cost basis of 13.27 million yen ($90,929) per BTC. Although the company recorded a 7.4 billion yen ($50.7 million) unrealized loss on its BTC position by the end of the quarter due to market prices, bitcoin’s recent rally has fully reversed the losses. The firm reported unrealized BTC gains of 13.5 billion yen ($92.5 million) as of May 12. Evaluating its treasury performance, Metaplanet reported a BTC yield of 170% and a BTC gain of 2,996 BTC. These metrics measure the growth in BTC per diluted share and the BTC per shareholder unit. Embracing a Bitcoin Treasury Metaplanet said last quarter’s report posted the strongest financial result in its 20-year corporate history. The company’s core operating metrics and Bitcoin treasury key performance indicators (KPIs) also broke its records for the first time. The entity recorded an operating profit of 593 million yen (over $4 million) after an 11% uptick quarter-on-quarter. Revenue rose 8%, while total assets surged 81% to 55 billion yen (more than $376.8 million) within the same time frame. Due to the success of its Bitcoin treasury strategy, Metaplanet is urging other companies to consider adopting Bitcoin, offering its capital strategy as a blueprint. “Our results speak for themselves: we don’t set targets to feel safe—we set them to exceed them, quarter after quarter. The global feedback loop between capital markets and Bitcoin is just beginning. Metaplanet intends to be its premier conduit,” the company said.

In a social-media post on Saturday, François-Philippe Champagne stated that about 70 percent of the counter-tariffs imposed in March remain active. That share covers roughly C$42 billion (US$30.1 billion) in goods from the United States, not including automobiles. On all these goods, a 25% retaliatory tariff rate will still apply. Champagne added that only some items for “health and public safety reasons” have been temporarily spared. More of the same falsehoods. To retaliate against U.S. tariffs, Canada launched largest-ever response — including $60B of tariffs on end-use goods. 70% of those tariffs are still in place. We temporarily and publicly paused tariffs on goods for health & public safety reasons. pic.twitter.com/qsLlxnzYlr — François-Philippe Champagne (FPC) 🇨🇦 (@FP_Champagne) May 18, 2025 Champagne’s statement challenges an earlier research report His statement challenges a 13 May report by Oxford Economics analysts Tony Stillo and Michael Davenport. The research firm noted that the recent exemptions were so broad they left Canada with “nearly zero” extra duty on U.S. products. The earlier report gave fresh new reasons to opposition lawmakers, who accused Prime Minister Mark Carney of not being transparent about the true scale of his tariff strategy. During the recent election campaign, Carney cast himself as the candidate best able to manage the trade dispute and promised counter-measures that would “cause maximum pain” south of the border. His Liberal Party secured victory in the 28 April vote. Tensions have been high since U.S. President Donald Trump imposed duties on a range of Canadian and Mexican products, including cars and trucks, despite an existing North American trade deal. Canada hit back first with a 25 percent tariff on selected American consumer goods, steel, and aluminum, and later extended the charge to vehicles built in the United States. These tariffs were first unveiled in March after Washington escalated the tariff dispute. Ottawa published a list covering consumer staples, metals, and machinery despite protests from several small firms. On 15 April, however, Champagne rolled out a series of six-month exemptions. Canadian firms may import items for manufacturing, processing, and food-and-beverage packaging without paying the tariff for the short term. Goods required for public health, health care, public safety, and national security are also exempt during this brief window.

In a detailed breakdown, SMQKE explains how Ripple, a fintech company that does not qualify for direct access to these accounts, leverages its partnership with core banking provider Finastra to integrate into the FedNow Service. HOW RIPPLE GAINS INDIRECT ACCESS TO FED MASTER ACCOUNTS VIA FEDNOW AND FINASTRA A Federal Reserve Master Account provides direct access to settle payments in central bank money through Fed systems like Fedwire and FedNow. These accounts are extremely hard to obtain,… pic.twitter.com/6ZbwDc0v3F — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 15, 2025 Understanding the Federal Reserve Master Account Limitation Federal Reserve Master Accounts are central to the U.S. payment infrastructure, enabling institutions to settle transactions in central bank money through systems such as Fedwire and FedNow. These accounts are tightly regulated and reserved exclusively for licensed depository institutions. Fintech firms, including Ripple, are not eligible for direct access due to regulatory requirements, making indirect access the only viable route for participation in central bank settlement. Finastra’s Integration with FedNow and Role as a Bridge According to SMQKE, Ripple circumvents the Master Account restriction through its strategic partnership with Finastra, a leading provider of core banking technology. Finastra is integrated with the FedNow Service and serves as an intermediary between private payment services and the Federal Reserve’s settlement infrastructure. The diagram shared by SMQKE shows Finastra Total Messaging facilitating connections between Ripple, Mastercard, and Thunes, enabling routing of payment messages across compliant channels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Liquidity Management Tool as the Key Enabler A central element of this structure is the FedNow Liquidity Management Tool (LMT). This tool allows for the transfer of funds between Federal Reserve Master Accounts and joint accounts that support private sector payment services. As SMQKE points out, this feature allows Ripple’s payment flows to settle through banks that do have Master Accounts, even though Ripple itself does not. The LMT enables service providers authorized by FedNow participants to initiate liquidity transfers. This mechanism makes it possible for firms like Ripple to participate in real-time settlement via banks that maintain direct access, effectively embedding their services into the central bank system without violating regulatory boundaries. Interoperability through ISO 20022 Standards FedNow’s support for ISO 20022 messaging is another key factor emphasized by SMQKE. This global standard ensures that structured data can move seamlessly across compliant financial platforms. Because Ripple’s infrastructure is ISO 20022 compatible , its XRP-based payment systems are interoperable with FedNow’s real-time messaging requirements. This compatibility supports seamless integration of blockchain-based payments into the traditional banking system. SMQKE’s analysis underscores the significance of Ripple’s positioning within this ecosystem. By aligning with Finastra and utilizing the FedNow LMT, Ripple participates in settlement processes using central bank reserves, despite lacking direct Federal Reserve access This model enhances Ripple’s reach in the U.S. payments space and illustrates how private fintech firms can legally and technically integrate with sovereign financial infrastructures through strategic partnerships and regulatory-compliant frameworks.

Participation is surging, investor traction is rising, and what began as a niche political token is now emerging as a full-fledged contender in the evolving altcoin landscape. This pre-sale phase did not slip in quietly. Earlier rounds closed out faster than projections, and the current phase is already drawing significant interest from retail buyers and crypto market analysts alike—many of whom now see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a frontrunner in Q2’s bullish rotation. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW Why This Phase Matters for Analysts Every new price tier in MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-sale doesn’t just reflect a price bump—it signals a structural shift in token distribution and investor incentives. With rising prices and reduced bonus allocations, analysts say the pre-sale model is driving urgency based on intelligent design, not just market hype. This latest stage builds on clear momentum: Over $8 million raised to date 20,000+ holders now confirmed Surge in engagement across Telegram, X (Twitter), and YouTube While many meme-inspired tokens peak quickly and disappear, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to maintain growth through consistent traction, transparent mechanics, and market-relevant appeal. Analysts Forecast 25x–35x ROI With Listing in Sight Investor interest is also being fueled by promising return projections. With a final target listing price of $0.007 , forecasts now indicate a potential 25x to 35x ROI depending on presale entry timing and launch conditions. Some estimates stretch even further, projecting 5,000%+ returns should market conditions remain favorable and upcoming partnerships materialize. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE is that its upside narrative isn’t rooted in speculation—it’s built on tokenomics, market timing, and a rapidly expanding user base. Rather than relying on fleeting influencer hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is leveraging political culture, scarcity mechanisms, and consistent delivery to establish itself as a durable altcoin force—especially in the meme-sector where volatility often dominates. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion: The Clock Is Ticking on Early Entry This newly launched phase marks more than just progress—it’s a decisive pivot point. Pricing continues to rise, bonus opportunities are fading, and those watching altcoin market cycles recognize that this is often where high-ROI windows close. With investor interest accelerating and visibility climbing across all major channels, MAGACOIN FINANCE is on track to become one of 2025’s defining projects. Analysts aren’t just tracking it—they’re calling it a primary driver of Q2’s altcoin surge.

At that price, anyone holding at least 10,000 XRP would find a portfolio valued at $1 million. But according to crypto veteran Armando Pantoja, the real challenge is not achieving sudden wealth—it is preserving it. $XRP skyrockets, you become a millionaire. What are you next steps? Drop a comment below pic.twitter.com/kwnl4DB1V6 — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) May 7, 2025 Pantoja, who has been active in the cryptocurrency space since 2011, believes that without a clear, disciplined financial strategy, most people are at risk of making irreversible mistakes once they gain significant profits. He emphasizes the importance of structured planning ahead of any major price breakout, especially one as life-altering as XRP hitting the $100 mark. Setting a Target: Define Your Financial Baseline Before Selling One of the first steps Pantoja recommends is identifying what he calls a “freedom number.” This figure represents the amount of money an individual needs annually to comfortably support their ideal lifestyle, including all essential living costs, discretionary spending, and long-term goals. He advises investors to calculate this monthly, then multiply it by 12 to get the yearly total. That number should then be doubled for emergencies, inflation, and unforeseen disruptions. This approach is intended to help individuals avoid underestimating their future financial needs. According to Pantoja, planning based on this framework provides a practical buffer and ensures that sudden gains can lead to lasting financial independence. Long-Term Thinking: Keep Your Principal Intact After such gains, Pantoja warns against spending or reinvesting the initial capital. He explained that the goal is to generate sustainable income through dividends, staking rewards, interest, or even real estate. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Keeping the original investment intact while building a portfolio of assets that produce recurring income is, in his view, critical to maintaining long-term wealth and building generational financial stability. He says this is the difference between becoming briefly wealthy and establishing a durable financial legacy. The Role of Preparation: A Detailed Plan Beats Improvisation Pantoja cautions investors against waiting until they become wealthy to start planning. Instead, he advises putting together a detailed, written plan in advance. This plan should include specific profit-taking points, where the money will be allocated, and how that capital will be structured to support a desired lifestyle. Importantly, he says this plan should be tested and adjusted before market conditions change. Doing so reduces the chances of making emotionally driven decisions when prices rise sharply. Could XRP Reach $100? As of now, XRP is trading at approximately $2.20. To hit $100, it would require a price increase of about 4,425%. Analysts remain divided on whether such a rise is realistic in the near term. Some optimists see a $100 target achievable within the next market cycle, potentially as early as 2025. Others adopt a more cautious view. Market commentator BarriC suggests that XRP could reach $100 between 2034 and 2040, citing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption as key variables. Meanwhile, crypto analyst All Things XRP stated that XRP can hit $100 without market cap concerns, pointing out that the market cap at that price, assuming a circulating supply of 58 billion tokens, would be around $5.8 trillion. DAG Managing Director Claver also weighed in on the matter, underscoring the significance of psychological discipline. He stated that even if XRP reaches $100, it may not transform your financial situation if you make critical investment mistakes. XRP’s path to $100 remains speculative, but the financial implications for holders are undeniable. Pantoja’s advice highlights the importance of preparation, emotional control, and forward-thinking strategy. For those holding XRP, achieving millionaire status is only the beginning; the ability to preserve and manage that wealth is what ultimately defines financial success.

According to the company's statement, the 30-day cumulative Open Interest Delta level has reached levels that were seen when Bitcoin tested new all-time highs in 2024, approaching $73,000. Alphractal analysts note that a distinct cyclical pattern is emerging in the market: a two-phase structure (Phase 1 and Phase 2), in which the increase and decrease in Open Interest Delta alternate. Usually, a strong increase in positions with a positive Delta is followed by a negative correction of almost the same magnitude. This indicates a regularly recurring cycle in the market. Related News: Analysis Company CEO Publishes List of 19 Altcoins Showing Strong Accumulation Signal The 180-day Delta data included in the company's analysis provides more striking signals. According to Alphractal: Sudden declines in delta usually indicate mass liquidation of long positions opened with high leverage. When delta turns negative, it often indicates market bottoms or accumulation zones. According to the latest data, the 180-day Delta is on the verge of turning negative. This suggests that there may be more volatility in the coming days, but it also indicates that a new consolidation phase may begin. The report also noted that Open Interest volume did not increase as strongly as it did from October 2023 to early 2024 and then from October 2024 to early 2025. These annually recurring trends may indicate that investor risk appetite is moving in a fractal pattern. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is History Repeating Itself in Bitcoin?

The token's price action shows resilience amid international trade disputes, with higher lows forming since recent dips while resistance remains firm around the $643-$645 zone. Decreasing volume volatility suggests energy buildup for a potential breakout, though direction remains uncertain as traders closely monitor both technical patterns and macroeconomic developments affecting market sentiment. Technical Analysis Highlights BNB traded within a narrow $9.67 range (1.52%) between $636.25 and $645.92 over 24 hours. Price formed a series of higher lows since the 13:00 dip, establishing support around $638-$640. Resistance emerged near $643-$645 with notable volume spikes during recovery rallies. Closing price of $642.59 suggests a neutral-to-slightly-bullish bias as BNB maintains position above mid-range. Decreasing volume volatility indicates potential energy buildup for a more decisive move. In the last hour, BNB showed bullish momentum, climbing from $641.21 to $643.09 (0.29% gain). Significant volume spikes occurred during upward moves at 01:54-01:55 when BNB broke above $642.60. A brief pullback to $640.57 at 01:32 established a strong support zone with aggressive buying. Hourly close showed consolidation near the high, suggesting potential uptrend continuation. Immediate resistance sits at $643.25.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/2-3-billion-xrp-in-24-hours-heres-the-significance/,"XRP experienced notable volatility in the past 24 hours, prompting concerns among investors. According to CoinGlass , the asset’s open interest is approximately $4.78 billion. The number of XRP tokens tied up in futures contracts dropped by 6.67%, signaling a potential weakening of confidence. This decline reflects a roughly 2.03 billion XRP in active futures commitments. In derivatives markets, open interest tracks the total number of outstanding contracts not yet settled. A significant drop in this metric can suggest reduced investor conviction or an unwinding of positions amid market uncertainty. Trading Volume Plummets, Price Tests Key Support At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.35, representing a daily decline of 2.6%. The token has been testing its support level around $2.30, contributing to a broader atmosphere of caution. Meanwhile, trading volume has contracted sharply, down by 38.82% to $3.2 billion. Analysts believe this pullback in volume is likely caused by profit-taking by short-term holders following XRP’s recent rally. The decline in market activity is also likely caused by heightened price fluctuations, as traders temporarily exit positions while awaiting further direction. Price Rally Earlier in the Week Reversed The current downturn contrasts sharply with XRP’s performance earlier this week, when it surged over 140% in value. During that rally, the token outpaced many other major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, which remained largely stagnant. That upward momentum, however, has since faded. The reversal has raised questions about the sustainability of XRP’s gains and the underlying factors influencing investor sentiment. A sharp rise followed by an equally fast retreat often reflects short-lived enthusiasm rather than a shift in long-term positioning. Regulatory Developments May Be Influencing Sentiment Some observers have linked XRP’s recent volatility to developments in the ongoing legal situation between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A recent update in the case, viewed by some as a setback , may have added uncertainty to the asset’s outlook. Despite this, a senior executive at Ripple has downplayed the impact of the legal update, stating that it does not affect Ripple’s operations or the legal standing of XRP. According to the executive, the situation is under control, without new regulatory risks. While XRP maintains a high level of open interest and significant market activity, the recent dip in futures positions and sharp decline in volume could be early signs of investor hesitation.

And with bullish forecasts predicting Bitcoin to go on a 10x run to $1 million, it could very well take the entire market with it on THE golden bull run of all time. Suffice to say, if Bitcoin pumps to a million , altcoins will see this trickle down. Mainstays PEPE , Kaspa, and XRP price predictions are off the charts, and they could go on epic runs if that happens. However, the tokens that stand to gain the most in this situation are actually low-cap gems that haven’t even come remotely close to mooning yet. One new altcoin in the frame is PayFi presale blue chip Remittix , which is being tipped for a 100x and beyond if Bitcoin does in fact reach $1 million – and leave PEPE , Kaspa, and XRP price forecasts in the dust. Here’s why. Kaspa price prediction: Is $100 possible if Bitcoin goes to $1M? Based on the Kaspa Power Law trend , it forecasts $100 per KAS in 8 years. The same is being tipped for Bitcoin, with $1M the target in 8 years. For Bitcoin to do that and raise Kaspa prices to $100, Bitcoin would have to garner widespread institutional adoption similar to gold (which could contribute another $2-3 trillion in market capitalization, roughly, mass enterprise adoption (accounting for another $2 trillion max), and retail growth in emerging markets. In 15-25 years, the trend says up to $1000 per KAS if demand continues. That’s along the lines of laughing at $1M per BTC 15 years ago. Source: CoinGecko Remittix upgrades cross-border payments Remittix isn’t chasing buzzwords, and it’s solving a trillion-dollar problem. This next-gen PayFi protocol lets users convert 100+ cryptocurrencies into fiat and push funds directly to global bank accounts. No delays, no FX fees, and no backlog. That’s true mainstream utility. Remittix uses localized payment rails to settle fiat payouts across 30+ currencies, from dollars and euros to pesos and naira, all through a sleek backend experience. And it’s not just for individuals. With the Remittix Pay API, businesses can accept crypto from customers and receive clean fiat in their bank accounts automatically. The market’s taking notice: over $15M raised in presale, and a $250K Gleam campaign pushing Remittix into the spotlight . With an exchange debut on the horizon, RTX isn’t just another token, and it’s a bridge to the real economy. PEPE and XRP price prediction: How high can XRP price go if Bitcoin hits $1M? Historically, XRP prices have always had a strong correlation with Bitcoin. It’s almost a foregone conclusion that if Bitcoin hits $1 million, XRP prices will ultimately follow suit. If, in theory, XRP captures a proportionality of 10% of Bitcoin’s market cap, that would amount to XRP prices running all the way from its current levels of $2.41 to a decent, near 20x at $21, assuming Bitcoin does run to $1M in the next 8 years. If XRP captures a 20% proportion of Bitcoin’s market cap, we may very well see XRP prices hit $42. XRP-BTC correlation. Source: Macroaxis The same can be said for frog-themed meme coin PEPE , but like Kaspa and XRP, the window for parabolic growth for PEPE has already come and gone in past bull runs. For investors looking for better gains, there are much better options than PEPE in 2025. Source: Coingecko The final word Bitcoin hitting $1 million isn’t out of the realm of possibility, but everything has to go perfectly in order for it to achieve a $1M valuation in the next 8 years. While Kaspa, PEPE , and XRP prices could surge to meteoric highs, the possibility of parabolic growth is no longer on the table, considering they have already been pumped. However, low-cap gems like Remittix are the best poised to turn in eye-watering gains—if Bitcoin does hit $1M, a 100x for RTX is child’s play.

In a new interview on CNBC Television, Lee says heightened optimism for 2026 and US companies thriving during hard times are signs suggesting the stock market looks more favorable than it did before Donald Trump sparked a trade war with numerous nations. “When we go back to February when the market was at all-time highs, we have to keep in mind, we had a lot of uncertainties ahead of us and we weren’t necessarily looking at 2026. The tariff visibility is much better today than it was three months ago, and when we look at 2026, I think there are things to look forward to, such as deregulation, tax cuts, and a [Federal Reserve] that’s on hold now but probably doing more cuts in 2026. From a company perspective, companies survived, I think, a black swan event. That waterfall of decline in equities and the near heart attack of the economy was an environment where companies produced earnings that beat expectations. I mean, this is the fifth stress test for businesses [and] when I put all that together, I think PE (price-to-earnings ratio) is probably going to be higher in six months than lower, and when you think about 2026 earnings having upside, I think there’s upside for stocks.” Lee goes on to say that investor sentiment shifting to neutral or positive could help stocks during the second half of the year. He also notes that institutional players are underexposed on the stock market. “We know a lot of institutions didn’t add risk back as the market rallied. So I think the pullbacks are going to be pretty shallow because investors just are underinvested at the moment. And then when you look at sentiment, it’s barely turning neutral now, so if investors have been fighting this rally, as they become more optimistic or neutral, that’s upside for stocks.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

ChatGPT Answers,https://cryptopotato.com/can-ripple-xrp-hit-10-in-2025-chatgpt-answers/,"TL;DR The cryptocurrency space is full of bullish and sometimes relatively ridiculous price predictions for members’ favorite assets, so we decided to ask ChatGPT for its opinion on whether XRP has the legs to make a mind-blowing surge to double-digit territory. It believes such a whopping 320% pump from current levels will require some “substantial developments.” $10 Mission Possible? The XRP Army, one of the most vocal communities in crypto, has outlined some massive predictions for the underlying asset, ranging from describing it as a modern-day Manhattan real estate opportunity to putting a future price tag of $100 . While these might sound a bit far-fetched at the moment, given XRP’s price of $2.38, we asked ChatGPT for another popular target – $10. After all, it would require a more modest 320% surge by the end of the year, something that Ripple’s token has done in the past – the last time was in late 2024/early 2025, when it shot up by even bigger percentages. The AI solution noted that the lawsuit resolution against the SEC, which is not officially over yet , even though both parties agreed to a $50 million settlement, has opened the door for XRP to gain further traction as it has “removed a significant uncertainty, potentially boosting investor confidence and institutional interest.” In terms of that institutional adoption, ChatGPT said a potential approval of a spot Ripple ETF in the States could skyrocket the underlying token’s price. The odds are relatively high, with Polymarket predicting a 79% chance for such a product to hit the US markets by the end of the year. Lastly, the AI chatbot outlined the overall crypto market dynamics. The arrival of the much-anticipated altseason, which has been highly speculated in the past few weeks, could be among the biggest gain drivers for the second-largest non-stablecoin alt. But These Challenges… ChatGPT believes reaching a $10 price tag is not an easy task and comes with its own set of challenges. One of them is the actual size of XRP in terms of market cap, as it would require the metric to shoot up to $580 billion or even more, given the billion tokens released every month. This would put it at levels almost twice as high as ETH’s current one. XRP also faces a lot of competition not only in the cryptocurrency space where investors can choose from thousands of altcoins, but in the traditional payment system where it serves as a cross-border token. As such, ChatGPT concluded: “While reaching $10 is within the realm of possibility, it would require a confluence of favorable factors, including increased adoption, positive market sentiment, and supportive regulatory developments. Investors should consider these factors and conduct thorough research when evaluating XRP’s potential.” The post Can Ripple (XRP) Hit $10 in 2025?

The policy, unveiled on 14 May, is meant to close tax loopholes, align with international standards and protect consumers from fraud. Mandatory data collection Exchanges, brokers and custodians will be required to record the name, address and tax identification number of both sender and recipient for every trade or transfer. They must also note the token type, quantity, sterling value and execution timestamp. HMRC emphasised that errors or late filings could trigger penalties of up to £300 per affected user. Officials urged companies to start gathering the necessary information immediately, even though technical guidance will be issued “in due course.” Balancing compliance and innovation Treasury staff say the mandate brings crypto disclosure into line with the transparency expected of banks and stockbrokers. Industry lobbyists, however, warn that small start-ups may struggle with the added cost of sophisticated know-your-customer systems. Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged the concern while introducing a draft bill that extends regulatory oversight to crypto exchanges, custodians and broker-dealers. “Today’s announcement sends a clear signal: Britain is open for business — but closed to fraud, abuse, and instability,” she told Parliament. Divergence from Brussels London’s plan integrates the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework directly into the existing financial-services rulebook. By contrast, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation creates a parallel licensing regime and imposes volume caps on stablecoins. Observers say Britain’s decision to allow foreign stablecoin issuers to operate without a domestic subsidiary could attract firms from across the Channel. Yet the divergence raises operational headaches for platforms serving both jurisdictions. Rising retail participation A Financial Conduct Authority survey last November found that 12 percent of UK adults held crypto in 2024, tripling the rate recorded in 2021. Policymakers cite the jump as evidence that clearer rules are now essential. HMRC previously relied on court orders to obtain exchange data, a process criticised as slow and adversarial. The new system flips the default, obliging firms to send annual reports proactively. Data will feed into a global exchange mechanism modelled on the Common Reporting Standard that already covers bank accounts. Treasury insiders believe uniform rules will also burnish London’s credentials as a responsible fintech centre in the wake of several high-profile exchange collapses abroad. They point to last year’s failure of offshore platform Globex, which left thousands of British investors scrambling to retrieve funds that HMRC could not initially trace. Consumer advocates agree that stronger oversight is overdue but urge the government to pair enforcement with public-awareness campaigns on phishing and romance scams. Civil-liberties groups remain uneasy, warning that centralised troves of transaction data could become lucrative targets for hackers. They are calling for end-to-end encryption of all submissions and mandatory breach-notification rules. Officials say security standards will be addressed in forthcoming technical guidance. Industry preparations RegTech vendors are pitching software that maps blockchain transactions to verified customer identities and generates ready-to-file HMRC returns. Larger exchanges are expanding compliance teams and consulting Big Four auditors on control frameworks. Smaller operators are pressing for phased implementation or de-minimis thresholds to avoid being priced out of the market. Lawyers warn that abrupt account freezes aimed at collecting missing data could trigger lawsuits, urging a pragmatic approach. Institutional investors, meanwhile, welcome the clarity, arguing that tax certainty will encourage pensions and insurers to allocate to digital assets. Looking ahead Secondary legislation fleshing out the details is expected later this year, giving stakeholders a final chance to shape the rules. HMRC plans educational campaigns to alert taxpayers to their obligations once the regime takes effect. Officials will publish annual statistics outlining the amount of previously undeclared crypto income captured by the new system. Analysts estimate the treasury could collect hundreds of millions of pounds in additional revenue within the first few years. Critics, however, fear that heavy-handed surveillance will drive traders toward decentralised platforms beyond regulatory reach. Regulators counter that most such protocols still rely on fiat on-ramps squarely within scope. As the 2026 deadline looms, British crypto companies face a stark choice: invest now in robust compliance infrastructure or risk fines and reputational damage later. Consultants say early adopters could gain a competitive edge by courting institutional clients who insist on high governance standards. Either way, the era of lightly regulated crypto trading in Britain is drawing to a close.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-18 07:14:50

Here’s an Expert Opinion,https://timestabloid.com/why-use-xrp-if-rlusd-exists-heres-an-expert-opinion/,"Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, recently addressed a common question within the cryptocurrency community: “Why use XRP if RLUSD exists?” RLUSD has been making waves since its launch in December 2024 , and exploring the uses of both assets shows their complementary roles and different purposes within Ripple’s broader financial infrastructure. People ask, “Why use XRP if RLUSD exists?” #XRP is the train, RippleNet lays the tracks, and RLUSD carries the cargo. The XRP Ledger is the foundation, with RLUSD as one tool built on top. As former Treasury Secretary Rosie Rios said, “The train has already left the station.” pic.twitter.com/zXYcZxFZDO — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) May 16, 2025 XRP as the Foundation of Cross-Border Payments XRP is the native digital asset of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), the foundational technology supporting Ripple’s global payment network, RippleNet. XRP functions primarily as a bridge currency , facilitating fast and cost-efficient cross-border transactions. RippleNet leverages XRP to provide liquidity on demand, enabling financial institutions to transfer value across borders without needing pre-funded accounts. This foundational role of XRP is emphasized by Aljarrah’s analogy that “XRP is the train, RippleNet lays the tracks,” highlighting XRP’s integral position in the payment infrastructure. The XRPL’s decentralized and high-performance nature allows it to handle large volumes of transactions with low latency, making it suitable for real-time settlement and liquidity management. RLUSD’s Purpose in the Ecosystem RLUSD was introduced to address use cases where price stability is paramount. Experts have explained that RLUSD plays roles that XRP cannot , like collateralizing loans or remitting salaries. RLUSD is designed to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the U.S. dollar, which is crucial for merchants, consumers, and businesses that require predictable value without exposure to cryptocurrency volatility. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlike XRP, which experiences price fluctuations inherent to cryptocurrencies, RLUSD offers a reliable medium of exchange and store of value for everyday transactions. This makes RLUSD particularly useful in scenarios such as retail payments, payroll, and other applications where stability is necessary. Distinct but Complementary Roles An expert recently clarified that RLUSD is not intended to replace XRP but rather to complement it. XRP remains essential for liquidity provisioning and cross-border settlement, while RLUSD is a stable transactional currency within the Ripple ecosystem. This distinction is critical because it highlights Ripple’s strategy to cater to diverse market needs. XRP’s volatility and liquidity make it suitable for international transfers and financial institutions, whereas RLUSD’s price stability supports everyday transactional use cases. The Future of Ripple’s Payment Network Aljarrah drew attention to former Treasury Secretary Rosie Rios’s statement, “The train has already left the station,” which captures Ripple’s momentum in developing a multi-faceted digital asset ecosystem. XRP and RLUSD are both integral components, each fulfilling specific roles that enhance the ecosystem’s functionality and adoption.

Despite macroeconomic headwinds, DOGE has maintained support above key moving averages while forming a potential bull flag pattern that could target $0.35 if validated by continued buying pressure. Technical Analysis Highlights DOGE experienced significant volatility with a 4.3% range (0.211-0.220) over the past 24 hours, forming a key support zone around 0.212 validated by high volume rebounds at 13:00 and 22:00. The price action reveals a bullish recovery pattern from the 16:00 low, with resistance emerging at 0.217-0.220. The 20:00 candle's strong volume surge above the 24-hour average confirms renewed buying interest, suggesting potential upward momentum if DOGE can maintain its position above the established support level. In the past hour, DOGE has demonstrated significant bullish momentum, climbing from 0.215 to 0.216 with notable volume spikes at 01:17, 01:21, and 01:54-01:55. The price established a strong support zone around 0.215 during the early minutes, followed by a decisive breakout at 01:16-01:17 where volume surged over 8 million. The uptrend continued with higher lows forming a clear ascending pattern, culminating in a new resistance test at 0.216-0.217 range. The final minutes saw particularly heavy trading activity with volumes exceeding 7 million at 02:01-02:02, confirming strong buyer interest and suggesting potential for further upside movement.

One of those is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale-stage cryptocurrency with strong utility plans and a growing base of early believers. With analysts now forecasting a price between $2 and $4 during its first major cycle, the current presale valuation under $0.05 is starting to look like a calculated entry point for strategic investors. These aren’t just speculative figures thrown around in forums. The projections come from a deeper look at the platform’s planned ecosystem rollout, protocol revenue mechanics, and early-stage fundamentals that align with tokens that have previously outperformed. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM’s bullish forecasts are based on two core ideas: supply alignment and organic value generation. Unlike many presale tokens that overinflate supply or rely solely on marketing buzz, Mutuum Finance is working toward utility from the start. Its ecosystem is being built around a non-custodial finance protocol that rewards activity, encourages retention, and funnels real value back into the token. Key features like smart-contract-based earnings, future governance roles, and capital-efficient incentives are drawing attention not only from individual buyers but also from mid-size DeFi-focused capital groups. The projected listing price is set to be $0.06, but the conversation is already shifting toward how high it can climb once the platform and integrations go live. When evaluating what cryptocurrency to invest in, especially pre-launch, that kind of structural planning often signals long-term viability over short-term hype.. Traders who specialize in early-stage opportunities understand how critical entry positioning is. At a presale price of $0.025, even a move to $2 would deliver a 7,900% return. When the token reaches $4, that would translate to a 15,900% gain—all from getting in before the public listing. But the strategy here isn’t just about price targets. It’s about aligning entry with ecosystem readiness. Mutuum’s internal mechanics, treasury allocation model, and product timeline are all designed to support healthy growth—without rushing the process. That factor alone is setting the project apart from the growing number of new cryptocurrencies. One area that hasn’t been talked about enough is how mtTokens, the interest-bearing tokens in Mutuum’s system, could serve larger roles within the DeFi space. Beyond simply representing deposits, they may eventually be used in third-party protocols or DEXs for additional yield or liquidity pairing. As decentralized finance continues evolving, tokens that carry built-in utility and measurable performance will hold more value in ecosystems beyond their origin platform. Mutuum’s early alignment with this principle adds weight to long-term price predictions. For investors exploring the best cryptocurrency to invest in, assets with this kind of flexibility and future composability are gaining more attention than short-lived hype tokens. It’s not just Mutuum’s roadmap that makes this entry window attractive—it’s market psychology. Often, projects that hit public exchanges with a working product, strategic reserve plans, and transparent token allocation outperform those built entirely around marketing. With its presale progressing and awareness starting to build, there’s a narrowing window where early entry comes at a fraction of future valuations. That dynamic is familiar to traders who got in early on altcoins like ETH and SOL before their first big cycle. MUTM now appears to be forming that same setup—still accessible, still overlooked, but structurally ready for the kind of growth that fits the $2–$4 narrative. Mutuum Finance isn’t aiming for buzz—it’s steadily delivering on a roadmap centered around real product development. For those weighing their next move and asking which crypto to buy today for long-term positioning, this may be one of the few presale tokens still offering real fundamentals below $0.05. With the platform’s full launch approaching, including deeper integrations and ecosystem expansion, entry at this stage looks less like a gamble—and more like a strategic decision. The price is still low. The mechanics are in place. And the $2–$4 window may arrive sooner than expected.

The date draws attention due to an alignment of regulatory, institutional, and legal factors that could significantly impact XRP’s market outlook. #XRP is about to enter one of the most important moments in its history. Imagine holding 5589 XRP before the market explodes. Let me explain in this why May 19 could change everything pic.twitter.com/fS4GaWXENC — J4b1 (@XRPJ4b1) April 27, 2025 XRP Futures ETFs Set to Begin Trading At the heart of this expectation is the anticipated launch of XRP futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the CME Group. This milestone is a potential gateway to the eventual approval of spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. Bitcoin and Ethereum saw substantial market movement following the introduction of futures ETFs before their respective spot versions. If XRP follows a similar trajectory, introducing futures-based funds could accelerate mainstream financial adoption. Over 70 cryptocurrency-related ETF applications are pending approval in the U.S. , with more than ten specifically tied to XRP spot offerings. This development increases the likelihood that spot ETFs will follow. The New Regulatory Environment The recent appointment of Paul Atkins as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) represents another significant shift. Replacing former chair Gary Gensler, Atkins is widely recognized for supporting market-accessible policies and fostering innovation within the financial sector. His leadership is expected to create a more open and constructive atmosphere for crypto regulation. The regulatory shift is already being felt across federal agencies. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has approved guidelines enabling U.S. banks to engage with cryptocurrency-related services , encouraging deeper involvement from major financial entities that previously hesitated due to regulatory ambiguity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The End of the Lawsuit and Macroeconomic Factors Legal clarity around XRP is also on the horizon. The long-standing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC is near its end . A settlement would remove one of the most prominent legal overhangs on XRP and could restore confidence among investors and institutions alike. Outside the U.S., XRP is already seeing progress. Brazil has launched the first XRP ETF . This international initiative shows growing institutional demand for XRP and demonstrates the token’s increasing legitimacy on the global stage. As J4b1 noted , XRP is shifting from a retail playground to a full institutional arena. Political sentiment within the U.S. also appears to be warming to digital assets. These developments, combined with possible geopolitical stability and easing tensions in Eastern Europe, may open the door for more risk-on investment behavior in global markets. With futures ETFs preparing to launch on May 19, token holders may be on the verge of witnessing a critical transition that could redefine their role in retail and institutional financial systems.

They arrested 12 people, nine men and three women, aged between 20 and 40, across several districts in mainland China and Hong Kong for their involvement. Now, they’ve all been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. Hong Kong officers seized over $98,000 in cash in one of their operations Hong Kong officers found about HK$1.05 million in cash, roughly worth $134000, over 560 ATM cards, several mobile phones, and bank documents in their raids. They also discovered that the laundering team actively recruited mainland Chinese individuals to open shell bank accounts and receive proceeds from fraud cases. Additionally, Superintendent Shirley Kwok Ching-yee revealed that the recruits used different bank cards to take out cash. They subsequently moved it to virtual asset exchanges to be converted into cryptocurrency before it was laundered. The laundering team allegedly also leased an apartment in Hong Kong’s Mong Kok area to organize and execute its money laundering operations. Chief Inspector Lo Yuen-shan revealed the syndicate ran its operation from a Mong Kok flat since mid-2024, where mainland recruits were housed to process illicit funds through shell accounts. She added that they caught two of the network leaders after tailing them from their flat. They trailed one into a bank and the other withdrawing cash from an ATM before the pair left to go to a crypto exchange shop in Tsim Sha Tsui. They confiscated around HK$770,000 in cash during the operation, or about $98,000. Additional arrests came after raids in several districts in the city. Lo claimed that over $1.2 million, roughly HK$10 million of laundered funds, were tied to 58 reported fraud cases. Fraud-related crimes had risen by over 12% in 2024 in Hong Kong Lately, police officers have been demanding stricter sentences against all those involved in money laundering, including those who let criminals use their bank accounts. Senior Inspector Tse Ka-lun of Hong Kong’s Commercial Crime Bureau argued that criminals often use their friends’ and families’ bank accounts to launder stolen funds. Money laundering offenders are currently up for about 14 years in jail and a HK$5 million ($640K) fine. However, for nearly two years, at least 100 people convicted of money laundering were given longer sentences, mostly additions of three to 18 months. Nevertheless, fraud-related crimes have been surging. In 2024, fraud cases rose by over 12% since 2023, with over 10,000 people arrested. Out of the 10,000 apprehended, over 70% were shell account holders. Not to mention, all the fraud cases in 2024 represented almost half of the total 95,000 criminal cases. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced new guidelines for crypto exchanges providing staking services in April. One of the new rules requires exchanges to acquire written approval before providing any services. Exchanges must also reveal all risks and information on fees, unstaking processes, outage processes, and custodial arrangements to clients. Additionally, the platforms must detail their staking activities to the SFC. Earlier, the commission also outlined a framework to enhance market access, diversify crypto products, bolster crypto infrastructure, and build relationships with industry players.

After gaining over 68% since its April lows, ADA is showing strong signs of recovery, but it must defend current levels to confirm continuation. This phase is critical, as price action tests a key demand zone that previously triggered significant upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Below ATH – Buying Pressure Weakens As Equities Outperform Adding to the bullish sentiment, on-chain data from Santiment reveals that whales have accumulated over 80 million ADA in the past 48 hours. This surge in large-scale buying activity points to growing confidence among big players, potentially setting the stage for a breakout. Whales often lead major market moves, and their renewed interest in Cardano may be signaling a sustained rally ahead. However, the $0.90 level now acts as a near-term resistance, and reclaiming it will be essential to unlock higher targets. The coming days are likely to be pivotal for ADA’s price structure. If bulls manage to flip this level, the next leg up could bring Cardano back into the spotlight—possibly reigniting broader altcoin enthusiasm in the process. Whale Accumulation Signals Strength: Buyers Push For A Breakout Despite this impressive rebound, ADA remains 43% below its December 2024 highs around $1.32. This gap highlights the cautious optimism that dominates the altcoin landscape. While bulls are gradually regaining control, overall market fear and macroeconomic uncertainty continue to pressure altcoins, many of which are still struggling to push through key resistance levels. ADA is currently consolidating just above the $0.74 level, forming a base that could precede a breakout. Market structure is tightening, and the next move—upward or downward- will likely be sharp. A decisive push above $0.90 would confirm a breakout and likely trigger renewed interest from retail and institutional investors. Fueling this narrative is fresh data from top analyst Ali Martinez, who reported that whales have purchased over 80 million ADA in the last 48 hours. This large-scale accumulation points to increasing confidence among big players and could act as a catalyst for further upside. Whale activity often precedes strong price action, and this development supports the idea that ADA may be on the verge of a significant move. As ADA consolidates near critical support and whale interest grows, market watchers are closely monitoring for signs of continuation. If bulls maintain momentum and break past resistance, Cardano could quickly shift from a consolidation phase to a full-scale rally, potentially reigniting momentum across the altcoin sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces Resistance Against Bitcoin – ETH/BTC Bullish Structure In Question Cardano Holds Crucial Support As Bulls Aim For Recovery Cardano is currently trading around $0.74, testing a key support zone after failing to hold above the $0.80 mark. The chart shows a strong surge earlier in May that brought ADA to local highs near $0.90, but since then, the price has retraced and is now consolidating just above its 200-day EMA (around $0.71). This level is acting as dynamic support and could be critical for the next move. The price structure suggests ADA is in a decisive phase. A breakdown below the EMA and the horizontal support around $0.72 could expose the token to a deeper retracement toward previous consolidation zones. On the other hand, reclaiming $0.80 would invalidate the bearish scenario and signal a potential push toward $0.90 and eventually $1.00—an area that marks strong historical resistance. Volume has declined slightly during the recent pullback, suggesting the retracement may be driven more by profit-taking than panic selling. The 200 SMA above at $0.80 remains a key target to watch for bullish continuation.

Blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain suggested that the investor made such an impressive feat by betting on Launchcoin, which is built in the Solana ( SOL ) ecosystem. At the moment, investors are turning to Remittix (RTX) to replicate similar returns for its holders. With the on-chain data spotting inflows north of $15 million, experts are making bold predictions of Remittix returning 100x returns when it launches. Let’s delve deeper! Remittix: The PayFi crypto with 100x upside potential Source: Remittix While Solana meme coins are cherished for their highly volatile ride, Remittix is gaining traction for one simple reason: it solves a real problem. Sending money across borders is still clunky, costly, and time-consuming, but Remittix makes it seamless. It lets market participants convert over 40 digital assets into fiat and send funds directly to any global bank account with no delays. With Remittix, the edge over traditional banks and even fintech competitors like Stripe and Wise is clear. Its PayFi protocol allows users to pay a flat fee with no hidden FX or wire costs; what’s sent is what’s received. The process is also as straightforward as any global transfer can be. The person receiving funds just gets a normal bank transfer without even knowing it originated from crypto. This is intentional because users get full control and flexibility while avoiding confusion on the other end. Meanwhile, Remittix opens doors for businesses, NGOs, and corporations. Its Pay API lets merchants accept crypto and settle in fiat to any chosen bank account. With this innovation, companies can easily and quickly pay international employees and freelancers with minimal fees. Transparent, Fast, and inclusive, Remittix has already raised $15 million in its presale, with more than two-thirds of its 750 million ICO allocation nearly sold out. At just $0.0757 right now and with a $250k giveaway underway, Remittix’s momentum can land smart money traders 100x during its launch. Why cryptos pump on the Solana network: A fertile ground for meme coins? Solana meme coins are booming. Besides, Launchcoin tokens like BONK and WIF have surged in popularity, drawing attention from smart money traders. Behind these impressive achievements is the Solana ecosystem, which is thriving according to Ali Martinez. In his X post , Glassnode reported that the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million in May. This rapid increase in smallholder wallets points to a rising wave of adoption and network participation, particularly as interest in the network intensifies. Source: Ali Martinez on X On the institutional front, Brazil’s B3 exchange will open Solana futures contracts on June 16 following regulatory approval. The SEC is now looking over Grayscale’s application for a spot Solana ETF. Polymarket, the largest decentralized betting platform , reports that investors are predicting an 82% chance for a SOL ETF approval. Conclusion While the Solana ecosystem grows, industrial experts are looking at another project to replicate Launchcoin’s latest rally. With the presale price now at $0.0757 and over $15 million raised, Remittix has the potential to surge 100x when it launches. Remittix’s undeniable utility within a lucrative sector has impressed both PayFi enthusiasts and crypto investors. For any smart money trader looking to get ahead of the curve, this market disruptor is not a project to pass up on.

Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg. After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and 225 Ether ( ETH ) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings. He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access. After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman’s funds were stored in a hardware wallet. He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase’s interface. Nine days later, a second caller claiming to be from Coinbase repeated the process. By the end of that call, all of Suman’s crypto holdings were gone. Crypto scammers impersonate Coinbase support.

Despite recent fluctuations, the asset is trading near $2.37 , reflecting an increase of approximately 374% from its price in early November 2024. This dramatic price movement has led to renewed discussion among analysts and community figures about the appropriate investment strategy for XRP holders. Crypto commentator and XRP community figure Vale has reiterated that holding at least 50,000 XRP is essential for serious investors. According to him, this amount should be viewed as a minimum threshold, especially in light of the evolving requirements to be ranked among the wealthiest XRP holders. I told ya’ll 50k $XRP is the minimum . Now like at how much XRP you need to be at just the 1% EXACTLY what I said —> 50,000!!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/ekBaHnT7BQ — KINGVALEX (@VALELORDX) May 16, 2025 Entry into XRP’s Top 1% Wealth Bracket Becoming Less Accessible Vale’s position aligns closely with current data from the XRP Rich List , which shows that an investor needs just over 51,000 tokens to be counted among the top 1% of holders. This figure has decreased gradually in recent months, making it appear more attainable numerically. However, as the token’s price has risen significantly, the financial cost of acquiring this number of tokens has surged, effectively making top-tier entry more expensive despite the lower token requirement. For context, in January 2025, the minimum amount of tokens required to reach the 1% threshold stood at 56,304. By April 1, 2025, it had dropped to 52,030. Most recently, that figure has declined further to 51,070. Though fewer tokens are required, the current market value of 50,000 XRP is approximately $118,500, well beyond what it would have cost just months ago. Historical Perspective on Accumulation Strategy Vale has long encouraged early and aggressive accumulation of the token. In late 2023, he publicly responded to a user who shared that they held 9,000 XRP, asserting that such a figure was insufficient for serious long-term positioning. He emphasized 50,000 XRP as a reasonable target even when the token traded for around $0.62, placing the total cost near $31,000. This stance remained consistent in October 2024, when Vale reiterated his 50,000 token recommendation in response to another investor holding 38,000 XRP. The token’s price hovered around $0.51 at that time, making the target cost roughly $25,500. Those who followed his advice then are now in a considerably stronger position as prices have soared. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investment Barriers Grow with Price Appreciation As XRP trades above $2.30, the cost to purchase 50,000 tokens now exceeds $118,000, more than four times what it would have cost less than a year ago. For new investors or those who hesitated in the past, reaching this benchmark has become increasingly difficult. According to the latest data, anyone aiming to join the top 1% XRP holders would now need to invest over $121,000. This rising barrier has reignited debate over how much XRP an investor needs to be well-positioned for future gains. While Vale maintains that 50,000 is the ideal minimum, not all analysts agree. Alternate Views on Reasonable Holdings Some industry participants believe a small amount of XRP tokens could yield substantial returns if the asset hits higher targets. For example, Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has proposed 10,000 XRP as a realistic and sufficient benchmark for long-term investors. His view suggests that while high accumulation may be advantageous, smaller positions could benefit significantly if the token meets long-term projections. With the asset continuing to draw institutional and retail interest, the debate around accumulation strategies remains active. While top-tier entry thresholds have declined in token count, their rising monetary cost highlights the challenges of late-stage accumulation.

After experiencing a significant dip to $2.307 on high volume, XRP has established an upward trajectory with a series of higher lows, suggesting continued momentum as it approaches resistance levels. Technical indicators point to a potential bullish breakout, with multiple analysts highlighting critical support at $2.35-$2.40 that must hold for upward continuation.

In the last hour, XRP climbed from $2.358 to $2.368, representing a 0.42% gain with notable volume spikes at 01:52 and 01:55. Price surged past resistance at $2.36 to reach $2.366, later establishing new local highs at $2.369 during 02:03 session on substantial volume (539,987). Currently maintaining strength above $2.368 support level with decreasing volatility suggesting potential continuation of upward trajectory.

Together, these assets represent a blend of institutional strength, technological innovation, and viral early-stage potential. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! XRP: Legal Clarity and Whale Confidence Powering Momentum Fresh off its court victories, XRP is rallying around $2.21 , and whales are making moves—now holding 12% of the circulating supply , according to Santiment. Analysts are eyeing key targets at $3, $4.85, and even $6.22 , fueled by renewed institutional inflows and favorable momentum. If this trend continues, some even believe XRP could challenge Ethereum’s market cap over the next cycle. While short-term volatility remains, the long-term setup looks stronger than ever. Kaspa (KAS): The High-Speed Underdog With Real Utility Often overlooked, Kaspa is building quietly as a top-tier proof-of-work network. Trading near $0.055 , KAS shows strong support and is targeting $0.11 in the coming months. With a unique BlockDAG architecture , growing developer activity, and consistent volume, analysts view Kaspa as a dark horse ready to shine in late 2025. Solana (SOL): Back With Strong Technicals and Ecosystem Growth After rebounding from April lows, Solana (SOL) is trading around $169.43 , supported by a bullish RSI of 73.70 and MACD crossover. Prices are now well above both the 100- and 200-day EMAs , reinforcing bullish sentiment. Experts are forecasting near-term targets of $180–$200 , with long-term upside pointing to $350–$370 if the Solana ecosystem continues its current expansion. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Undervalued Altcoin With 36x Potential HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY — THIS ENTRY WON’T LAST While the majors lead headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly becoming one of the most explosive early-stage altcoins in the market. With over $8 million raised , a presale price below $0.001 , and a target listing at $0.007 , early traders are lining up for 25x–36x returns . What’s driving the buzz? Scarcity-based tokenomics built for long-term upside Fully audited by HASHEX , boosting investor confidence A politically charged, meme-fueled narrative with viral potential Bonus opportunity: MAGA50X promo code delivers an additional 50% token bonus This isn’t just hype—it’s a structured, well-timed launch that’s gaining serious momentum. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion: 4 Coins Leading the Next Altcoin Wave XRP, Kaspa, Solana , and MAGACOIN FINANCE are shaping up as four of the most strategic plays heading into the next market leg. With a mix of established dominance and emerging explosiveness, these assets represent a strong blend of confidence, innovation, and early ROI positioning . If you’re looking to stay ahead of the trend, these are the names to watch— especially MAGACOIN FINANCE , which may still be flying just under the radar.

According to a May 14 statement from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rules will mandate that platforms record full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction must also be logged with specifics such as the cryptocurrency used and the amount transferred. UK Crypto Reporting Rules to Cover Companies, Trusts, and Charities The reporting obligation extends beyond individual users to include companies, trusts, and charities engaged in crypto activity. Firms that fail to comply or submit inaccurate data may face penalties of up to £300 ($398) per user. Authorities say they will provide additional guidance in the coming months but are urging businesses to begin preparations now. These changes mark the UK’s adoption of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Cryptoasset Reporting Framework, which aims to standardize tax reporting obligations across jurisdictions. “The UK is open for business — but closed to fraud, abuse, and instability,” said Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves in April when unveiling a draft bill aimed at bringing crypto exchanges, custodians, and broker-dealers under stricter oversight. The proposed legislation is designed to combat scams and fraud while enhancing consumer protection and boosting confidence in the sector. The policy shift comes amid rising crypto adoption in the UK. A Financial Conduct Authority study from November 2024 found that 12% of UK adults held crypto assets, up from just 4% in 2021. The UK just proposed a major shift in #cryptoasset regulation. The draft rules from @HMTreasury bring trading, custody, #staking and #stablecoins under existing UK financial laws, embedding crypto into the #FSMA framework rather than building a separate regime. A few key… pic.twitter.com/rLAtrioeay — MiCA Crypto Alliance (@MiCA_Alliance) May 9, 2025 The UK’s approach stands in contrast to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. While MiCA imposes stricter rules on stablecoin issuers — including volume limits — the UK has opted for a more flexible framework. Foreign stablecoin issuers will be allowed to operate without registration, and no cap will be imposed on transaction volumes, offering greater leeway for innovation. UK Trade Associations Urge Special Crypto Envoy Appointment Earlier this year, a coalition of leading UK trade associations called on Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government to appoint a special envoy for crypto and develop a comprehensive action plan to support the digital assets and blockchain sector. In a letter addressed to Varun Chandra, Starmer’s special adviser on business and investment, six UK digital economy organizations stressed the need for stronger strategic alignment to unlock investment, growth, and job creation within the crypto industry. In September 2024, the UK government introduced a new bill aimed at clarifying the status of digital assets, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), cryptocurrencies, and carbon credits, as “things” and “personal property” under the nation’s property laws. The UK has been among the countries that have ramped up regulatory efforts following some high-profile bankruptcies last year. The FCA oversees crypto activities, focusing on anti-money laundering measures and consumer protection.

According to Hong Kong Commercial Daily , the criminal syndicate used over 500 so-called stooge accounts (bank accounts opened or provided by third parties) to receive proceeds from fraud cases. The money was then funneled through local crypto exchange shops, effectively masking its origins. Crypto Laundering Ring Operated from Mong Kok Apartment, Police Say The group is believed to have operated out of a rented apartment in Mong Kok, where they planned and coordinated laundering activities. Authorities say more than HK$9.4 million ($1.2 million) of the funds can be linked to at least 58 confirmed fraud cases. The operation came to a head on May 15 after police surveillance tracked two suspected syndicate recruits leaving the Mong Kok base—one visiting a bank, the other an ATM. Both individuals later attempted to convert cash into cryptocurrency at a shop in Tsim Sha Tsui. Officers intervened before the funds could be laundered, arresting both on the spot and seizing around HK$770,000 ($98,540) in cash. Ten additional suspects, aged between 20 and 41, were apprehended soon after. During the raids, authorities recovered approximately HK$1.05 million ($134,370) in cash, over 560 ATM cards, several mobile phones, and documents linked to bank and crypto transactions. Senior Inspector Tse Ka-lun of the Commercial Crime Bureau stated that many of the bank accounts used in the scheme were provided by friends and relatives of those involved, often without understanding the full extent of the criminal activity. The arrests come amid a surge in fraud-related crimes in the city. Reports of fraud rose by 12% in 2024, with over 10,000 related arrests.

Hong Kong Intensifies Crypto Crackdown The crackdown coincides with Hong Kong’s broader efforts to tighten oversight of its crypto sector. Last week, Hong Kong Cyber ​​Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) announced the launch of a virtual asset analysis tool to aid in crypto crime investigations. Dubbed ‘CryptoTrace’, the tool is developed in collaboration with the University of Hong Kong, offering “advanced intelligence and investigation support to crime investigation units.” The Bureau said that they conducted virtual asset investigations and CryptoTrace training sessions in March. The course was aimed at strengthening the capabilities of frontline officers in handling virtual asset cases. In addition to fighting crypto-related crimes, CSTCB has been actively engaging with stakeholders across sectors. Titus, a legal firm in Hong Kong, noted that the city-state lost a staggering $3.1 billion in the first 10 months of 2024 to crypto-related scams. Additionally, the government recently exposed a sophisticated scam related to the fake “National Hong Kong Coin.” The scam misled the public into believing the government would soon launch an official digital currency.

As XRP’s price movements come under speculation following a recent court ruling, Unilabs is attracting investors, gaining over $30m AUM. Table of Contents XRP price dips to $2.40 following settlement setback Unilabs: The AI-based asset platform looking to challenge XRP Can Unilabs challenge XRP gains? Unilabs (UNIL), a new AI-powered DeFi platform, has been gaining traction after a successful presale launch, garnering over $30m in AUM. Ripple, on the other hand, continues to demonstrate strong potential within the crypto market. However, a recent court ruling has seen XRP’s price dip to the $2.40 level. Unilabs, currently in stage two of its presale, has already seen a 27% price rally, owing to early-stage investments for its transformative approach to automated asset allocation. As the platform continues to gain traction, many believe it could challenge XRP in terms of growth and returns. XRP price dips to $2.40 following settlement setback XRP witnessed a market dip following a key court decision in its legal dispute with the US SEC. Judge Torres rejected Ripple’s joint motion with the US SEC, pointing to multiple procedural violations. If the settlement had materialized, it would have reversed an earlier ruling and reduced Ripple’s previous penalty of $125 million. The news led to a market reaction that saw the XRP price dip to the $2.40 level. Despite the dip, XRP still holds a monthly surge of over 15%. If the crypto sustains momentum above the $2.40 and $2.50 levels, a breakout toward the $3.00 level could be next. This will also open the door for a potential retest of the 2018 all-time high. However, a rejection of the XRP price at its current level might trigger a dipping trend toward the $2.25 level. For now, technical indicators point to increased whale accumulation and institutional players, which could also propel XRP price gains in the coming days.

This provides users with the chance to capitalize on its presale stages and enjoy a higher return on investment. Can Unilabs challenge XRP gains? With the XRP price seeking to regain an uptrend momentum despite its recent dip, investors are closely monitoring its momentum. Unilabs offers a different kind of opportunity to investors, one that’s diversified, AI-powered, and still in its early presale stages. This has seen some XRP investors diversify into UNIL, attracted by its low entry price of $0.0051 and its potential in the market.

According to La Tribune Dimanche , Lagarde told the paper on Saturday that instead of the dollar gaining ground during global uncertainty like it usually does, the euro is the one going up. “It’s impressive to note that in a period of uncertainty when we should normally have seen the dollar appreciate significantly, the opposite happened: the euro appreciated against the dollar,” she said. Her explanation: people in the markets no longer trust how Trump is running things. Lagarde called the moment “counterintuitive” but not surprising. She said the dollar is falling because of what she described as confusion and loss of confidence caused by the president’s actions. In her words, “uncertainty is permanent and renewed daily” in the United States, and that is pushing investors toward Europe. She also said this isn’t a problem for Europe — “more than a threat, it is an opportunity.” She told the paper that now is the time for European Union leaders to move faster and finish what she called the job of integration. Lagarde calls for deeper EU integration to capitalize on currency change Lagarde explained that Europe is being seen as more reliable right now. She said the region offers a “stable economic and political area,” with a strong currency and a central bank that isn’t under any political pressure. She warned that the US can no longer claim that same kind of independence. She didn’t mention any names in that part, but she was clearly pointing at Trump’s frequent outbursts at the Federal Reserve. Lagarde warned that a central bank being controlled by politicians never ends well. “The independence of the central bank is fundamental to monetary and financial hygiene within a country or group of countries,” she said. “In every case where a central bank has found itself under the thumb of a fiscal authority, it has never ended well.” Lagarde also pushed for more reforms within Europe. She mentioned the digital euro and the single capital market as areas where momentum is building fast. “There is a groundswell more powerful than anything I’ve seen in six years in office,” she said. Lagarde added that the same type of united oversight already in place in Europe’s banking system should be expanded across sectors. The numbers back up what she said. ECB officials stress caution on rates, warn of inflation uncertainty The dollar has dropped this year against every major currency tracked by Bloomberg, including the euro. That’s not a coincidence. Investors are leaving the greenback behind as Trump continues to throw out unpredictable trade moves and threatens the independence of the Fed. His actions have created what Lagarde sees as a clear opening for Europe to step up. Luis de Guindos, her vice president, also commented recently, saying that the euro could become a real alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency. But like Lagarde, he said that would only happen if the EU does more to unify. Isabel Schnabel, an executive board member, made similar remarks the same weekend. “We now have a historic opportunity to further strengthen the international role of the euro,” she said. She called for quick action while the global trust in the euro is at a high point. She also addressed the rising value of the euro directly, saying that it should be read as a show of faith in Europe’s economy. “We now have a historic opportunity,” she repeated, almost echoing her earlier remarks word for word. But she also added one big condition — Europe needs a stronger bond market. She said a massive capital pool is necessary if the euro is going to play a bigger role on the world stage. That also means opening up the conversation on joint debt again, she said. “I do think that it’s not fundamentally wrong to also think about joint debt to finance public goods in Europe,” Schnabel told the podcast. That debate has come and gone before, but with the euro rising and the dollar sliding, European officials now see the moment as too big to waste.

MUTM’s early entry is closing fast,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/18/new-crypto-coin-with-a-buyback-model-mutms-early-entry-is-closing-fast/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is starting to gain serious traction in the DeFi space—not through flash or viral hype, but because of how its system is built to actually function. For many investors who rode the early success of speculative plays like Shiba Inu, Mutuum offers something different: a product-driven protocol that rewards actual engagement and supports sustainable token value. What’s attracting attention isn’t just the current entry price, which remains under $0.03 during the presale, but the fact that the platform is designed around working mechanics—lending, borrowing, and an automatic buyback engine that benefits long-term holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum’s lending and borrowing process revolves around liquidity pools where users can supply assets like ETH or stablecoins. When assets are deposited, suppliers receive mtTokens, which are tokenized receipts that increase in redeemable value as interest accrues. This interest comes from borrowers who tap into the pools by providing overcollateralized positions—backed by accepted crypto assets with a defined Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. The LTV is set based on the volatility of each collateral asset, meaning borrowers can only unlock a portion of their asset’s value, maintaining platform safety and reducing the risk of defaults. Interest rates for borrowers vary depending on pool utilization, and those same dynamics shape the APY that lenders earn, which adjusts in real-time. The higher the pool usage, the more attractive the return for those supplying liquidity. What makes the model even more appealing to those holding mtTokens is how the protocol uses a portion of the borrower interest. Mutuum executes buybacks of MUTM tokens directly from the market. Those tokens are then redistributed to users participating in the system—especially those holding mtTokens in designated reward pools. This cycle means that as borrowing activity grows, so does buying pressure on the token, all while rewards are fed back into the community. For early-stage crypto investors, this kind of setup hits all the right notes. And that’s exactly why many of those who previously gained from Shiba Inu are now allocating toward MUTM. The reasoning is simple: SHIB brought explosive returns, but lacked underlying utility. It was momentum-driven. Mutuum, on the other hand, offers a chance to enter a token at a similarly low price, but with an actual financial mechanism backing its growth. This isn’t about chasing hype—it’s about backing a system that’s built to reward the people who support it early. For those who got in on SHIB before the peak, the lesson was clear: timing matters, but holding something with long-term structure matters even more. Mutuum Finance is now offering MUTM tokens at $0.025 during its ongoing presale, with over 83% of the current phase already filled. Once this round wraps up, the price will increase to $0.03, ahead of the confirmed listing at $0.06, giving early participants a clear pricing edge. So far, the project has raised over $8.4 million, showing strong demand rooted in product fundamentals—not hype. With the beta version of the platform expected post-launch, this presale isn’t just early access—it’s a chance to enter before wider market exposure begins. Holding this token isn’t just about waiting for price movement—it’s tied directly to participating in a system that pays. Lenders earn from protocol activity. Token holders benefit from buybacks. And the entire model is aligned around on-chain behavior, not social campaigns or speculative waves. With the presale closing in on its final stages and the listing price confirmed at $0.06, those looking for strategic entries are watching the last remaining stretch before the token price adjusts upward. For investors asking what crypto to invest in with real upside and built-in utility, MUTM is increasingly looking like a smart decision—not just because of where it’s priced, but because of how it works.

This move, expected to lower the deposit facility rate from the current 2.25% to 1.75%, comes after seven consecutive cuts over the past year. The decision reflects concerns over weak inflation, soft economic growth, and currency effects tied directly to President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. Speaking to the Financial Times , Pierre Wunsch, governor of Belgium’s central bank and one of the 26 members of the ECB Governing Council, said the current environment “might warrant to be mildly supportive” of growth. That translates to interest rates “slightly below 2 percent.” Wunsch made it clear he wasn’t shocked by what markets are expecting. “The way I read them is that, somewhere around the end of 2025, we could be mildly supportive,” he said. This is a full reversal from his tone earlier this year. In February, Wunsch told the same outlet that the central bank should not “sleepwalk to 2 percent [interest rates] without thinking about it.” Now, he’s publicly floating the idea of going even lower. “I’m not pleading to lower interest rates below 2 percent,” he said, “but I’m open to contemplate this possibility.” Wunsch links rate cuts to Trump tariffs Wunsch explained that his change in stance followed Trump’s announcement on April 2 of sweeping tariffs on nearly every major US trading partner. The president slapped 20 percent levies on almost all exports from the EU, though that figure was cut to 10 percent on April 9 for a temporary 90-day negotiation period. Wunsch pointed out that the fallout from these tariffs adds “clear downside risks to inflation” and to growth prospects across the Euro area. He also pointed out that the euro’s appreciation against the dollar—which came after what European officials are calling “liberation day”—has made imports cheaper. That, combined with falling energy prices and the expected arrival of cheaper Chinese goods, could reduce inflation even further. In April, Eurozone inflation stood at 2.2 percent, just above the ECB’s target, but economists say the full impact of lower oil prices hasn’t yet shown up in consumer prices. Wunsch dismissed the idea that Germany’s €1 trillion spending plan to rebuild its military and infrastructure could do anything to stop this short-term slide. “Fiscal policy takes time before it becomes supportive,” he said. He warned the region could be hit with a “negative [economic] shock in the short term” before seeing a “positive shock in 2026 and 2027.” Kazaks sees few cuts left after June Martins Kazaks, Latvia’s central bank governor and another ECB Council member, said Friday on CNBC that the ECB may be approaching the end of its rate-cutting cycle—if the inflation outlook stays stable. “We are relatively close to the terminal rate already,” Kazaks said. He still sees room for a “couple” more cuts this year but stressed that policymakers should not move too fast given the ongoing uncertainty in the global trade environment. Kazaks also said that he considers the market’s expectations “appropriate.” He reiterated that any future decision will depend entirely on incoming data. Investors have priced in another rate cut for June, and they’re betting on more by the end of the year. The primary driver behind those bets: weakening inflation trends and economic headwinds from Trump’s trade policies. New figures from Eurostat added to the urgency. The bloc’s economy only grew 0.3 percent in the first quarter—less than the previous estimate of 0.4 percent. “The risk of a shallow, short recession is in my view still very significant,” Kazaks said. “Maybe not for the euro area as such but for specific countries by all means. So overall the lack of growth is the key story here.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Economy|ECB|EUR,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-18 09:05:18

Shiba Inu price movement amid market shift Shiba Inu has seen a 6.14% price decline over the past week. However, in the past month, it surged by 23.12%. Over the past six months, the memecoin’s value dropped by 40.51%. The current price ranges between $0.000014 and $0.0000175. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0000180, and the support level is at $0.0000101. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 51.16. This suggests that SHIB is neither overbought nor oversold. If it surpasses the resistance level, it could see an increase of around 12%. Conversely, dropping to the support level would mean a decrease of about 20%. PEPE surges nearly 84% in a month: What’s next? PEPE has experienced a remarkable price increase over the past month, rising by 83.66%. Over the last weeK, the price has gone up by 3.61%. Despite thE upward momentum, the coin’s price is still down by 35.33% over the past six months. The current price of PEPE is fluctuating between $0.000012 and $0.000015. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.91. This suggests that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving room for movement in either direction. The nearest resistance level is at $0.000018. If the price breaks above this point, it could signal further upward movement. On the other hand, the nearest support level is at $0.000005. If the price falls below this level, it might indicate a bearish trend. Based on the recent positive price changes, PEPE coin could continue its upward trajectory. However, the neutral RSI suggests that the market could go either way. Traders should watch the resistance and support levels closely, as breaking through these points could lead to significant price movements of nearly 20%. Conclusion While memecoins like SHIB and PEPE have experienced significant growth in the past, their short-term potential appears less promising in the current market. The ongoing bull run is shifting attention toward projects that offer tangible utility and unique features, rather than relying solely on hype.

The unidentified trader offloaded 10,543 ETH worth approximately $26.1 million at an average price of $2,476 per coin, resulting in a $2 million loss in a sale executed in two days, according to the latest on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from Lookonchain on May 17. Details of the transaction show that the ETH was sold through a series of large swaps, most of which occurred within an hour. The trader used 1inch, a decentralized exchange aggregator, and multiple contract interactions to convert wrapped ETH (WETH) into stablecoins like USDC and USDT. ETH whale transaction. Source: Lookonchain This selloff coincided with a slight downturn in the broader cryptocurrency market , during which Ethereum also saw short-term losses. Rather than holding through the dip, the whale opted to exit the position, despite Ethereum maintaining support above the $2,500 level. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows increased whale activity around Ethereum amid the price pullback. On May 17, another large holder withdrew 6,053 ETH, worth roughly $15.66 million, from cryptocurrency exchange OKX, possibly signaling profit-taking following Ethereum’s recent rally.

However, caution is warranted as Ethereum’s 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 66.51, nearing the overbought threshold.

Right now, protocols are stuck: cycling between incentive-driven inflows and inevitable outflows of liquidity as providers chase higher and higher returns. Even with existing bridging and wrapping solutions, because of concerns around complexity and security, most retail investors are unable to or unwilling to distribute their assets effectively across protocols. This leaves over $400 billion worth of idle assets locked across siloed chains whilst protocols across DeFi compete for limited liquidity, their demand vastly outsizing the available supply. Without a global liquidity to unlock these idle assets and enable a shared source of liquidity, DeFi will struggle to supplant traditional finance and reach global adoption. You might also like: The end of payment friction: Why stablecoins and on-chain liquidity are winning | Opinion The liquidity problem Traditional finance thrives on deep, integrated capital markets. The centralized structure of global banks means that liquidity thresholds can be proactively regulated to maintain solvency, and the sheer number of participants in permeable global markets means that there is always capital circulating within any given system. DeFi, by contrast, remains fragmented. A lack of compatibility between competing chains fractures the liquidity of an already small user base, whilst nontechnical participants may struggle to move their assets with the interoperability solutions that currently exist. This limits the capabilities of DeFi as a financial system; simply put, people are able to do less with their capital. This problem is captured in the one-two punch of stagnation and underutilisation. Without access to sufficient liquidity, emerging products struggle to maintain trading volumes, lending capacity, and user activity. To attract liquidity, new projects issue native tokens and offer high APYs or governance rewards. However, whilst these strategies succeed in the short term, this capital remains trapped within individual ecosystems. These ecosystems suffer from sharp outflows when rewards taper off or are bettered elsewhere, slowing down the growth of new and potentially innovative projects. We even see this manifest in formerly dominant protocols, with Ethereum ( ETH ) struggling in the last year. This has come from a cultural shift in DeFi away from promises of long-term utility and instead towards quick returns on memecoins based on Solana ( SOL ), drawing capital from one silo to another in the process. Both the symptoms and causes of some of these liquidity issues are the vast amount of underutilised capital across DeFi. Unlocking this capital also provides a key solution. When we talk about $400 billion worth of idle assets in DeFi, we are talking about ‘premier’ tokens like XRP ( XRP ), Bitcoin ( BTC ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ); tokens with a high market cap, but a comparatively low TVL. These tokens either lack the opportunity to be utilized effectively in staking and trading, or many of their holders lack the technical ability or interest to stake and restake for optimised yield. This represents a substantial imbalance in overall asset valuation and the associated DeFi protocol activity. If we could rectify this imbalance, there would be a flood of liquidity into the market. This would jumpstart the process of investment and innovation that DeFi needs. Towards a global liquidity layer If DeFi is to break free from the cycle of fragmented liquidity and short-term incentives, it must follow TradFi’s lead. Most importantly, it needs to develop a shared liquidity infrastructure to enable the frictionless flow of assets that prospective users have come to expect. The industry is not blind to these problems, and early steps toward global liquidity are already underway. Protocols like Wormhole and LayerZero allow smart contracts to complete orders across chains. Elsewhere, intent-based protocols and advancements in zero-knowledge proofs are beginning to push the boundaries of DeFi’s UX, making capital movement as simple as in TradFi offerings. A unified liquidity layer could create, for instance, an XRP market on Solana, a DOGE market on Avalanche ( AVAX ), and a Cardano ( ADA ) market on Base. This would enable DeFi projects to function like large-scale TradFi institutions, benefiting from deep and stable capital pools, reducing the need for constant incentive programs. Over time, this would eliminate the short-termism of APY wars, encouraging lenders to deploy assets with greater confidence, with a unified liquidity framework mitigating exposure risks without compromising returns. Capital would be fully utilised, liquidity would flow freely to where it is needed, and DeFi’s growth would accelerate. For retail users, this would be a breakthrough. With accessible cross-chain markets, retail investors could easily diversify their assets without having to navigate complex bridges or take unnecessary risks. Furthermore, simplified UX would lower technical barriers, making staking, lending, and trading accessible to users from day one. With reduced exposure, retail users could confidently engage in DeFi, driving adoption, introducing billions of dollars to new markets, and allowing DeFi to reach its lucrative potential. However, if DeFi is truly serious about global liquidity, major ecosystems must move beyond isolated solutions and establish shared standards through interoperable liquidity hubs or decentralized coordination mechanisms. Founders and developers must collaborate for a healthy and prosperous ecosystem, not compete for limited resources. The shift towards unlocking the free-flowing markets of DeFi’s future needs more than one single market-busting product. It will come from a sustained industry-wide effort: a cultural shift towards ambitious and user-friendly product offerings that take into account the needs of both the markets and the customers of the future. Conclusion DeFi’s liquidity problem is more than a matter of inefficiency; it points to structural, cultural, and systemic issues within the industry. Only a coordinated response will allow DeFi to reach its potential. The industry is locked in a cycle of short-term incentives, with key assets siloed and protocols competing for fragmented capital; without a structural shift toward a global liquidity layer, DeFi will struggle to scale, innovate, or offer real alternatives to TradFi. The foundations for this shift exist; it is perhaps even underway, but a coordinated response remains missing. For those that believe in DeFi’s mission, though, a future where liquidity moves freely across chains is non-negotiable; it’s the only way forward.

It writes code, runs tests, and creates requests to incorporate code changes on behalf of users. This helps accelerate the work of programmers in the cloud. OpenAI has launched Codex, a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) agent for software engineers. It is already available for ChatGPT Pro, Team, and Enterprise users, and will soon be available for Plus users. According to the official OpenAI blog, ”Codex is a software engineering agent that can work on multiple tasks in parallel: writing functions, answering code questions, finding and fixing bugs, and creating requests to incorporate code changes.” Each task is performed in a separate environment in the cloud that is preloaded with the user's codebase. Codex can read and edit files, run tests, perform analyses, and conduct type checks-all without Internet access, which guarantees secure execution. Codex is powered by codex-1, a special version of the OpenAI o3 model optimized for software engineering tasks. It has been trained using reinforcement learning on real engineering tasks to match human coding style and team standards. Users can interact with the agent through a sidebar in ChatGPT, giving it tasks or asking questions about the code. Codex captures its actions through terminal logs and test results, allowing transparent verification of each stage of execution. Early partners such as Cisco, Temporal, Superhuman, and Kodiak are already implementing Codex into their daily workflows. ”Codex helps us realize ambitious ideas faster by acting as a smart assistant for engineers,” Cisco noted. Additionally, at Temporal, the agent runs complex tests in the background without distracting developers. At Superhuman, even product managers can make minor code changes without involving an engineer-just with validation. OpenAI also released the lightweight codex-mini-latest model for Codex CLI, an agent that runs in the terminal. It responds faster to requests and is better suited for interactive code work. Codex is available now at no additional cost during the exploratory preview phase. A flexible pricing model is planned for the future. For example, codex-mini-latest is available in the Responses API at $1.50 for 1 million input tokens and $6 for 1 million output tokens, with a 75% discount for repeat requests. ”We envision a future where developers focus on core tasks and delegate the rest to agents.

Many altcoins have marked more substantial gains in the past day, but most of them are reps of the ever-volatile meme coin niche. BTC Consolidation Phase Endures Bitcoin began the business week with some enhanced volatility following the trade deal struck between the US and China. At first, the cryptocurrency shot up to a multi-month peak of almost $106,000 before the bears took brief control of the market and drove it south to under $101,000 hours later. Nevertheless, the predominantly bullish sentiment prevailed and bitcoin remained within six-digit price territory. Moreover, it bounced off and spiked to $105,000 a day later where it found another rejection. The price moves repeated in a smaller extent but BTC overall managed to remain above $103,000. It slipped below that lower boundary yesterday, but that was also short-lived and now sits around $104,000. This has pushed its market capitalization to over $2.060 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has retraced slightly since yesterday, but is still above 60%. Yet, this hasn’t stopped many analysts from speculating that the altseason has started. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Memes Rebound Most altcoins have bounced off after yesterday’s nosedive. Ethereum has reclaimed the $2,500 level after a 2% daily increase, while XRP has neared $2.4 following a similar jump. More impressive daily pumps come from SOL, TRX, AVAX, and LINK. However, the meme coins lead in terms of daily gains. The largest of the bunch has soared by 5% to $0.22 while SHIB is up by 5.5% and sits above $0.000015. Even bigger gains come from the likes of WIF (11%), Fartcoin (9%), BONK (8%), and FLOKI (8%). PI has found a place somewhere between them with a 9% daily increase. However, Pi Network’s token is down by 19% since this time last Sunday. The total crypto market cap has defended the $3.4 trillion line and is up by $30 billion since yesterday.

MUTM Is Topping That List Right Now,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/whats-the-best-crypto-coin-to-buy-with-sub-0-03-entry-mutm-is-topping-that-list-right-now/,"When market sentiment begins to shift and early momentum returns to altcoins, smart investors focus on one key factor: strategic entry pricing. At the top of conversations around undervalued assets right now is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a new cryptocurrency that’s gaining serious traction while still priced below $0.03. With rising inflows and an active presale nearing its final stages, MUTM isn’t being overlooked anymore. It’s now widely considered one of the best crypto coins to buy ahead of the next market move, and for good reason. This project isn’t just a token—it’s a functioning DeFi protocol in development, with features that directly link utility to token value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum’s presale is currently in Phase 4, and over 83% has already sold out. The current entry point sits at $0.025, but that’s not going to last. The next phase will increase the token price to $0.03, while the launch price has been officially set at $0.06. Investors aren’t waiting for listings to get in. They’re moving now—because the setup is clear: early buyers are securing pricing that analysts believe could jump over 2,100% shortly after launch, with a projected surge toward $0.56. That forecast isn’t just based on sentiment—it’s grounded in infrastructure. The core reason behind this aggressive forecast is simple: utility-backed demand. The Mutuum team has announced that a beta release of the platform will go live alongside the token’s official launch. That means users will be able to access live features—borrowing, lending, stablecoin interactions—right as the token hits the market. That alone changes the post-launch dynamic. Most new crypto coins debut without working products, relying on hype alone. Mutuum’s different. The foundation is being built in parallel with the token, and that’s one of the main reasons investors are viewing it as a top cryptocurrency to invest in—not later, but right now. The buzz doesn’t stop at product readiness either. With active platform mechanics and liquidity engagement in place, MUTM is expected to be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges shortly after launch. Higher-tier listings bring visibility, and with that comes demand—which could further accelerate the token’s rise in value. What’s Powering the Protocol? Lending & Borrowing: Users can lend assets like ETH or stablecoins and earn returns. Borrowers overcollateralize their loans, protecting liquidity while giving users access to short-term capital. P2C & P2P Models: Mutuum offers Peer-to-Contract lending for those seeking a hands-off way to earn passive income, while its Peer-to-Peer model allows users to create tailored loan agreements directly with other participants. Buyback Mechanism: A portion of borrower interest is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, redistributing them to active users. This ensures that token demand is always linked to actual platform use. Stablecoin Utility: The protocol is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, minted from excess collateral in lending markets, and algorithmically pegged to USD value. Layer 2 Compatibility: Mutuum is preparing for Layer 2 integration, reducing gas fees and ensuring smooth operation as the platform scales. Audit Underway: To reinforce user trust, the project is undergoing a security audit by CertiK, one of the most respected firms in blockchain smart contract verification. To further incentivize early participation, the Mutuum team has introduced a $100,000 giveaway exclusively for presale contributors. Anyone who purchases during the presale has the opportunity to qualify, with full details available on the official platform. It’s another reason why early positioning is drawing both retail investors and DeFi-focused capital. MUTM is topping more than just watchlists—it’s leading a shift in how investors define value in new cryptocurrency. With working features, a self-sustaining token model, and a clear roadmap, it offers one of the few chances to enter at a sub-$0.03 valuation before the broader market takes notice. For those looking to secure the best crypto coin to buy now, Mutuum Finance checks every box: price, timing, utility, and traction. This is more than a presale—it’s the setup for a breakout. And the opportunity to get in at this stage is closing quickly.

After hitting $74,652 earlier this year, BTC has made a V-shaped recovery and is now above $104,000 and heading towards $109,427. This technical pattern – sharp declines followed by sharp rebounds – is a sign of strong market conviction and often precedes big rallies. Since breaking above the 50-day EMA ($94,870), Bitcoin has been in a steep trend with higher lows and accumulation. Bitcoin's V-Shaped Recovery is Complete From $74K lows to $104K highs, BTC has staged a textbook V-shaped reversal—fast fall, faster rebound. Bulls now eye $109K… and beyond. #Bitcoin #BTC #Crypto #VShapeRecovery #CryptoTrading pic.twitter.com/idFi5AFsAq — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) May 18, 2025 Despite some caution in the momentum indicators, especially the MACD showing decreasing bullish volume, price structure is good. This rebound also comes with institutional flows and broader crypto market optimism. Bitcoin Price Chart (V-Shaped Recovery) – Source: Tradingview V-Recovery Highlights: Rebounded from $74,652 to $104,000+ Reclaimed 50-day EMA at $94,870 Targeting $109,427 Bitcoin Analysis – Symmetrical Triangle Breakout Bitcoin price prediction appear bullish in the long run, though short-term analysis indicates indecision. On the 1-hour chart, BTC is coiling in a symmetrical triangle – an indecision zone that often precedes big breakouts. At $104,007, the price is pressing against the triangle’s upper resistance and horizontal barrier at $104,550. Technically, Bitcoin is looking good beneath the surface. The MACD has turned green, the 50-period EMA ($103,421) is holding as support and recent candles are showing increasing buying pressure and higher lows. If bulls can confirm a breakout with a strong 1-hour candle above $104,550, BTC could quickly go to $105,668 and possibly $106,685. But if it doesn’t break out cleanly, it could go back to $103,000 or $102,700 before the next attempt. Bitcoin Price Chart (symmetrical triangle pattern) – Source: Tradingview $120K in Sight for Bitcoin? Macro Momentum Building With Bitcoin’s V-shaped recovery and technical pressure building, eyes are now on $120,000 – a psychological and Fibonacci extension target if BTC clears $109K cleanly. Short-term resistance needs to be respected but long-term sentiment is getting bullish. The broader setup is also bullish: Whale accumulation is increasing, according to on-chain data ETF inflows are strong Institutional sentiment is shifting from cautious to opportunistic Conclusion Bitcoin is looking good on both daily and 1-hour charts. Technicals are in place and sentiment is improving. $120K is not out of reach if bulls can get above $104,550. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.84M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As Bitcoin stabilizes above $102K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $5,919,969.28/ $6,844,387 Token Price: $0.002515 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily. According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin ( BTC )’s role as a monetary protocol. “No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote , arguing that the OP_RETURN limit increases were justified in the past under false assumptions. He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data. Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools. Source: Adam Back Related: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overview Ammous compares Bitcoin spam to email Ammous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system. “It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions. “So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added. The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy. Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems. Source: Saifedean Ammous The conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder. In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages. Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.

After making a strong run toward the $2,700 mark on Tuesday, May 13, the altcoin’s price has struggled to build on its momentum over the past few days. The price of ETH did manage to stay above the $2,500 mark over the past week, bouncing back from the psychological level on Thursday, May 15. However, the recent struggles seem to have compounded over the weekend, with the Ethereum price losing the $2,500 level to end the week. The Next Support Cushion For ETH Price Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to the social media platform X to share an interesting on-chain outlook on the price of Ethereum and its latest lack of bullish momentum. Following the dip of ETH beneath the $2,500 mark, the online pundit has identified the altcoin’s next significant support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Market Signals Further Upside Potential For BTC Price: New ATH Soon? This evaluation revolves around the average cost basis of several Ethereum investors. Cost-basis analysis basically measures the ability of a price level to act as support or resistance — based on the total amount of coins last purchased by investors at this level. As shown in the chart above, the size of the circles directly corresponds with the quantity of ETH tokens bought within each price zone and the region’s significance as support or resistance. In essence, the bigger the dot, the higher the number of tokens, and the stronger the support or resistance; the green dots are support (as they are usually below the current price), while the red dots represent resistance (as they are above the asset price). Data provided by Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shows that the Ethereum price has key support around the $2,354 – $2,430 zone, where 2.64 million addresses purchased 63.9 million tokens (worth $153.04 billion at an average price of $2,395). As Martinez highlighted, this price bracket would serve as an on-chain cushion for the ETH price, as investors with their cost bases around the level would likely defend their positions by buying more tokens if the price falls toward $2,400. The fresh buying pressure around this price region would help counter the downward pressure, thereby keeping the Ethereum price afloat. The highlighted chart shows that it is all clear blue skies for the price of Ethereum, with no significant resistance lying ahead. However, the altcoin will need to hold above the $2,400 level, or it risks falling to as low as $2,200. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,480, reflecting a 0.7% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin is down by nearly 4% on the weekly timeframe.

According to reports, authorities seized assets worth $4.5 million, including a beachfront mansion, luxury cars, and Bitcoin, from the convicted individual. According to reports, the individual, 32-year-old Shane Duffy, from Queensland, saw millions worth of those assets seized after a lengthy investigation into his illegal activities. He was apprehended on charges of stealing digital assets and cyber hacking. The authorities seized Duffy’s beachfront home back in April. In addition, the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) of the AFP also seized a 2019 black Mercedes-Benz sedan and about 25 Bitcoins. AFP seizes assets worth $4.5 million from hacker According to reports, Duffy was suspected of carrying out the theft of about 950 bitcoins from a French crypto exchange in 2013. The assets are now worth about $150 million. Before then, he had been convicted of hacking Riot Games, the US company behind the popular video game League of Legends. In 2018, the CACT initiated an investigation after AUSTRAC was alerted to the development by authorities in Luxembourg about his suspicious bitcoin transactions. However, the authorities have yet to bring up criminal charges in connection with the alleged theft. Meanwhile, they have been able to halt the suspected proceeds of the alleged crime under federal laws, even without a prosecution. Authorities were able to secure the restraining order for the assets obtained in 2019, and they were subsequently forfeited in April. According to the AFP, the assets include a waterfront mansion in Beachmere, Queensland’s Moreton Bay region, which was purchased at about $1.1 million, and is now estimated to be worth about $2 million. The authorities added that the property was held in the suspect’s mother’s name. CACT has seized criminal assets worth $1.2 billion After the sale of the seized properties, the proceeds are expected to be transferred into a special fund that assists crime prevention and law enforcement initiatives. The AFP says it is still committed to confiscating alleged proceeds to disrupt the activities of criminals and cybercrime. AFP Commander Jason Kennedy highlighted the law backing the seizure. “The Proceeds of Crime Act provides law enforcement agencies with unique powers to restrain and forfeit instruments and proceeds of crime,” he said. He added that criminals are driven by greed, and unfortunately it is law-abiding Australians and businesses who end up losing their hard-earned money to these cybercriminals. “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts, which is why the AFP works closely with our partners in the CACT to target the proceeds of crime and ensure they are reinvested in the community,” he said. According to reports, the CACT has seized criminal assets worth over $1.2 billion since 2019. These assets include houses, cars, fine art, luxury items, and digital assets. According to court documents obtained by the media, Duffy allegedly accumulated more than $32,000 in 2013 through the sale of access to inactive League of Legends accounts. The suspect was said to have hacked the X account of Riot Games president Marc Merrill to promote the illegal operation and allegedly partnered with another hacker to disrupt matches on the platform by disconnecting players. Riot Games mentioned the hack resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. In 2016, Duffy was sentenced to two-and-half years in prison, a term he served after pleading guilty in Brisbane District Court. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Bonk has seen significant growth recently. Its price jumped 28.37% over the past week and 70.52% in the past month. This surge is notable, especially after a 51.82% drop over the past six months. The current price ranges between $0.00001738 and $0.00002554. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 37.38, which suggests the coin is nearing oversold territory. This could indicate a potential rebound in price. Bonk’s nearest resistance level is $0.00002887. If the price breaks above this point, it might continue to rise. The nearest support is at $0.00001255. If the price falls below this level, it could lead to further declines. Based on recent trends, Bonk may continue its upward movement. Reaching the resistance level from the current high would be an increase of about 13%. However, dropping to the support level from the current low would mean a decline of around 28%. Conclusion While BONK presents interesting opportunities, its short-term potential seems limited compared to new contenders. Codename:Pepe aims to offer true intelligence for maximum profits. By harnessing advanced AI to navigate the chaotic memecoin market, it provides exclusive trading signals and automated trading capabilities. Some investors believe joining its mission could be the key to capitalizing on the current bull run’s gains. To find out more about Codename:Pepe, visit the website .

While its technology is optimized for speed and low fees, everyday users have few ways to participate meaningfully in network operations or generate yield from holding HBAR. The reward structure favors corporate stakeholders, leaving retail users without direct incentives or control. Bitcoin Solaris disrupts that model with a network designed around everyday participation. Through its Nova App, any smartphone becomes a mining node — allowing users to earn BTC-S tokens daily, with no specialized hardware, no validator applications, and no capital lock-ups. The system transforms casual users into protocol contributors and opens a direct pathway to get rich through real-time, on-chain income rather than speculative price movement. Mobile Mining: Income Without Barriers Bitcoin Solaris’s core innovation is its mobile mining model. Users download the Nova App, allocate a small portion of phone storage (1–5 GB) and background CPU, and begin earning passively. The app runs in the background, consuming minimal energy and integrating seamlessly into normal device usage. Unlike Hedera, which restricts consensus and rewards to a fixed set of enterprise validators, Bitcoin Solaris invites anyone with a smartphone to contribute and earn. Mining rewards are distributed based on device uptime and network support, meaning even those without deep technical knowledge or institutional backing can gain exposure to daily blockchain income — turning phones into financial tools for wealth accumulation. Built for Scale, Speed, and Accessibility Bitcoin Solaris operates on a dual-layer blockchain optimized for performance and decentralization: The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) to secure the ledger and handle consensus without high energy costs. The Solaris Layer, built on Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT), processes transactions and mining operations at over 10,000 TPS, with 2-second finality. This structure separates transaction throughput from validator consensus, allowing the network to scale independently of centralized control. Hedera may offer high speed, but participation is reserved for enterprise gatekeepers. Bitcoin Solaris ensures speed with inclusivity — enabling protocol-level rewards for global users regardless of geography or financial status. In a recent review, Crypto Legends broke down how Bitcoin Solaris gives power to users through mining, while Hedera remains tightly controlled by council members. The video highlights accessibility, income models, and how mobile mining opens doors for everyday investors. BTC-S at 3 USDT: Smart Entry Before Demand Surges Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Presale Phase 3, offering BTC-S tokens at 3 USDT. Of the 21 million fixed token supply, 4.2 million (20%) are allocated for presale participants. There is no inflation, no staking requirement, and no dilution from future minting. By securing tokens during presale, users position themselves for early access to Nova App mining, low initial difficulty rates, and first participation in validator and app-layer deployments. For those seeking to get rich through contribution rather than speculation, this stage presents a uniquely timed opportunity before public rollout and exchange listings. Get Up to 75% Extra BTC-S in Phase 3 Invest specific amounts to activate bonus rewards during this phase: Invest exactly $1,000 → Receive a 25% bonus Invest exactly $2,500 → Receive a 50% bonus Invest exactly $4,000 → Receive a 75% bonus Bonuses are valid only during Phase 3. Investing less than the required amount will not qualify. Offer ends when the phase closes. Audited for Security, Designed for the Masses Bitcoin Solaris has passed multiple independent audits confirming the reliability, fairness, and scalability of its infrastructure: Cyberscope Audit : Assessed smart contracts, mobile mining structure, and token emission Freshcoins Audit : Reviewed consensus logic and cross-layer interaction integrity KYC Verification : Verified development team identity and governance oversight These verifications ensure that participation is secure, transparent, and immune to the opaque control models used by legacy projects. Hedera may serve institutions — but Bitcoin Solaris serves everyone. Through daily mobile mining, decentralized reward distribution, and presale access at just 3 USDT, it empowers users to get rich by participating in the network itself. As more retail investors leave passive ecosystems behind, Bitcoin Solaris is becoming the foundation for a new kind of crypto elite — one built from the ground up, phone by phone.

From meme coins evolving into utility assets to blockchains pushing performance limits, the next big opportunity may already be live. Dawgz AI could be one of those early-stage gems. It blends meme culture with Ethereum-backed AI trading tools—built to give you an edge in a fast-moving market. With its presale still active, it’s attracting attention for good reason. Let’s break down the top cryptocurrencies showing momentum right now and why Dawgz AI might be the one to watch in 2025. Dawgz AI – A Meme Coin Built for More Than Hype Dawgz AI is gaining traction as a meme coin with real-world utility. It’s powered by Ethereum and features AI-driven bots that analyze the market and execute trades automatically—something most meme coins can’t claim. Why Dawgz AI Could Stand Out AI trading tools: Bots scan and act on crypto trends 24/7 for better decision-making. Ethereum foundation: Built on a stable, widely-used blockchain. Early presale access: Lets users buy in before broader exchange listings. Staking utility: Investors can earn rewards for long-term holding. With over $3.5 million raised so far, investors suggest Dawgz AI may be one of the few meme coins with lasting impact. If adoption continues, it could gain serious momentum in the upcoming bull run. Pepe (PEPE) – Still Riding the Meme Wave Pepe exploded in popularity in 2023 and hasn’t slowed down. It remains one of the most active meme coins by trading volume, thanks to a loyal community and wide exchange listings. Why PEPE Has Potential: Community power: Massive online support keeps it relevant in meme culture. Ethereum efficiency: Uses smart contracts for fast, scalable transactions. It’s not utility-heavy, but as meme demand spikes, PEPE continues to ride the trend. Floki Inu (FLOKI) – More Than a Meme Coin Floki Inu has evolved from a meme token into a growing ecosystem. Its platforms include DeFi tools, NFTs, and even a metaverse game—making it one of the more well-rounded meme projects. Key Strengths Ecosystem growth: Includes FlokiFi, FlokiSwap, and Valhalla. Decentralized finance focus: Expands use beyond speculation. It’s a meme coin, yes—but one that's building lasting infrastructure in the crypto market. Bonk (BONK) – The Solana-Based Challenger Bonk launched on the Solana blockchain and made headlines with its lightning-fast transaction speed and minimal gas fees. It’s meme-driven, but with real performance benefits. Why BONK Is Gaining Steam Solana synergy: Low costs make it ideal for quick trades. High accessibility: Listed on multiple exchanges, boosting liquidity. For those seeking a high-energy community coin with low friction, BONK could fit. Dogwifhat (WIF) – Wildcard With Momentum Dogwifhat (WIF) has become a favorite in meme circles. It’s unpredictable, but that’s part of its charm—backed by fast community growth and rising interest from trading platforms. Why WIF Might Be Worth Watching Engaged fanbase: Surging social media engagement and memes. Low supply model: Could increase demand over time. It’s a wildcard—high-risk, but with signs of sustained momentum. Solana (SOL) – Speed Meets Scalability Solana is a smart contract platform built for developers who want performance. Despite some price drops, it remains one of the top cryptocurrencies by speed and cost-efficiency. Why SOL Still Holds Value Fast blockchain: Ideal for NFTs, gaming, and dApps. Institutional interest: Keeps SOL relevant in the long-term ecosystem. It may not be “cheap,” but it’s still one of the best blockchains to hold for the long term. Cardano (ADA) – Slow and Steady Growth Cardano is known for its academic foundation and gradual rollout of features. Its long-term roadmap and secure, peer-reviewed architecture keep it in investor conversations. Why ADA Could Climb Smart contracts are live: Increasing dApp development. Strong roadmap: Updates planned through 2025 and beyond. ADA may not spike overnight, but it continues to offer solid fundamentals.

AI-backed trading: Bots act on market data, helping optimize entry and exit. Ethereum-based: Strong security and compatibility with dApps. Verified and trusted: Audited by SolidProof , adding transparency. +135% presale gains: Early momentum is already evident.

With the BTC price at a critical price threshold, Martinez first questioned whether a new all-time high or a correction would come first. According to the analyst, the BTC price has hit a key resistance area at $107,000 following a 42% rally last month. Martinez added that this level is historically a turning point. However, the analyst argued that the current momentum has become overstretched, with the RSI data on the daily chart showing BTC in overbought territory, which is a common occurrence in short-term pullbacks. Warning about the pullback, the analyst also said that BTC whales sold around 30,000 coins, which means profit taking from current levels has occurred.

According to the analyst, the area between $95,850 and $98,730 will be a must-hold support area for BTC if selling pressure increases. Martinez noted that a breakout from these levels could result in a deeper correction for BTC. On the bullish side, the analyst claimed that if the Bitcoin price manages to stay above the mentioned level, it could enter a period of consolidation and gather strength for a breakout towards $116,900 as the next major target. *This is not investment advice.

BTFD Could Give You $45K From $500—A Comparison to Brett and Floki,https://timestabloid.com/best-meme-coin-presales-to-buy-this-week-btfd-could-give-you/,"Fellow risk-takers, degen dreamers, and moon-chasers—welcome to the arena where meme coins aren’t just tokens; they’re a lifestyle. If your wallet has ever wept for not buying DOGE in 2013 or cried through the Brett and Floki rallies, there’s still a second chance. Three words: BTFD Coin. And if you’re feeling a little reckless (as you should), you’ll want to hop on one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week. Here’s the alpha drop: BTFD Coin’s presale ends May 26th, and right now, you can use code LAUNCH200 for a 200% token bonus. It’s in Stage 15 out of 16, folks. This isn’t a drill; this is a countdown. Over $7 million raised, 12,200+ holders, 74 billion BTFD Coins sold , and that juicy 90% APY staking reward sitting pretty. The window is closing, and this article is here to break down why this is the meme coin presale to jump on, plus how Floki and Brett are still keeping it spicy. BTFD Coin: The Badge of the Bold Staking isn’t just for the whales anymore. With BTFD Coin, even the smallest fish can swim in shark-infested waters. Thanks to its 90% APY, degens can multiply their stack just by holding and staking. Say you drop $500 at the current price of $0.0002. That lands you 2.5 million BTFD coins. Stake it, leave it, and let that APY cook. Add in the LAUNCH200 bonus, and you’re instantly tripled to 7.5 million coins. Now here’s where it gets saucy: Analysts believe $BTFD could debut at $0.0006 on launch and potentially moonshot to $0.006 during its breakout phase. That original $500 bag? If it hits $0.0006, you’re sitting on $4,500 (with the bonus applied). But if that moon target of $0.006 gets smacked? Welcome to $45,000. Degens, that’s an 8900% ROI, and it’s only available for a limited time. BTFD Coin is also powered by a four-level Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, backed by Ethereum, and protected by long-term token locks and a community-first tokenomics plan. And then there’s the Bulls Squad—a quirky cast of characters adding personality and purpose to the project. With only one stage left, BTFD Coin is charging full speed toward launch on May 27th. This is your final boarding call. Don’t miss what might be one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week . Floki: The Viking-Inspired OG With Utility Firepower Floki isn’t just a meme; it’s a brand. Inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu pup and raised by the community, Floki has matured into a utility-backed beast. It powers a full-blown ecosystem featuring DeFi tools, educational platforms like Floki University, and NFT metaverse spaces. While many meme coins live and die by hype, Floki’s strength is in the blend of utility and storytelling. The coin’s Norse branding gives it an edge in the narrative-driven world of crypto. Whether it’s launching partnerships with real-world companies or appearing on global billboards, Floki knows how to stay relevant. That strong community (a.k.a. the “Floki Vikings”) is active, vocal, and loyal. For degens looking to diversify, it’s a worthy add alongside the best meme coin presales to buy this week. Brett: The Internet’s Most Chaotic Icon Got Crypto-fied If you’ve ever been terminally online, you know Brett. This chaotic blue frog crossed over from cringe culture into icon status, and the Brett token leans fully into that internet-native weirdness. With no need for fluff or fake utility, Brett’s strength lies in its raw, viral energy. Brett stands as the embodiment of internet absurdity turned financial instrument. It’s community-driven, memetastic, and funny. Think of it as the spiritual sibling to PEPE, but with a little more Gen Z nihilism and weirdcore vibes. It’s the type of token that explodes overnight because TikTok decided to have a moment. Final Words: Don’t Just Watch the Stampede, Lead the Best Meme Coin Presales to Buy This Week It’s the last stretch of a golden opportunity. BTFD Coin is closing its presale doors on May 26th, and with code LAUNCH200, you still have time to triple your bag. The 90% staking APY, future CEX listings, and P2E ecosystem all scream long-term win, and at $0.0002, this might be the lowest price you’ll ever get. Floki and Brett hold their weight in culture, community, and chaos, but only BTFD Coin gives you this kind of early-stage entry, elite degen bragging rights, and more. Ready to wear the Bull badge? Go to: BTFD Buy Page . Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Enter LAUNCH200 in the bonus code field and click “Apply.” Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy. Confirm and click “Buy Now.” Catch the meme coin presale before it ends. Don’t just scroll past history. Stampede into it.

The BTFD presale ends on May 26th, right before the token launch on May 27th. What is the LAUNCH200 bonus code? This code gives you a 200% token bonus when entered during the BTFD Coin presale.

As the cloud mining market grows and diversifies, users are faced with many choices — from Hashing24 and NiceHash to StormGain and BitFuFu. But how does HashFly truly compare, and why should it be your platform of choice? 1. Proven Track Record and Longevity HashFly ’s foundation in 2013 places it among the pioneers of cloud mining. Unlike newer platforms still building their reputation, HashFly has a decade of experience supporting over a million satisfied miners worldwide. This longevity reflects its stability, reliability, and commitment to delivering consistent results. 2. Superior Return on Investment (ROI) While many platforms offer cloud mining contracts, few can match HashFly’s high daily returns—up to 7.2%—and clear, short-term contract structures. For example, smaller contracts starting at $200 provide quick, daily profits, enabling users to reinvest or withdraw with confidence. Other platforms often feature longer contract durations with less attractive yields, making HashFly an ideal choice for investors seeking fast, tangible returns. 3. User-Friendly Experience and Instant Bonuses HashFly simplifies cloud mining with an intuitive platform and mobile app, making it accessible to both beginners and seasoned investors. Upon registration, users receive a $10 instant bonus, giving them a risk-free start to mining. By contrast, platforms like NiceHash operate as hash power marketplaces, which can be more complex for new users, while others like Hashing24 require higher minimum investments and offer fewer immediate incentives. 4. Transparent and Daily Payout System Transparency is critical in crypto mining. HashFly delivers daily payouts directly to user accounts—no delays, no hidden fees. In comparison, some platforms may have weekly or monthly payout schedules or complex fee structures, potentially limiting user cash flow. HashFly’s daily payout system empowers users with liquidity and control. 5. Responsive Customer Support Mining investments demand trust. HashFly’s 24/7 customer support ensures users receive prompt assistance whenever needed. This level of support surpasses many competitors, whose customer service can be inconsistent or limited to business hours, leaving miners uncertain during critical issues. How to Start Mining on HashFly： Step 1: Sign Up & Claim Your Bonus Visit HashFly.com, register with your email, and receive a $10 sign-up bonus instantly . Step 2: Choose a Mining Contract Select from a variety of flexible plans based on your investment goals.

Apple’s Market Signal Pushes Crypto Momentum,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-meme-coin-to-buy-now-apples-market-signal-pushes-crypto-momentum,"If you're trying to find the best meme coin to buy as 2025 unfolds, you're not alone. Apple just made waves in the traditional market by announcing a $0.26 per-share dividend on May 15, 2025, and while that may seem unrelated to crypto, it’s actually a signal worth watching. When a $2.9 trillion company boosts market sentiment, it can ripple through institutional strategies—including crypto investments. Stocks climbed, and within hours, Bitcoin and Ethereum surged in tandem. In the world of meme coins, that type of risk-on momentum can be a green light. In this piece, we’ll break down how traditional market events like Apple’s dividend can push meme coin sentiment forward, and spotlight one project— Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) —that could become the best meme coin to buy right now. Market Signals: Why Apple’s Dividend Matters to Crypto Investors On May 15, Apple confirmed a $0.26 per-share dividend, and while the payout is standard, the implications are bigger. Apple’s stock rose by 1.2%, Nasdaq jumped 0.8%, and suddenly risk appetite was back on the table. At the same time: Bitcoin (BTC) rose 2.1%, hitting $63,600. Ethereum (ETH) gained 1.8%, reaching $2,980. BTC trading volume spiked by 15% to $28B in 24 hours. ETH trading volume hit $12.5B—a 10% increase. Why does this matter? It shows a strong correlation between tech stock stability and crypto confidence. For investors, especially those seeking short-term trades or tokens with high upside, this kind of momentum can push smaller assets, including meme coins, into breakout territory. Key Signals in the Best Meme Coins When the market is quiet, identifying the best meme coin requires spotting early signs of movement. Here's what to look for: Unique Narrative or Utility Does the coin just ride on memes, or is there more to the story? The most promising meme coins in 2025 combine humor with utility—like access to DeFi tools or integration with real AI. A strong narrative not only grabs attention, but also helps the coin sustain interest during market dips. Coins with no clear message often fade fast. Strong Community Engagement A meme coin lives and dies by its community. Watch for active Telegrams, Twitter spaces, and organic content—it’s often the first signal of a brewing breakout. Real engagement includes user-made memes, community voting, and consistent dialogue—not just hype from the devs. The louder and more authentic the buzz, the more likely it is to translate into upward price pressure. Tokenomics That Drive Scarcity The best meme coins usually implement a capped supply, staking rewards, or burn mechanisms that help increase value over time. Scarcity works when it's paired with demand—especially during presales or exchange listings. Catalysts and Momentum Look for upcoming exchange listings, influencer interest, or new partnerships. These events often drive price jumps when interest is already brewing. Coins that consistently push updates and remain visible have a much better chance of staying relevant. When these pieces come together, meme coins can flip from quiet to explosive in hours. That’s why timing matters—and why smart investors track more than just price. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ): A Meme Coin With Breakout Potential In a crowded space of coins trying to go viral, Dawgz AI is aiming higher. Built on the Ethereum network, it combines meme culture with AI-powered trading utility—a hybrid that some investors believe could position it among the top meme coins of the year. Here’s why DAGZ is showing early signs of strength: AI + Meme Culture Instead of riding trends, Dawgz AI creates its own. It integrates Blackbox AI algorithms designed to provide automated trading strategies—giving holders more than just a token to speculate on. Early Presale Success With over $3.4M raised, the project has already built a strong base of supporters. That’s a key advantage for community-driven growth. Audited for Security The smart contract was audited by SolidProof , a recognized firm, adding trust for early backers. Tokenomics With Staking Built-In 8.888B total supply 20% allocated for staking Rewards available even during presale This model rewards long-term holders and reduces sell pressure—a smart move for maintaining value. Ethereum Foundation Being an ERC-20 token means it’s easy to store, trade, and integrate across existing DeFi apps. Active Visibility Push The team is executing targeted marketing to ensure the project stays top of mind—a key move when attention spans are short. Dawgz AI could be one of those rare projects that makes its move before the rest of the meme market catches up. The Best Meme Coin to Buy Today? The Apple dividend signal might seem distant from meme coin trading—but when institutional money shifts, it creates waves across all assets. Bitcoin moved. Ethereum followed. Meme coins are next in line. For those looking for the best meme coin to buy now, Dawgz AI offers a compelling mix of narrative, community, utility, and timing. While nothing is guaranteed, early signals point to DAGZ as one of the few new meme coins preparing to lead, not follow. FAQs Section Which meme coin is best to buy now? Dawgz AI is gaining traction for its mix of AI utility and meme appeal, making it one to watch closely. Which meme coin will reach $1 in 2025? It's hard to predict, but Dawgz AI's strong tokenomics and roadmap could position it for big moves if demand continues. Which meme coin will 100x? New tokens with utility and momentum, like Dawgz AI, may offer that kind of upside—though risk is always part of the equation. Which memecoin has the most potential? Dawgz AI stands out right now for combining AI trading tools with a viral-friendly community narrative. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

44768296,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=730256,1747565843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44768296.jpeg,"China hits US, EU, Japan, Taiwan with new anti-dumping tariffs on plastics",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-us-eu-japan-taiwan-anti-dumping-tariff/,"China hit back at four major economies—the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Taiwan—on Sunday by imposing steep anti-dumping tariffs on POM copolymers, a type of engineering plastic used in everything from electronics and auto parts to medical equipment. This update came directly from China’s Ministry of Commerce, which concluded a year-long investigation that started May 2024, following fresh US tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, chips, and more. According to Reuters, this new round of trade penalties will charge importers from the US up to 74.9%, the highest among the four affected regions. The European Union will face a 34.5% tariff, while Japan will be hit with 35.5%, except for Asahi Kasei Corp, which got a slightly better deal at 24.5%. Taiwanese firms will see 32.6% tariffs, with Formosa Plastics getting 4% and Polyplastics Taiwan receiving 3.8%. This decision followed a temporary penalty in January, when China’s ministry said there was enough proof to suggest dumping was hurting domestic markets and began collecting deposits from importers. Trump’s tariff truce with China fails to ease burden Despite President Trump negotiating a 90-day truce to reduce some tariffs between Washington and Beijing, American importers aren’t seeing relief. The cumulative weight of past tariffs remains. Josh Teitelbaum, senior counsel at Akin, explained the reality: “While companies are relieved to see a temporary pause from the incredibly high tariffs on goods from China, retailers are still facing very high tariffs that will have an impact on prices and supply.” Teitelbaum pointed out that footwear is getting wrecked. A children’s or women’s leather sneaker now carries a 40% tax, combining the WTO’s most favored nation rate of 10%, 25% from Section 301 rules, and an added 30% from fentanyl and reciprocal-related tariffs. It doesn’t stop there. Tariffs stacked across categories like clothing are draining the entire supply chain. Cotton sweaters from China now attract 46.5%, women’s bathing suits are tagged with 54.9%, and baby dresses come in at 41.5%. These numbers aren’t projections—they’re being paid now. Retailers brace for higher prices as stacking continues This tariff layering is choking US retailers. Dan Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide, said on Saturday that basic items like kids’ backpacks—which mostly come from China—are seeing combined tariffs “over 70%.” Anthony explained that this includes the 17.6% standard tariff, Section 301’s 25%, and the new 20% fentanyl-related charge plus a 10% reciprocal tariff. Even companies the size of Walmart are exposed. John David Rainey, the company’s CFO, said on CNBC that shoppers should expect price bumps across toys, food, and electronics. “We’re trying to navigate this the best that we can,” Rainey said. “But this is a little bit unprecedented in terms of the speed and magnitude in which the price increases are coming.” Walmart’s own shipment records support the warning. Data from Panjiva tracking January 2025 to May 12 shows that 34.1% of the company’s imports originated from China , followed by India at 26.3% and Hong Kong at 10.6%. With a third of their supply pipeline tied to Chinese exports, Walmart and others like them are directly impacted by the Chinese response to US tariffs.

BTC fell to an intraday low of $102,722 on Saturday but rebounded to briefly cross $104,000 before moving to its current level. The cryptocurrency has registered a marginal increase during the ongoing session, trading around $103,950. Bitcoin May Skyrocket As US Loses Top Tier Credit Rating The US has lost its AAA credit rating over rising national debt and deficits. Moody’s Rating downgraded the US credit rating, downgrading it from its perfect AAA status to AA1 due to increasing debt and interest significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns. The downgrade is being viewed as a warning to investors and could increase borrowing costs for Americans already grappling with inflation and tariffs. Moody’s had held a perfect credit score for the US since 1917. Moody’s explained the downgrade in its official statement, adding, “The downgrade reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns.” However, despite the downgrade, Moody’s assigned a stable outlook for the country, highlighting the Federal Reserve’s historically strong and independent monetary policy. However, this outlook could be at risk, with President Trump threatening to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell. However, an adverse market reaction forced Trump to backtrack. Journalist Michelle Makori believes that Bitcoin and gold are worth watching following the downgrade, adding she expected their prices to skyrocket. According to Makori, the downgrade creates the perfect environment for Bitcoin and gold prices to surge. “Watch Bitcoin and gold. America now shares a credit rating with Austria and Finland. Hard assets don’t lie. Watch Gold and Bitcoin.” Bitcoin Whales Accumulating Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales are continuing to accumulate the asset, according to OKC Partner and Binance KOL Ted Pillows. According to analysts, Bitcoin Whales acquired 2,180 BTC valued at around $226,750,000 on May 15, indicating strong market confidence. Large accumulations by Bitcoin whales generally suggest bullish sentiment among investors and a strong potential for further price appreciation. BTC is trading around the $103,900 mark at the time of writing. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) maintained its position above $100,000 despite selling pressure and buyer exhaustion. Market watchers are watching for signs of an uptrend and whether it will carry BTC past its all-time high of $109,000. Despite waning momentum, market experts believe BTC’s uptrend is far from over. Blockstream CEO Adam Beck stated earlier in the week that Bitcoin’s price was strangely low and could surge to $500,000 or even $1M over the next four years. Meanwhile, another analyst predicted that BTC’s next market top could be $120,000, but only if the $90,000 support holds. However, some bearish signals are emerging despite overall bullish sentiment. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a sharp increase of 2.19% on Tuesday, settling at $96,845. A marginal increase the following day saw the price reach $97,000. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as markets rallied. As a result, BTC soared over 6%, crossing $100,000 and settling at $103,093. The rally lost momentum on Friday as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $102,851. However, it recovered on Saturday, rising nearly 2% to $104,617. Despite a positive Saturday, the price was back in the red on Sunday, falling almost 1% and settling at $103,802. Source: TradingView BTC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price dropped 1.04% to $102,728, but not before falling to an intraday low of $100,694. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to $104,123. However, it lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 0.53% and settling at $103,568. The price plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action turned bearish on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. BTC has recovered during the ongoing session, with the price up nearly 1%, trading around $104,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With a rising presale, confirmed development milestones, and a product rollout strategy already in motion, MUTM is quickly being recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy now—and Not only for its long-term prospects, but also for its strong short-term growth potential. Investors aren’t sitting on the sidelines—they’re getting in early and securing their positions ahead of the breakout. And with strong buy pressure already building during presale, it’s clear that interest is shifting toward new crypto coins that offer more than hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM is currently progressing through Phase 4 of its presale, where the token remains priced at $0.025. Over 87% of this round is already completed, with more than $8.6 million raised and 9,900+ wallets participating. In the upcoming phase, the token price will increase to $0.03, with its launch rate already locked in at $0.06. That gap between entry and launch has made this one of the top cryptocurrencies on watchlists this month. But what’s really driving urgency is the pace—this phase is filling quickly, and once the next round begins, early investors lose that discounted advantage. The current price point isn’t just a good entry—it’s a short-term opportunity that could soon be gone. With momentum growing and investor attention increasing, MUTM is trending toward breakout conditions before it ever reaches the open market. One of the most important reasons behind this momentum is that Mutuum isn’t launching a token and building later—it’s building now. The team has confirmed that a beta version of the lending and borrowing platform will go live shortly after the token launches. This is key. Instead of launching on speculation alone, users will have access to real DeFi functionality—right away. Borrowing, lending, interest accrual, and capital movement will begin on-chain almost immediately. That product rollout is what analysts say could help drive MUTM to $0.37 in a short time after launch. With a token designed to benefit from protocol activity—and real activity happening right after listing—that price target is no longer seen as a stretch. In addition to its DeFi engine, the Mutuum team is building out more utilities to support token demand and internal ecosystem growth. A native overcollateralized stablecoin is in development, backed by excess collateral provided by users in the lending system. This stablecoin won’t rely on external assets—it will be fully on-chain and pegged to the U.S. dollar through algorithmic mechanisms. As users mint and repay stablecoin loans, demand flows back into the protocol, boosting treasury revenue and platform volume. All of this ties back to MUTM’s value loop: users engage with the protocol, value is created, and token demand increases in parallel. Mutuum is also preparing for the next phase of growth by working toward Layer 2 integration. This will help reduce transaction fees, speed up user interactions, and ensure the protocol remains accessible as it scales. For any new crypto coin aiming to onboard thousands of users post-launch, Layer 2 isn’t optional—it’s essential. This move positions MUTM to compete with larger DeFi platforms while offering the advantages of a smaller-cap token with room to grow. While the rest of the crypto market slows down, MUTM is showing real forward motion. From a nearly sold-out presale to a functional product on the verge of launch, everything points to a project that’s not just promising upside—but actively delivering on it. If you’re still trying to decide what crypto to buy before the market picks back up, MUTM offers more than an early price—it offers a system designed to reward usage, backed by real development, and structured for demand. It’s not waiting for the market to move. It’s actively being built—and that steady progress is driving its rapid growth.

At the moment, ETH is trading around $2,508, below both the triangle’s upper trendline and the 50-period EMA ($2,519) on the 2-hour chart. Some expected an early breakout, but price is still coiled, no confirmed break above resistance. This triangle formation, created by converging trendlines, means consolidation and decreasing volatility—a classic sign of a big move coming. ETH has held a series of higher lows, keeping the bullish case alive, but buyers haven’t produced a strong breakout candle yet. Volume is low and recent candles are showing hesitation with mixed body sizes and small wicks. Ethereum Momentum Building as MACD Turns Bullish Momentum indicators are hinting at a change in sentiment. MACD is showing a fresh bullish crossover and the histogram is green—often a sign of upward momentum. Ethereum Price Setup ETH is coiling inside a symmetrical triangle, trading near $2,509 and pressing against key resistance. Watch for a breakout above $2,527 to confirm momentum. No breakout yet—just pressure building. #Ethereum #ETH #Crypto #Trading #ETHUSD #Altcoins pic.twitter.com/kNYkrIUM9R — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) May 18, 2025 This, combined with higher lows in price, means buyers are gaining strength, but confirmation is missing. If ETH can break above $2,527—triangle’s upper boundary and horizontal resistance—it will trigger bullish targets at $2,649 and $2,720. Below $2,500 or a break below $2,420 will invalidate the setup and test lower support. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Ethereum Key Levels to Watch Ethereum price prediction remains neutral as ETH hasn’t broken out yet, but the setup is getting close to resolution. Watch for breakout volume or rejection. Patience is key in triangle setups—entering too early can be choppy. Trade Setup: Entry (bullish): Above $2,527 on strong bullish close Targets: $2,649 and $2,720 Stop-loss: Below $2,420 (triangle support) Summary: Think of this triangle like a pressure cooker—it’s building steam, but unless the lid pops off (above $2,527), price will stay contained. Wait for breakout confirmation before entering. Ethereum is consolidating at resistance, a big move is coming. Whether bulls can take advantage remains to be seen—but all eyes are on $2,527. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.84M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As Bitcoin stabilizes above $102K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $5,919,969.28/ $6,844,387 Token Price: $0.002515 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

While Ethereum (ETH) , Dogecoin (DOGE) , and TRUMPCOIN capture headlines, a lesser-known contender— MAGACOIN FINANCE —is rising rapidly on watchlists with unmatched early-stage momentum. Here’s a look at six cryptocurrencies showing real breakout potential this quarter. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! 1. Ethereum (ETH) – Institutional Anchor with Web3 Momentum Trading near $2,435 , ETH is up 3.8% in 24 hours and continues to dominate as the infrastructure layer for Web3. Its $293B market cap , strong L2 activity, and ETF speculation position it for a range between $2,400–$2,600 through Q3. Institutions remain heavily involved, securing ETH’s leadership status. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) – Meme Titan Holding the Line DOGE has surged past $0.24 , eyeing a breakout to $0.41–$0.50 if market optimism holds. With Elon Musk’s endorsements and unmatched brand identity in meme culture, DOGE remains the sector’s blue-chip altcoin in 2025 . 3. TRUMPCOIN – High-Impact Volatility Tied to Politics Currently trading around $10.12 , TRUMPCOIN is spiking amid election-year hype. Analysts forecast a possible move to $100+ driven by media cycles, community engagement, and headline-driven momentum. High risk—but even higher potential for traders betting on timing. 4. Kaspa (KAS) – Scalable Infrastructure Token on the Move KAS sits at $0.13 , up 16% on the week , holding support at $0.10 . Its DAG-based architecture offers high scalability, and analysts project moves to $0.28–$0.35 in Q3. As Layer-1 infrastructure gains favor, Kaspa is becoming a core altcoin allocation for informed traders. 5. PEPE – Pure Meme Volatility Still hovering near $0.0000092 , PEPE is the ultimate short-term swing coin. If volume returns, 25%–30% spikes are possible. While speculative, its name-brand status keeps it a contender in meme coin cycles. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT 6. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The Breakout Meme Altcoin With 35x Potential With over $8 million raised , MAGACOIN FINANCE is surging in presale traction. Priced below $0.001 , with a $0.007 listing target , early participants are lining up for 25x–35x returns . A 50% bonus via the MAGA50X code increases exposure, attracting whales and smart money alike. Recent highlights: $132K+ whale transaction recorded on-chain Over 50,000 holders and rising rapidly Listings and media coverage expanding Scarcity-based supply, audited by HASHEX , and 2025’s most viral political branding Analysts now compare its structure to the early days of DOGE and SHIBA —except with more organization and strategy behind the scenes. Conclusion: May’s Crypto Rotation Is Underway—And MAGACOIN FINANCE Is in Play With ETH , DOGE , TRUMPCOIN , and KASPA each commanding attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the dark horse altcoin of 2025 .

While tokens like SHIB and PEPE have surged off social media buzz and unpredictable trends, MUTM is charting a different path—one that doesn’t rely on hype but is built around actual protocol activity, structured tokenomics, and on-chain revenue mechanics. Still in its presale phase and priced well below $0.03, MUTM has become a growing point of interest for investors looking beyond the next meme trend. And according to analysts tracking early-stage DeFi projects, this isn’t just another new crypto coin—it’s one that could outperform even the most viral tokens in the months ahead. Meme-based cryptocurrencies have shown they can rally fast—but they’ve also shown how fragile that momentum can be. Often driven by influencers or sudden community surges, these coins rarely have systems in place to maintain long-term demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM isn’t trying to ride the same wave. Its value doesn’t depend on how many times it trends online. Instead, it’s being developed as a DeFi crypto protocol with real mechanics behind its growth—where usage drives demand and returns are based on how the platform functions, not how loud it gets on social media. Mutuum is building a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol where value flows through activity. Users can deposit assets into the platform and earn passive income, while others can borrow funds by locking in collateral. When borrowers pay interest, the protocol directs a portion of those funds toward repurchasing MUTM tokens on the open market. Those tokens are then distributed to active participants—specifically those who provide liquidity and hold mtTokens, the platform’s deposit receipts. This model creates a self-sustaining reward system. The more people borrow and use the protocol, the more buying pressure is placed on the token. It’s a setup that naturally benefits holders, without relying on token inflation or artificial incentives. Mutuum isn’t merely in its presale phase—it’s actively preparing for launch. A beta release of the platform is planned to follow the token listing, allowing users to engage with its lending and borrowing functions right from the start. This approach stands in contrast to many other presale tokens, which go live with no product and spend months trying to deliver on basic promises. MUTM is skipping that waiting game, and that has caught the attention of traders who are watching closely for the best cryptocurrency to invest in before wider adoption begins. MUTM’s price action won’t rely on virality to take off. What makes it stand out is the structure—specifically how the buyback model, combined with protocol revenue, aligns incentives between users and token holders. This design has led to growing forecasts that MUTM could outperform more well-known meme coins once it hits the market. And with the current presale price locked at $0.025, investors are entering at one of the lowest points in its pricing curve. Once the next phase begins, the price will increase to $0.03, ahead of the confirmed listing at $0.06. As the market shifts focus from speculation to sustainability, tokens like MUTM are getting a closer look. Its fixed total supply, redistribution logic, and early beta deployment all contribute to a model that supports both early momentum and long-term holding. This is why some investors who once took bets on meme coins are now looking at MUTM with more serious intent. It may not trend overnight—but it’s built to run longer. MUTM doesn’t need to go viral to move. It’s designed to grow from within, rewarding usage and holding through a closed-loop model tied to real activity. For those evaluating what crypto to buy now or seeking a project that blends early access with clear functionality, MUTM is one of the few that checks all the boxes. It’s not another meme—but it might just outperform them all.

While the macro trend remains bullish, the recent Bitcoin price action shows tightening within a symmetrical triangle formation on lower time frames, suggesting that a breakout—or breakdown—may be imminent heading into May 19. What’s Happening with Bitcoin’s Price? Looking at the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin continues to respect a rising support trendline that connects the early May lows to the current structure. After surging from sub-$100,000 levels earlier this month, the Bitcoin price has faced repeated rejections just under $105,000. The consolidation near $103,300–$103,800 represents a period of indecision following the bullish rally, but structure remains intact as long as bulls defend $101,500.

And the numbers? They’re not just better—they’re life-changing. Cardano: Brilliant Design, Slower Rewards Cardano’s layered architecture and peer-reviewed foundation have earned it respect across the crypto space.

It doesn’t just protect wealth. It builds it fast. BTC-S is a blockchain that generates value every day, directly into your hands, using only your phone. The project is also audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and fully KYC-verified , giving new investors confidence that this isn’t just hype. It’s substance. From Zero to Wealth: How BTC-S Is Changing Lives We’re not talking theory. We’re talking early BTC-S investors already reporting 300–400% gains thanks to presale access and daily mobile mining rewards. The upcoming Solaris Nova App will allow users to mine BTC-S from any smartphone, with one tap. There are no setups, no rigs, and no confusing software. Just a smart algorithm that runs quietly in your pocket—earning real money every day. And thanks to the double rewards referral program, the growth doesn’t stop there. Users who refer friends receive 5% commission in BTC-S every time someone buys through their link. Even better? The person they invite gets 5% extra tokens on their purchase. It’s a win-win model built to multiply community wealth—fast. To access it, all you need is an account on BitcoinSolaris.com, your personal referral code, and the motivation to share it with your network. From social media to direct invites, the earning potential grows every time you connect someone new. What If You Caught the Next Big Bitcoin Fork Early?

44768885,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=730264,1747567202,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44768885.jpeg,Paris kidnap attempt highlights need for crypto data security,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/paris-kidnap-crypto-data-security/,"Over the last few weeks, there has been an uptick in the number of kidnappings linked to the crypto community in the French capital, Paris. The latest one was the attempted kidnapping of relatives of Paymium co-founder Pierre Noizat on Tuesday. The kidnapping situation, which was worsened by the attempt on Tuesday, has seen the French interior minister Bruno Rataileau announce a meeting with crypto professionals to discuss a way forward. According to reports, most of these kidnappings happen because the criminals are looking forward to receiving ransom for those captured. However, the Director of Strategy at French crypto exchange Paymium, Alexandre Stachtenko, has taken a dig at how information related to crypto transfers under EU rules must be collected, calling it a “ticking time bomb.” Paris kidnaps calls for crypto data security According to Stachtenko, the current method is risky and one leak could put people in harm’s way. “If there is a leak of one of these databases from which I can find out who has money and where they live, then the next day it is on the dark web, and the day after there is someone outside your home,” he said. The executive implied that crypto users are not safe because it only takes a platform breach for their details to be in the hands of bad actors. Data theft is something that has been happening in the crypto market over the years, with the latest one related to popular crypto exchange Coinbase. The exchange mentioned that the criminals had bribed and duped their way into stealing digital assets from its users. The exchange then added that the criminals asked for a bribe to keep the crime from coming out. However, instead of paying, Coinbase informed regulators about the crime and has made plans to spend between $180 million and $400 million to reimburse affected users. After the attempted kidnapping, Paymium also released its statement urging authorities to ensure the protection of companies inside the sector. It also highlighted the disturbing trend of activities like these happening across different locations since the beginning of the year. The platform, which was founded in 2011, also cited “the highly dangerous aspects of certain financial regulations, either recently adopted or in the making”. “With the unprecedented organisation of massive and sometimes disproportionate collection of personal data, public authorities contribute to putting the physical safety of millions of cryptocurrency holders in France, and more widely in Europe, at risk,” the platform added. The comment was talking about rules that came into effect at the end of 2024, which extended the Travel Rule that was already in place for traditional finance transfers to include digital assets. European AML regulations to restrict privacy coins and wallets According to Stachtenko, one aspect of the Travel Rule he finds disturbing is the disclosure of the address of a user’s crypto wallet, which contains details of their accounts and transactions. He added that sensitive data like that is sometimes stored or exchanged insecurely, putting the holder in harm’s way. However, Sarah Compani, a lawyer specializing in digital assets, has mentioned that these regulatory changes are adopted to curb illicit acts in the crypto industry. Meanwhile, the new anti-money laundering law in Europe, which will come into effect in 2027, will restrict the use of wallets and digital assets that allow its holder to be anonymous. The development is coming after France announced the same law, which it aims to use to fight narcotrafficking, targeting anonymous devices like crypto mixers used to obscure the origin of funds. However, cybersecurity analyst Renaud Lifchitz has mentioned that there are many “legitimate interests” in having such tools. He added that these tools are sometimes beneficial to many interested legitimate parties, such as journalists or activists opposed to an authoritarian regime that controls the traditional banking system. Meanwhile, the recent kidnappings can be explained by a “somewhat nouveau riche” and “ill-prepared” cryptocurrency sector. Since 2014, software developer Jameson Lopp said, he has recorded at least 219 physical attacks targeting crypto users.

MUTM Stands Alone Below $0.05,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-cheapest-cryptocurrency-with-actual-utility-mutm-stands-alone-below-0-05/,"In a space flooded with low-cost tokens that rarely offer anything beyond speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is breaking that pattern. At a presale price of just $0.025, it’s among the cheapest cryptocurrencies on the market—but it’s also one of the few that comes backed by real, functional utility. With so many tokens under $0.05 offering little more than hype, MUTM is positioning itself differently. It’s not chasing virality or empty engagement. It’s building a DeFi protocol with actual use cases, a revenue engine, and smart economic design that supports long-term demand. And as capital continues to flow in, it’s becoming clear that investors aren’t just noticing MUTM—they’re acting on it. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM is now in Phase 4 of its presale, offering tokens at the current price of $0.025. Over 83% of this round has already been sold, and once it concludes, the price will increase to $0.03 in the next phase. The confirmed launch price is $0.06, providing early buyers with a strong entry advantage ahead of the token’s exchange debut. So far, the project has raised more than $8.4 million and attracted thousands of early supporters. Unlike typical new cryptocurrency launches, this demand isn’t based on promotional gimmicks—it’s grounded in infrastructure. The team is building, and the presale serves as both a funding round and an early access point for those seeking high-potential entries ahead of broader exchange visibility. Most sub-$0.05 tokens are cheap for one reason: they offer little to no working product. MUTM is the opposite. The protocol is being developed to provide decentralized lending and borrowing solutions through both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. This dual approach allows users to either earn passive income by contributing to shared liquidity pools (P2C) or negotiate loan terms directly with others (P2P), offering more flexibility and broader accessibility than standard DeFi products. It’s utility like this—not hype—that has analysts naming MUTM among the top cryptocurrencies to watch this year. Mutuum isn’t stopping at basic lending features. The team is currently preparing for Layer 2 integration, ensuring the protocol can operate efficiently at scale without falling victim to high gas fees or transaction delays. This forward-looking approach makes the platform more accessible to everyday users while supporting larger, high-volume activity over time. In addition, the project is undergoing a smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the leading blockchain security firms in the space. This signals a strong commitment to safety and transparency—two qualities often missing from other new crypto coins in this price range. What also sets MUTM apart is its buyback model. A share of the interest paid by borrowers is allocated to buying MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then redistributed to engaged users across the ecosystem. The result is a system that rewards long-term holders and reinforces value through actual usage—not artificial pumping. This alignment between activity and reward is rare, especially at this price level. It’s one of the key reasons MUTM is considered one of the best crypto coins to buy now, especially for those looking for upside without sacrificing fundamentals. With prices still under $0.03, and a functional platform approaching launch, MUTM offers something that’s hard to find: a low-cost cryptocurrency that’s building toward real product delivery. It isn’t the cheapest token on the market—but it’s arguably the cheapest cryptocurrency with actual utility worth paying attention to. For anyone asking what crypto to invest in while prices remain favorable, MUTM is one of the few options that offers early access without compromising on structure, roadmap, or demand logic.

Cardano (ADA) , SUI , and Ethereum (ETH) are attracting capital thanks to technical resilience and institutional attention. But quietly gaining ground alongside them is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a pre-listing altcoin offering one of the sharpest asymmetric return setups in the current cycle. Cardano (ADA): Accumulating Quietly, Ready to Break ADA is showing steady upward movement, now trading around $0.68 , supported firmly in the $0.63–$0.66 zone. A clean move above $0.74 could trigger a breakout, especially as upgrades like Hydra and expanding smart contract use cases improve sentiment. Cardano’s engaged community is also contributing to continued accumulation. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X SUI: The Post-Unlock Performer to Watch After its May 1 token unlock , SUI has doubled in value, currently holding at $3.95 . Analysts forecast a near-term move to $4.47 , while longer-term projections eye $13.66 by year-end. Strong market structure and active liquidity make it a standout among newer Layer-1s. Ethereum (ETH): Institutional Strength Fuels Rally Ethereum (ETH) continues its dominant run, now trading near $3,762 —a 29% increase in the past week . Driven by demand from institutions and tokenization trends, ETH is expected to oscillate between $2,190–$2,900 through the year. Its role in NFTs, L2 networks, and global infrastructure remains unmatched. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The Early Entry Altcoin With 36x Potential While the market focuses on established names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building its own breakout path. With a current price under $0.001 and a projected listing target of $0.007 , it presents a 25x–36x ROI opportunity for early-stage buyers. Over $8 million has already been raised in presale, and using promo code MAGA50X grants buyers a 50% token bonus —increasing position size and potential upside. Key strengths behind MAGACOIN FINANCE include: Scarcity-based tokenomics designed for long-term sustainability An independent audit by HASHEX ensuring security and transparency Bold political branding aligned with 2025’s most dominant narratives Consistent traction across Telegram, YouTube, and X during multi-phase presale This is a structured rollout with a strategic community-building engine already in motion. SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP – ACT NOW Conclusion: MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Rising With the Leaders ADA , SUI , and ETH are clearly leading the Q2 charge. But for those seeking sharper upside before the next wave hits, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the early-stage play to watch. Its smart design, high-return window, and cultural relevance are quickly making it a standout for 2025 cycle traders.

Last time this happened in 2021, a bevy of popular altcoins returned cryptocurrency buyers 28,000% by the end of the market cycle. Bitcoin Dominance Takes 4% Spill Bitcoin’s market share fell from 65% to 61% between May 7 and May 13, according to TradingView. Markets haven’t seen that 65% level of BTC dominance over altcoins since 2021. That year was the altseason, as crypto veterans like to call it, that launched Dogecoin’s price tens of thousands of percent upward in under 12 months. Meanwhile, in 2021, a $100 Shiba Inu investment went from Jan. 1, 2021, to over $14 million by Mar. 2023. Two unemployed Millennial brothers from Westchester, NY, invested $8,000 in Shiba Inu that year after a family friend told them about it. There are hundreds of trillions of dollars out there. There are only 21 million #Bitcoin . Do the math. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) May 8, 2025 As Bitcoin boosters like to say: Do the math. While a 4% dip in Bitcoin dominance may seem like a small fraction, the numerator here is a global Internet currency with a two trillion dollar market cap on May 7. That’s something like an $80 billion dip in market share against altcoins over six days in May. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s price and market cap grew by 7% during those six days, even as its wedge on the pie chart shrank. Altcoins Form Bullish Golden Cross Meanwhile, an index of altcoin prices formed a golden cross in May, potentially signaling bullish momentum into a prolonged bull run. As one popular crypto YouTube analyst reported on May 13, the total altcoin market cap for major currencies has formed a golden cross. That’s when a shorter-term moving average crosses from below to above a longer-term moving average. Altseason incoming. golden cross hit.

These cryptos might not dominate headlines daily, but their recent developments, especially Remittix’s presale, indicate they are potentially undervalued. Read on to discover whether these projects merit the attention of savvy DeFi investors. Is Remittix Deserving of The Title of PayFi’s Best Crypto? Considering the current state of the market, generating over $15 million in a presale isn’t merely impressive; it’s a clear indication that Remittix has captured attention in all the right ways. It marks the project’s strong entry into the fast growing PayFi space, where innovation and trust are hard to come by. For investors to commit such a substantial amount of money to a new project, there must be something truly remarkable about it. In this case, it is Remittix’s bold mission to overhaul the way international remittances work. While legacy systems remain tangled in fees, delays, and third-party hold-ups, Remittix offers something refreshingly different. It cuts through the noise with fast, low-cost transfers and supports over 40 cryptocurrencies alongside 30 fiat currencies. This kind of range gives users more control and choice, regardless of whether they’re sending money across the world or just next door. One of the most appealing features is the platform’s Pay API, which is designed specifically for enterprises and merchants. It enables seamless global payments without the need for intermediaries. Every transaction comes with a flat 1% fee and zero foreign exchange charges. This means there are no hidden costs, no hoops to jump through, just clean, efficient movement of money. ADA Might Be On Its Way To Hitting The Coveted $1 Mark On May 9, ADA finally broke through a persistent resistance level at $0.75, a barrier it hadn’t surpassed since March 9 earlier this year. That day, Cardano closed at $0.7774 as it slipped past the 23.60% Fibonacci mark at $0.7593. During those months of sideways movement, ADA carved out an inverted head and shoulders pattern. Usually, this pattern is a classic signal that hints at a possible shift in a token’s momentum. ADA’s breakout of this setup points to a target around $1.08, which aligns neatly with the 50% Fibonacci retracement. This is a huge sign that a potential 30% climb from ADA’s current levels is very likely. ADA’s price action has also edged above the 200-day EMA, which suggests growing long-term strength. All three key EMAs like the 50, 100, and 200 are now tilting upward meaning there just might be an impending bullish crossover. Some analysts, like Ali Charts on X , say that if ADA clears the $0.81 resistance next, the $1 mark might just be within reach. This price prediction, alongside ADA’s recent integration into the Brave browser could be the reasons for the token’s latest surge. Source: Coinmarketcap Conclusion Cardano and Remittix represent compelling investment opportunities in the altcoin space. Remittix, in particular, is demonstrating its potential with a over $15 million presale, where its native RTX token is priced at $0.0757.

Still in its presale phase and priced at just $0.025, many now consider it one of the best crypto assets to invest in before it sees major upside. Several crypto analysts are projecting that MUTM could reach $2 in the coming cycle—a massive jump from its current value. And unlike hype-based coins that ride short-term waves, Mutuum is backed by a working financial model that’s already attracting long-term investors and protocol participants. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol for lending and borrowing, designed to give users full control over their digital assets. When users deposit supported tokens like ETH or USDC into the platform, those assets become available to borrowers who provide overcollateralized loans. The interest paid by borrowers is where the token economics get interesting: a portion of those fees is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. Those purchased tokens are then redistributed to users who supplied liquidity—creating an internal loop of real usage generating demand. This buy-and-redistribute model makes MUTM increasingly valuable as the platform gains more users. Analysts believe that as borrowing volume increases, the constant market demand for the token will create long-term upward pressure—making the $2 prediction more than just optimistic speculation. Users who contribute assets to Mutuum’s liquidity pools are issued mtTokens, which serve as interest-accruing representations of their deposits. These mtTokens accumulate value over time as borrowers pay interest. Unlike other systems that rely on staking or manual rewards, Mutuum’s mtTokens grow automatically based on platform activity. This structure means users don’t need to actively manage their holdings to earn—they simply hold their mtTokens and watch their redeemable value rise. It’s a model built for passive income, which continues to attract serious long-term investors. MUTM is currently in Phase 4 of its presale, trading at $0.025. Over 87% of this round has been sold, and once complete, the price moves up to $0.03, with a confirmed launch price of $0.06. An investor entering at today’s price of $0.025 with $2,000 would receive 80,000 MUTM tokens. When MUTM reaches the projected target of $2, that position would grow to $160,000—a 6,300% increase from the original investment. Even hitting a fraction of that would still represent massive ROI. It’s numbers like these, paired with a working product, that are leading analysts to suggest MUTM could be the best cryptocurrency to invest in before listings go live. This bullish sentiment isn’t based on hope—it’s backed by deliverables. The team behind Mutuum has already confirmed the launch of a beta version of the platform shortly after the token goes live. That means real borrowing, lending, and earning will start almost immediately. In addition, the protocol is working toward Layer 2 integration to lower transaction costs and enhance scalability as user activity grows. And to ensure security, all smart contracts are currently undergoing a CertiK audit—a step that signals long-term seriousness and exchange-readiness. With these milestones already in motion, MUTM isn’t just preparing to enter the market—it’s preparing to perform in it. While many coins trade on speculation alone, MUTM has given analysts solid reasons to expect meaningful growth. From a strong buyback system to long-term staking through mtTokens, every part of the protocol reinforces value over time. At a current entry price of $0.025, the math speaks for itself. For investors searching for the top cryptocurrencies to invest in before the next wave, MUTM is proving to be more than just promising—it’s priced to move. And if that $2 projection becomes reality, early buyers won’t just have invested—they’ll have positioned themselves for life-changing gains.

A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of social media behemoths Instagram and Facebook, tells the Wall Street Journal that the corporate giant is dealing with “an epidemic of scams” that has been growing exponentially in recent years, both in scale and sophistication. “As this scam activity has become more persistent and sophisticated, so have our efforts.” The spokesperson reveals that Meta is experimenting with facial-recognition technology while also forming partnerships with banks and tech firms since the scams are affecting so many industries and “different parts of society.” Citing people familiar with the matter, WSJ also reports that JPMorgan Chase has raised concerns with Meta about its policing – or lack thereof – of scams. Meta accounted for nearly half of all reported scams on Zelle for JPMorgan Chase customers between the summers of 2023 and 2024, according to a WSJ source. JPMorgan also recently began blocking certain Zelle payments and warning users about transactions originating from social media platforms like Meta. The person said that the number of scams linked to Meta has shown improvement in recent months. However, documents seen by WSJ reportedly show that Meta has recently deprioritized enforcing scams, avoiding takedowns of erroneous advertisements because of supposed safety concerns, while also cutting costs and moving resources to other departments. WSJ interviewed Edgar Guzman, the owner of a home improvement supplies and garden equipment company in Atlanta, who said scams are relentlessly targeting his customers, prompting them to make payments for products that never arrive. Says Guzman, “What sucks is we have to break it to people that they’ve been scammed – we don’t even do online sales… We keep reporting pages to Meta, but nothing ever happens.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $3.29. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $10.31 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.7585 Market Cap $26.79 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $774.59M Circulating Supply 35.32 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.7683 24-hour Low $0.7295 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.18% 50-day SMA $ 0.688835 14-Day RSI 50.67 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADA/USD 1-Day Chart Based on the 1-day chart for Cardano (ADA) on May 18, the token is currently trading near $0.757, and shows a modest upward movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 53.84, meaning that the coin is in a neutral momentum with potential room for further gains before reaching overbought territory. On the other hand, Bollinger Bands are moderately wide, and the price is trending above the middle band, which often indicates bullish continuation. The upper band resistance around $0.854 may act as a short-term ceiling. If ADA manages to break this barrier, it could target the $0.90 zone. Support lies near $0.741. Momentum appears cautiously bullish pending a decisive breakout or rejection. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADA/USD 4-hour Chart Based on the 4-hour chart of Cardano (ADA) on May 18, the price is currently trading at approximately $0.759, nestled between the middle and upper Bollinger Bands. This suggests a neutral-to-bullish posture but lacks strong directional momentum. The MACD indicator shows a bearish crossover, with the MACD line and signal line dipping below the zero axis, hinting at potential short-term weakness. The Balance of Power (BoP) reads negative, pointing to a slight bearish pressure in recent sessions. If the price breaks below $0.737, a correction toward $0.70 may follow. However, maintaining above $0.764 could preserve the bullish structure. Traders should watch for volume confirmation.

On the daily chart, ADA is trading near $0.757, slightly above the middle Bollinger Band, indicating an effort to recover upward momentum. The RSI hovers around 59, suggesting moderate bullish sentiment without overbought pressure. However, price action shows resistance near $0.80. On the 4-hour chart, ADA has slipped slightly, with MACD showing a weakening bullish signal and the Balance of Power turning negative. This reflects fading bullish strength in the short term. A sustained hold above $0.737 may preserve upside potential, while a drop below risks a correction. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $1.00, with an average trading price of about $0.88 and a minimum price of $0.85. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $7.10. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.92 and $7.10, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano is likely to surpass $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $7.10. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $10 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $10.31. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.68, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $7.10. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges. Recent news/opinion on Cardano The Cardano Builder Fest #2 is scheduled for April 2025 in Vietnam. Developer Andrew Westberg has proposed reducing the treasury tax from 20% to 10%, which has been the subject of much discussion. Some argue that this would boost staking incentives and short-term price growth, while others worry about its impact on Cardano’s long-term sustainability.

By 2026, Cardano’s price could trade at a maximum of $1.264 Cardano’s historic price sentiment Cardano price history Cardano was founded in 2015 and went live in 2017. It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. In January 2025, Cardano traded around $1.02 and $1.09. However, the closing price for Cardano in January was $0.9. In February 2025, ADA surged toward $0.81 but it declined toward $0.64 by the end of the month. ADA value dropped further in March as it dipped to the $0.60 range. In April, ADA price dropped below $0.55 but it later surged toward $0.7. ADA ended April at $0.7030. At the start of May, ADA price skyrocketed to $0.8.",Crypto Price Predictions|ADA,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-18 11:47:26

From January 1, 2024, to the peak of the November rally, BONK provided a net 345% return, and BDAG was 2024’s most successful presale, raising over $250 million. Now, experts are backing the latest AI-driven project, Unilabs (UNIL), speculating it can replicate BlockDAG’s success and provide higher returns than BONK by the end of 2025. In its first week, Unilabs has surpassed $30 million in assets under management, and the UNIL presale has already amassed $425,000, setting new records for token demand in presale. BlockDAG: Redefining Scalability With EVM and DAG Architecture BlockDAG is an adaptive blockchain protocol with robust EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) capabilities. The project follows Bitcoin’s core principles but introduces the scalability of EVM chains to push the performance boundaries. The platform merges fast DAG technology with proof-of-work architecture to facilitate the processing power needed to execute thousands of transactions each second. BlockDAG’s large mining community, Tap-to-Earn rewards, and beta testnet launch add to investor appeal. The BDAG presale is near its end, and the early investors who have made a significant profit are now transferring capital to the Unilabs (UNIL) presale to make similar returns again and multiply their profits. BONK Rallies After Deep Correction: How High Will It Reach? After its massive rally last year, the Solana meme coin BONK entered an extended correction and dropped with considerable momentum in a declining wedge pattern, reaching a new multi-year low at $0.000009 on March 11. Image courtesy: TradingView The wider market recovery allowed BONK to break out from the upper trendline of the falling wedge. The price retested the upper trendline on April 7, and in the 39 days since, it has surged over 130%, giving rise to a new uptrend. A few days ago, BONK attempted a breakout from the bullish pattern but failed and has pulled back to the previous swing high. At press time, it trades at $0.00002131, with strong immediate support near $0.00002. Despite the pullback, the MACD and RSI indicate increasing bullish sentiment, and a move past the $0.000024 resistance could fuel the BONK price rally to a target of $0.000036. Regardless, investors prefer Unilabs as its presale offers steady returns that can outperform in the long run. Unilabs (UNIL): Unlocking AI-Automated Fund Investing Investors are moving funds from BlockDAG and BONK to the Unilabs presale in search of better and sturdy returns. This massive inflow has made UNIL the fastest rising presale this season, raising nearly $400K within a week. Unilabs attracts investors not only with its lucrative returns but also with the impressive technological innovation of its next-generation AI-fund manager. The platform offers four main DeFi fund baskets: BTC, RWA, AI, and Mining, each holding a range of emerging and high-potential altcoins. The AI has been trained to find trends and patterns using historical market data. It carefully assesses tokenomics, sustainability, risks, and background checks, and adds the assets with the best expected returns to the respective baskets. The profits are completely transparent and are distributed periodically as dividends and yields. Users can also earn passive income with Unilabs’ referral scheme, which offers exciting rewards to those who help expand the community. The referral rewards are distributed from a share of the platform’s revenue in the form of UNIL tokens, which are also available to purchase in the live presale. In presale stage two, UNIL is priced at $0.0051, reflecting a 21.5% surge from the stage one price of $0.004. As the presale reaches further stages, the price will continue to rise, providing the most compounding returns to the earliest investors. Conclusion While BlockDAG and BONK gave remarkable results in 2024, Unilabs’ growing momentum highlights its potential to flip these two giants in this year’s bull market. Timing is the most important thing in crypto, which is why this is the right moment to acquire UNIL , which sells for a discounted price in presale.

Analysts in this Ethereum price prediction say that if ETH can clearly push beyond the $2,800 resistance level, a psychological and technical barrier, it might quickly climb toward $3,300. Rising institutional interest, a deflationary supply trend following recent network upgrades, and a strengthening macroeconomic environment for crypto assets all support this projection. Bullish Signals for Ethereum: Can ETH Smash the $2,800 Barrier Ethereum is currently testing the pivotal $2,800 resistance level, a key focus in recent Ethereum price prediction analyses. Following the successful Pectra upgrade and the Ethereum Foundation’s launch of the Trillion Dollar Security initiative, ETH has shown resilience, trading above $2,450 and aiming for higher targets. Source: CoinMarketCap With ETH holding above the 200-day moving average, technical indications point to a bullish momentum. A clear break above $2,800 is expected by analysts to drive Ethereum into the $3,000 level. Notable investments, notably a UK company’s $655 million purchase, emphasize strong institutional interest and hence help the hopeful Ethereum price prediction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows overbought conditions, which could imply possible short-term corrections. Hence, care is recommended. Still, the general trend is hopeful since Ethereum’s strong foundations and increasing use help to sustain a good prognosis. Depending on overcoming the $2,800 barrier, the Ethereum price predictions stay good. Success in this project could pave the way for more increases, hence strengthening Ethereum’s standing in the crypto market. ETH Sets Sights on $3,300 Ethereum is gaining real traction, with strong charts and growing interest from big investors. Experts now believe ETH could climb 20% and reach $3,300 by May 2025, thanks to positive trends and solid institutional support. Analysts have drawn attention to Ethereum’s approaching key resistance mark around $2,800. Source: TradingView A successful breach of this barrier could open the road for ETH to rise towards $3,300 and maybe higher. Investor trust in Ethereum’s long-term worth has also been strengthened by the recent Pectra upgrade, which has helped to create a deflationary trend. Some, nevertheless, warn that technical signs point to a possible retreat to $2,800 if selling pressure rises and that Ethereum’s price is now consolidating around $3,300. Notwithstanding this, the general mood stays positive since Ethereum’s strong foundations and increasing use help to promote a good view. Remittix Presale Frenzy: $15 Million Raised as RTX Gains Momentum The crypto market is rebounding swiftly, and optimistic Ethereum price predictions are fueling momentum across the sector, especially for rising projects like Remittix and its innovative PayFi solution.

Broadcasting live data from the exchange it was opened on – Hyperliquid, CoinGlass’s live feed shows that the liquidation price is set at $95,576. A WHALE JUST OPENED $276 MILLION 40X LONG POSITION ON BITCOIN THE LIQUIDATION PRICE IS $95,000 WHALE OR INSIDER ? pic.twitter.com/79Aopmbl1m — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) May 17, 2025 Numerous crypto content creators and influencers picked up the massive position on Saturday evening, which at first was worth a more modest $276 million. The initial entry price was $103,129. However, live data from CoinGlass shows that the mysterious whale capitalized on a brief opportunity they had when bitcoin’s price slipped below $103,000 to double down on their position, which is now worth over $393 million (3,790 BTC). The entry price has been lowered to $103,083, but the liquidation still stands at just shy of $95,600. Given BTC’s current price tag of almost $104,000, the whale stands on a “modest” unrealized profit of $3.3 million as of now. There have been quite a few cases in the past couple of months in which mysterious whales opened large positions on Hyperliquid that caught the community’s attention. Recall another example from March this year when someone opened a massive multi-million-dollar short position. Later, popular crypto sleuth ZachXBT claimed that this was William Parker, a UK individual linked to a $1 million casino theft among other scandals. According to the reports, Parker profited around $20 million by using extremely high leverage to open positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars, which allowed him to manipulate the market.

Price Predictions Point to a 15x Surge,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/is-mutm-quietly-becoming-next-big-crypto-price-predictions-point-to-surge/,"The post Is MUTM Quietly Becoming the Next Big Crypto? Price Predictions Point to a 15x Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a market full of noise, the tokens that make the biggest moves often do so quietly—backed not by hype, but by real growth, utility, and early investor positioning. That’s exactly what’s happening with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale-stage project that’s rapidly gaining attention for all the right reasons. With a confirmed launch price of $0.06 and a current presale price of just $0.025, analysts are now forecasting a potential 15x surge, putting a short-term price target in the $0.375 range. And with its unique DeFi architecture already in place, many believe MUTM could be the next big crypto to take off as listings approach. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol designed to create value for participants through real usage. The platform doesn’t rely on promotional stunts or inflated rewards. Instead, it generates token demand through a buy-and-redistribute system. When users borrow from the platform, they pay interest. A portion of that interest is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then redistributed to liquidity providers. This creates a sustainable reward mechanism based on usage, not hype. Mutuum stands out by offering two lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to deposit assets into a shared pool. The protocol handles the rest—allocating funds to borrowers and distributing passive returns to suppliers based on pool utilization. It’s a low-maintenance, yield-generating model for users looking for hands-off income. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) gives users more control, enabling direct negotiation between lender and borrower. This model is ideal for users who want to set custom terms, choose specific counterparties, or work with assets that aren’t typically included in standard DeFi lending pools. This dual-model structure not only broadens Mutuum’s user base but also makes it more dynamic than many of its DeFi competitors—an important factor when considering what crypto to buy now for long-term value. Every time a user supplies liquidity to the platform, they receive mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that reflect their contribution to the pool. Over time, these mtTokens increase in value as interest accumulates, giving users passive income without needing to stake or manage complex strategies. mtTokens also serve as a core element of the protocol’s design, enabling broader functionality, including composability with other DeFi systems in the future. MUTM is now in Phase 4 of its presale, priced at $0.025, with over 87% of the round completed. So far, the project has raised more than $8.6 million and attracted nearly 10,000 holders—signs of both institutional and individual confidence in the project’s roadmap. The next pricing tier will raise the token price to $0.03, offering smaller margins before the confirmed listing at $0.06. For those searching for the top cryptocurrency to enter before exchange exposure, this is one of the few remaining entry points backed by actual development. Multiple crypto predictions are converging on one point: MUTM’s early price doesn’t reflect its full potential. Between its self-sustaining tokenomics, live product development, and real passive yield system, the value logic is already clear. When MUTM hits just $0.375 post-launch, early presale investors at $0.025 would see a 15x return. That would turn a $1,000 investment into $15,000. Mutuum Finance is gaining ground without making a scene. While other coins chase trends, MUTM is building real infrastructure, offering real returns, and earning real trust. The whales have already started positioning. Long-term investors are locking in low-cost entries. If you’re wondering which crypto to buy for exponential potential, don’t wait for the headlines. By the time everyone’s talking about it, the best entry might already be gone. MUTM may not be loud right now—but it’s moving fast. And this quiet phase? That’s when smart money makes its move.

Despite the current pause in momentum, the broader Ethereum price action remains bullish as long as price holds key higher support levels near $2,450. What’s Happening with Ethereum’s Price? After its breakout rally from the $1,950 zone, the Ethereum price soared more than 35% in under a week, testing the $2,660–$2,700 supply region. However, this level has triggered a short-term rejection, and ETH has since corrected back into the $2,470–$2,500 range.

The Zamoskvoretsky District Court ordered his detention earlier this week. Authorities have not disclosed the specific nature of the alleged criminal activity . The arrest comes as the investigation into tap-to-earn platforms intensifies. Blum clarified that Smerkis is no longer associated with the company in a statement distributed to its 5.3 million followers on X. Crypto executives’ involvement in fraud cases raises investor tension Fraud cases involving crypto executives are becoming increasingly common. The desire for personal gain, perceived pressures, and opportunities within their roles are complex interplaying factors that lead executives to engage in fraud. As a result, tension among cryptocurrency investors has increased. Concerning Vladimir Smerkis’s arrest, Blum shared an X post stating that it would like to let its community know that Smerkis had resigned from his position as Chief Marketing Officer and was no longer working on the project or serving on its team. Smerkis’s arrest comes at a time when tap-to-earn platforms are under growing global attention. The trend exploded after the viral success of Hamster Kombat in 2024, which introduced millions to the crypto world through the largest token airdrop the industry has seen. Blum emerged as one of the notable projects riding this wave. The platform became well-known due to the tap-to-earn trend, which involves games in which players tap their screens repeatedly to accumulate digital tokens. In the case of Blum, players collected in-game currency by tapping falling snowflakes, which the project stated could be converted into actual cash. According to CoinGecko data, the tap-to-earn segment currently has a $511 million market capitalization. Alexander Mashinsky pleads guilty to multimillion-dollar fraud Alexander Mashinsky is another crypto executive allegedly linked to fraud cases. He was arrested in relation to fraud cases on Thursday, May 8, after reports from sources revealed that the former CEO of Celsius Network pleaded guilty to two fraud counts, getting a 12-year prison sentence. Mashinksy’s legal issues started in 2023. In December of the same year, he pleaded guilty to commodities fraud and Celsius token manipulation. Mashinsky was sentenced in Court 14A, 500 Pearl Street, which also housed several criminal cryptocurrency executives. Moreover, he was taken into custody on suspicion of wire fraud, commodities, and securities. Around the same time, Celsius reached a $4.7 billion settlement with the FTC. The settlement made the full extent of the fraud clear. Celsius had to turn over the remaining clients’ assets to file for bankruptcy. This followed accusations against Mashinsky for deceiving investors about the security and profitability of a platform that produced Celsius yields and selling tens of millions of dollars in his company’s personal assets. In the Southern District of Manhattan, Mashinsky stood before US District Judge John G. Koeltl and faced the truth about what the prosecution claimed was a multimillion-dollar investment scheme. Mashinsky pleaded guilty and was sentenced on Thursday, ending the lengthy case authorities pursued after the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused him and Celsius of committing a multibillion-dollar fraud after initially denying any wrongdoing. Other formerly influential executives have also experienced similar outcomes to Mashinsky’s for their involvement in fraud cases, including Do Kwon of Terraform Labs , Changpeng Zhao of Binance, and Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX.

The focus is no longer just on well-established tokens, but on newer, fundamentally solid projects that offer both early-stage entry and near-term upside. One project that’s steadily moving to the forefront of that discussion is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently in its presale phase and priced under $0.03, MUTM is not just another token waiting for a market cycle—it’s a protocol with infrastructure already in motion, and a user model that aligns usage with value generation. Over the past several days, on-chain inflows into the presale have climbed sharply, prompting analysts to raise projections. Several analysts now anticipate that MUTM may surpass the $1 mark earlier than originally projected. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While many new cryptocurrency projects rely on marketing cycles to create momentum, MUTM is gaining attention due to growing interest in its architecture—particularly its dual lending models and scalable backend. Mutuum offers two distinct lending options: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model is built for stability and ease. Users deposit assets like ETH, DAI, or USDC into shared liquidity pools, which borrowers can access by locking approved collateral. Interest rates are dynamic, responding to supply and demand within each pool. This model is ideal for users looking to earn passive APY with lower maintenance. In contrast, the P2P system is more flexible. It enables users to negotiate loan terms directly with one another. This format is especially useful for those who prefer more control over rates and loan conditions—or want to support assets outside typical pool listings. It’s also an efficient way to isolate risk between counterparties. The presence of both systems in one protocol makes Mutuum uniquely adaptable, appealing to a broader range of user strategies. As investors look for more than simple staking mechanics, these lending features have become central to why MUTM is increasingly being viewed as a top cryptocurrency to buy now. Scalability has become a defining issue for DeFi platforms aiming to grow past initial adoption. Elevated gas costs and network congestion reduce efficiency and discourage user participation. Mutuum Finance is addressing this by preparing for Layer 2 deployment, ensuring that as transaction volume rises, the platform remains efficient and cost-effective. Integrating a Layer 2 solution will allow faster processing, lower fees, and a better experience for users interacting with lending, borrowing, and collateral features. This forward-looking step adds even more confidence for early adopters seeking what crypto to invest in that’s prepared for broader market demand. The increasing capital inflow into MUTM’s presale isn’t just a blip—it’s a signal. Many early-stage investors, especially those who’ve tracked successful DeFi crypto projects in the past, are positioning before what they see as a strong breakout window. With the current presale price at $0.025, and a confirmed launch price of $0.06, the pricing gap is already attractive. However, the discussion has moved beyond simply aiming for 2x or 3x returns. Based on user demand, token utility, and protocol rollout, several analysts now believe $1 is within reach sooner than expected—especially as awareness spreads and larger investor segments step in. The structure is in place. The mechanics are built. And entry is still open. Mutuum Finance isn’t aiming to be just another name in the crowd. It’s building around real lending strategies, user-driven models, and scalable tech. That foundation—combined with rising interest and growing capital inflow—is why many now see it as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in before the next breakout. Whether you’re drawn to the long-term mechanics or the near-term price setup, MUTM presents something that’s rare in the current market: a project that’s still early, but clearly moving in the right direction.

Judge Analisa Torres won’t issue an indicative ruling, so both sides will have to do more than just agree between themselves—the court wants a good reason to reverse its previous position. BREAKING RIPPLE VS. SEC UPDATE: Judge Torres SHUTS DOWN the parties' request for an indicative ruling! #XRP #Ripple #SEC pic.twitter.com/rb6Q4eaf54 — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) May 15, 2025 The crypto markets were shocked and XRP’s regulatory status is once again uncertain. Analyst Eleanor Terrett said Judge Torres “isn’t letting them walk away easily” while attorney John Deaton said the court wants a credible argument that serves both public and institutional interests. Deaton also said a revised motion could be approved eventually—but not for months. Ripple’s path forward is to continue its cross-appeal while the SEC may still appeal the programmatic sales ruling. With the June 16 court deadline for a settlement update looming, this drama is far from over. XRP Outlook: Settlement, Appeals, or Supreme Court? This case can still go three ways : full settlement, appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals or Supreme Court. A Supreme Court ruling would set a precedent not just for XRP but the entire crypto market. NEW: After speaking with three legal sources and tuning into @JohnEDeaton1 ’s live analysis, my read is that Judge Torres is playing hardball here—she’s not making it easy for the parties to simply walk away; instead, she’ll make them work for it. Deaton raises a valid point:… https://t.co/GYU4RDt77R — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) May 16, 2025 The concern for XRP bulls is timing. A long court battle or worse an SEC win on appeal could delay or kill future XRP-spot ETF approvals in the U.S. which previously boosted optimism in July 2023. With the SEC getting more aggressive in crypto enforcement XRP’s legal future is tied to Washington’s evolving stance on digital assets. But the core issue now is credibility. Will Ripple insist a settlement is required to withdraw its cross-appeal? If so and the SEC doesn’t play ball the case could spiral into another multi-year battle. XRP Technical Setup: Breakout at $2.44 Despite the legal woes XRP has shown technical strength. After holding above $2.314 it broke out of the descending channel and is now at $2.40. The 50-period EMA at $2.382 has flipped to support—a bullish sign.MACD has crossed below zero with green histogram bars, indicating increasing upside momentum. XRP Technical Setup: Breakout at $2.44 – Source: Tradingview The candlestick pattern is also improving with a bullish engulfing candle followed by consolidation, buyers are absorbing selling pressure. Entry: On breakout above $2.440 Targets: $2.504 and $2.568 Stop-loss: Below $2.369 For new traders: XRP just climbed out of a price slide. Now it’s resting on a ledge. If it can get above $2.44 it could start to rally. Conclusion XRP is walking a tightrope—legally and technically. But for now bulls have short-term control, making XRP price prediction bullish. A confirmed move above $2.44 could be the trigger that gets it to $2.56 even as the legal battles continue. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.84M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As XRP holding above $2.38, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $5,919,969.28/ $6,844,387 Token Price: $0.002515 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

The 8th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been steadily regaining lost ground in the last couple of weeks, following a major downturn in proceedings in the cryptocurrency markets in general and DOGE in particular. DOGE is the world’s first meme coin and one of the oldest digital currencies, dating back to 2014. It started as a joke as the founder, Billy Markus, copied Bitcoin’s code to start a network but changed the font to Comic Sans, which is used in the popular Shiba dog meme. But, with time, the meme coin sector started to attract major attention in the crypto community, peaking during the 2020-2021 bull market when the digital currency rose a spectacular 600000% in just a few months, leaving crypto traders in awe. DOGE’s incredible success powered a massive foray into the meme coin economy that still sees dozens of new tokens released daily. However, DOGE’s major exploits during the 2020-2021 bull market haven’t been replicated in the 2024-2025 edition. The cryptocurrency has yet to come close to the $0.7 All-Time High price point, and if it fails to do so, a major rally will remain elusive. On-chain Activity Surge Nevertheless, a recent surge in the cryptocurrency network’s on-chain activity may spark the bullish forces. According to popular X influencer Ali Martinez, over 280,000 active addresses have been witnessed in the last couple of days, showing strong improvement in on-chain activity. The flurry of blockchain network undertakings is now reaching new six-month highs. Here is the graph shared by Martinez: Image Source: X Price Trend Here is the graph of DOGE from the last couple of months or so: The coin is trading around $0.224, up from $0.17 just a week ago. According to top analysts, a major boost is needed in the ensuing months if the $1 price target is to be realized in the coming months. Analysts are confident that the $1 goal is achievable, and the meme coin economy’s continued short-term exploits mean that the joke token sector is here to stay. However, a move similar to 2020-2021 may not be expected. Overall, DOGE is scheduled to cement itself among the Top Ten cryptocurrencies during this bull market.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-18 12:36:44

Ethereum launched a new security initiative, DeFi tools continued evolving, and JPMorgan executed its first transaction on a public blockchain. Let’s find out more. Bitcoin Brazilian fintech firm Méliuz has announced that it has become the country’s first Bitcoin treasury company, by acquiring $28.4 million in Bitcoin as part of a long-term corporate strategy to integrate the cryptocurrency into its financial operations. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April, which is less than the predicted 2.4% that economists had forecast. Bitcoin (BTC) climbed back above $103,000 and is continuing to accumulate above $100,000. Ethereum The Ethereum Foundation has introduced a new security-focused initiative, dubbed the Trillion Dollar Security (1TS), aimed at significantly enhancing the blockchain’s resilience and reliability. DeFi DeFi hooks are helping reduce front-running, minimize slippage, and dynamically adjust swap fees to better handle volatile market conditions. Technology JPMorgan Chase has carried out its first transaction on a public blockchain, marking a milestone in its ongoing efforts to integrate traditional finance with digital asset infrastructure. Business Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Company, has significantly increased its exposure to Bitcoin, committing over $408 million through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). In a major statement of intent, Jack Mallers’ Twenty One Capital has acquired 4,812 Bitcoins worth approximately $458.7 million. FalconX, a leading digital assets prime brokerage, has announced a strategic partnership with Standard Chartered aimed at enhancing digital asset services for institutional investors across key global markets. Pump.fun, the leading Solana-based memecoin launchpad, has unveiled a significant update to its platform, introducing a 50% revenue-sharing model for token creators. Web3 Space and Time (SxT) has achieved sub-second proofs for its Proof of SQL product, advancing its vision of a fast, interconnected Web3 powered by zero-knowledge coprocessors. P2P.org joins the IOTA network as a Genesis Validator for the recently launched IOTA Rebased mainnet to provide enhanced security to the network and increase institutional staking participation. AI is now supercharging spatial computing , fusing physical and virtual worlds in real time through technologies like AR, VR, and MR, with the market projected to reach \$280 billion by 2028. The world of finance has been witnessing a quiet revolution as tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) have made their way onto the blockchain, taking a once-niche experiment to the heights of a burgeoning movement capable of attracting major banks, asset managers, and fintech innovators. Tezos’s L2 offering ‘Etherlink’ has been enjoying a DeFi growth spurt of epic proportions, thanks, in large part, to a cleverly gamified incentive program called ‘ Apple Farm .’ Security Coinbase has revealed a recent cyberattack where hackers bribed the platform’s overseas support agents to steal confidential data and use it in social engineering attacks.

The substantial amount is held in both USD and PI tokens. Pi Network Ventures: The Details It all started with a mysterious yet hyping tweet ten days ago when the official X account behind the project said a big announcement would come on May 14. The community went wild with speculations but their number one possibility – a listing on Binance – didn’t come to fruition. The actual announcement outlined the creation of a dedicated investment fund called Pi Network Ventures, which will distribute up to $100 million toward startups and businesses that “advance the utility, adoption, and real-impact of Pi.” The details behind the new initiative, published by the team earlier this week but reiterated in a more recent post, indicate that it was established through the Pi Foundation, which is an “ownerless organization intended to steer the long-term development of the Pi ecosystem.” The PI holdings in the new fund come from 10% of the tokens that are allocated for foundation reserves. The main objectives for the Pi Network Ventures are threefold, but at their core, they aim to benefit “builders, businesses, and most importantly, the global community of Pioneers: Boost Pi utility : Support startups and businesses that integrate Pi into their products, services, and customer experiences. Enable more of the world’s production onto Pi Network : Get more real-world production processes, whether in the form of apps, transactions or companies, onto Pi by investing early on in startups and companies that create such processes. Bring Pi to the real world : Empower real-life use cases and applications that demonstrate Pi’s unique value as a widely distributed, accessible, and usable cryptocurrency. The upcoming investors will range from early-stage startups to Series B funding rounds and beyond, continues the post. How Does it Differ? The announcement outlined two key reasons why Pi Network Ventures differs from other similar cryptocurrency ecosystem programs. First, it said that Pi’s alternative will focus heavily on “general technology sectors, including generative AI and AI applications, FinTech, embedded payments, e-commerce platforms, marketplaces, social networks, and real-world consumer and enterprise applications.” Second, all of its processes are supposed to mirror the practices of traditional Silicon Valley VC firms in the way it sources, selects, and vets projects in which it will invest. The team further noted that Pioneers (investors holding the PI token) will benefit because the new initiative will create more utility for the asset, enhance the ecosystem, and incentivize high-quality integrations.

According to reports, the woman, in her 40s, carried out the theft while her boyfriend was sleeping. Prosecutors did not reveal the name of the perpetrator during the trial. According to reports , the accused woman stole around 683 million won, worth approximately $488,000. She carried out the theft in January, with the sentencing being carried out this week. During her trial, the woman was also convicted on charges of embezzlement after it was discovered she also stole 2 million won in cash, worth about $1,430. The news was reported by local media in South Korea. South Korean woman sent to jail for crypto theft According to the authorities, the crime occurred at 11:50 PM at her boyfriend’s house in Jeju City, South Korea, on January 5. They said that the woman had carefully memorized her boyfriend’s login details in the hopes that she would access his account when he went to bed. While he was sleeping, the woman took his phone and used his bank apps and exchanges to transfer funds to her personal accounts. Authorities mentioned that after stealing the money, the South Korean woman fled the location, boarding a plane to another part of the country. She had the intention of staying there and enjoying the stolen funds. However, things did not go the way she had thought as the police nabbed her at a hotel near Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province. She was subsequently arrested and moved back to Jeju City to answer for her crimes. According to the details of the case, the woman admitted to the charges, noting that she carried out the criminal act on January 5 while her boyfriend was sleeping. She also mentioned that she had returned most of the funds, noting that she only owes around 21.9 million won, worth about $15,000. The woman also asked the court for leniency because she had returned part of the funds and is remorseful about her actions. Uptick in crypto-related crimes causes concerns The media in South Korea mentioned that the court refused her plea of leniency because she is a repeat offender, given her history of fraud, and the amount of money owed was still substantial. The case was handled by the court in Jeju province, South Korea. The woman’s legal representatives also urged the courts for mercy, citing their client’s remorse and her actions towards refunding the stolen funds. They argued that the woman owes a smaller amount of money compared to what she originally stole on January 5. The court, during the announcement of the verdict, mentioned that the woman was a repeat offender. The court said she had two previous convictions for fraud, with one of them heading to trial before she stole her boyfriend’s digital assets. The judge refused to consider her plea or give her a second chance because she had repeatedly been given second chances, which she has continually wasted. The judge handed her a two-year jail term. The conviction adds to an increasing number of crypto-related crimes in Jeju and globally, as peer-to-peer trades are now leading to theft, assault, and even murder. In January, a man in his 30s was found stabbed to death in a hotel in Jeju after travelling there to attend a private crypto meeting. In another case, four Chinese nationals were apprehended for stealing $63,000 in digital assets. The same month, 22-year-old Maissa Jebali was arrested for stealing TRUMP meme coins from her ex-boyfriend. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The biggest returns often come not from following the crowd but from acting before the momentum builds. As the broader market begins to show early signs of recovery, investors are once again asking a familiar question: What crypto to buy before the next wave hits? And one name is steadily gaining ground among those watching closely— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Still in presale and priced at just $0.025, MUTM has yet to hit exchanges, but it’s already turning heads. Why? Because the project isn’t built on trends—it’s structured around function. And with a product rollout aligned with its token launch, Mutuum isn’t waiting for attention—it’s preparing to earn it. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) What sets Mutuum Finance apart from the growing list of new cryptocurrencies is its protocol-first model. At its core, the project is focused on decentralized lending and borrowing, but not in the way that simply imitates existing platforms. When users interact with the system—by depositing assets or borrowing funds—those actions contribute to real value movement within the protocol. Borrowers pay interest. A portion of that interest is then used by the system to buy back MUTM tokens on the open market. Those tokens are distributed to users who supply capital through the platform, creating a reward loop tied directly to usage. This isn’t a reward system based on token inflation. It’s a system that grows through protocol volume—something that becomes more valuable as more users participate. It’s one of the reasons long-term investors see it as one of the best crypto projects to invest in ahead of listings. Most crypto investors know that by the time a token is trending, the best entry is already gone. That’s why serious traders are positioning before the rest of the market catches on. MUTM is still accessible—but not for much longer. The presale is currently in Phase 4, with over 83% completed. Once this round closes, the price will increase to $0.03, followed by the confirmed listing price of $0.06. For those aiming to double or triple their position by simply entering ahead of the listing, this is the strategic window. But there’s more at play than just launch pricing. As capital continues flowing into the project, some analysts are now forecasting that MUTM could exceed $1.25 during its first cycle—especially as awareness spreads and the protocol begins to deliver real-time results. Mutuum’s lending architecture gives users options through two models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C structure allows users to deposit assets into shared pools and earn returns based on utilization rates—ideal for those looking for a passive yield experience. In contrast, the P2P model gives users more control, allowing direct negotiation of terms with another user. This approach opens the door for higher returns or custom terms, especially on assets that may not be supported in the main liquidity pools. To support future growth and handle increased activity, the team is also preparing for Layer 2 deployment, aiming to reduce fees and improve transaction speeds as the platform scales. This forward-thinking strategy is another reason investors aren’t just eyeing MUTM as a trade—but as a project worth holding through the next cycle. While many are still waiting for the market to show a full breakout, seasoned investors are already repositioning—and they’re doing it quietly. The tokens that outperform aren’t usually the ones found during the bull run. They’re the ones discovered before it begins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings structure, utility, and a reward system that actually responds to use. It doesn’t rely on gimmicks, and it isn’t built to go viral—it’s built to grow. For anyone asking what crypto to buy now, this is one of the few presale projects where the fundamentals and the timing both align.

On May 17, a federal judge rejected a SEC settlement motion to reduce the $75 million penalty, citing procedural issues rather than addressing the case’s merits. While the decision doesn’t worsen Ripple’s legal standing, it prolongs the uncertainty that continues to cloud XRP. This unresolved legal status may weigh on investor sentiment, as a judge’s approval of the settlement would have finally closed the chapter. In light of this, Finbold gathered predictions from OpenAI’s ChatGPT and xAI’s Grok to assess how XRP might perform by the end of 2025 amid regulatory uncertainty. AI predicts XRP price for end of 2025 ChatGPT presented a scenario-based forecast shaped by how the SEC case unfolds in a bullish outcome. In this scenario, where Ripple secures a favorable settlement, the broader cryptocurrency market rallies XRP could rise to between $3.50 and $5.50. ChatGPT noted that XRP will likely trade between $2 and $3 if the legal process drags on without resolution. An unfavorable outcome, such as an adverse ruling or broader market downturn, could push prices down to the $1 and $2 range. With XRP currently trading at around $2.40, ChatGPT suggested the price reflects a mix of optimism for legal closure and caution due to delays. ChatGPT XRP price prediction.

However, the ongoing SEC case may still create short-term volatility. The lower end of its forecast accounts for extended legal delays or a broader market pullback, while the $4.50 projection assumes partial legal progress, supported by potential approvals of spot XRP exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) and Ripple’s expanding role in global payments.

After a dour performance during the week, the premier cryptocurrency has continued to trade within the $92,000 – $95,000 range on Saturday, May 17. With the choppy price action, doubt about the Bitcoin price reclaiming its all-time high of $108,786 is starting to creep in. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the market leader could be gearing up for significant price movements over the next few weeks. Open Interest Metric Predicts What’s Next For BTC Price In a recent post on the X platform, blockchain analytics firm Alphractal delved into fresh on-chain observations revolving around the price of Bitcoin and the open interest (OI) cycle. According to the market intelligence firm, the BTC open interest data is exhibiting certain patterns that have coincided with major price moves in the past. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Below ATH – Buying Pressure Weakens As Equities Outperform Typically, the open interest metric measures the total amount of money flowing into BTC derivatives at any given period. Meanwhile, the OI Delta indicator estimates changes in the open interest over a specific timeframe. Firstly, Alphractal highlighted that the 30-day Open Interest Delta recently reached the same levels seen during the Bitcoin price rise to its previous all-time high around $73,737 in 2024. This pattern shows that the BTC market could be at the beginning of a cyclical behavioral change. Alphractal said: A familiar pattern is emerging: alternating cycles of increase and decrease in the Open Interest Delta — what we might call Phase 1 and Phase 2. After a strong buildup of positions (positive Delta), we often see a nearly proportional drop (negative Delta), showing clear cyclical behavior in the market. Furthermore, Alphractal noted that the 180-day Open Interest Delta offers a more interesting insight into the Bitcoin price trajectory in the coming weeks. According to the market intelligence firm, a negative 180-day OI Delta metric is usually associated with a market bottom or an accumulation trend. As shown in the chart above, the 180-day Open Interest Delta sits just above the negative territory, which suggests that the Bitcoin price could witness increased volatility in the coming weeks. However, it is worth mentioning that a cross beneath the zero threshold could also signal the start of a new consolidation phase. Alphractal concluded on X: Overall, Open Interest has not grown proportionally like it did from October 2023 to early 2024 — and again from October 2024 into early 2025. These yearly patterns may suggest a fractal behavior in investor risk appetite. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $103,367, reflecting a 0.4% decline in the past 24 hours.

Unilabs (UNIL) is by far the world’s first AI-powered DeFi asset manager, which utilizes advanced AI to track over 1,000 emerging projects to determine early investments and deliver industry-leading yields. Ethereum Price Cools Off: Shows 27% Surge In Weekly Gains The Ethereum price has increased gradually since April 7. Reportedly, on May 10, the movement became parabolic, leading to a 50% weekly increase. ETH even outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) during this time, which has rarely happened in the current cycle, where ETH has lost over 70% of its value against BTC. The Ethereum price has completed a five-wave upward movement with an unusually extended wave five since April 7. While the movement became parabolic on May 10, ETH lost some momentum this week and became much more gradual. Furthermore, technical indicators are showing weakness in recent analysis. Source: TradingView If the analysis is on point, the Ethereum price has started an A-B-C correction (red), which can end at three support levels. An extremely shallow retracement would reach the $2,420 area, a Fibonacci and horizontal support. A deeper retracement could bring the $2,220 and $2,060 levels into play, coinciding with an ascending parallel channel. Unilabs Overshadows Ethereum Price Rally With $30 Million AUM While most ETH holders reflect bullish signs through trading, Unilabs (UNIL) gradually shifts the spotlight with its fast-selling presale mania. This modern-gen investment platform is positioned to skyrocket in the upcoming sessions after crypto experts share in-depth analysis about Unilabs’ potential, as seen in its first presale stage. Unilabs is gaining popularity in the trillion-dollar market for its cutting-edge blockchain technology that delivers lightning-fast execution speeds and an advanced AI protocol embedded in the platform. The platform features premium and enterprise-grade trading tools that help investors and traders make the most of it while navigating the crypto market. What’s Next for Ethereum (ETH) Holders This Cycle? A look at the long-term wave count suggests that the ongoing increase is a relief rally, since it follows a five-wave decline (red). If the count is accurate, the Ethereum price is at the top of wave A in an A-B-C structure (green). Thus, after the predicted retracement, the price will begin another upward movement, taking it between $3,066 and $3,526. Afterward, ETH’s downward trend that started in December 2024 will likely resume. While ETH’s increase in the past week is impressive, it does not invalidate its long-term bearish trend. The most likely short-term analysis suggests ETH will retrace toward a maximum of $2,060 before rallying again. Unilabs’ Presale Gains Momentum As the Next Bull Run Approaches Unilabs (UNIL) is showing signs of growing momentum with the next bull run just around the corner. This platform offers next-level transparency, significant returns, and full access to ventures typically restricted to high-profile investors. Unilabs follows the narrative of delivering high returns by enabling institutional investment opportunities for retail traders. At Unilabs, the dev team helps uplift the platform to build an infrastructure that allows investors and traders to seize the potential of high-growth crypto innovations. The platform is positioned for more gains in the near term as AI enthusiasts prioritize Unilabs (UNIL) over other emerging projects for its top-notch blockchain technology and AI integration in the platform. Conclusion: While the increasing Ethereum price is turning heads, Unilabs (UNIL) is also soaring ahead with a mind-blowing adoption rate among investors and retail traders. Visit the presale today.

Long-term investors remain confident in their positions, but short-term traders are beginning to lose patience. Ethereum (ETH) trades near $1,837 , with modest quarter-to-date growth of just over 2% . Despite bullish fundamentals—like L2 adoption and AI token demand—ETH remains pinned below critical breakout levels. XRP holds around $2.22 , buoyed by U.S. ETF speculation and Ripple’s global payments infrastructure. Yet with volume flattening and legal clarity still elusive, upward movement has stalled. For traders seeking sharper upside before summer, attention is shifting toward one emerging contender— MAGACOIN FINANCE . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Altcoin Quietly Outperforming in Q2 While legacy tokens consolidate, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum. With over $8 million already raised and presale stages filling fast, this altcoin is offering something rare— high-conviction upside before exchange listing . Set to list at $0.007 , early entry points offer traders estimated 25x to 35x ROI , depending on participation tier. Unlike other early tokens dependent on hype or influencer buzz, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising through substance—backed by real community traction and a solid growth plan. This pre-listing performance is positioning it as one of Q2’s strongest altcoin ROI opportunities. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Pulling Ahead Analysts highlight several reasons MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out: Scarcity mechanics built to reward early participation A fast-growing community of over 20,000+ holders Narrative synergy with 2025’s political and cultural landscape A tiered bonus model that creates urgency and front-loads rewards With its biggest milestones still ahead—including major listings, integrations, and media campaigns— MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining speed while ETH and XRP tread water.

MAGACOIN FINANCE , by contrast, is building real momentum before its debut on exchanges. With listings on the horizon, deep community support, and clear structural upside, the question is shifting from “if” to “when” this altcoin hits the mainstream.

This comes after witnessing a week of fluctuations. The rise in Bitcoin’s dominance, in a way, pressured altcoins to perform as retail investors are still absent. However, the stock markets and crypto remained nearly correlated. The ongoing 90-day tariff pause between the US and China has markets within striking distance of their all-time highs. Meanwhile, Moody’s delivered a shock downgrade to the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1. It cited soaring deficits and a mounting debt burden. S&P, BTC, gold near ATHs As per the data, S&P 500 is trading at a current price of $5,958 after setting its all-time high of $6,147 on February 19, 2025. It is only 3.27% away from its ATH. Gold is also trading around $3,200 per ounce, after posting its ATH of $3,509 on April 22, 2025. The precious metal is just 9% out from hitting its fresh ATH. A Goldman Sachs report stated that investors have been increasing their holdings of gold since March. It was driven by economic uncertainty, geopolitical risk, and a surprising surge in demand from central banks. But not all moves have made sense to investors. The recent 5% drop in gold prices , which mirrors a fall in equities, confused some investors. The analyst suggests that gold’s status as a haven asset hasn’t gone anywhere. As stocks sank, investors sold gold to raise cash for collateral, not because they lost faith in it. On the traditional market side, a bullish sentiment is spreading among investors. Almost 36% of individual investors have indicated a bullish stock market sentiment over the next 6 months in the latest AAII survey. That is the highest level of confidence since the last week of January.

It is the lowest since mid-February. This has eventually marked the end of the record streak of 11 consecutive weeks with over 50% bearishness. Bitcoin hovers near $104K Soft US inflation data and Federal Reserve rate cuts have managed to keep the crypto market up and going. Coinbase’s inclusion in the S&P 500 index also improved market sentiment. Bitcoin price hovered around $103k-$104k over the past week. BTC is trading at an average price of $103,894 as of press time, inching closer to its ATH of $109,026, recorded on January 20, 2025. The biggest crypto is just 5% away from hitting its fresh high. Its surging dominance (62.5%) in the market hints that a rally might be 0n. In the meantime, the biggest altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have managed to cover some ground. ETH price jumped by more than 57% over the last 30 days. This surge came in due to the successful Pectra upgrade. ETH is trading at an average price of $2,501 as of press time. Solana has seen impressive DeFi activity, boosted its value to $184.77, but profit-taking pulled it back to $170. As per the DefiLlama, its TVL spiked by over 28% in the past month.

Table of Contents Bonk price forecast On-chain and derivatives analysis Top catalysts driving gains in BONK Bonk price forecast Bonk ( BONK ), a Solana-based meme coin with a market capitalization above $1.436 billion, saw its price decline last week. Even as analysts observed capital rotation from large market cap tokens to smaller cryptos and Solana-based memes, BONK price lagged behind, while blue-chip DeFi tokens like Dogwifhat ( WIF ) led in gains. BONK price slipped 14% in the last seven days, after posting nearly 60% days in the past month. The daily and weekly price charts show mixed signals. Technical indicators like MACD are bullish on the weekly price chart, signaling an underlying positive momentum in BONK price trend. RSI reads 48, hovering close to the neutral level. BONK trades at $0.00001875 at the time of writing and the closest resistance is the lower boundary of a Fair value gap on the weekly price chart, at $0.00002039. The closest support for the meme coin is the lower boundary of a bullish imbalance zone, at $0.00001572. The daily price chart shows a negative outlook, meaning further correction is likely over the weekend. While BONK is in an upward trend, price has slipped into the imbalance zone. Once BONK collects liquidity, it could attempt a rally to resistance at $0.00002039 and $0.00002581, key levels marked by lower boundaries of FVGs on the daily timeframe. The RSI reads 49, close to neutral and MACD flashes red histogram bars above the neutral line, meaning that there is an underlying negative momentum in BONK price trend. Traders need to watch the daily price chart and indicators closely for signs of reversal, if RSI slopes upward or MACD flashes green histogram bars, it could support a bullish thesis on the daily timeframe.

On-chain and derivatives analysis On-chain data from crypto intelligence tracker Santiment shows the transaction volume and social dominance of BONK suffered last week. Transaction volume represents the activity of BONK traders across exchanges and social dominance represents the share of BONK relative to other cryptos in mentions in social media, on X, and other platforms. A decline in transaction volume and social dominance signals likely disinterest or fatigue among BONK holders. However, it could be a positive development for BONK since the metrics do not point to a relative increase in selling pressure or other factors that could usher further correction in the Solana-based meme coin. BONK on-chain analysis | Source: Santiment Derivatives data from Coinglass shows a large volume of long liquidations, as opposed to shorts, in the last 24 hours.

Heavy hitters like Cardano (ADA) , Avalanche (AVAX) , and Ethereum (ETH) are holding key levels—and analysts believe they may trigger the next altcoin breakout as Bitcoin consolidates. But while these giants dominate headlines, early-stage investors are quietly positioning for high-upside moves. One altcoin making waves below the surface? MAGACOIN FINANCE —a structured, politically charged project now drawing strategic attention from both traders and analysts. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X ADA, AVAX, and ETH Poised for Key Breakouts Cardano (ADA) is nearing the critical $1 resistance. If it breaks, price models point to a potential run toward $3 , fueled by upgrades like Hydra and Mithril and consistent developer activity. Avalanche (AVAX) is trading between $18–$23 , showing higher-lows and gearing up for a potential late-2025 surge to $40–$50 . Subnet growth in finance and gaming is keeping it firmly on investor watchlists. Ethereum (ETH) remains the market anchor. Holding near $2,400 , bulls are watching for a move past $2,500 , with long-term targets ranging between $4,000–$5,500 due to ongoing staking and scalability improvements. MAGACOIN FINANCE Quietly Builds Momentum Below the Surface As the spotlight remains on majors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining quiet but meaningful traction. With over $8 million raised and a listing price of $0.007 , early participants are positioning for 25x to 36x ROI —especially with the MAGA50X bonus still active. Recent momentum includes: 17% increase in active DEX wallets in just 10 days Growing buzz about cross-chain liquidity development A token model applauded in community polls for its structure and fairness What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE different is its organic growth.

Its key metrics are jumping, and market share growth continues. Nansen data shows that Base has solidified its position as the biggest player in the layer-2 industry. Its weekly transactions jumped by 27% to 65.9 million, much higher than Ethereum’s ( ETH ) 9.4 million. Base’s active addresses jumped by 42% in the last seven days to 9.7 million, higher than Ethereum’s 2.14 million. It has also overtaken other popular layer-2 networks like Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism. Base Chain metrics | Source: Nansen More data by DeFi Llama shows that protocols in the Base Chain are nearing a $400 billion milestone. They have handled over $363 billion since its inception, with $25 billion in the last 30 days. If the trend continues, Base will likely cross the $400 billion level in June or July. The most active DEX network on the Base Chain is Aerodrome, which has processed over $183 billion in transactions since inception. Uniswap ( UNI ) is the second one after it handled over $130 billion. The other top players in the network are PancakeSwap, Woofi, Javsphere, and Sushi. Base Chain has also become the sixth biggest chain in decentralized finance or DeFi. its total value locked has jumped to $4.7 billion, making it a bigger chain than most popular players like Sui, Avalanche, Cardano, and Cronos. Base Chain has attracted users because of its significantly lower transaction fees and faster speeds. It has also become a major player in the meme coin industry, with tokens on its ecosystem having a market cap of over $1.7 billion. The most notable ones are Brett ( BRETT ), Toshi, Degen, and Ponke.

While this uptick has garnered attention, FloppyPepe (FPPE) grabs the spotlight with the potential for a 20,000% price spike and the ability to redefine the meme coin sector through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and outstanding tokenomics. Shiba Inu Whale Activity Spike Amidst SHIB Price Uncertainty A notable increase in Shiba Inu whale transactions was recently experienced, indicating heightened activity among large-scale investors. Data from Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) shows that $1 million and $10 million worth of SHIB transactions have surged by 450% in the past 3 months. Furthermore, Nehal on X confirmed a bullish structure forming for SHIB in late April 2025. Despite the uptick, SHIB's price remains volatile, and the broader market context presents challenges that could impact its trajectory. While this Shiba Inu Whale volume surge suggests potential bullish sentiment, it's essential to approach with caution. The increased Shiba Inu whale activity may reflect strategic positioning ahead of anticipated market movements, but without sustained volume and broader investor confidence, the longevity of this trend among Shiba Inu whales remains uncertain. Investors should monitor SHIB's performance closely, considering both on-chain metrics and external market factors. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The AI-Powered Meme Coin Upgrading Crypto 80% Bonus Tokens - Code: FLOPPY80 FloppyPepe (FPPE) is a pioneering project that fuses the viral appeal of meme culture with cutting-edge AI technology. In the heart of its ecosystem lies FloppyAI, an artificial intelligence system designed to analyze crypto market trends, monitor price actions, and assess global events, providing traders with insights that might otherwise go unnoticed.

And Meme-o-Matic, a personalized meme creation platform. These features support users in producing engaging content effortlessly, improving community engagement, and broadening the project's reach. Unlike the average meme coins created as pump-and-dump projects, this AI token has undergone a SolidProof smart contract audit , confirming its credibility, security, and reliability. Furthermore, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is committed to accessibility as evident in its planned integration with major chains like Binance Smart Chain and Polygon, guaranteeing broader usability and scalability. Assured Source Of Liquidity And Impressive Floppynomics The tokenomics of FloppyPepe (FPPE) are meticulously crafted to benefit holders. With a 1% burn mechanism on every transaction, the token supply becomes increasingly scarce over time, potentially boosting its value. Additionally, 3% of each transaction is redistributed to existing holders, offering a passive income stream. Investors can further maximize through staking and liquidity mining opportunities within the platform. Notably, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) appeal extends to savvy investors seeking alternatives to high gas fees and tax-heavy tokens. The meme coin’s structure removes these concerns, making it an attractive option for SHIB holders and those looking to diversify their portfolios. The presale phase of FloppyPepe (FPPE) has already demonstrated significant momentum, raising $900,000 in record time. Analysts predict a potential 20,000% increase post-presale, positioning early investors for substantial returns. For instance, a modest $1,000 investment at the current price of $0.0000002 could hypothetically yield $200,000 if projections hold true. (Here’s a chart below.)

With sentiment shifting and the crypto fear and greed index leaning toward optimism, now is a critical time to identify the top altcoins to buy before the next surge. Giants like XRP, Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA) continue to hold strong based on network activity and development, but new coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is performing well and attracting attention. Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Phase 4 which is over 80% sold out, already raking in over $8.6 million with over 10,000 investors participating. With a public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 4 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 140% by the time the token hits exchanges. These five picks represent a mix of established strength and breakout potential, ideal for those mapping out their crypto investing strategy this month. Altcoin giants leading the charge in May 2025 As the crypto sector gains momentum this spring, established altcoins like XRP, Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA) are securing their places as key holdings in any serious crypto portfolio. XRP continues to push ahead with its focus on cross-border payments, gaining further traction as regulatory clarity increases. Solana remains one of the quickest and most scalable Layer 1s and is drawing developers and DeFi projects at a rapid rate. Ethereum, the basis for smart contracts, is benefiting from increasing Layer 2 adoption, while Cardano’s research-oriented, incremental approach continues to develop its ecosystem. These market frontrunners are breaking ground—yet emerging players like Mutuum Finance are beginning to make their presence known with startling speed. Mutuum Finance: Genuine innovation in DeFi lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance is being third-party audited, and their open-source smart contracts are secure in design while creating trust among users. The platform is also set to be compatible with non-EVM and EVM blockchains, and the gates swing wider with more liquidity in other ecosystems. Presale momentum At today’s $0.025, the MUTM token is of huge interest to early investors. A Phase 5 20% price jump will give the token a boost to $0.03. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there’s plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance one of the most-watched low-market-price DeFi plays. Mutuum Finance is quickly earning its place alongside top-tier altcoins like XRP, SOL, ETH, and ADA—proving that new entrants can still shake up the crypto rankings in 2025. The project has already raised over $8.6 million from more than 10,000 investors, with Phase 4 now over 80% sold out at a price of $0.025. A 20% price jump is coming in Phase 5, and with a projected listing price of $0.06, early backers are eyeing potential gains of 140% or more before the token even hits exchanges. As big-name altcoins push forward this month, Mutuum Finance offers something rare—early-stage access to a real DeFi solution with rapid adoption. Time is running out before the next phase hits, secure your position now.

With the rate cut to 30% and trade talks shelved for 90 days, businesses are rethinking how and when they bring in shipments. At the same time, a wave of incoming stock is putting new pressure on warehouses and transport networks. Before this week’s announcement, the 145% tariff effectively blocked all but the most vital goods from crossing the Pacific. For cargo already on the water, many companies turned to bonded warehouses, which let them store items duty-free for up to five years. They only pay the tariff when they finally move the goods into the U.S. market. “By holding the goods under bond, there’s the possibility that they might pay at a lower rate,” said Ben Dean, vice president at Flexe, a national warehousing network, in an interview last week. When the duty stood at 145%, waiting in a bonded facility, even with storage fees, often made financial sense. Now that the levy has dropped to 30%, interest in bonded storage has “fallen precipitously,” Dean told Business Insider . Still, some importers view it as insurance against any future hikes. Many businesses are turning to foreign-trade zones (FTZs). Like bonded warehouses, FTZs allow a delay in paying tariffs. The crucial difference is timing. FTZs lock in the duty at the moment goods arrive, not when they leave the zone and officially enter U.S. commerce. That could shield importers if rates climb again after the three-month pause ends. “Should we not make progress on a formal agreement and in 91 days rates shoot up again, that is a risk,” Dean said. “At least now there’s an upside risk, which we didn’t have before.” On the transportation side, demand for rail and short-haul trucking is rising, while long-haul trucking rates have eased. “The need for speed has gone away,” Dean explained. “Slower, more cost-effective transport modes are now in high demand.” In effect, importers who rushed goods in ahead of the earlier tariffs are now using the nation’s rail lines to hold merchandise until it’s time to sell. That buys extra time without piling up bills at storage facilities. Meanwhile, container bookings between the U.S. and China have shot up nearly 300% this week, pointing to a fresh influx of goods. “The ports are working hard to make sure that surge can get off the ship,” Dean said. “Everyone wants to avoid another headline event like we saw at the Port of Long Beach during the COVID peak, when ships sat waiting at anchor for weeks.” Despite available warehouse space across the country, west coast docks could face capacity tight spots in the weeks ahead. “We are in real-time changing the economics of inventory cost,” Dean said. “We’re running a live test of what happens to our supply chain domestically when that shift occurs.” Trump’s reduced tariffs on China won’t save U.S. consumers from price hikes The drop from 145% to 30% might sound like a relief, but U.S. shoppers may not see much difference, according to a CNN report . With the reduced duty lasting just three months, companies are racing to finish orders and ship goods from China while the rate is at its lowest. That urgency is driving up production and shipping premiums, eating into any tariff savings. Factory owners in China are already hiking their own costs to meet the surge in orders. “They’re offering overtime pay for employees and other bonuses, which is unusual,” said Andrew Rader, managing director at Maine Pointe, a global supply-chain consulting firm. Meanwhile, prices for key raw materials—plastics, metals, and the like have climbed “upwards of 10% or more,” he added. To compound matters, many factories have raised their minimum order sizes. Companies that once bought enough goods for three months must now place orders large enough to cover six months. That boosts inventory levels and the storage bills that come with them, before tariffs or any transport fees are added. Taken together, Rader estimates U.S. firms are paying 15% to 25% more to manufacture in China, even before the 30% duty and rising shipping costs. Still, he notes the current rate is a “sizable saving” compared with the 145% duty they faced days ago. “Any cost and risk added to the supply chain has to be expressed somehow,” said Andy Tsay, a business professor at Santa Clara University. He warned that higher expenses could lead to more frequent stock-outs or fewer and smaller sales and discounts. Tsay also said some new products might never reach store shelves if companies decide the shifting costs and risks are too great. And even if tariffs revert to zero after the deal, he suggested sellers may keep prices higher if consumers prove willing to pay. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Europol arrested 17 suspects in January, but has only now released information about the ongoing investigation. The takedown of the crypto mafia was a complex investigation because the case overlapped with other cases, such as migrant smuggling and drug trafficking. The crypto mafia had a banking system called hawala, which relied primarily on crypto transfers. The press release, by Europol, announced that 17 individuals were arrested and that the suspects were part of a coordinated criminal network. The operation involved various jurisdictions, including Austria, Belgium, and Spain. The Europol operation extended upon another case involving migrant smuggling. The arrested suspects included nationals from China and the Middle East. Europol reported over €21 million of laundered money, using hawala banking and crypto transactions. Europol listed many assets seized, totalling €4.5 million, including firearms, cash, bank accounts, real estate, and vehicles. Europol concluded that the agency was essential in providing operational support for other law enforcement agencies, helping to take down a complex network committing economic crime. “Following up on the successes in taking down the migrant smugglers”, wrote Europol in a press release, “who relied on this criminal network’s illicit banking services, national investigators and Europol’s experts in financial crime jointly picked up a new trail. Examining the migrant smugglers’ phones led to the criminal network laundering illicit proceeds, which kicked off this latest investigation. On the action day, Europol financed three Spanish investigators to travel to Belgium and Austria. Additionally, two Europol experts travelled to Austria and Belgium to provide support on the ground, while two more Europol experts were deployed to Spain. The crypto mafia tried to cover up its illicit activities by operating a remittance service. But authorities were not fooled by their attempts and continued investigating the organisation. The crypto mafia, meanwhile, became more brazen in its attempts to procure new clients, advertising its remittance service on social media. Spanish authorities coordinated with Europol through the Belgian branch. Spanish courts handled the legal case against the crypto mafia. Blockchain analysis reveals that the remittance service operated by the crypto mafia transferred over $50 billion in illicit funds. Europol became aware of the illicit network thanks to a German couple reporting the crypto mafia to local authorities. The crypto mafia had been masquerading as financial consultants and manipulating the German couple to deposit more funds, using fake charts to suggest their successful investment strategies. Spanish authorities started to monitor the group and discovered millions of dollars being transferred monthly. The January raid involved over 250 officers and had a command and control centre that could monitor the raids in real time. Out of the 17 suspects arrested, 15 remain incarcerated, charged with money laundering and being associated with a criminal organisation.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-18 13:54:34

Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer of Bitwise, said that the king cryptocurrency can hit the milestone by the end of 2025, considering demand and supply. Hougan’s rationale is that miners can only produce 165,000 $BTC this year. On the other hand, Strategy alone has bought 379,800 $BTC over the past six months. This means that miners can’t produce enough $BTC to satiate the market’s demand. Moreover, a huge amount of money has been flowing into Bitcoin ETFs, with the total now standing at $6B. Add to this governments and corporations also buying $BTC left, right, and center, and we’re witnessing an unforeseen demand for the ‘digital gold.’ Hougan expects that $BTC sellers would stop at $100K, which also happens to be a huge psychological level. Keep reading to learn more about Bitcoin’s brewing rally. We’ll also list down the best altcoins you can buy to benefit from this. Shrinking Bitcoin Supply Michael Saylor’s Strategy has emerged as the most aggressive Bitcoin buyer. The company now holds a whopping 568,840 $BTC worth $59.03B. Because of this, the Bitcoin supply has turned deflationary (-2.33%), as per analyst Ki Young Ju. Simply put, Bitcoin’s supply is decreasing by 2.33% every year. Now, with other firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald’s Twenty One also buying Bitcoin aggressively and governments rushing to form a Bitcoin reserve, this deflationary rate is only expected to increase in the next few years. In other words, Bitcoin could become an asset of the rich with limited supply. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin is not expected to stop even after it reaches $200K. Crypto analyst Scott Melker said in a recent interview that the asset can reach $250K by the end of 2025. Heavy corporate investments have meant that Bitcoin has become less volatile over the years. Earlier, it was about three times more volatile than the S&P 500, but it’s now less than twice as volatile. Decreasing volatility is a strong indication of increasing institutional interest. The more money flows into an asset, the less volatile it becomes. If you, too, want to benefit from Bitcoin’s mighty swing upwards, this might be your last chance. If you’re looking for ideas, here are some of the best cryptos to invest in right now. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Altcoin to Buy to Ride Bitcoin’s Growth A Bitcoin rally generally means happy times for the broader crypto (and meme coin) market. However, becoming an early investor in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) will allow you to make the most of Bitcoin’s growth. That’s because $BTCBULL is the ONLY crypto today offering real (and free) $BTC via airdrops to its token holders. Every time Bitcoin reaches a landmark figure, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K, for the first time, $BTCBULL holders who have stored their tokens in Best Wallet will automatically receive their share of $BTC. As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin is expected to reach $250K this year, meaning you can benefit from at least three $BTC airdrops, depending on when BTC Bull Token goes live. The project is currently in presale, with over $5.9M in early investor funding. Luckily for you, one $BTCBULL is available for just $0.00252. It’s also worth noting that the project’s developers have planned to follow a deflationary model. This simply means that the total $BTCBULL supply will keep reducing – every time $BTC’s price jumps $25K, to be precise – which will likely boost demand.

MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights A booming crypto market is a launchpad for viral meme coins. We’ve already witnessed this in the last couple of weeks, with tokens like $MOODENG, $KEKIUS, and $GOAT recording triple-digit gains. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a potentially revolutionary new crypto that will help you identify such high-potential tokens before they rocket to the moon. $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that stirs up conversations on online platforms like X. It talks to the crypto community and deep dives into their opinions on various altcoins. Finally, it analyzes all the data it has collected using its cutting-edge hive-mind analysis to read the pulse of the market and zero in on the best cryptos to buy . Remember, $MIND is also self-evolving, which is why it’ll be able to create its own tokens once it has spread its popularity far and wide in the crypto community. Finally, it’s worth noting that only $MIND token holders will have access to the AI agent’s real-time insights and investment suggestions. Additionally, if you want to make the most of $MIND’s predicted 800% growth , consider becoming an early investor in the project. Hurry up, though, because the $MIND presale is ending in less than two weeks. Each token is currently available for just $0.0037515, and the project has in total raised $9.4M so far. Buy $MIND now . 3. Department Of Government Efficiency ($DOGE) – Viral Meme Coin Inspired by Musk’s DOGE The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is Elon Musk’s newest infamous initiative. As the name suggests, DOGE’s mission is to assist the second Trump administration by maximizing the productivity of the federal government. Considering that anything Musk touches becomes a fad in crypto, it’s hardly a surprise that $DOGE (not Dogecoin, mind you) has risen to become one of the top trending cryptos . To make the most of its viral bottom line, the $DOGE meme coin offers a few distinct advantages to crypto traders. For instance, you don’t have to pay any fees while buying, selling, or transferring $DOGE. Next, this low-cap coin is now completely owned by the community; the $DOGE owner has given up control over it. $DOGE is up over 140% in the last month or so, including 76% in just the last seven days. It’s currently trading at $0.03318, which, seeing as Trump’s second term is only getting started, could be a great entry point for interested investors. Remember, Even the Best Altcoins Require Sound Risk Management With a Bitcoin rally looking imminent, top altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and MIND of Pepe ($MIND) offer once-in-a-lifetime opportunities thanks to their unique prospects and low prices. However, bear in mind that the crypto market guarantees nothing. It’s highly volatile and unpredictable, which is why you should only risk what you can afford to lose.

Known for hosting The Wolf of All Streets podcast, Melker shared his outlook in a recent interview , pointing to reduced volatility and deeper integration with traditional finance as catalysts for the next major rally. “$250K this year totally possible,” Melker said, noting that Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped considerably. “It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” Pension Funds and ETFs Fuel Bitcoin’s Shift Toward Market Stability Melker attributed the shift to increased involvement from pension funds and exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers, describing a more stable environment as long-term investors replace short-term speculators. The arrival of institutional players, he said, has changed Bitcoin’s profile from a high-risk asset to a potential portfolio cornerstone. Signs of renewed strength have already emerged. In May, Bitcoin climbed above $104,000, while Ethereum moved past $2,600. The rally was accompanied by broader market gains, including surges in smaller-cap altcoins — a trend Melker said indicates new capital entering the space. The sector also saw a symbolic victory when Coinbase was added to the S&P 500, entering the benchmark index within its top 50 by market cap. Melker called it a clear signal that crypto firms are gaining legitimacy in traditional financial circles. Additional momentum has come from firms like Galaxy Digital and eToro, which continue to pursue public listings amid a more favorable regulatory landscape. Melker referenced recent developments, including paused enforcement actions by the SEC and pro-crypto signals from the White House, as factors contributing to what he described as “an extremely bullish backdrop.” Still, not all forecasts are as aggressive. Most analysts expect Bitcoin to peak between $120,000 and $150,000 this cycle. But Melker noted that unpredictable upside moves are part of the market’s history. “From the 2020 lows to the last peak, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000,” he said. “A 2.5x move from here wouldn’t be a big deal.” Adam Back Predicts Bitcoin Price Will Hit $500K-$1M This Cycle Adam Back, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community and CEO of Blockstream, believes that Bitcoin is significantly undervalued and could surge to between $500,000 and $1 million per coin during the current market cycle. In a recent interview, Back expressed surprise at Bitcoin’s current price level (hovering around $103,300) given the surge in institutional interest and major developments in the crypto landscape. Despite being just 5% below its all-time high of nearly $109,000, Back argued the price does not yet reflect the full scope of bullish momentum building behind the asset. Meanwhile, according to Michael Saylor, founder of Strategy, Bitcoin’s recent price stagnation below the $150,000 mark can be attributed to short-term holders exiting the market . He added that Bitcoin is now finding its way into the hands of institutions and investors with a longer time horizon, particularly through spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasury strategies.

Bitcoin, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Investors Are Betting Big Before Stage 8 Closes",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/500-to-1m-bitcoin-solana-and-magacoin-finance-investors-are-betting-big-before-stage-8-closes/,"Introduction As the crypto market charges into Q2 2025, momentum is building around a select group of assets showing both strength and strategic upside. Bitcoin is reclaiming dominance , Solana is on an 80% rally , and a new wave of investors is zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rising political altcoin that could become this year’s biggest early-stage win. With major players like AVAX attracting institutional attention, the altcoin market is entering a fresh phase of speculation, strategy, and aggressive positioning. The big question now: Can $500 today really grow into $1 million during this cycle? Let’s break down the leaders that are catching the market’s attention right now — and the altcoin that’s turning heads just before Stage 8 closes. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Bitcoin Eyes $250,000 as Institutional Demand Accelerates Bitcoin (BTC) is holding firm above $103,000–$104,000 , with analysts projecting a run to $250,000 by the end of 2025 . The bullish outlook stems from a confluence of major factors: spot ETF adoption , record pension fund inflows , and reduced volatility . Scott Melker and other analysts are calling this cycle the most structurally sound yet, with long-term holders increasing and new institutional vehicles providing serious capital flow into BTC. The current chart shows a bullish retest , with rising lows — typically a precursor to an explosive move upward. As legacy finance integrates crypto, Bitcoin continues to stand as the macro anchor of the next bull cycle . Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is the Coin to Watch in 2025 While Bitcoin leads the charge, early-stage investors are turning heads toward MAGACOIN FINANCE , a fast-rising altcoin that’s gaining traction ahead of its $0.007 listing target . As Stage 8 nears completion , MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as one of the highest ROI opportunities of the year. With each stage selling out rapidly, the momentum is unmistakable — and analysts are starting to label it a 35x contender in the 2025 cycle. Here’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE is on every radar: Massive demand with exponential early traction Political narrative that resonates deeply with retail and community-driven investors Clear roadmap and token utility backed by rising investor momentum Crypto analysts are now suggesting that MAGACOIN FINANCE could do what early SHIBA INU and DOGE once did — but with stronger positioning and clearer upside strategy . The timing ahead of listings is becoming critical. AVAX Surges as Institutional Flows and Gaming Deals Spark Momentum Avalanche (AVAX) is up 3.2% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $28.35 , with renewed volume pouring in during the Avalanche Summit 2025 . The event showcased Avalanche’s growing role in institutional finance and GameFi , including a major partnership with MapleStory . What really caught attention is BlackRock’s involvement in recent development talks — a major credibility signal for AVAX’s role in Web3. With new onchain trading tools and expanding real-world integrations , analysts are calling Avalanche “seriously undervalued” heading into the summer. Solana’s 80% Rally Positions It as the Cycle’s Breakout Layer-1 Solana (SOL) has surged more than 80% from recent lows, now trading in the $165–$180 range. It’s quickly becoming the top performer among major altcoins , thanks to its thriving DeFi ecosystem and developer-first architecture . Forecasts suggest short-term consolidation around $162–$171 , with long-term targets pushing toward $250–$400 . With consistent protocol upgrades and growing adoption, Solana is proving it has staying power as a serious Ethereum alternative. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Final Thoughts Between Bitcoin’s ETF-driven surge , Solana’s high-velocity rally , and AVAX’s institutional momentum , crypto’s next cycle is already taking shape. But among all of these, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only early-stage entry still offering ground-floor potential . With a clear listing roadmap, strong investor demand, and Stage 8 nearing closure, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the best shot at a 25x–35x return in 2025. The opportunity is narrowing — and smart investors are already taking notice.

Mutuum Finance, a rising DeFi powerhouse, is now stepping into the spotlight, going head-to-head with meme coin giants Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. While DOGE and SHIB rode massive waves of hype in previous cycles, their paths to $1 have stalled, weighed down by large market caps and limited utility. Mutuum Finance presale has raised more than $8.6 million and attracted over 10,000 participants, ahead of a token price rise to $0.03 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 140% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. Investors have limited window since phase 4 is almost closing as over 85% has been sold. Mutuum Finance is backed by real-world functionality, efficient tokenomics, and growing community support, positioning it as the next crypto to hit $1. Mutuum Finance presale: A growing DeFi solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market.

The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Social media channels will release the results of an ongoing Certik smart contract audit after the completion of this audit by the team.

With a launch price of $0.06 and analysts projecting a strong post-listing trajectory, early buyers could see up to 140% gains before the token even hits exchanges.

The recent market onslaught affected notable cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu (SHIB), crashing their prices over the weekend. In particular, Shiba Inu, which clinched a multi-month high of $0.00001757 on May 12, plunged to the $0.000014 mark a few days later. Most SHIB Investors Currently Underwater As of 6:40 a.m. (UTC) on May 17, 2025, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.00001425, down 8.17% over the past week. Notably, the price of Shiba Inu plummeted by 5.93% within 24 hours alone, causing investors huge losses. Fresh data from IntoTheBlock confirms that about 80.80% of all Shiba Inu on-chain holders are currently in losses at the current price. These investors hold a combined 796.14 trillion SHIB tokens. On the other hand, 16.59% of Shiba Inu investors holding 163.42 trillion SHIB are in profit at the current price of $0.00001425. The remaining 2.61% of Shiba Inu holders currently hold a total of 25.47 trillion SHIB and are at breakeven. This implies that these investors are neither in profit nor in loss. Shiba Inu In and Out of the Money | IntoTheBlock Shiba Inu In and Out of the Money | IntoTheBlock Even though the majority of Shiba Inu investors are underwater, this has not dampened their hopes in SHIB. Notably, they are anticipating a major price rebound that could take Shiba Inu’s price to bullish targets ranging from $0.0001 to $0.0005. Path to $0.0001 and $0.0005 Hitting the targets of $0.0001 and $0.0005 would require Shiba Inu to erase a zero from its price and eventually trade with three zeros after its decimal. It is worth mentioning that Shiba Inu came close to achieving this milestone in October 2021 when its price soared to an all-time high of $0.00008845. However, it could not sustain the bullish momentum, leading to a massive plunge from its peak price. For Shiba Inu to clinch the $0.0001 target, its price must increase by 601.75% from the current level of $0.00001425. However, reaching the $0.0005 demands a greater surge of 3,408% from the current price. Assuming Shiba Inu’s circulating supply remains constant at 589.24 trillion tokens, reaching the $0.0001 and $0.0005 targets would push SHIB’s valuation to $58.92 billion and $294.62 billion, respectively. Timeline for Shiba Inu Surge to $0.0001 and $0.0005 The good news is that several analysts believe the $0.0001 and $0.0005 targets are within reach for Shiba Inu. While most experts think Shiba Inu would clinch the $0.0001 mark this year, others believe it will take a few more years for the $0.0005 target to materialize. Analysts like Eunice Wong suggests that Shiba Inu would rally to the $0.0001 territory this year. However, Changelly experts see the $0.0001 price forecast materializing by July 2029, projecting that SHIB would hit a maximum target of $0.000102 by then. The same Changelly analysts forecast that Shiba Inu would soar to the $0.0005 territory five years later, specifically by April 2034. Worth of 10M, 100M, 500M SHIB at $0.0001 or $0.0005 If Shiba Inu eventually hits the $0.0001 or $0.0005 targets, early investors would be the biggest gainers of this remarkable price increase. Specifically, investors holding 10 million, 100 million, and 500 million Shiba Inu tokens today would see their investments' value skyrocket massively. For context, portfolios of 10 million, 100 million, and 500 million Shiba Inu tokens are worth $142.5, $1,425, and $7,125, respectively. If Shiba Inu soars to the $0.0001, a 10 million SHIB portfolio would be valued at $1,000, while the 100 million and 500 million SHIB holdings would be worth $10,000 and $50,000, respectively. At $0.0005, this 10 million SHIB portfolio would be worth $5,000. Moreover, if SHIB eventually clinches the $0.0005 target, the 100 million and 500 million SHIB token holdings would be valued at around $50,000 and $250,000, respectively.",Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-05-18 14:51:05

The market is eager to see if bullish forces will drive these digital currencies to new heights. This article explores the potential for significant gains and investigates which of these coins show promise for upward movement. Delve in to discover the future prospects of Polkadot and Avalanche. Polkadot Market Pulse: Recent Gains and Key Price Levels Over the past month, Polkadot surged by 28.30%, but the half-year trend shows a decline of 22.43%. The price fluctuated between $3.41 and $4.54, indicating mixed market energy. Volatility has been notable, with fast rallies followed by significant pullbacks, suggesting changes in trader sentiment. Recent buying activity contrasts with the longer-term bearish outlook, revealing a market in transition. Currently, prices trade within the $3.41 to $4.54 range. Nearest resistance is at $5.03, while immediate support is at $2.76, with additional benchmarks at $6.16 and $1.64. The market shows no clear dominance between bulls and bears, leading to a balanced situation. Trading strategies should include buying near support and exercising caution near resistance, with an emphasis on tight risk management. Avalanche AVAX: One Month Surge, Six-Month Slide Avalanche experienced an 18.58% increase over the past month alongside a steep 36.27% decline during the last six months. The coin’s recent week saw a drop of 12.24%, reflecting short-term pressure amid earlier gains. Price action has shown notable volatility, with gains leading to sharp corrections that highlight shifts in market sentiment and momentum. Current prices range between $16.03 and $24.43, with immediate resistance near $27.94 and support around $11.14. Bears dominate in lower ranges, while bulls struggle to break through resistance. There is no clear trend at this moment, leading traders to look for opportunities around support levels while waiting for a more decisive movement. Conclusion DOT and AVAX are nearing critical levels. The market's reaction at these points will be key. If positive momentum builds, there could be upward movement. Investors will be watching closely. These moments often define short-term trends. Current indicators suggest potential for gains. However, no guarantees exist in such volatile conditions. Focus remains on how both assets perform in the near future. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

There’s been an update about Ripple’s case with the SEC, and while it’s not terrible news, it’s not great either. According to an analyst, right now, XRP is trading around $2.43 — but the situation feels a bit shaky. Over the past three days, XRP tried to break through a key resistance level at $2.62, but it failed every single time. This isn’t a good sign because if buyers and big investors (like institutions) were strong in the market, XRP should have easily crossed that point. Even worse, instead of moving up, the price actually dropped below $2.50 yesterday. At this stage, the market is leaning a little more bearish rather than bullish. According to the analysis, for XRP to look positive again, it needs to climb back above $2.50 — and ideally break past $2.62 with strong buying support. If XRP continues to stay above $2.30, things are still under control. But if it falls below that level, traders should be ready for the price to drop closer to $2.00. That’s why the $2.30 support level is so important right now. Be Ready for All Possibilities Despite these short-term worries, the long-term outlook for XRP remains positive. Many still believe XRP could reach $10 by mid-2026 and even dream of a $100 price in the next five to ten years. But the road there won’t be smooth. The crypto market is famously unpredictable. Prices can surge or crash without warning, and history shows that bull runs can be short-lived. While some believe the bull market might already be over after Bitcoin touched $110,000 and altcoins had their moment, others remain optimistic.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-18 14:57:47

While BTC itself may dominate headlines, the real growth potential often lies in low-to-mid-cap projects primed to outperform as capital rotates outward. From established names like XRP and Ethereum to emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE and Hedera (HBAR) , a handful of strategic plays are positioning themselves for potential 10,000% returns this cycle — especially as institutional inflows rise and market sentiment strengthens. Here are five breakout candidates that could capture serious momentum in Bitcoin’s shadow. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 Among the newest altcoin contenders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining a powerful reputation as a highly asymmetric early-stage opportunity . With a listing target of $0.007 and significant market traction already underway, many analysts are now viewing it as a realistic 25x–35x setup — and some models forecast even more extreme upside if momentum continues post-listing. What’s setting MAGACOIN FINANCE apart isn’t just the branding — it’s the intense demand , clear tokenomics , and a community-first launch strategy that’s working. With the current presale nearing a critical close, traders are calling this a rare chance to secure exposure at sub-penny levels before MAGACOIN FINANCE hits exchanges . Strategically, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers what other tokens at this stage rarely do: a combination of viral narrative , early entry pricing , and realistic price targets in the months ahead. Ethereum Prepares for a New Institutional Wave Ethereum (ETH) is quietly consolidating near $2,600 , but beneath the surface, a storm is brewing. The recent Pectra upgrade has improved throughput, and analysts expect Ethereum ETF approvals to mirror Bitcoin’s earlier success. ETH has long been seen as crypto’s infrastructure layer — but now, it’s being recognized as a prime institutional asset . Forecasts place ETH in the $4,000–$6,000 range by late 2025, with higher targets possible if ETF demand snowballs. With upgrades complete and DeFi once again heating up, Ethereum is no longer just a Layer-1 — it’s a Wall Street asset in the making. XRP’s Futures Launch Could Spark a Historic Repricing XRP has reclaimed its position above $2.30 , and with the CME Futures launch imminent , it’s one of the most closely-watched names in the market. Legal clarity in the U.S. has opened the door to broader institutional use, and payment-driven demand is fueling renewed optimism. Many analysts now forecast XRP moving beyond $5 in the short term — and in long-term scenarios, $15–$30 price levels are being discussed if ETF approvals and liquidity integrations play out as expected. With global financial rails being reshaped, XRP is quietly becoming the infrastructure token for real-world settlement. HBAR’s Technical Breakout Has Analysts on Alert Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) recently broke out from a long consolidation, rallying over 40% in early May before settling around $0.211 . The surge came after key ecosystem announcements and growing attention from enterprise partners — sectors where Hedera remains uniquely strong. HBAR is one of the few altcoins that consistently aligns with corporate-scale adoption , and technical analysts are watching for a break past $0.23 , which could unlock a path toward $0.40 and beyond . It’s not flashy — but it’s reliable. And in a market increasingly seeking real-world value, HBAR’s structure makes it a strong long-term hold. Bitcoin’s Role as Catalyst — and Gatekeeper While these altcoins capture the upside narrative, Bitcoin remains the catalyst that triggers rotation . With current prices holding above $103,000 , BTC continues to draw institutional inflows and is setting the tone for what could be a historic 2025 cycle . Should Bitcoin break through $110,000 and push toward analyst targets of $250,000 , it could unleash a massive altcoin wave — particularly in undervalued assets with strong positioning like MAGACOIN FINANCE and HBAR. For many investors, Bitcoin is the foundation. But the biggest returns are increasingly found in the layers that follow . CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion With Bitcoin setting the stage for a powerful second-half surge in 2025, the spotlight is now shifting to altcoins with strategic positioning and high-growth potential. Ethereum and XRP offer credibility and scale, while MAGACOIN FINANCE and HBAR provide early entry opportunities with outsized return potential. Investors who are rotating now — before listings finalize and media attention catches up — may be best positioned to benefit from the kind of explosive upside that defines every crypto supercycle.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000708. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000381 and an average trading price of $0.0032 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. With DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, these features collectively enhance Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

The MACD is still slightly bearish. Short-term momentum suggests imminent recovery. FLOKI on the daily timeframe: Floki Inu shows a strong bounce with a 10.79% daily gain As of May 18, 2025, FLOKI is showing a strong bounce with a 10.79% daily gain, reclaiming ground above the 20-day SMA at $0.00009278. This rebound comes after a pullback from recent highs, and the price is now challenging the mid-range of the Bollinger Bands. Floki Inu shows a strong bounce with a 10.79% daily gain The MACD is still slightly bearish, but the histogram shows fading momentum to the downside. Meanwhile, the RSI has risen to 63.36, approaching bullish territory, suggesting growing buying interest without being overbought. FLOKI is attempting a recovery, and if the momentum continues, it could retest the upper band around $0.00011786. Bulls are regaining control, but confirmation from volume or a MACD crossover would strengthen the push. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe: Floki shows short-term recovery FLOKI’s 4-hour chart shows a short-term recovery underway. Price has pushed above the green Alligator line (lips) and is testing the red (teeth), signaling early bullish momentum. FLOKI shows short-term recovery The MFI sits at 45.40 — still neutral but rising — while the CMF at 0.10 reflects returning capital inflow, a positive sign. If buyers maintain pressure, a move above the blue Alligator line (jaw) at $0.00009807 could trigger more upside.

The 4-hour chart reveals rising momentum, and the daily chart confirms a bounce above the 20-day SMA. If Floki Inu breaks above $0.00001020, a stronger rally may follow. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong community and meme buzz, which can drive short-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 80x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

With presale activity intensifying and investor participation growing by the day, the token is beginning to show clear signs of rising buy pressure—well before its official launch. Unlike most new cryptocurrency projects that rely on buzz alone, MUTM is gaining traction through its structure. Demand isn’t manufactured through hype; it’s built into the way the protocol operates. As a result, more investors are stepping in now—before the broader market reacts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) One of Mutuum’s most defining features is how it connects real activity to token value. Each time a user borrows within the platform, they pay interest. Instead of that interest being hoarded or used for overhead, the protocol uses a portion of it to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. Those tokens are then redistributed to active participants. It’s a direct feedback loop—platform usage drives buying pressure, which rewards holders and suppliers. The more the system is used, the greater the impact on token demand. This mechanism creates consistent market activity, even before exchange listings. And with investor participation growing, it’s becoming one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch before the next surge in altcoin momentum. MUTM is currently in Phase 4 of its presale, and the token is still available at $0.025. However, this pricing tier is nearly filled—over 87% of the round is complete, and the next phase will increase the token price to $0.03. Importantly, the official launch price is set at $0.06, giving early supporters a significant advantage. For many, this early-phase positioning is not just about short-term profit—it’s about entering before demand significantly expands. With over $8.5 million raised and thousands of wallets already participating, it’s clear that the project is no longer flying under the radar. Mutuum isn’t just preparing for listings—it’s preparing for launch with functionality. The team has announced that a beta version of the platform will roll out alongside the token’s debut, offering immediate access to core features like lending, borrowing, and yield generation. This sets it apart from typical presale tokens that go live without anything tangible. The focus here isn’t hype—it’s execution. This approach has led analysts and early investors alike to consider it one of the best crypto projects to invest in now, especially for those seeking utility-backed assets still in their early phases. To support long-term scalability and user growth, Mutuum is also developing Layer 2 compatibility. This will reduce transaction costs and improve network efficiency as the platform scales—a crucial move for any DeFi protocol anticipating increased usage. On the security side, the project is undergoing a smart contract audit by CertiK, a trusted name in blockchain security. This step is not only about safety; it also positions the project more favorably for future listings on major exchanges. Alongside the presale, the team has launched a $100,000 giveaway for participants who secure tokens early. It’s an added incentive for those already considering an entry—and one more reason investors are moving quickly before the price increases. MUTM isn’t just another presale—it’s a protocol generating real demand before launch. With its tokenomics tied to usage, its platform nearing rollout, and participation climbing daily, it’s fast becoming one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in before demand peaks. Entry at this stage still offers value. But with each day, that window narrows—and the next phase is already approaching.

A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.” Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure. The rise of L2s is far from a passing fad While some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank ), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy. This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements. The growing viability of L2s Thanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on. Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solution Some onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries. We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future. Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.

Solana (SOL) just posted a 22% weekly gain, pushing toward the $200 mark as network activity reaches new highs. But not everything signals strength. The long/short ratio has dropped to 0.8653, showing a cautious outlook from some traders. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) is climbing back after a $22.5 million liquidation setback. It’s trading near $0.229 and watching the $0.285 zone, depending on whether it clears resistance at $0.244. Traders may see momentum in both coins, but the biggest wave is coming from BlockDAG (BDAG) . With 20 listings locked in and 20.6 billion coins already sold, the final presale phase is here. The limited-time $0.0020 entry, open until June 13, stands well below the $0.0262 batch price and the $0.05 launch mark. At this point, it’s less about “if it grows” and more about “how far and how soon.” Solana Price Rises, But Long/Short Ratio Lowers Confidence The Solana (SOL) sentiment is showing strong gains, with the price moving close to $200. SOL is trading around $172.74 now, up 22% this week. This rise is backed by growing network usage and improved activity. Still, there are hints of caution. A drop in the long/short ratio to 0.8653 shows a shift in trader sentiment. That suggests more traders are betting against SOL than before. As long as SOL holds above $170 and the broader mood stays positive, many expect it to break through the $200 mark soon. Dogecoin Rebounds After $22.5M Shakeout Dogecoin (DOGE) is back on its feet after dropping 10%, which wiped out over $22.5 million in positions. Despite the fall, DOGE has regained momentum and is hovering around $0.229. Recent chart moves show a strong upward trend, with the price staying above $0.235 and its 100-hour moving average. If bulls manage to push past $0.244, DOGE could aim for $0.265 or even $0.285. But if it fails at that level again, it might drop toward the $0.215 support. $254.5M Raised and 20 Listings Locked: BlockDAG’s Window Is Closing BlockDAG has confirmed 20 exchange listings, with five already revealed. The rest will be made public on June 13, which is also the final day to grab BDAG at its frozen $0.0020 price. That’s far below the $0.0262 batch 28 rate and the expected $0.05 listing price. The referral system is another key feature. Users earn 25% on each referral, instantly credited with no lock period. The person referred also receives 5% extra. It’s a two-sided bonus loop that adds real value, especially before listings push prices higher. With over $254.5 million raised and more than 20.6 billion coins sold, BlockDAG’s growth speaks for itself. The network has passed CertiK’s audits and reports over $7 million in miner sales, with 17,568 units bought so far. This isn’t a maybe. BDAG is already up 2,520% from its first price batch. Analysts say it could soon reach $1, then $5, and maybe $10. For anyone still waiting, time is the biggest risk. Delaying could mean missing the last low entry. Which Crypto Leads the Next Surge? Solana, Dogecoin, and BlockDAG all show signs of growth, but each has a different path. SOL is heading toward $200, though the drop in its long/short ratio hints at pressure. DOGE is regaining ground and could climb to $0.265 if it breaks $0.244. These are short-term moves. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is offering locked-in gains. Its presale entry point of $0.0020 is still live, but only until June 13. With 20 listings ahead and a price jump of 2,520% already, this could be one of the most powerful setups in the space. Add in the 25% referral bonus, and BDAG presents a rare chance before public trading kicks in.

According to MasterAnanda, Bitcoin is confronting its final major resistance level before entering full price discovery. This level could cap the current rally, with a market top likely in late 2025 and a downturn following, he said in a TradingView post on May 18. MasterAnanda pinpointed the resistance zone between $120,000 and $130,000, levels that align with projections from fellow analyst Tradingshot , who anticipates Bitcoin hitting $130,000 by June 2025, as reported by Finbold. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView However, a significant mid-cycle correction in this range could suppress Bitcoin’s upside potential. For the cryptocurrency to reach its full bullish target, potentially between $180,000 and $220,000, the trading expert suggested that any meaningful pullback should ideally occur later, around the $150,000 to $160,000 range. Based on his outlook, Bitcoin’s bull run could extend through November 2025, giving the market another six months of upward momentum before a bear phase potentially sets in. “We are still in May month #5 and the minimum we can expect growth is until November month #11 which gives us 6 months. 6 months of straight up is a very long time. With a 2-3 months correction now it isn’t that long,” he said. Bitcoin’s play above $200,000 Adding to the bullish outlook, pseudonymous crypto analyst Thescalpingpro in an X post on May 18, projected a cycle peak of $207,701. The target is based on historical trends and technical indicators, particularly the Fibonacci extension levels. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Thescalpingpro In the previous bull market, Bitcoin peaked at the 3.618 Fibonacci extension. Now, BTC remains below the 1.618 level, with the next major resistance at the 2.618 extension near $154,522. If this level is breached, the analyst expects the 3.618 level, at $207,701, to act as the final resistance. Bitcoin price analysis At the moment, Bitcoin is attempting to reclaim the $105,000 resistance level, which is critical in setting the stage for a new all-time high above the previous record of nearly $110,000. As of press time, BTC was trading at $104,665, up almost 2% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

Nevertheless, the price is likely to initiate a fresh rally once the current corrective consolidation phase concludes. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Bitcoin remains in a consolidation phase after failing to reclaim the key $108K resistance zone. This price behavior suggests that profit-taking is occurring at this crucial level, increasing selling pressure and triggering a mild retracement. However, Bitcoin still exhibits strong bullish momentum, evidenced by its recent impulsive moves toward this resistance. As such, once the ongoing consolidation ends, a renewed bullish surge is expected. The price may retrace further toward the key $98K–$100K support range, where new demand is likely to enter and fuel the next rally. This could pave the way for a fresh attempt at a new all-time high in the mid-term. The 4-Hour Chart In the 4-hour timeframe, BTC continues to trade within a short-term ascending channel, forming higher highs and higher lows—an indication of a bullish structure. The recent consolidation has led to a pullback toward the channel’s lower boundary at $100K, a major psychological support level. If this support holds, a rapid rebound toward the $109K ATH appears likely. However, if the price breaks below the channel, the consolidation could extend further, with a decline toward the $98K support range becoming the probable scenario. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s next move hinges on how the price behaves around the ascending channel’s lower boundary. On-chain Analysis Bitcoin’s interaction with the Realized Price of long-term holders’ UTXOs has historically served as a reliable indicator of market direction, as it reflects the average acquisition cost of these key investors. This metric often acts as a dynamic support or resistance level. Currently, Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the Realized Price of the 3–6 month holder cohort, suggesting that these important market participants are now in overall profit. This development is typically seen as a bullish signal. However, a short-term corrective retracement toward this level, currently around $98K, remains a likely scenario, as the market consolidates and searches for fresh demand. The $98K zone stands as a critical support range. A strong rebound from this level could confirm it as a solid foundation and potentially ignite a fresh uptrend, aiming for a new all-time high.

However, signs of exhaustion are beginning to surface. While higher timeframes remain bullish for now, short-term caution is warranted. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart ETH has hit a technical ceiling just under the $2,900 resistance, which aligns closely with the 200-day moving average. This zone previously acted as a major breakdown point in February and is now serving as a supply area. The RSI also recently entered overbought territory, suggesting that momentum is fading as price approaches this resistance. A rejection from here could lead to a pullback toward the $2,200 support zone and the 100-day MA located near the $2,100 mark. A confirmed breakout above $2,900 would shift the bias back to bullish, with a potential continuation toward the critical $4,000 zone. The 4-Hour Chart Dropping lower on the 4-hour timeframe, Ethereum is showing signs of weakening momentum. After the explosive move above $2,100, the price has been consolidating within a narrow range near the $2,500–$2,600 region. A clear bearish divergence is now confirmed on the RSI, with price making higher highs while RSI makes lower highs. This typically indicates a potential correction ahead. If ETH loses the $2,450 support, a retracement toward $2,200 and even $2,050 becomes likely. On the flip side, reclaiming $2,600 with strong volume could invalidate the bearish signals and open the path for a run at the $3,000 area. Sentiment Analysis The recent rally triggered a sharp wave of short liquidations, which helped fuel the aggressive price surge. As seen in the short liquidation chart, the largest liquidations occurred near $2,400–$2,600, signaling a large portion of sellers were forced out of the market. This typically leads to short-term cooling, as the “fuel” for the rally gets exhausted. The liquidation chart shows a clear uptick in forced closures over the past week, aligning with Ethereum’s breakout. These spikes often mark local tops, as the removal of excessive short exposure removes the momentum driver. With liquidations now tapering off, the price may struggle to push higher without fresh demand entering the market. This context reinforces the idea that ETH could consolidate or correct before any meaningful continuation.

Current panic among retail cryptocurrency traders is not justified. Crypto users’ edgy behavior results from unfulfilled expectations. Bitcoin entered into a consolidation after the latest price surge, leading to minor price pullbacks. BTC registered a bearish weekly candle for the first time in the past six weeks. However, many retail investors feel disappointed, probably because the recent momentum did not push BTC above the existing all-time high. In his latest podcast , a renowned crypto analyst berated the retailers’ reaction following the slight pullback in the crypto market. According to the analyst, pullbacks are normal during bull runs, and investors must expect them to happen. The analyst explained why crypto users’ panic is unjustified, noting that the market might experience a deeper pullback without changing the overall narrative of a bullish trend. Although the analyst’s argument is substantive and highlights the crypto market’s classic behavior, the users’ reaction could result from impatience, considering how long they have waited for the characteristic parabolic crypto … The post Crypto Market’s Bullish Trend Remains Intact Despite Intermittent Pullbacks – Analyst appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-05-18 15:15:00

A bullish breakout will pave the way for a sustained rally toward the $3.1 range. XRP Analysis The Daily Chart XRP’s recent bullish trend has been halted at the upper boundary of a prolonged descending wedge near the $2.7 level, triggering a bearish retracement. However, the price is now consolidating within a decisive and tight range between $2.3 and $2.5, bounded by the wedge’s apex. This zone has become a critical battleground between buyers and sellers. The current pullback may also be interpreted as a retest of the recently broken 100 and 200-day moving averages, which could reintroduce demand into the market. A breakout from this narrow range appears imminent, and the direction of this breakout will likely determine XRP’s next major move. A bullish breakout above $2.5 would open the door for a sustained rally toward the $3.1 resistance area. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Ripple has maintained a broader bullish structure in recent days, breaking out above the descending wedge pattern. However, the asset faced significant selling pressure around the $2.7 resistance and was swiftly rejected, falling back into the wedge formation. This movement suggests a potential bull trap and false breakout. Currently, XRP is holding above the key support at $2.3, where buying interest could reemerge. If this level holds, a renewed bullish push toward the $2.7 zone is likely. Still, the market is awaiting a decisive breakout from the $2.3–$2.5 consolidation range. If the breakout is bullish, the price could quickly surge toward the $3.1 resistance. Conversely, a breakdown below $2.3 might trigger a sharp decline toward the $2 support, especially if accompanied by a short-squeeze or panic selling from overleveraged long positions.

By leveraging the XRP Ledger (XRPL), Ripple aims to enhance traceability, facilitate sustainability premiums, and expand microfinance accessibility for smallholder farmers. Ripple’s New Initiative: Empowering Colombian Agriculture On May 15, Ripple announced its latest pilot project in collaboration with Mercy Corps Ventures and traceability technology provider WËIA. This marks Ripple’s second pilot of the year under its broader “Unlocking Opportunity” initiative. The project is focused on integrating blockchain technology into Colombia’s agricultural finance framework to boost the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. Excited to launch our latest Ripple Impact collaboration with @MCSocialVenture as part of our Unlocking Opportunity initiative. https://t.co/fWZfU6pwxM In partnership with WËIA, this pilot leverages the XRP Ledger to test how blockchain traceability could boost incomes for 300… — Ripple (@Ripple) May 15, 2025 Ripple highlights that the initiative’s primary objective is to foster financial inclusion and increase the income of Colombian farmers by employing blockchain-driven traceability on the XRPL. This innovative approach seeks to address challenges within the agricultural supply chain, particularly in verifying sustainability practices and providing financial solutions. Blockchain-Powered Traceability and Financial Solutions The project utilizes WËIA’s traceability platform, built on the XRP Ledger, to monitor the production process of agricultural products, with a particular focus on panela, a traditional, unrefined cane sugar. The system records each step from the initial planting stages to harvesting, assigning a unique QR code to every product. This code contains verifiable sustainability data, responding to the global demand for transparent food supply chains. Ripple’s choice of XRPL is strategic, given its speed, low transaction costs, and carbon-neutral characteristics, making it ideal for maintaining accurate and tamper-proof records. An additional feature of the project is the introduction of a “Farm Now, Pay Later” (FNPL) scheme, enabling farmers to obtain essential inputs before harvest and repay later. This model aims to alleviate the liquidity challenges that have long hindered agricultural productivity. Inclusivity and Impact: A Focus on Community and Gender Approximately 300 smallholder farmers are expected to join the initiative, collectively processing around 240 tonnes of panela monthly. Significantly, the project emphasizes gender inclusivity, with women constituting 46% of the participants, well above Colombia’s national average of 26%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The pilot will assess three main outcomes: whether providing verified sustainability data can command higher prices, if increased transparency fosters retailer satisfaction, and whether the adoption of blockchain for traceability encourages more structured contracts between producers and buyers. Ripple’s Vision: Real-World Blockchain Solutions Ripple sees this initiative as an opportunity to demonstrate how blockchain can offer practical solutions in agriculture. By improving traceability, fostering financial accessibility, and supporting sustainable practices, the project sets a precedent for blockchain technology in real-world scenarios, particularly within the agricultural sector. By implementing this pilot, Ripple continues to showcase blockchain’s potential to enhance transparency, economic empowerment, and compliance with global sustainability standards—ultimately paving the way for smallholder farmers to thrive.

Experts estimate that strong fundamentals and market momentum might propel these currencies to 500% gains in 2025. Optimism is being fuelled by Cardano’s scaling improvements, Mutuum Finance’s creative DeFi lending, and Dogecoin’s viral community appeal. These assets stand out for their potential to grow, and the cryptocurrency industry is teeming with opportunities. In particular, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which raised $8,600,000 and sold over 481 million tokens to 10,000 holders, is attracting large audiences with its presale. Let’s examine why these currencies are now the greatest cryptocurrency to purchase. Cardano’s scalability surge Cardano (ADA) is carving a path toward explosive growth. Its blockchain prioritizes scalability and sustainability, positioning it as a top crypto to buy. Recent upgrades, like the Hydra protocol, boost transaction speeds, making ADA a strong contender for DeFi and real-world applications. Analysts note a bullish chart pattern, with ADA testing resistance at $0.82. A breakout could propel it to $1.00 or beyond in 2025. Institutional interest, spurred by potential ETF approvals, adds fuel. Yet, Dogecoin’s meme-driven hype and Mutuum Finance’s presale frenzy are stealing some thunder, making ADA a solid but less urgent pick for now. Mutuum Finance’s presale powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is igniting the crypto market with its presale in phase 4, currently 87% filled at $0.025 per token. Investors are rushing to secure tokens before phase 5, which brings a 20% price hike to $0.03—a 20% gain for current buyers. The project’s lending platform enables users to earn passive income through decentralized borrowing and lending. Its buy-and-distribute model ensures steady token demand, promising stability. With a listing price of $0.06, early investors face a 140% return. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $2.50, yielding a 9,900% ROI. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is undeniably a top cryptocurrency to invest in. Mutuum Finance’s innovative edge Beyond its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rolling out mtTokens, which grow in value as interest accrues, offering users a unique income stream. The team is auditing its smart contract with Certik, with results soon to be shared on social platforms. A new dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, who earn bonus tokens, is sparking competition. This feature drives engagement, cementing Mutuum Finance’s appeal. Compared to Dogecoin’s speculative swings, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility, making it a standout in the crypto investment space. Its structured tokenomics and real-world use case position it as the best cheap crypto to buy now. Dogecoin’s meme-fueled momentum Dogecoin (DOGE) thrives on its passionate community and viral appeal, making it a top crypto coin to buy for short-term gains. Its low price and high liquidity attract speculative traders, but its lack of utility pales against Mutuum Finance’s DeFi prowess. Analysts see DOGE hitting $0.50 in 2025, a 500% jump from current levels, driven by social media buzz and potential P2P lending integration on platforms like Mutuum Finance. However, its volatility demands caution. Investors eyeing the next crypto to explode may find DOGE appealing, but Mutuum Finance’s presale offers a clearer path to massive returns. Riding the Crypto wave The crypto market is brimming with potential, and Cardano, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), and Dogecoin are leading the charge. Cardano’s technical upgrades and Dogecoin’s cultural clout hold promise, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its presale momentum and DeFi innovation. Investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in should act fast—Mutuum Finance’s phase 4 is nearly sold out, and prices will climb. Don’t miss the chance to join 10,000 holders banking on a 9,900% post-launch surge.

In a recent interview , crypto analyst Scott Melker, also known as the Wolf of All Streets, highlighted increasing institutional interest and waning volatility as key catalysts that could propel the price of the premier crypto higher. “$250K this year, totally possible,” Melker posited, noting that Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped drastically in recent years. “It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” Melker mentioned increasing participation from pension funds and exchange-traded fund issuers as evidence of a more mature and stable market. According to the analyst, the reduced volatility mirrors a wider trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” the Wolf of All Streets explained. “Extremely Bullish Backdrop” The crypto market has been on a tear so far this year. Bitcoin has recently rebounded above the $105,000 mark, while Ethereum (ETH) jumped back above $2,500. Coinbase’s inclusion in the broad-market S&P 500 stock index is a significant milestone for the crypto industry, providing millions of average investors and model portfolios with exposure to a crypto-focused company. The S&P 500 tracks 500 of the biggest publicly traded companies in the United States across different sectors, including tech, healthcare, finance, etc. Notable names in the index include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. Melker observed that Coinbase is not just joining the index, but is becoming one of the top 50 companies by market cap, indicating how entrenched some crypto firms have become. Moreover, other crypto-centric companies like Galaxy Digital and eToro are going public, a sign of growing confidence in the regulatory atmosphere under the Trump regime. The pundit believes that this environment, buoyed by dismissed Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits and pro-crypto executive orders, has created what he deems “an extremely bullish” backdrop for the industry. Despite being optimistic, Melker still noted that most analysts are generally predicting cycle peaks between $120,000 and $150,000. Nevertheless, he stressed that parabolic rallies are not uncommon in the crypto world. “From the 2020 lows to the last bull market, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000. A 2.5x from here wouldn’t be a big deal.”",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-18 15:26:03

The enforcement action resulted in a dozen arrests as officials intensified their campaign against individuals who monetized their personal banking credentials. Law enforcement conducted a series of coordinated raids on Thursday led by the Commercial Crime Bureau. This led to the detention of nine males and three females between the ages of 20 and 40 across several Hong Kong districts. The operation obtained evidence such as HK$1.05 million in cash currency, a collection of over 560 bank cards, multiple communication devices, and financial documentation.

A senior police official explained that these accounts functioned as conduits for criminal proceeds from various scam operations. The recruited individuals would then withdraw physical cash using various payment cards and transport these funds to cryptocurrency exchange locations where the money would be converted to crypto. Authorities stated that among those in custody were two Hong Kong residents identified as primary organizers of the operation. They were captured alongside ten mainland Chinese nationals who allegedly served as account fronts for the scheme.

Investigators have currently traced HK$10 million of these laundered assets to 58 documented fraud cases. Also, affected victims reported total financial damages of HK$43.2 million. The criminal network had reportedly established an operational headquarters in a Mong Kok residential unit beginning in early 2024. This served as housing for mainland recruits while they awaited directives to process incoming fraudulent transfers. Law enforcement officials confirmed they advocate for improved judicial penalties against individuals who provide their banking credentials for illicit financial activities. Under current Hong Kong regulations, money laundering convictions can result in maximum sentences of 14 years’ incarceration and financial penalties up to HK$5 million. Crypto crimes and scams have been on the rise not just in Hong Kong but also globally. A man from Wellington was arrested in Auckland in connection with an international investigation into a cryptocurrency operation. The operation was suspected of defrauding seven victims of approximately $265 million (NZD $450 million).

So what’s pushing this cat above the pack? For starters, it’s the presale mechanics—each new stage has a price increase. FOMO is baked into the contract. But there’s more. A 69% APY staking program is coming in Stage 9, offering holders a way to grow their stack passively. The Game Center burns tokens through gameplay and ad revenue transactions, helping drive long-term deflation.

Play-to-Earn Game Center: A Key to Troller Cat’s Long-Term Success In this exciting ecosystem, $TCAT tokens will be burned every time players win in the Game Center. This auto-burning mechanism effectively reduces the total supply of tokens, creating a deflationary environment that benefits holders by increasing scarcity. As more players engage with the platform, the value of $TCAT is expected to rise, providing significant upside for both early adopters and long-term holders. The P2E Game Center also introduces a unique layer of community engagement. As players participate in various games, they earn rewards and contribute to the overall growth and exposure of the Trollercat project.

Investors looking for a blend of nostalgia and profit potential should keep an eye on Simon’s Cat. It is becoming among the top five meme coins to buy and hold for its solid community engagement and upside potential. 3. Act I ($ACT) Imagine a meme coin that feels like stepping into an AI-powered sci-fi movie—and you’re the main character. Act I: The AI Prophecy is part of a larger meme-narrative ecosystem where token holders influence the storyline of an unfolding digital prophecy. Think choose-your-own-adventure meets crypto. Each chapter of the story is released as a limited-edition NFT drop, and the community votes on where the narrative goes next. Innovative, engaging, and refreshingly different, $ACT has attracted writers, gamers, and meme connoisseurs who love futuristic themes. The devs also plan to launch a “Neural Trading Bot” powered by ChatGPT-style LLMs that trades based on meme sentiment. $ACT easily earns a spot in the best 100x cryptos for storytelling, utility, and meme creativity. Conclusion Bitcoin may have sparked the rally, but meme coins are carrying the torch now, and Troller Cat is leading the charge. With a fully structured presale model, viral-level FOMO, and the math that makes even serious investors double-take, this isn’t just a meme—it’s a machine.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, and Bitcoin Could Be the Next to Explode",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrps-surge-to-50-magacoin-finance-cardano-and-bitcoin-could-be-the-next-to-explode/,"Introduction With XRP’s price continuing to climb and speculation mounting around a possible futures-driven breakout, crypto investors are expanding their focus to the next batch of high-upside candidates. While XRP’s potential move toward $50 has the spotlight, analysts are pointing to MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, Litecoin , and Bitcoin as stealth contenders that could soon erupt in value . Here’s how these four coins are quietly positioning for explosive gains in 2025 — and why the momentum is shifting fast. THE CLOCK IS TICKING FAST – ACT NOW Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Ground in Crypto Circles As XRP gains momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building its own wave — only earlier in the curve. This politically aligned, community-driven token has caught the attention of early-stage investors, particularly as Stage 8 nears closure and listing price targets remain locked at $0.007 . The appeal of MAGACOIN FINANCE lies in its unique trifecta: A powerful narrative that resonates with a politically active base A clean, capped structure with strong tokenomics A realistic 25x–35x upside window for those entering before exchange listings begin With many early-stage altcoins suffering from weak demand or overcomplication, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something simpler: clarity, traction, and timing . And that’s exactly what savvy investors are acting on right now. Cardano (ADA) Quietly Sets Up for a Breakout Cardano (ADA) has remained relatively quiet compared to Ethereum or Solana — but behind the scenes, it’s been building. Now trading between $0.73–$0.80 , ADA is holding strong support and beginning to attract momentum traders eyeing a break above $1.00 . Recent upgrades and a continued focus on research-first development have kept Cardano’s fundamentals strong. Analysts see a move toward $1.50–$2.00 as possible if market sentiment remains bullish and capital rotation into Layer-1s accelerates. While ADA isn’t grabbing headlines, it’s consistently been one of the best-performing L1s during full cycles — and that makes it a name worth watching again. Litecoin (LTC) Bounces Back from ETF Delay After falling on news of a delayed spot ETF decision , Litecoin (LTC) is now trading near $82 — but sentiment is recovering. The coin remains one of the longest-standing crypto assets, with a loyal holder base and real merchant adoption. If an LTC spot ETF gets the green light in 2025, many believe this legacy coin could revisit previous highs in the $300–$400 range , giving it one of the highest risk-reward profiles among established coins. Litecoin is often overlooked — but its consistent presence and upcoming catalysts make it a dark horse in the coming altcoin wave . Bitcoin Eyes the Next Leg of the Supercycle With current support holding near $103,000 , Bitcoin is building energy for what many analysts believe could be a breakout toward $150,000 or even $250,000 before the year is out. ETF inflows remain strong, and institutional strategies are evolving from exploratory to aggressive. Bitcoin’s reduced volatility and maturing reputation as a macro hedge give it an even greater edge as traditional investors seek exposure. As altcoins move in rhythm with BTC dominance, any upward breakout from Bitcoin could create a domino effect across the rest of the market — especially projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano, which thrive in bullish conditions. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion While XRP continues to steal the spotlight with $50 targets on the table, savvy investors are diversifying into other top contenders that show similar potential — only at earlier stages. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a high-reward asymmetric entry , while Cardano, Litecoin, and Bitcoin each offer structural strength and upcoming catalysts that could trigger massive upside. With Stage 8 heating up and the broader market showing strength, this could be the moment to lock in the plays that lead the next crypto moonshot.

Twelve suspects, aged 20 to 40, were arrested in operations across mainland China and Hong Kong. They now face charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, Hong Kong Commercial Daily reported on May 17. Recruitment Of Shell Account Holders According to investigators, the group hired people from the mainland to open shell bank accounts. Those recruits received funds from various fraud schemes. They withdrew cash with different ATM cards, then sent the money to virtual‑asset exchanges. From there, it was converted into digital tokens and mixed into other transactions. Flat In Mong Kok Used As Base Based on reports from Chief Inspector Lo Yuen‑shan, the syndicate ran its operations out of a flat in Mong Kok since mid‑2024. Mainland recruits were housed there. They processed illicit funds through those shell accounts every day. In one raid on that flat, officers found 600,000 HKD in cash and dozens of bank documents. HONG KONG POLICE BUST $15M CASH & CRYPTO LAUNDERING RING Hong Kong authorities have dismantled a $15 million laundering syndicate, arresting 12 suspects and seizing hundreds of ATM cards. The group used mainland recruits to open shell accounts tied to illicit funds.Nearly half… pic.twitter.com/mcELDjFe3C — Crypto Town Hall (@Crypto_TownHall) May 18, 2025 Tailing Leads To Big Seizure Superintendent Shirley Kwok Ching‑yee said police tailed two key figures from the flat. One went into a bank, and the other used an ATM. Both then headed to a crypto exchange shop in Tsim Sha Tsui. Officers moved in and seized about 770,000 HKD in cash. Across all raids, they recovered roughly 1.05 million HKD, around 134,000 in other currencies, plus over 560 ATM cards and several phones. Scope Of The Fraud Cases Lo added that more than 10 million HKD of the laundered money tied back to 58 separate fraud cases. Fraud‑related crimes in Hong Kong rose by over 12% in 2024, with more than 10,000 people arrested. Shell account holders made up over 70% of those arrests. Fraud now accounts for nearly half of the city’s 95,000 criminal cases last year. Calls For Tougher Penalties Senior Inspector Tse Ka‑lun of the Commercial Crime Bureau said friends and family often lend their bank accounts to criminals. He’s urging judges to hand down stiffer sentences. Current law allows up to 14 years in jail and a fine of up to 5 million HKD. But in the past two years, more than 100 convicted launderers got extra time—between three and 18 months added.

Notably, Starknet (STRK) just unveiled its Stage 1. Stage 1 as a Leap Toward Trust Minimization This means that the Starknet network has officially launched its first stage of decentralization. For clarity, “Stage 1” comes from L2BEAT, a site that tracks and assesses the maturity and risks faced by Ethereum L2 projects. Based on its model, L2BEAT utilizes a three-stage framework to categorize L2s based on their decentralization and security properties. Stage 1 implies that at least one security mechanism is in place to protect against fraud or ensure validity. However, some aspects, such as upgrading or data availability still depend on trust assumptions. This suggests that Starknet can now guarantee transitions are cryptographically verified, relies less on central operators but it is not fully trustless yet. Buterin congratulating Starknet signals his approval of the platform for advancing a more secure and decentralized operational model. With this development, Starknet has now joined other top-level L2s that are helping to scale Ethereum. Vitalik Buterin’s Silent STRK Move Sparks Speculation Interestingly, Buterin was involved in the STRK token drop of 2024 . Although he received a stash via Starknet’s LockedTokenGrant, he has discreetly moved over 2 million tokens to an unlabeled wallet. Buterin finalized this move about nine months ago from his Gnosis Safe. No explanation was given for the lack of labels, as they were almost undetectable to observers. The move could have been for privacy, custody, or some other purpose. STRK Price Reacts as Ecosystem Eyes Stage 2 With this milestone achieved, Starknet can now focus on completing the next stage, Stage 2. To achieve this, Starknet has set a target of 2026. The Stage 2 signals full decentralization with a trustless withdrawal mechanism live. At this level, the system is fortified against operator failure or malicious behavior, which remains a challenge in the crypto sector. The development has positively impacted the Starknet ecosystem. STRK is trading up by 5.88% at $0.1571 as of this writing. The asset earlier hit a peak of $0.1599 in the crypto market. Starknet users look forward to the ecosystem supporting the next level of decentralized applications.

44775577,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67581,1747582974,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ethereum (ETH) Recovery Is Happening, Major Breakout Imminent",https://timestabloid.com/ethereum-eth-recovery-is-happening-major-breakout-imminent/,"Ethereum (ETH), one of the most influential cryptocurrencies, is once again at the center of market analysis as speculations of a V-shape recovery gain momentum. Prominent crypto analyst Ash Crypto recently posted on X about the ongoing ETH V-shape recovery, drawing parallels with the 2020-21 cycle to forecast the next potential price trajectory. ETH V-SHAPE RECOVERY IS HAPPENING. STUDY 2020-21 CYCLE AND YOU'LL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. pic.twitter.com/qEEocK1Nsx — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) May 18, 2025 Understanding the V-Shape Recovery A V-shape recovery typically refers to a sharp decline followed by a swift and sustained rebound, forming a ‘V’ pattern on the price chart. This formation indicates a strong and rapid recovery after a significant downturn. In the context of Ethereum, this pattern emerged during the 2020-21 cycle, where ETH experienced a steep decline, marked as point ‘A’, before quickly recovering and surging to new highs at point ‘C’. The rally that followed saw ETH reach unprecedented price levels, establishing the recovery as one of the most iconic in crypto history. According to Ash Crypto, Ethereum’s current price structure resembles the same V-shape pattern that was evident during the 2020-21 period. The chart shared in his post highlights two comparative phases: the 2020-21 cycle on the left and the ongoing cycle on the right. In both instances, ETH experienced a drastic drop to point ‘A’, followed by a rebound towards point ‘B’, and ultimately skyrocketed to point ‘C’. The notable similarity between these cycles is the steep rebound phase, which Ash Crypto points to as evidence that ETH could be on the verge of a similar recovery. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Indicators Supporting the Thesis Examining technical indicators from the chart, it becomes evident that the structure of the current cycle mirrors the historical pattern. The rebound from point ‘A’ to point ‘B’ signifies renewed buying interest and accumulation, signaling that the bottom may have been established. Furthermore, the volume profile during these phases indicates heightened trading activity, often a precursor to a sustained bullish move. Market Sentiment and Broader Implications Market sentiment around Ethereum has been increasingly optimistic, bolstered by network upgrades and ongoing adoption. If Ash Crypto’s projection materializes, a strong V-shaped rally could not only restore investor confidence but also set the stage for new all-time highs. The historical correlation between past patterns and current movements lends credibility to the argument that ETH might witness a rapid recovery akin to the previous cycle. The prospect of an ETH V-shape recovery, as analyzed by Ash Crypto, offers a compelling case for bullish sentiment among investors. While past performance is not a guaranteed predictor of future results, the striking similarities between the 2020-21 cycle and the current price structure cannot be overlooked. Investors and analysts alike are closely monitoring Ethereum, awaiting confirmation of this pattern to solidify the recovery narrative.

44775734,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-crypto-to-buy-now-coinbase-reveals-400m-cost-of-data-hack,1747583443,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/44775734.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy Now? Coinbase Reveals $400M Cost of Data Hack,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-crypto-to-buy-now-coinbase-reveals-400m-cost-of-data-hack,"Coinbase faces a critical security breach just days before its S&P 500 listing. Hackers reportedly bribed insiders to bypass protocols, accessed sensitive customer data, and exposed vulnerabilities ahead of its market debut. While Coinbase has pledged full reimbursement and is collaborating with the FBI, trust has eroded—its stock COIN fell over 4% following the incident. The incident highlights broader risks for crypto: as adoption grows, bad actors are increasingly targeting internal vulnerabilities. Amid the uncertainty, investors are prioritizing projects emphasizing decentralization, community-driven security, and transparent innovation. For those evaluating where to navigate this environment, the best crypto to buy now may be those addressing systemic security challenges while advancing blockchain’s core principles. Crypto’s Trust Crisis: Coinbase Hit by $400M Hack with Insider Help Coinbase just got sucker-punched by hackers—and it’s messy. The crypto giant dropped a bombshell blog post today: attackers allegedly bribed employees and contractors to swipe customer data, potentially costing the firm a jaw-dropping $400 million. How? By impersonating Coinbase support and tricking users into coughing up their crypto. “Less than 1%” of customer data was stolen, and the criminals demanded $20 million to keep quiet. Coinbase told them to pound sand. Instead of paying up, Coinbase vowed to refund every victim, even as its stock nosedived 4.1% ahead of its S&P 500 debut. Talk about bad timing. “This isn’t just a Coinbase problem—it’s crypto’s dumpster fire,” said Nick Jones, founder of Zumo. He’s right: Chainalysis reports crypto firms lost $2.2 billion to hackers last year alone. To fight back, Coinbase fired the rogue staff, slapped a $20 million bounty on the hackers’ heads, and teamed up with the FBI. “We’re coming for these clowns,” a company rep growled. But here’s the scary part: this isn’t some lone wolf attack. As crypto goes mainstream, hackers are weaponizing insider access like never before. Remember the $600M Poly Network heist? Or the Axie Infinity disaster? Coinbase is now urging users to double-check every email and enable two-factor authentication—because even the “safest” platforms aren’t bulletproof. “We’ll fix this,” they promised, but trust is crumbling faster than a stale cookie. Bottom line? Crypto’s gold rush is a hacker’s playground, and until companies lock down their teams, we’re all just sitting ducks. Best Crypto To Buy Now As Coinbase scrambles to clean up a $400 million mess, it’s clear that trust in crypto is changing. This breach wasn’t about weak passwords; it was insiders flipping for cash. With the “safest” crypto firm burned, the industry must brace for more. But amidst the chaos, certain tokens are rising, built with solid security and utility-first ecosystems. These projects aren’t just hype—they’re hope. The best crypto to buy now as Coinbase’s fall reshapes trust in the market. Bitcoin As Coinbase stumbles, Bitcoin stands tall—battle-hardened, borderless, and immune to insider bribes. In a world where platforms get hacked, BTC reminds us: be your own bank, or risk losing everything. The price of Bitcoin soaring above $100K once again, leading many to speculate that Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, may have surpassed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in wealth. According to blockchain analytics firm Arkham, Satoshi’s crypto wallet is estimated to hold around $113.8 billion in Bitcoin, as reported by Benzinga—while Bill Gates' net worth is estimated at $112.9 billion by Forbes. Undoubtedly, Bitcoin is poised to reach even greater heights, with experts like Arthur Hayes and JP Morgan predicting that its saturation point is still a long way off. In technical terms, it is currently trading at around $104K with a market cap of $2.06 trillion, securing its position in 1st place. It has shown a 0.52% growth in the past 24 hours, suggesting that the saturation point is still far off, creating an opportunity for potential buyers to capitalize on upcoming opportunities. Bitcoin's influence extends beyond finance, often referred to as ""digital gold."" It also holds political weight—recently, Eric Trump remarked, ""Everyone in the world is trying to hoard Bitcoin right now. Mind of Pepe Coinbase got tricked, highlighting the need for simpler and more secure alternatives. With its unique and innovative roots, it’s fair to say that Mind of Pepe mocks the mess. This meme-fueled thinker thrives on irony, weaving chaos into creativity. In a world of hacks and heists, Pepe’s mind games focus on delivering sharp market insights—many of which are likely to emphasize the importance of security. Mind of Pepe combines the comedic themes of memes with the advantages of an AI-driven ecosystem. Developed by Elvora Labs, Mind of Pepe features an AI agent that learns from the crypto ecosystem and provides sharp insights in the form of posts on X, while also engaging with the broader cryptocurrency community. Among the many tools developed by the Mind of Pepe team, the focus is on crypto insights, trading alpha calls, and the ability to create and deploy tokens. These factors have helped it raise close to $10 million to date, with its presale set to end by the end of May. Solana Coinbase crumbles from within—but Solana’s chain races ahead, unbothered. With lightning-fast speeds and a builder army, it’s not just scaling—it’s surviving the trust collapse. While others patch holes, SOL rewrites the infrastructure. It’s not just hype—it’s horsepower. In a study by CoinMarketCap, it was revealed that the top seven performing ecosystem tokens are meme coins or meme coin-related projects. This underscores the growing importance of Solana in crypto space. As one of the leading blockchains, Solana’s major demand stems from meme coin trading, thanks to its seamless user experience. According to Messari’s State of Solana Q1 2025 report , Pump.fun, a platform on the Solana blockchain that enables users to quickly create and trade meme coins, emerged as the top revenue generator for Solana apps in Q1 2025.

BTC BULL While insiders sell out and exchanges implode, BTC Bull charges forward. Built to thrive in chaos, this bull doesn’t flinch when giants fall—it feeds on the panic. High-energy, low-trust markets are its arena. No gloves, no breaks—BTC Bull is charging full throttle toward its new target of raising $6M in its presale. With a powerful tokenomics structure built on a dual system of token burns and airdrops, BTC BULL is making waves in crypto space. The platform rewards users with real Bitcoin when key milestones are reached, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K in Bitcoin’s value. One of the famous crypto YouTubers, ClayBro , has predicted that there could be a massive rise in the price of Bitcoin. Additionally, with high staking rewards, BTC BULL offers users a chance to earn passively—whether one is a beginner or an experienced trader—while benefiting from the strength and longevity of Bitcoin, the oldest and most established cryptocurrency. Conclusion Coinbase may recover and address the breach, but the impact extends beyond stolen data or temporary stock declines—it challenges trust, which rebuilds slowly. In an industry where future breaches remain a risk, resilience depends on vigilance. The best crypto to buy now includes projects designed with decentralized frameworks and community-driven security, reducing reliance on centralized weak points. While established platforms address vulnerabilities, strategic investors are shifting focus to protocols that emphasize transparency, robust infrastructure, and long-term viability. That’s why half of the investor picks listed in this article are innovative crypto ICOs. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

44775898,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/shib-to-001-by-2025-ozak-ais-price-forecast-shows-it-might-hit-1-faster,1747583740,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/44775898.jpeg,SHIB to $0.01 by 2025? Ozak AI’s Price Forecast Shows It Might Hit $1 Faster,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/shib-to-001-by-2025-ozak-ais-price-forecast-shows-it-might-hit-1-faster,"With the crypto market preparing for what many analysts believe will be the next major bull run in 2025, investors are once again speculating on high-risk, high-reward tokens. One such token is Shiba Inu (SHIB)—the meme coin that took the market by storm in 2021. Enthusiasts continue to ask: Can SHIB realistically reach $0.01 by 2025? While the Shiba Inu community remains optimistic, a new contender named Ozak AI is grabbing attention with its real-world use case, AI integration, and a presale price of just $0.003. Many believe Ozak AI could hit $1 before SHIB touches a cent. SHIB to $0.01 by 2025? Hitting $0.01 has long been the holy grail for SHIB investors. At its current price of around $0.000022, SHIB would need to increase over 450x to reach that milestone. With a circulating supply of over 589 trillion tokens, such a surge would push its market cap into multi-trillion-dollar territory—something that even Bitcoin hasn’t achieved yet. SHIB developers have introduced token burns and utility features such as Shibarium, a Layer 2 scaling solution, to increase token value. Still, the sheer volume of SHIB in circulation remains a significant obstacle. While a 2x to 5x rally in 2025 is very possible with favorable market conditions, hitting $0.01 may still be wishful thinking barring a dramatic supply reduction. From a technical standpoint, SHIB’s next resistance levels are around $0.00003 and $0.00005, while key support zones rest near $0.000013 and $0.00001. While its community is strong, its price ceiling is structurally limited. Ozak AI’s Price Forecast Shows It Might Hit $1 Faster Ozak AI is emerging as one of the most exciting presale tokens of 2024–2025. The project merges artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, offering practical tools for data analysis, automation, and predictive modeling in decentralized environments. Its real-world utility gives it a strategic edge over hype-driven meme coins. Ozak AI presale has already raised over $1 million, with investors rushing in at the attractive $0.003 price point. With a relatively low supply and growing institutional interest in AI-focused crypto projects, analysts believe Ozak AI could hit $1 in the next bull run, representing a potential 300x return. Ozak AI is built around technology adoption and has a more scalable path toward real valuation growth. With AI being a trillion-dollar industry, Ozak AI’s integration into that ecosystem makes it more than just a speculative play—it’s a bet on the future of AI-powered finance. While SHIB to $0.01 remains a hopeful narrative for its community, the fundamentals and market math make it an uphill battle. Meanwhile, Ozak AI, backed by a strong use case, low initial valuation, and current momentum, presents a much more feasible route to $1 in the near term. For investors weighing between meme coin nostalgia and future-tech innovation, Ozak AI looks better positioned to deliver substantial returns by 2025.

Mutuum Finance, an early-stage startup in the DeFi space, is generating buzz among early on investors and analysts alike, many of whom believe that it will reach the $5 mark well before its larger, more mature competitors. While ADA is looking at scalability and DOGE is riding hype from the community, Mutuum Finance comes with world utility, a lean tokenomics strategy, and quick ecosystem development. Mutuum Finance Phase 4 presale Which exceeds 85% sold, is up for sale at $0.025, with investor interest keen enough to push the buy by over 10,000 buyers in raising a total of $8.6 million. Investors who join the round are poised to make a 140% return when the token launches on exchanges at $0.06. With crypto investors evaluating what crypto to own today, Mutuum is quickly becoming the leader of the next big break out. Mutuum Finance Presale The investor support for Mutuum Finance Phase 4 presale continues to grow steadily throughout its development cycle. Buyers are investing in the platform due to its sustainable DeFi solution, which is built on a more robust development scale than typical meme coin volatility. So far, the presale has collected more than $8.6 million from investors while gathering over 10,000 token holders, an early sign that it could be one of the best crypto projects to watch as momentum builds. Early participants find Phase 4 tokens highly appealing because they are available at $0.025 during the ongoing phase. The platform launch will raise token prices to $0.06 at launch thereby delivering a 140% profit to Phase 4 investors. Analysts anticipate MUTM will achieve a post-listing price of $2.50 which would significantly enhance its market value. Investors can anticipate a price enhancement to $0.03 in phase 5 which indicates future price growth for MUTM. A recently unveiled dashboard of Mutuum Finance presents a leaderboard ranking of token holders where top 50 holders who stay in their position earn bonus tokens to boost long-term investor interest. Mutuum Finance is also gamifying the user interface with a leaderboard of the top 50 holders of tokens, who are to be rewarded with additional MUTM tokens. On top of that, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on, with ten winners selected to each receive $10,000 in tokens. There is also a referral program running, which rewards users for helping to grow the platform through organic, grassroots outreach. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Dual-Model System Mutuum has a special dual-lending system. It combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) methods. This offers maximum flexibility. P2C System: Smart contracts through P2C System regulate lending pools by modifying interest rates according to market trends which provides lenders with financial stability while securing loans for borrowers. P2P System: This distributed system removes middlemen. It creates direct connections between lenders and borrowers. This gives both lenders and borrowers full control over the process.

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the second-biggest meme coin in crypto, has dropped to $0.000015, down from this week’s high of $0.00001750. CoinGecko data shows that the daily volume has dropped in the past few weeks, signaling demand is drying up. Shiba Inu had a 24-hour volume of $173 million on Sunday, much lower than Dogecoin’s ( DOGE ) $1.416 billion and Pepe’s ( PEPE ) $933 million. Its volume was also lower than that of other smaller meme coins, such as Official Trump, Bonk, Dogwifhat, and Peanut the Squirrel. The same trend is happening in the futures market, where open interest has been downtrending after peaking at $272 million on May 11. It has dropped to $216 million, a smaller figure than other meme coins like Bonk and Pepe. You might also like: Pi Network price crashes as centralization risks persist Futures open interest is a popular figure that measures the number of unfilled orders in the futures market. A high open interest is a sign of high volume and liquidity. Shiba Inu price has also dropped as the daily burn rate has slowed in the past few days. Data shows that the daily burn rate dropped by 78% on Sunday to 3.3 million. Less than 70 million SHIB coins were burned since Tuesday last week. Shiba Inu burns are usually bullish because they reduce the amount of coins in circulation and boost market sentiment. Further, the total value locked in the Shibarium network has dropped in the last seven days. It fell from $3.98 million to $3.41 million, with most dApps in the ecosystem, like ShibaSwap and K9 Finance, losing assets. Shiba Inu price technical analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The ongoing Shiba Inu Coin consolidation could be calm before the storm and a surge. The weekly chart shows that the SHIB price has formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.00001076. A double-bottom often leads to a strong bullish breakout, potentially to the neckline, which, in this case, is at the November high of $0.00003390, up by 133% from the current level. Shiba Inu is also forming the popular harmonic pattern known as XABCD. It has already completed the XA, AB, and BC phases and is now in the early stages of the last CD phase. If this happens, the SHIB price will likely bounce back and hit the 2024 high of $0.00004618, up by 227% from the current level.

At the same time, Uniswap just made history with $3 trillion in total trading volume, a huge milestone in the DEX space even though UNI itself is still trying to catch fire again. While the spotlight stays on these giants, another name is gaining speed fast. Unstaked is blending AI and Web3 in ways few saw coming and early buyers are already seeing the setup. Unstaked’s $1 million giveaway is up and running, with 20 winners lined up to split the reward. Still, the real win could be the entry price of $0.009267. Why? Because $UNSD is connected to AI agents that are designed to run entire community roles with no manual work. For anyone scouting the next big crypto play, this might be the breakout moment before the crowd catches on. Unstaked Launches $1M Giveaway With Surge in Presale Unstaked is turning heads with its $1 million giveaway, giving 20 winners a shot at free $UNSD tokens just for joining in. No lockups, no fine print, just a chance to score big by getting in early. But if you’re only watching the promo, you could be missing what really matters. The bigger story is the presale price of $0.00899 in Stage 13, with over $6.1 million raised so far. In the last 48 hours alone, $2 million has poured in. That kind of rush doesn’t happen without serious interest. Some early buyers are jumping in below a penny, eyeing the forecasted $5 listing price that could mean a 600x move. This isn’t just buzz. It’s built on actual function. Unstaked’s AI agents are designed to handle all Web3 community tasks, cutting the need for paid moderators. These agents will be used to run chats, give answers, and grow follower bases on platforms like X and Telegram. They’re still in development and will launch once $UNSD is listed, while other projects are still figuring out their purpose. For buyers, this isn’t just about chasing hype or joining a contest. It’s about stepping into a Crypto Trading setup with real features behind it. If you’re betting on AI and crypto working together, Unstaked could be the early-stage Crypto Trading move that hits big. XRP Forecast: Can a $3T Cap Take It to $51? The XRP forecast is catching fire as the coin trades near $2.40 with a market cap of $140 billion. Analysts say a breakout past current resistance could push XRP into new territory. If the market cap reaches $750 billion, the price might land around $12.81. Others are looking higher, predicting $25.62 at a $1.5 trillion cap and even over $51 if XRP climbs to $3 trillion. That kind of run would put XRP ahead of big tech like Meta and possibly Apple. Some think $52 is a stretch, but others believe it’s on the table if adoption grows fast enough. Either way, XRP’s position in the top four cryptos keeps it on every trader’s radar. The XRP forecast is fueling bold debates as the price action heats up and longer-term bets come into focus. Uniswap Sets $3 Trillion Trade Record Uniswap just hit a massive milestone, crossing $3 trillion in total trade volume. That cements its lead as the biggest decentralized exchange, now pushing $3.3 billion in daily trades and holding 23% of the DEX market. PancakeSwap trails close behind with 21%. The news was confirmed by founder Hayden Adams and backed by Dune Analytics data. Even with strong volume, Uniswap’s total value locked is still around $5 billion, just half of its 2021 peak. Meanwhile, the UNI token is trading at $7.03, which is 84% below its all-time high of $45. But the $3 trillion number proves Uniswap isn’t just noise. With upgrades like EIP-7702 on the way, the platform could remain a top choice as users shift to on-chain trading with fewer middlemen. What to Watch Next XRP is steady near $2.40, and some bullish XRP forecast models are pointing to $12 and beyond. Uniswap just crossed $3 trillion in trades, proving its dominance in the DEX world even if UNI’s price is still catching up. But the wild card may be Unstaked. It’s a $1 million giveaway is open now, with 20 winners in line for $UNSD. Still, the bigger story could be the $0.009267 crypto presale price tag. Forecasts put the future value at $5, which sets up a possible 600x return. Unstaked’s AI agents are being built to run full crypto communities, replacing the need for paid moderators. These tools are under development and expected to launch after listing. For anyone chasing real upside in the Crypto Trading scene, Unstaked might be the early play worth jumping on.

The daily chart shows consistent resistance just above $107,000, with the latest candles forming in a compressed horizontal band, indicating indecision and low momentum. Related Reading: ‘Judgment Day Is Coming’—XRP Set To Explode, Analyst Warns This price behavior could be seen as a pause before the next leg higher. However, it could also be a trap that could cause a reversal towards $98,000. Daily Close Above $107K A Clear Breakout Signal Bitcoin’s current consolidation around the $103,000 price level has dragged on for over a week, and an eventual breakout could happen into any direction. In a recent post on social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted the importance of a daily close above $107,000 for a bullish Bitcoin. His chart illustrates that price has approached this threshold multiple times since December 2024 but failed to sustain a close on the daily timeframe. This, in turn, has led to the formation of a horizontal barrier just beneath $108,000. Notably, even Bitcoin’s all-time high of $108,786 on January 20 failed to close above the $107,000 price level on that day. According to Martinez, a confirmed close above this level could open the door for further upside movement toward new all-time highs. However, until this threshold is decisively cleared, Martinez warns that traders should be cautious and avoid forcing positions. Image From X: @ali_charts Potential Bitcoin Trap Setup And Liquidity Sweep To $98K A separate technical breakdown by crypto analyst TehThomas, published on TradingView, presents a far more cautious outlook for Bitcoin. Similarly, the analyst noted that Bitcoin has spent more than eight days locked in a narrow range between roughly $100,000 and $105,800. According to his liquidity-based framework, this range is likely being used as a trap to invite both long and short traders into premature breakout trades. His 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart shows a clear consolidation block, with price failing to escape either end, and liquidity pooling above $105,800 as well as under $100,000. TehThomas believes the equal highs near $105,800 are acting as bait for breakout longs. He expects Bitcoin to briefly sweep these highs, only to cause a fast and decisive move downwards into the lower demand zone between $98,000 and $97,500. This zone, marked as a large unmitigated fair value gap and golden pocket level on his chart, is where he expects the price to react next, once the liquidity on both sides is taken. Image From TradingView: TehThomas However, this short setup towards $98,000 would be invalidated if the Bitcoin price manages to hold above $105,800 and shows a continued strong volume and follow-through.

Uniswap (UNI) has price projections ranging from $4.60 to $7.58 following its v4 upgrade. Meanwhile, Pepe (PEPE) has climbed 80% from its April low, supported by strong RSI and bullish patterns. Still, many fund managers are shifting attention to Web3 ai . With its presale near $0.0003 and analysts projecting a possible $1, it is now considered by some as the best crypto for 2025. Web3 ai focuses on building and launching 12 AI tools designed for practical use. These include trading signals, portfolio monitoring, arbitrage tools, scam alerts, and on-chain sentiment analysis, all linked to the $WAI token. The project has already secured $4.1 million and is being viewed as a serious contender in the AI crypto space. For those looking at early projects with working products, Web3 ai may be one of this year’s top breakout candidates. Web3 ai Builds Tools That Aim to Meet Real Market Needs Web3 ai is gaining attention because it is creating tools aimed at active crypto users, not just making promises. Its 12-tool platform includes features like trade alerts, sentiment tracking, risk detection, and automated portfolio adjustments. These tools are powered by the $WAI token, meaning usage and demand are connected from the start. The presale results show that interest is building. Over $4.1 million has been raised as the project moves into stage 5 of its 50-stage presale. The token is now priced at $0.000365, up from $0.0003 in stage 1, and is expected to launch at $0.005242. That presents nearly a 15x difference, and some analysts believe it could reach $1 if adoption continues. One reason for the growing interest is how the tools match today’s crypto needs. Individual users want easy-to-use automation. Larger players are looking for AI tools that work on-chain. Web3 ai aims to offer both, without hiding behind complicated systems. That’s why it stands out in the current field of AI tokens. For anyone exploring the best crypto for 2025, Web3 ai is becoming a strong candidate. It offers useful features, early-stage momentum, and room to grow from its current price. Many analysts and early supporters now see it as a top choice across both AI and DeFi spaces. UNI Price Outlook Shifts After New Version Launch The latest Uniswap (UNI) price outlook ranges from $4.60 to $7.58 by mid-2025, based on how the market reacts to Uniswap’s recent v4 update. This upgrade went live across 12 blockchains, including Ethereum and Avalanche, and brought in “hooks” that let developers add custom features to trading pairs. It increases Uniswap’s flexibility within the DeFi space. Currently trading near $6.57, UNI has risen 29% over the past week, even with daily price swings. In total, Uniswap has handled over $2.94 trillion in trades, which is more than Canada’s 2023 GDP. That number is helping UNI return to watchlists. The Uniswap (UNI) price outlook is likely to shift with broader DeFi trends, but the network’s reach and on-chain strength keep it in focus as one of the more reliable tokens for long-term value. Traders looking at fundamentals and usage metrics are keeping it under review. PEPE Price Moves Higher After April Rally The latest Pepe (PEPE) price move has drawn attention after a sharp 80% increase from its April low of $0.00000693 to around $0.0000139. This rally is supported by technical signs, including a breakout above the 200-day EMA and key Fibonacci levels, along with an RSI above 80. These shifts have brought PEPE back into view among meme coin traders, many of whom are watching for fast moves. Forecasts remain mixed but lean positive. Some see it reaching $0.000045 by the second quarter, while others expect possible highs near $0.00006376 by late 2025. The Pepe (PEPE) price trend also shows how much current movement is driven by market sentiment and speculative interest. While it remains a high-risk coin, the momentum points to more short-term gains for those tracking the chart closely. If interest continues and community support stays active, PEPE will likely remain one of the more talked-about meme coins. Web3 ai Joins the Conversation on Top Picks for 2025 Uniswap (UNI) price forecasts are rising after its v4 upgrade and $2.94 trillion swap total, with the current value near $6.57 and some analysts targeting above $7. The Pepe (PEPE) price update shows an 80% rise from April lows, with technical signs pointing to possible new highs of $0.00006376. Both tokens are moving fast, but neither brings what Web3 ai is aiming to offer. Web3 ai is priced at $0.000365 in stage 5 of its presale, with a planned listing value of $0.005242 and $4.1 million already raised. Many early watchers are now listing it as the best crypto for 2025. The $WAI token powers 12 blockchain-based AI tools made for crypto users, including signal trackers, scam filters, and risk detection tools. If you’re looking beyond market noise and focusing on working AI tied to blockchain, Web3 ai stands out. It’s more than just a presale. It may be one of the top AI crypto projects to watch as 2025 approaches.

With Ethereum ETF approvals looming and global regulators greenlighting more crypto-based instruments, market participants are shifting focus from overvalued giants to under-the-radar projects showing real promise. Among them, Qubetics is rapidly emerging as a Best Performing Crypto for 2025—fueled not by speculation, but by substance. With a growing ecosystem, enterprise-ready tools, and a strong crypto presale track record, Qubetics is capturing the spotlight as the smart money pivots toward utility-first platforms. Chainlink once captured that spotlight, delivering jaw-dropping returns to early participants. But that ship has long sailed. Now, Qubetics ($TICS) is surging with a crypto presale that’s attracting serious attention from analysts and developers alike. Positioned as the Best Performing Crypto in the presale market, Qubetics is already offering utility that Chainlink never could—and at a fraction of the cost. The market appears to be writing a familiar script, and this time, the token rewriting the rules is $TICS. Chainlink: The Opportunity That Came and Went When Chainlink (LINK) first entered the market in 2017, priced under $0.20, few outside the developer community grasped its significance. At its core, Chainlink was not a traditional payment token or smart contract platform—it was a decentralized oracle network, built to connect blockchain applications with real-world data. As DeFi exploded, the demand for accurate, tamper-proof external data surged, and Chainlink became the go-to solution for countless protocols. By May 2021, LINK soared to over $50, rewarding early adopters with gains of over 25,000%. Chainlink’s value wasn’t just in its price. It was in how it enabled decentralized finance to function properly. Platforms like Aave, Synthetix, and Yearn Finance relied on Chainlink’s oracles to price assets, calculate yields, and settle contracts securely. While some speculators overlooked its “backend” utility, developers and institutions knew Chainlink was indispensable. Still, many casual market participants missed the window, failing to understand the critical role oracles play in Web3 infrastructure. Qubetics: The Best Performing Crypto for Real-Life Application and Explosive Growth Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just promising scalability. It’s already delivering use-case scenarios that apply to people’s everyday lives—across industries, geographies, and income brackets. From freelancers to multinational businesses, its blockchain platform powers cross-border payments, smart contract development, and decentralized infrastructure—all without forcing users to master complex tools. The presale numbers speak volumes: Stage 34 live Token Price: $0.2532 Over 512 million $TICS sold More than 26,500 holders $17 million raised This momentum is turning heads, not because of hype, but because of tangible utility. Qubetics is building an ecosystem where developers, enterprises, and even individuals with minimal technical background can deploy blockchain solutions instantly. Here’s how the Qubetics blockchain applies in real life: Small Businesses : A clothing supplier in Texas can pay its cotton exporter in Pakistan in seconds using Qubetics-powered remittances, avoiding currency exchange fees and bank delays. Freelancers : A designer in Manila gets paid in $TICS through smart contracts that release funds upon task completion—no need for costly escrow services. Enterprises : Mid-sized logistics firms now automate payments and shipment tracking across borders using Qubetics’ interoperable blockchain toolkit. Crypto analysts are already placing bold bets. Forecasts project: $TICS at $1 post-presale: 294% ROI $TICS at $5 post-launch: 1874% ROI $TICS at $15: A staggering 5822% ROI potential Qubetics’ edge lies in its blend of scalability, usability, and modular tools like QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE. These platforms simplify smart contract creation, enabling rapid adoption among startups and enterprises alike. In contrast to the legacy coins that burned brightly and fizzled out, Qubetics shows the traits of a Best Performing Crypto in the making—affordable now, but possibly unobtainable later. Why Timing Is Everything—and 2025 Belongs to Qubetics History in crypto doesn’t repeat, but it does rhyme. Chainlink, like many coins before it, rewarded those who moved early and punished those who hesitated. The pattern is unmistakable: high-utility coins in crypto presale phases often deliver the most disproportionate gains. Qubetics’ current stage mirrors what Chainlink once was—a project with sound fundamentals, expanding adoption, and a ticking clock before mainstream discovery. The market may never see $TICS at $0.2532 again. As more holders join the crypto presale and momentum builds, the entry point narrows daily. And unlike speculative meme coins, Qubetics isn’t just riding sentiment. It’s backed by real platforms, with products already being used and praised by a growing global user base. Every metric, from token distribution to holder count, confirms what the market is starting to realize—Qubetics is the Best Performing Crypto rising right under the radar. Conclusion: Missed Chainlink? Don’t Miss Qubetics Those who missed Chainlink during its breakout phase still revisit historical charts, imagining what could’ve been. Yet crypto is not a market of second chances—it’s a market of early action. Qubetics offers a new frontier, with a stronger foundation, deeper use cases, and a much broader range of real-life impact. It is not merely another altcoin—it is positioning itself as the Best Performing Crypto of the current cycle. The crypto presale metrics speak volumes: over 512 million tokens sold, $17 million raised, and more than 26,500 holders secured. With a current entry price of $0.2532, this is more than a buying opportunity—it’s a strategic moment to engage before Qubetics hits mainstream momentum. For those seeking the Best Performing Crypto to watch in 2025, the window is narrowing. And just like Chainlink, the moment to move may not come twice.

What makes Qubetics the Best Performing Crypto candidate? Its blend of real-world application, presale growth, and high analyst ROI predictions make it a standout for 2025. What are analysts predicting for $TICS post-launch? Forecasts range from $1 to $15, offering potential ROI of up to 5822%. How does Qubetics differ from Chainlink? Qubetics integrates modular tools, real-world blockchain use cases, and cross-border payment capabilities, making it more adaptable than Chainlink was at its early stages.

With the crypto market showing signs of life, there’s growing curiosity about when these two will join the surge. Analyzing their current position could offer insights into their potential for growth. The article explores whether these coins are poised for an upward movement. ARB Price Update: Recent Trends and Critical Levels ARB price showed volatility over the past half-year with a 48.37% drop, yet a robust monthly gain of 34.99% indicates a recovery effort. A one-week decline of 21.28% further highlights the coin’s choppiness while reflecting mixed market sentiment. Price action over these periods points to swings of both bullish and bearish forces as traders reacted to changing conditions. Current trading sees ARB moving between $0.2577 and $0.3787. Immediate resistance at $0.43 and support at $0.18 form crucial boundaries, while secondary levels at $0.55 and $0.07 add depth to the chart. Bulls and bears remain in a tug-of-war with no clear trend, prompting setups that favor buying near support and cautious profit-taking near resistance. Optimism's Volatile Slide Amid Recent Recovery OP monthly performance shows a modest gain of 9.7% despite a steeper weekly drop of 22.08%. The six-month trend reflects a significant decline of 61.43%. Price swings have been notable, indicating a struggle between temporary recoveries and a prolonged downturn. Current trading range stands between $0.568 and $0.873, with resistance points near $1.02 and a second resistance at $1.32. Key support is at $0.41, followed by a lower level at $0.099. Bears seem to dominate the market due to negative signals from moving averages and oscillators, while a clear trend remains absent. Traders can consider short-term opportunities within these defined levels while exercising caution. Conclusion Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) are emerging as strong contenders in the market. Both have shown potential through impressive tech advancements and growing communities. They are built to improve transaction speeds and reduce costs, making them attractive for users and developers. The coming months will be crucial for ARB and OP as they strive to gain more traction. If they continue on their current path, they might soon join the larger rally observed in the broader market. Hence, keeping an eye on their progress could be rewarding. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Interestingly, no legal representatives appeared on their behalf. The virtual hearing was a preliminary step before potential civil litigation surrounding the multi-million dollar crypto scheme. According to a report by the Argentinian newspaper Página/12 , the digital conference, arranged with an official mediator, saw attendance from just one attorney who represented defendant Manuel Terrones Godoy. Godoy reportedly had prior involvement with similar financial irregularities.

The judicial order, which extends to Karina Milei, the Secretary General of the Presidency, seeks banking information dating back to 2023. The investigation follows allegations that the Mileis had connections to promoters of the Libra ( LIBRA ) cryptocurrency. LIBRA collapsed shortly after the president endorsed it on social media. Court documents show the fraud may have affected approximately 25 victims across Argentina and internationally, with losses estimated at $4.5 million.

The legal action against Novelli extends to family members, including his mother, María Alicia Rafaele, and sister, María Pía Novelli. Security footage from a Galicia bank branch shows the women entering with empty bags on February 17 and departing with visibly full containers. This was just one business day after President Milei’s cryptocurrency endorsement. “At 11:03:08, the women were observed exiting the branch with their handbag and backpack appearing significantly more filled than when they arrived,” states a Federal Police report from the Money Laundering division. The controversy started on Feb. 14 when President Milei promoted the LIBRA launch on his social platforms. While the cryptocurrency briefly appreciated in value, it quickly plunged. Milei subsequently published a statement claiming he had no knowledge of the transaction details.

As Ethereum approaches the $3,000 milestone, the cryptocurrency market is pulsing with activity. The Pectra upgrade’s promise of scalability and deflationary mechanisms is what motivates this action. Altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralised financial enterprise that captivates investors, thrive in this bullish wave. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is now in its fourth presale round, has raised $8,600,000 and sold over 481 million tokens to 10,000 holders. As Ethereum ignites the market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a prime candidate for explosive growth. Ethereum’s rally ignites Altcoin fever Ethereum is charging toward $3,000, buoyed by the Pectra upgrade. This update slashes transaction costs and burns ETH via gas fees, potentially shrinking supply. The crypto charts reflect this momentum, with Ethereum leaping past its 200-day EMA, a bullish signal for long-term growth. Trading volumes soar, and the crypto fear and greed index tilts toward optimism. Yet, Ethereum’s high entry point dims its short-term ROI potential. Investors now hunt for the next crypto to explode, seeking cheaper coins with robust fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits this mold, offering a low-cost entry into a utility-driven DeFi ecosystem. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform revolutionizing lending and borrowing in the crypto market. It enables users to deposit assets like ETH to earn interest-bearing mtTokens, such as mtETH, which grow in value and remain usable across DeFi ecosystems. Borrowers access funds through overcollateralized loans, ensuring stability. A unique buy-and-distribute mechanism reinvests platform revenue into MUTM tokens, rewarding stakers and driving demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is dominating its fourth presale phase, now 87% filled at $0.025 per token, up from $0.01 in the opening phase. Investors face a narrowing window before phase five hikes prices 20% to $0.03, yielding a swift gain for current buyers. The tokenomics guarantee a 140% profit at the $0.06 listing price. Analysts predict a post-launch climb to $2.50 in 2025, promising a staggering 9,900% ROI. Recently, the team launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for loyalty. This move sparks urgency, as phase four’s rapid sell-out fuels FOMO in the crypto market. Innovative lending fuels MUTM’s rise Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche with its decentralized lending model. Users deposit assets like ETH to earn mtTokens, which accrue interest over time. These tokens, like mtETH, offer liquidity across DeFi platforms, blending passive income with flexibility. Borrowers access funds via overcollateralized loans, ensuring stability. A buy-and-distribute system funnels platform revenue into MUTM token repurchasing, rewarding stakers and sustaining demand. The team is finalizing a CertiK smart contract audit, with results soon to be shared on social media, bolstering trust. A forthcoming stablecoin will further deepen liquidity, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a DeFi leader. Altcoin season’s hidden gem As Ethereum’s rally stokes the crypto market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines as the best crypto to buy now. Its $0.025 entry point offers unmatched value, dwarfing Ethereum’s pricier prospects. The 140% listing gain and potential 9,900% ROI in 2025 make it a top crypto for short- and long-term investors. Unlike Ethereum’s established trajectory, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) taps untapped DeFi potential. The crypto prices today favor early adopters, and with phase four nearly sold out. Hesitation risks missing this cheapest crypto’s ascent. Join the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale now to secure your stake in the next big cryptocurrency.

The meme token surged nearly 4.3% over the last 24 hours, driven by a strong rebound from critical demand zones. After several days of choppy trading and downside pressure, SHIB bulls appear to be reclaiming momentum as sentiment improves across the broader crypto market. The key question now is: Why Shiba Inu price going up today, and can this rally sustain into the weekend?

A growing number of large-cap crypto holders are now quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE , with early projections suggesting up to 20,000% upside if it mirrors early SHIBA, DOGE, or PEPE-style performance. With Stage 8 heating up , MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the high-risk, high-reward entry play favored by smart money — while Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even altcoin traders from Aptos (APT) position for the next big move. Here’s why analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the most explosive altcoin entry of the 2025 cycle. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why Early Whales Are Targeting MAGACOINFINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer a secret. While still in its pre-listing phase, this politically infused altcoin has caught the eye of whales looking for early-stage asymmetric returns . With a forecasted listing price of $0.007 and a growing wave of attention around its narrative, branding, and tokenomics, many now see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a real contender for 25x–200x returns . Why whales are quietly loading up: Narrative resonance with a massive cultural audience Structured entry pricing before exchanges open the floodgates Momentum-fueled cycle timing with BTC already showing strength This is no typical meme coin. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a strategic entry point — and those who understand early accumulation behavior are already acting. Bitcoin’s Steady Climb Reinforces Market Confidence Bitcoin (BTC) remains the macro driver of all crypto cycles — and it is currently holding strong above $103,000 , reinforcing sentiment across altcoins. With institutional inflows still growing post-ETF approval and increasing use of BTC as a hedge against fiat devaluation, Bitcoin is helping pave the way for higher-risk plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE to flourish. Analysts continue pointing to $150K–$250K targets before year-end, and whale wallets are expanding — not just in BTC, but in smaller tokens with explosive upside. Ethereum’s Quiet Build-Up Toward ETF Catalysts Ethereum (ETH) may not be making headlines every day, but behind the scenes, the ecosystem is gaining strength. Upgrades like Pectra have improved performance, and ETH is expected to follow BTC’s lead with ETF approvals of its own. Currently trading near $2,600 , Ethereum is the foundation of smart contracts and DeFi. But more importantly, ETH whales are diversifying — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing up on more radar screens as a pre-listing play with massive ROI appeal. Aptos (APT) Sees Event-Driven Gains — But Attention Is Drifting Aptos (APT) recently gained traction following the “Aptos Experience 2025” event, trading above $8.40 with volume surging. While APT’s tech-first approach has strong backing, some early investors are rotating out profits in favor of lower-cap exposure . MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefitting from that shift, with many short-term speculators taking gains from APT and placing them into MAGA , where exponential upside still remains. APT may continue rising, but MAGACOIN FINANCE has a clearer short-term growth curve — and a much lower entry price. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion When whale wallets start positioning early, it usually means one thing: they see something retail investors haven’t caught onto yet . With MAGACOIN FINANCE accelerating through Stage 8, the combination of timing, tokenomics, and narrative is drawing serious accumulation from large BTC, ETH, and XRP holders. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the anchors of the market, it’s tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer the true breakout potential . And with whales quietly loading up, that breakout could arrive much sooner than the market expects.

According to a Bloomberg report , Infinite Risks International, a private security firm based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, is seeing more inquiries into bodyguard services and more long-term clients signing up for a private security detail. Additionally, French law enforcement officials recently announced enhanced security measures for crypto entrepreneurs and investors, following at least three separate kidnapping incidents so far in 2025. The measures include security briefings and expedited access to police lines in the case of emergencies for the entrepreneurs and their families. French law enforcement authorities also advised crypto investors not to advertise their wealth or wear crypto-branded clothing, lessening their chances of becoming targets. The disturbing string of incidents highlights the need for proactive safety measures and vigilance for crypto investors and industry professionals.

In May 2024, the father of an unnamed crypto entrepreneur was freed from a ransom attempt after French law enforcement officials raided the location in a Paris suburb where the individual was being held hostage by organized criminals. According to Le Parisien, the suspects severed one of the victim's fingers — bearing a disturbing similarity to other crypto-related kidnapping cases in France where the victim was mutilated by the suspects.

Several masked assailants physically assaulted the family on the street and attempted to force Noizat's daughter and grandson into a van in broad daylight. The daughter and another pedestrian managed to fight off the attackers and force them into retreat, preventing the family from being abducted. The high visibility and brazenness of the crime sent shockwaves through the crypto world, leading French interior minister Bruno Retailleau to call for a meeting with industry executives to discuss the incidents and propose enhanced security measures for at-risk crypto professionals and high net worth investors.

Vet’s observations provide a clear perspective on how the XRPL has evolved into one of the most approachable blockchain platforms for developers, supported by a growing community and improving infrastructure. The XRP Ledger is the easiest chain to build against. It's very accessible and not intimidating for new devs. With well documented API calls . Huge community difference between 2020 and 2025. More apps. More infra operators. More education. More users. More XRP Ledger. — Vet (@Vet_X0) May 16, 2025 Enhanced Developer Accessibility and Programmability Vet pointed out that the XRPL remains “the easiest chain to build against,” highlighting its reputation for being highly accessible to new developers. This accessibility stems largely from the network’s well-documented API calls. This simplifies the integration process and reduces the learning curve for those new to blockchain development. In early 2025, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, shared the company’s roadmap for institutional DeFi on the ledger , and programmability was a notable part of this roadmap. The XRPL’s programming environment has undergone continuous upgrades to enhance programmability, enabling developers to create more sophisticated applications with greater ease. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The improvements in programmability are the result of sustained developer efforts over recent years. These efforts have included expanding the ledger’s capabilities to support smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, while maintaining the network’s core strengths of speed and low transaction costs. EVM Sidechain is a key part of the XRPL’s progress, which recently allowed XRP support on Metamask and holds numerous advantages for the ecosystem. Vet’s remarks reflect the tangible outcomes of these upgrades, as more developers can now confidently and productively engage with the XRPL. Community Excitement for the XRPL’s Progress Many community members are excited about the progress made on the ledger over the past few years. One community member commended the developers, noting that there is significantly more to do on the ledger than in 2020. Vet agreed , recalling how the XRPL initially supported only multiple methods of wallet creation. However, with the network’s numerous features and developer-friendly design, adoption could grow significantly. A central theme in Vet’s post is the noticeable difference in the community between 2020 and 2025. The network has experienced growth across multiple dimensions: more decentralized infrastructure operators, increasing educational resources, a broader user base, and a proliferation of applications built on the ledger. This expansion is significant because it demonstrates that the XRPL attracts developers and fosters a robust ecosystem that supports long-term sustainability.

On Friday, Moody’s downgraded America’s credit rating from AAA to AA1 while changing the country’s outlook from negative to stable. Moody’s attributes the downgrade to the United States’ soaring national debt and interest payment ratios that exceed those of other countries with the same credit rating. “As deficits and debt have grown, and interest rates have risen, interest payments on government debt have increased markedly. Without adjustments to taxation and spending, we expect budget flexibility to remain limited, with mandatory spending, including interest expense, projected to rise to around 78% of total spending by 2035 from about 73% in 2024. If the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is extended, which is our base case, it will add around $4 trillion to the federal fiscal primary (excluding interest payments) deficit over the next decade. As a result, we expect federal deficits to widen, reaching nearly 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024, driven mainly by increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation. We anticipate that the federal debt burden will rise to about 134% of GDP by 2035, compared to 98% in 2024.” Moody’s latest decision strips the United States of its final Triple-A credit rating. The downgrade follows earlier moves by other major agencies: in 2011, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) lowered the US’ rating from AAA to AA+ due to concerns over the government’s inability to address rising debt levels. And in 2023, Fitch followed suit, citing persistent budget deficits and political infighting as key drivers of its downgrade.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value appears on track to confirm a ""golden cross"" in the coming days, according to charting platform TradingView. The pattern occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of prices crosses above the 200-day SMA to suggest that the short-term trend is outperforming the broader trend, with the potential to evolve into a major bull run. The moving average-based golden cross has a mixed record of predicting price trends. The impending one, however, is worth noting because it's about to occur weeks after its ominous-sounding opposite, the death cross, trapped bears on the wrong side of the market. A similar pattern unfolded from August through September 2024, setting the stage for a convincing move above $70,000 in early November. Prices eventually set a record high above $109K in January this year. The chart on the left shows that BTC bottomed out at around $50,000 in early August last year as the 50-day SMA moved below the 200-day SMA to confirm the death cross. In other words, the death cross was a bear trap, much like the one in early April this year. Prices turned higher in subsequent weeks, eventually beginning a new uptrend after the appearance of the golden cross in late October 2024. The bullish sequence is being repeated since early April, and prices could begin the next leg higher following the confirmation of the golden cross in the coming days. Past performance does not guarantee future results, and technical patterns do not always deliver as expected. That said, macro factors seem aligned with the bullish technical setup. Moody's amplifies U.S. debt concerns On Friday, credit rating agency Moody's downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating from the highest ”Aaa” to ”Aa1”, citing concerns over the increasing national debt, which has now reached $36 trillion. The bond market has been pricing fiscal concerns for some time. Last week, CoinDesk detailed how persistent elevated Treasury yields reflected expectations for continued fiscal splurge and sovereign risk premium, both bullish for bitcoin.

Despite this, a significant development has occurred with the recently launched leveraged XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Teucrium’s 2x Long XRP ETF Crosses $100 Million Notably, the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF , with XXRP as ticker, has accumulated $106 million in assets since it gained approval in April 2025. This suggests that the asset is gaining traction in the crypto space. An analysis of the data shows the fund has been recording inflows every week since its launch. According to ETF.co data, it hit a peak last week with $30.4 million in assets, marking a huge leap from the previous week, when it managed $14.1 million. The increasing inflow signals a growing demand for XRP ETFs in the broader financial market. The data is better appreciated when contrasted with other altcoins in the space. For instance, the Ethereum ETF has recorded $2.5 billion in assets since September 2024. The XXRP ETF equivalent, the 2x Solana ETF (SOLT), has only managed to register $30 million, even though it debuted two months before the XXRP ETF was unveiled. JPMorgan Predicts $15 Billion in Combined Inflows for XRP and Solana This development aligns with JPMorgan’s prediction for the two assets, Solana and XRP ETF. According to the bank’s forecast, Solana and XRP would attract about $15 billion in inflows in their first launch year. However, JPMorgan maintains that XRP would attract a larger share. This could suggest preference among potential investors in the crypto space and the broader financial market. There are speculations that this number could increase significantly in June. This is when the crypto community expects the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to decide on the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF. SEC Decision Looms as Approval Odds Rise Despite the optimism, some expect the regulatory body might delay the ETF approval again. They consider October as a possible timeline while considering the applications of Bitwise and VanEck. Others like 21Shares are also eyeing a spot XRP ETF . Polymarket traders have given XRP an 83% chance of approval in 2025, an increase from the earlier 70% chance it gave the asset.

Pyth Network ( PYTH ), an oracle protocol that connects market data owners to applications on multiple blockchains, was trading at $0.150, its lowest level since May 9 and 72% below its highest point in November last year. The main catalyst for the Pyth price will be a giant token unlock scheduled on May 20. According to CMC , the network will unlock tokens worth $333 million, or 58% of the float. These 5.66 billion tokens will be allocated to private sales, publisher rewards, ecosystem growth, and protocol development. Pyth Network has a maximum supply of 10 billion, and 36% are in circulation. After this unlock, the final two will happen in May 2026 and May 2027. You might also like: New XRP ETF hits an inflow record as XRP price wavers A token unlock is often seen as a negative catalyst for an asset because it introduces new coins into the market. If an asset does not have substantial investor demand, this can depress the price. Pyth Network is the third-biggest oracle provider in the crypto industry, with a total value secured of $8.38 billion. Only Chainlink ( LINK ) and Chronicle, which have $43 billion and $8.40 billion, are bigger. Pyth provides numerous services, such as price feeds, random numbers for smart contracts, and tools to eliminate miner extractable value (MEV). It is used by top players in decentralized finance, such as Kamino Lend, Ethereal, Suilend, and NAVI Lending. Pyth Network price analysis PYTH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the PYTH price peaked at $0.5540 in November last year and then plunged to $0.1557. It has dropped below the key support level at $0.1697, the highest swing in March and the lowest point in February. PYTH token remains below the key point at $0.2210, the lowest level in August last year. It has also moved below the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages, while the Relative Strength Index and other oscillators have pointed downwards. The outlook for the PYTH price is bearish. The next point to watch is $0.1042, its lowest level on April 7. A move above the resistance level at $0.2090 will invalidate the bearish outlook.

That’s the case with several standout projects in 2025. These platforms are attracting strong support even before hitting exchanges. Backed by serious tech, growing user bases, and confirmed listings, they’re not just passing trends. This article explores the top presale crypto contenders this year. BlockDAG, Unstaked, and Web3 ai are gaining serious attention, thanks to rising community interest and clear roadmaps. All three offer an early access window many buyers aim for before listings drive prices up. In the fast-paced world of crypto, timing can be everything. BlockDAG: $254.5M Raised and $0.0020 Price Locked Until June 13 BlockDAG is clearly leading as a top presale crypto of 2025. The project has raised over $254.5 million so far, with more than 20.6 billion BDAG coins already sold. Right now, the entry price is fixed at $0.0020 until June 13, offering buyers access at the same rate as larger participants. Once this frozen price ends, the coin is expected to trade at $0.0262 during Batch 28, marking a 2,520% gain since the first batch. Its roadmap confirms listings on 20 exchanges, including MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, BitMart, and XT.com. This early access, backed by confirmed platforms, puts it ahead of most launches. BlockDAG uses a hybrid network model that combines DAG scalability with PoW security. This allows it to handle thousands of transactions per second with very low fees. Over 1 million users have downloaded its X1 mining app, and 400,000+ users are active each day. The project also has over $7 million in miner sales with 17,568 units sold. With a $0.05 launch price ahead, market watchers expect BDAG to approach $1 this year. The strong tech, active users, and real listings make BlockDAG the top presale crypto choice for those looking to enter before prices jump. Unstaked: $6M Raised and AI Tools Shaping Web3 Growth Unstaked is making a mark as a top presale crypto with its unique AI-powered approach. The project has already pulled in over $6 million and is priced at $0.008997 in the current stage. A $1 million community giveaway has helped spark early attention, but its real strength lies in the product. Unstaked focuses on AI agents that help grow and manage Web3 communities. These tools respond to user activity, detect key trends, and reward on-chain engagement. Rather than relying on paid promotions, Unstaked is giving users control over how communities evolve. This real-world utility is helping it stand out. Unstaked is not just another crypto project promising future tools. It’s already building platforms that work today. That’s why it continues to climb the charts among top presale crypto options. Unstaked’s approach is both functional and user-first. It delivers something fresh to Web3 while helping active users take part in shaping their experience. As early buyers get in, its use of AI could set a new standard for the space. Web3 ai: $4M Raised and 3,200x Growth Potential Projected Web3 ai closes out this list of top presale crypto projects with a promising blend of live tools and major upside potential. With a current presale price of just $0.000365, its team is targeting a $1 price at launch, a possible 3,200x return. So far, Web3 ai has collected more than $4 million in funding, with $500,000 raised in just two days. These numbers show growing support from early buyers and strong backing from larger holders. The platform offers 12 AI-based tools, including scam detectors, auto-trading alerts, and portfolio tracking features. These aren’t future products, they’re ready to roll out once the project goes live. Web3 ai is building a full system to help crypto users stay ahead of the market with better data and smarter tools. Compared to other presales still in development, Web3 ai already feels built out. Its hands-on approach, combined with low entry pricing, is attracting attention across the space. As one of the top presale crypto projects in 2025, it gives early buyers a working product and a potential edge in future trading. These Presales Are Leading 2025’s Breakout Picks With thousands of launches every year, only a few make real progress. The top presale crypto projects of 2025 are doing just that. BlockDAG’s $254.5 million raise and confirmed listings, Unstaked’s functional AI ecosystem, and Web3 ai’s ready-to-use tools all show strong signs of growth. These projects are setting the tone early. They’ve raised real funds, built active communities, and developed products ready for launch. Their prices remain low for now, but that won’t last. Once listings hit, access will tighten fast. If you’re watching for early-stage value and tools that actually work, these three presales are worth tracking. They represent what serious projects look like before the rest of the market catches up.

XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are Tipped to Lead the 2025 Bull Run",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/huge-news-xrp-solana-and-magacoin-finance-are-tipped-to-lead-the-2025-bull-run/,"Introduction The early signs of a 2025 bull market are flashing across the charts, and a wave of analysts are beginning to agree on one thing: XRP, Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE , and Kaspa (KAS) could be the four altcoins poised to lead this explosive cycle. From institutional accumulation to stage-based investor frenzy, each of these projects has something unique driving their surge in momentum. And as MAGACOIN FINANCE approaches the final hours of Stage 8 , traders are beginning to ask whether this is the next big breakout before listings go live. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Could Lead the 2025 Altcoin Rally CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to build enormous traction as one of the most-watched early-stage projects of the year . With a listing target of $0.007 and aggressive accumulation from both small and large buyers, this token has become a strategic pick for those looking to 25x–35x in this cycle. What sets it apart: A narrative-driven launch that taps into powerful audience energy A structured rollout with fast-moving presale stages — Stage 8 is heating up fast Analyst sentiment growing stronger as presale demand remains high With listings on the horizon and the 2025 cycle building strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being viewed as the next high-conviction entry — and some say this could be the SHIBA INU moment of the year . XRP Pushes Toward Institutional Breakthrough XRP is making bold moves once again. Trading above $2.30 , it’s now being primed for a CME futures launch and may follow Bitcoin and Ethereum with its own ETF proposal soon after. The XRP community has long viewed the asset as more than just a token — it’s a potential backbone for global financial settlement infrastructure . If current trends hold, analysts believe XRP could blast through $5–$10 , with extended targets even higher in a full-blown bull market. And with legal clarity in place, institutional access is finally opening up — making XRP one of the top picks for high-conviction capital. Solana’s Ecosystem Growth Fuels Major Momentum Solana (SOL) remains the standout performer among Layer-1 protocols. Currently priced around $165–$180 , SOL is riding the tailwinds of explosive DeFi growth and renewed institutional curiosity. With average monthly forecasts landing in the $170–$180 range and long-term targets extending beyond $300 , Solana is quickly becoming the go-to chain for speed, scalability, and developer support. As capital rotates from Ethereum into high-speed alternatives, SOL is positioned to lead — and investors are watching closely as major whales continue to stack. Kaspa (KAS) Begins Its Climb with Bullish Forecasts Kaspa (KAS) has quietly emerged as one of the most compelling proof-of-work altcoins on the market. Currently trading near $0.13 , KAS is forecasted to potentially hit $0.65 or higher in 2025 , according to multiple analysts tracking token unlocks and on-chain signals. Its strength lies in scalability and consistent network improvements, but now it’s getting attention from traders looking to ride momentum in fresh directions. With predictions of a summer rally , KAS could be the surprise runner of Q2 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion XRP, Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Kaspa are more than just trending tickers — they’re shaping up to be the four key altcoins of the 2025 bull cycle . Each one offers a different kind of upside: infrastructure (XRP), scalability (SOL), early entry explosion (MAGACOIN FINANCE), and under-the-radar growth (KAS). But among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the token that could deliver life-changing ROI — if entered before the window closes. As Stage 8 heats up, and market momentum builds, this is the moment smart investors are locking in.

Here’s The Destination,https://timestabloid.com/kraken-moves-over-265-million-xrp-heres-the-destination/,"In a recent development that has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community, Kraken, a prominent crypto exchange, executed a substantial transfer of XRP . According to a post by Xaif on X, Kraken moved a staggering 265,582,341.90 XRP, equivalent to approximately $622.8 million, to one of its internal wallets. The transaction has raised numerous speculations about the motive behind such a large movement. BREAKING: Kraken just transferred 265,582,341.90 $XRP (~$622.8M) to one of its wallets! What’s going on here? Massive move! pic.twitter.com/1z9289fUqv — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) May 18, 2025 Details of the Transaction The transaction summary, as depicted in the uploaded image, confirms that the transfer was successful, with the ledger index recorded at 96,181,521 and the transaction sequence numbered 62,158,857. The transaction fee was a nominal 0.006 XRP, highlighting the efficiency of the XRP Ledger. The transfer destination was identified as an internal Kraken wallet, tagged with the destination tag (DT) 5824. The successful delivery of the exact amount—265,582,341.902137 XRP—further affirms the transaction’s validity. Possible Motives and Market Implications The scale of this transaction naturally sparks speculation among market analysts and XRP enthusiasts. Several hypotheses can be drawn from such a significant transfer: Internal Liquidity Management: Crypto exchanges often move large sums internally to balance liquidity across various trading pairs and to maintain sufficient reserves. Security Measures: Kraken might have transferred the XRP to a more secure wallet or a cold storage solution to safeguard the assets. Strategic Market Positioning: The timing and scale could indicate a strategic decision related to market movements or upcoming developments. However, without an official statement from Kraken, the precise rationale remains speculative. Such a large transfer can potentially affect market sentiment, especially among retail investors who may interpret it as a precursor to significant trading activity.

Regardless, the lack of an official explanation leaves room for diverse interpretations. While the reasons behind Kraken’s massive XRP transfer remain unclear, the crypto space is buzzing with speculation. Such large-scale movements often ignite curiosity and sometimes anxiety among traders and investors.

High-level investors, along with market analysts, actively seek out emerging digital assets that are poised for exceptional growth. Some major crypto projects possess the ideal combination of technical innovations and community support, which makes them viable for delivering 35x value returns by summer 2025. Five major prospects exist, each following its individual route to success. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Tokenization Titan Rexas Finance (RXS) is quickly emerging as one of the top Gen-Next altcoins. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, which rely solely on price speculation, RXS is backed by real-world utility. The project is revolutionizing the tokenization of RWAS, allowing anyone to hold fractional stakes in high-ticket assets, including real estate, art, and commodities. While global asset tokenization is forecasted to reach over $30 trillion by 2030, Rexas Finance is becoming the portal into this market. It is what sets RXS apart, however, that is its popularity with investors. The project has already raised over $48 million from its current presale, with more than 92% of its tokens sold. Such demand is indicative of a profound faith in the market. RXS will be listed on multiple Tier-1 exchanges by June 2025, and investor projections anticipate a return on investment (ROI) exceeding 100x in the long run. Even pessimistic projections place a 35x presale price increase in the near term. With its practical application in real life, phenomenal presale activity, and upcoming listings, Rexas Finance can easily become 2025's breakout altcoin. Solana (SOL): The Scalable Smart Contract Powerhouse Solana has solidified itself as a top player in the bright contract space. With its breakneck transaction speed and low gas fees, Solana has attracted a substantial number of decentralized applications, NFT solutions, and DeFi protocols. coinmarketcap Recent technological updates and network stability enhancements have helped mitigate past performance issues at Solana, and investor faith has been regained. SOL is currently at around $138 as of April 2025, significantly above its 2022 low. With more developers working on it and more users getting on board, SOL is projected by analysts to reach four-figure peaks in the next bull cycle, with a 35x pump remaining a possibility. Chainlink (LINK): The Data Oracle Backbone of Web3 Chainlink provides decentralized oracle services to enable smart contracts to access off-chain data in a trustless and verifiable way. This critical function makes Chainlink a foundation for nearly every top DeFi and blockchain project. coinmarketcap With new integrations across multiple chains and growing enterprise collaborations, Chainlink continues to expand its reach. The platform's CCIP has also raised new interest. At current prices, LINK is approximately $13.42, but most analysts project that its value will increase exponentially as data and interoperability demands surge across DeFi ecosystems. A 35x gain is well within reach by the end of 2025 if the adoption rate is sustained. Cardano (ADA): The Low-Key Innovator with Long-Term Potential The stealthy nature of Cardano, compared to Ethereum and Solana, makes it a sound long-term investment due to its academic specialization and sustainability features. The most recent upgrade Hydra has improved Cardano’s scalability and furthered its chances of mainstream adoption by increasing throughput and efficiency. coinmarketcap The current price of ADA stands at $0.6428. At the same time, investors believe its current value does not accurately reflect its fundamental development strength and its growing demand across African markets and educational sectors. ADA exhibits excellent growth potential, which could drive the price beyond $1 as the platform gains prominence. It is expected to rise between 100% and 300% to achieve a 35x value by mid-2025, regaining its position among the top five cryptocurrencies. Polkadot (DOT): The Interoperability Innovator Polkadot delivers an interoperable multichain system that empowers blockchain integration and collaboration, thus creating opportunities for new decentralized application deployment and service development. The parachain auction mechanism from Polkadot has become a highly sought-after feature, demonstrating its unique ability to achieve equilibrium between various blockchain networks. coinmarketcap Currently, DOT trades at $3.88, yet its demand for Web3 interoperable solutions positions it as an attractive investment opportunity. Analysts project that the current price of Polkadot will experience exponential growth of 20 to 35 times, as Web3 initiatives expand their operations through this platform. Conclusion: Why Rexas Finance is in the Lead Pack While all five of these cryptocurrencies possess compelling upside potential and solid fundamentals, Rexas Finance (RXS) stands out the most in terms of potential return, utility, and momentum.

The coin is currently trading at $103,592, holding firm above $100,000, a level it hasn’t touched since early May, according to data from CoinGecko. The price has moved sideways for over a week, showing bulls aren’t backing off yet and are still waiting for the next leg up. Bitcoin has also surpassed the $2.1 trillion market cap. Since May 9, Bitcoin has been caught in a tight range, stuck between sellers capping its highs and buyers defending the lows. But the fact that it’s staying above $100K says a lot. Bitcoin price chart | Source: TrradingView Traders are clearly still holding positions, waiting for a push through the $105,787 resistance. If that level gets cleared, momentum could quickly drive it toward $120,000, a target that’s now being floated by analysts watching the charts. But if the bulls fumble and Bitcoin fails to break past its old record, short-term holders could start cashing out, leaving $100,000 wide open for a breakdown. A dip under $100,703 might trigger a deeper selloff, especially if market sentiment flips fast. Arthur Hayes sees Bitcoin as exit plan from US capital walls Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of Bitmex and now chief investment officer at Maelstrom, dropped his latest macro blog where he warned that the United States, under pressure from rising debt and heavy reliance on foreign funds, is likely to turn to capital controls as an alternative to tariffs. Arthur said this is going to be the next political move because it’s easier to explain to voters than more taxes or money printing. He outlined a 2% tax on foreign-owned US assets, which he estimated total $33 trillion, as a more enforceable policy than tariffs. Arthur said this kind of tax could cover the income taxes of 90% of Americans, making it politically attractive. But the consequences, according to him, would include a retreat of foreign investment from US markets. When that happens, Arthur believes the Federal Reserve will roll out stimulus again to stop the bleeding. That’s when Bitcoin steps into the spotlight. “Bitcoin will be the best-performing asset during this period of global monetary transformation,” Arthur wrote in the post. He said that even with capital restrictions, people will still be able to move money using the internet, adding, “As long as there is the internet, you will be able to sell fiat for bitcoin.” US stock rebound drives shift toward global exposure and crypto The broader market has now fully recovered from the April selloff. Major losses have been erased, and portfolios are back in the green. But for investors who rode the US stock market through the chaos without diversifying, this rebound is being seen as a rare second chance. Many are now being told to look abroad—and some are listening. Global markets actually outperformed US stocks from January through April. For example, the VXUS ETF—which tracks international markets—has brought in over $6 billion so far in 2025. But that still looks small next to the $63 billion that’s poured into Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO) this year. That fund is on track to smash its previous annual inflow record. Despite that, analysts and portfolio managers are saying the message should be clear: investors who stayed too focused on US stocks need to balance out. Even old-school investing figures like Warren Buffett and Jack Bogle have always leaned US-centric, arguing that multinational US companies already earn revenue worldwide. But now Warren is reportedly dialing back on some of those long-held domestic bets and putting more capital into Japanese markets. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

XRP and Solana dominate the pile, but meme coins like DOGE and TRUMP are elbowing their way in. New SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who has $6 million in crypto-related investments, faces a high-stakes decision. XRP and Solana Steal the Lead in ETF Filings. Data from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reveals the numbers: 72 crypto ETF filings await SEC review. XRP ETF filings top the list with 18 applications. Solana follows close behind with 17. Together, they account for nearly half of the total pile. Why the huge number? XRP’s legal win against the SEC cleared its path, boosting confidence among ETF issuers. On the other hand, Solana’s appeal lies in its lightning-fast blockchain, processing thousands of transactions per second. These stats dwarf Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have dominated past ETF waves. Meme Coin ETFs: Risky Business? The filings take a sharp turn into meme coin territory. DOGE, PENGU, TRUMP, MELANIA, and BONK all have pending ETF applications. Some even propose 2X leveraged funds, doubling the potential reward and risk. Leveraged ETFs amplify returns but magnify losses too. Meme coins, already volatile, could turbocharge this instability. DOGE, for instance, spiked 300% in 2021, then crashed 80% the next year, according to CoinGecko. Paul Atkins is the SEC’s new chair as of January 2025. His financial disclosures, filed in late 2024, show $6 million in crypto-related investments. This hefty stake raises eyebrows. Atkins’ holdings signal a personal tie to the market he now regulates. Analysts wonder how this shapes his view on the 72 filings. The SEC’s mandate—protecting investors—remains his north star, but his portfolio adds a layer of intrigue. No specifics on his assets are public, leaving analysts to parse the implications. These ETF filings could reshape crypto’s future. Approval might draw billions in institutional cash. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, launched in 2024, pulled in $10 billion in its first six months. XRP and Solana ETFs could follow suit. But meme coin ETFs pose a dilemma. Their approval might legitimize speculative assets, luring retail investors. Critics, like SEC veteran John Reed Stark, warn of “market chaos” in a 2023 tweet. Leverage only heightens the stakes. The SEC’s track record offers clues. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs got the green light in 2024 after years of rejections. This shift suggests a thaw in regulatory frost, but meme coins may test that limit.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|SOL|Solana|trump|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-18 17:24:07

This New Crypto Coin Is Gaining Ground Fast,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-is-everyone-watching-mutm-right-now-this-new-crypto-coin-is-gaining-ground-fast/,"It’s not often that a new crypto coin enters the conversation with this much speed and consistency. But over the past few weeks, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gone from emerging project to heavily watched token, pulling in early capital and attracting attention across the DeFi space. And it’s not just hype—MUTM is gaining ground because it’s structured for real growth. Still in presale and trading at just $0.025, the token has quickly become one of the most anticipated launches of the year. With over $8.6 million raised, nearly 9,900 holders, and more than 87% of Phase 4 already completed, the pace is clear: investors are watching because they know the window is closing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) What sets Mutuum apart from the usual early-stage tokens is that it’s not launching empty-handed. The team has made it clear that the project is more than just a concept. A working beta of the platform is expected to launch alongside the token, giving users instant access to real features—starting with decentralized lending and borrowing. Mutuum allows users to deposit assets and earn interest passively, while borrowers can access liquidity without selling their holdings. What makes this model effective is its focus on overcollateralized positions, ensuring that the system remains stable and secure. Borrowers lock in more value than they take out, protecting the protocol and allowing lenders to earn reliable returns. Unlike high-risk, underdeveloped projects, Mutuum is taking a DeFi-first approach—one that’s built on generating actual protocol activity and revenue. For early investors asking what crypto to buy now, this kind of design offers more than speculative upside—it offers structure. One of the most important developments happening inside the Mutuum ecosystem is the introduction of its decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized stable assets that rely on black-box reserves or off-chain guarantees, this stablecoin will be minted directly from excess collateral provided within the platform. Here’s how it works: users who provide collateral above a specified threshold will be able to mint stablecoins pegged to the U.S. Dollar. These stablecoins can be used within or outside the Mutuum ecosystem, without ever selling the original collateral. Once repaid, the stablecoin is burned—ensuring the supply remains dynamic and always backed by real on-chain value. This isn’t just a side feature. The introduction of a native stablecoin gives MUTM deeper utility and stronger internal demand. Because all interest paid on stablecoin loans stays within the protocol’s treasury, the stablecoin actively contributes to ecosystem revenue—supporting long-term value growth. As that usage scales, so will the demand for the token, which powers the broader platform. Analysts watching these developments now point to the stablecoin’s role as a key reason why MUTM could outperform other new crypto coins in the months following its listing. The presale is moving fast. At $0.025, with Phase 4 nearly sold out, the next pricing level is locked in at $0.03. The confirmed listing price is $0.06, meaning investors who enter now are securing a 140% margin ahead of the token’s exchange debut. But what’s more important than the price shift is the combination of working utilities and strong fundamentals. Few new tokens offer both. Most either launch with no product or depend entirely on marketing to survive post-listing. Mutuum is rolling out both product and token at the same time—with smart contract development, lending infrastructure, and a native stablecoin already in place or underway. The question isn’t just “why is everyone watching MUTM?”—it’s “why wouldn’t they be?” With real DeFi mechanics, rising demand, and a growing community base, it’s clear that this new crypto coin isn’t just trending—it’s earning its momentum. For those looking to get in before attention peaks, MUTM offers a rare mix of affordability, product readiness, and forward-facing design. It’s not about hype—it’s about timing. And right now, this might be the best cryptocurrency to invest in before the market fully catches on.

At last check Sunday, Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) traded at $1.20, down 14.35% from its highest point this month. Nansen data shows that the number of savvy money investors holding the Fartcoin token dropped to 37 on Sunday, down from this month’s high of 44. These investors collectively have 727 million tokens, much lower than last month’s high of 740 million. Smart money investors are closely followed because they are often seen as more experienced and sophisticated. These investors can be institutions, funds, or individuals who have demonstrated profitable on-chain behavior. Smart money investors are likely selling Fartcoin tokens to take profits after the coin surged by almost 500% from its lowest point in April. They may also exit because they expect the token to reverse in the coming weeks. Smart money is dumping Fartcoin | Source: Nansen Another red flag for the Fartcoin token is that the number of tokens on exchanges has continued to rise in the past few days. There were 174.29 million tokens on centralized and decentralized exchanges like Raydium, Kraken, and KuCoin, a 9.48% increase from last week. Rising exchange balances are usually a bearish sign since they signal that investors are moving their tokens from their cold wallets to exchanges to sell them. Fartcoin price technical analysis Fartcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Fartcoin price surged from a low of $0.20 in March to $1.4677 earlier this month. This rally helped to spark the recent surge in Solana ( SOL ) memecoins, which helped to turn their market cap from $6 billion to $15 billion today. On the positive side, Fartcoin price remains above the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level and the 50-day moving average. However, it has also formed a rising wedge pattern, a popular bearish reversal sign in technical analysis. Therefore, the outlook is bearish if it is below the resistance point at $1.4677. A move above that level will point to more gains to $2. However, there is also a risk that the Fatcoin price will drop below $1.

While the broader trend remains in recovery mode after last week’s steep decline from above $1.40, bulls are currently testing the confluence of moving averages and short-term resistance levels, suggesting a make-or-break moment for Pi Coin price action in the coming sessions. What’s Happening With Pi Coin’s Price? After a parabolic surge that took the Pi Coin price from $0.30 to over $1.60 in less than a week, the asset witnessed a sharp retracement, losing over 50% of its gains and revisiting the $0.65–$0.70 accumulation zone. However, buyers have started to regroup near this demand region, evident from the 4-hour candles forming higher lows over the past 24 hours. Pi Network price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Pi is currently capped by the 20-EMA and lower Bollinger Band on the 4-hour chart, both aligned near $0.78. A clean break above this zone could trigger fresh upside toward the $0.85–$0.90 supply region. Until then, the short-term trend remains fragile, with resistance keeping Pi Coin price spikes in check.

Based on the asset’s performance at this level, BTC investors could expect a bullish price continuation or a significant price pullback. After a brief rise above $105,000 on May 12, Bitcoin has remained range-bound, showing no significant price movement since then. However, bullish sentiments remain high as demonstrated by US BTC spot ETFs scooping another almost $2 billion in net weekly investments.

In an X post on May 16, Crypto Patel shares a simple technical analysis on Bitcoin price movement, highlighting the present major support and resistance levels. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s most recent price gain shows the asset is retesting a critical resistance around the $106,500 price region. Notably, this resistance band has proved effective in inducing price rejections in December and January. If Bitcoin bulls can command sufficient market demand to subdue this price barrier, Crypto Patel projects the premier cryptocurrency will sustain its current uptrend with an initial price target set at $120,000. On the other hand, another price rejection could harm current investors’ expectations, as such negative development would force prices below the crucial $90,000 support zone to trade as low as the current market bottom at $75,000. This projected correction hints at a potential 27.1% decline from the present market price despite currently robust bullish sentiments. Interestingly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that Bitcoin has recently dipped from the overbought territory, thus supporting predictions of an impending price correction. However, macroeconomic developments such as the 90-day tariff truce between the US and China, and strong levels of institutional investment, boost the potential of a bullish trend continuation.

According to the prediction site, CoinCodex, investors are showing a high level of greed as indicated by the Fear & Greed Index at 74. Coincodex analysts are predicting Bitcoin to reach $127,872 in the next five days, followed by a price correction that will return prices to around $111,616. For long-term investment, the analyst projects Bitcoin to hit a valuation of $155,583 in three months and $148,167 in six months.

From institutional buyers to early-stage speculators, all signs point to a smart money rotation underway — and the focus has locked onto four specific tokens: Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE , and TRON (TRX) . Each brings a unique angle to the table: macro safety, payment utility, early-stage asymmetric potential, and network volume efficiency. But for those seeking massive ROI , one altcoin in particular is drawing the most aggressive positioning. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Backed for Major Returns MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads as one of the most-watched early-stage projects in Q2 2025 , with smart capital treating it as a strategic high-upside allocation before listings go live. The structure is simple: A hard listing target of $0.007 A unique narrative identity backed by a defined supply Analysts forecasting 25x–35x potential based on current entry levels Unlike legacy tokens that rely on broad utility narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE operates within a focused, conviction-driven ecosystem that appeals to speculators looking to repeat what early DOGE, SHIBA, or PEPE investors experienced in previous cycles. As Stage 8 accelerates , those entering now are doing so based on a structured risk-reward model, not hype. It’s this clarity that continues to attract high-risk, high-reward capital. Bitcoin Holds Ground as Institutional Confidence Grows Bitcoin (BTC) remains the anchor for all capital entering crypto — and in May 2025, it’s holding steady around $103K–$104K , with analysts targeting $150K–$250K by year-end. Following ETF approvals, BTC has moved into macro-asset territory , with family offices, hedge funds, and sovereign capital now treating it as a reserve asset. This confidence trickles down, enabling capital to flow into riskier assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE. While Bitcoin may not deliver 20,000% returns again, it is the catalyst enabling that opportunity in the altcoin space . XRP’s Derivatives and Payment Integration Fuel Demand XRP is now one of the most strategically positioned coins in the market. With price holding above $2.30 , and CME futures on the horizon, XRP is approaching its first institutional breakout moment since regulatory clarity was achieved. From a fundamentals perspective, XRP’s growing adoption in cross-border payments, liquidity provision, and institutional rails make it a favorite for analysts eyeing a move to $10–$30 in a high-volume environment. It’s not just a speculative play — it’s a settlement infrastructure layer that’s finally receiving validation from traditional finance. TRON (TRX) Maintains Its Quiet Strength in DeFi and Transfers TRON (TRX) has long operated in the background of the crypto conversation, but those paying attention know it’s one of the most practically used Layer-1 chains — particularly in stablecoin transactions. Currently priced near $0.27 , TRON remains a favorite in Asian markets and high-frequency payment corridors. Its consistent throughput, low fees, and stablecoin dominance continue to make it a resilient asset during both bull and bear phases. As speculative capital rotates into new narratives, TRON remains a quiet pillar of real-world crypto utility — one that smart money keeps holding. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion The smart money in May is not chasing hype — it’s rotating into conviction. Bitcoin provides the trust layer , XRP brings the utility and institutional bridge , TRON delivers the volume backbone , and MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the most explosive early-stage upside among them all. For those aiming to turn $1,000 into life-changing returns , only a few windows remain — and based on risk-adjusted timing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now considered the most strategic early entry of the cycle .

Over the past week, centralized digital asset exchanges have seen massive whale outflows signaling another wave of price momentum. This comes on the heels of strengthened institutional demand in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Bitcoin Metrics Are Bullish On-chain data shows a spike in trader sentiment as long-term holders move assets. Aside from several technical indicators pointing to a full recovery, Bitcoin holders are poised to reclaim the $100k mark. However, several commentators have warned against lingering risks. In the last seven days, Bitcoin whales transferred 17000 BTC from centralized exchanges to other custodians. As widely noted, this signals surging bull sentiments pointing to longer-term holdings. The large asset movement was also followed by a series of huge institutional buys reshaping the wider market. Data shows a bullish reaction from Binance whales in the last two weeks following the much-needed White House tariff lifeline. These whales correctly backed a price surge below $80k to present levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price jumped 12.3% within one week, showing strong momentum. Crypto trader Ali Martinez also noted that the digital asset leader is currently testing the yearly open above $93,500. Furthermore, the new trading volume on Binance hit a 30-day high above $62 million, highlighting fresh buying pressure. Analyst Crypto Dan cited important whale movements on the exchange, projecting positive whale movements. “ Recently, most people had shifted their view to a bearish cycle, and public interest had significantly decreased. Furthermore, with Bitcoin and altcoins in an oversold condition, the market has effectively shaken off the retail investors which means the market is now ready for a rise. I have been continuously highlighting this point through my analysis. The cryptocurrency market in 2025 is still expected to show positive movements.” Massive Rally Ahead? After the massive rally in crypto prices this week, traders speculate a wider upward movement close to peak levels earlier this year. This remains dicey as the bull confidence isn’t at those levels backing a fully-fledged altcoin season . At the moment, BTC’s price trades at $104,586, while the market cap has soared 5% to $2.07 trillion. Ethereum (ETH) is up 11% to $2,533, as traders are keen on the $2,000 level. XRP and Solana (SOL) are moving in a similar direction, clinching 9.2% and 8% inflows, respectively.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-18 17:32:23

The rally, which began after the king cryptocurrency dipped to just below $75,000 in early April, has been marked by strong accumulation phases, exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, and a cooling of sell-side pressure, pointing to sustained bullish momentum despite recent profit-taking by long-term holders. Spot Demand Outpaces Derivatives Unlike previous rallies fueled by leveraged speculation, this latest uptrend has been characterized by organic sport market accumulation. According to the Glassnode report , BTC changed hands heavily in the $93,000 to $95,000 range, which is now acting as a key support level as it coincides with the cost basis of traders who entered the market within the last 155 days. The price has respected this range amid sideways accumulation, reinforcing the “stair-stepping” structure visible on the Cost Basis Distribution heatmap. Meanwhile, derivatives markets lagged, with perpetual futures open interest dropping 10%, from 370,000 BTC to 336,000 BTC, possibly indicating a substantial short squeeze as bears were flushed out. However, funding rates remain neutral, reflecting a lack of excessive long-side leverage, something which Glassnode’s experts believe is a sign the rally could have more room to run. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows also played an important role, peaking at $389 million on April 25 before tapering to around $58 million per day. Coinbase, a preferred exchange for U.S. institutional investors, recorded consistent buying. At the same time, the sell pressure on its global counterpart, Binance, eased from $71 million per day in March to just $9 million, suggesting investors were actively buying the dip. Long-Term Holders Cash In, But Demand Remains Strong Despite the rally, long-term Bitcoin holders have started taking profits, as CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain noted in a May 15 report. According to them, the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric, which tracks dormant coins being moved, has risen to 0.6. While it shows these holders are offloading dormant BTC for profit, the metric has not reached the 0.8 zone seen during previous bull market highs. Glassnode’s own data corroborates this trend, showing that short-term holder (STH) realized profits are spiking to nearly +3 standard deviations above the 90-day average. However, the analytics firm cautioned that profit-taking has not yet reached exhaustion levels, since in past rallies, higher deviations closer to +5 were needed to deplete demand and mark local tops.

In the post, BitMEX hinted at an upcoming announcement that could have a significant impact on the XRP market. The message, which read, “Keep your eyes peeled We have some news that’s gonna have a @ripple effect on the market,” has sparked widespread speculation among XRP enthusiasts and investors alike. Keep your eyes peeled We have some news that’s definitely gonna have a @ripple effect on the market pic.twitter.com/9ImUNC2OgN — BitMEX (@BitMEX) May 17, 2025 The Ripple Effect: What Could It Mean? BitMEX’s choice of words has led many to believe that the announcement is directly related to Ripple, the blockchain company behind XRP. While the exchange has remained tight-lipped about the specifics, the playful reference to a “ripple effect” suggests that the news may involve developments that could influence XRP’s market dynamics. Several theories have emerged as the community eagerly awaits more information. Some speculate that BitMEX might be planning to expand its XRP trading pairs or introduce new derivative products involving XRP. Others believe that a strategic partnership or integration with Ripple’s technology could be on the horizon. BitMEX’s Role in the Crypto Market BitMEX, known for its sophisticated trading products, has been a key player in the cryptocurrency derivatives market. As a platform that frequently rolls out new features and trading opportunities, its hint about a major announcement naturally garners attention. Any news related to XRP, one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, would undoubtedly attract both retail and institutional interest. Ripple’s Recent Developments While BitMEX’s post remains ambiguous, it is essential to consider the broader context of Ripple’s recent activities. Ripple has been making significant strides in cross-border payment solutions and regulatory battles. The ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has seen notable progress, with XRP recently gaining legal clarity as not being considered a security. This victory has already positively influenced XRP’s price and market perception. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Speculations and Reactions The XRP community on X is rife with theories, ranging from potential trading fee reductions for XRP transactions to broader adoption initiatives. Some users expressed their hope for a listing on new trading pairs or the introduction of staking options for XRP. The community’s enthusiasm reflects the potential for significant market movement, depending on the nature of the announcement. Potential Market Impact Should BitMEX’s announcement prove to be substantial, it could result in heightened trading volume and increased market volatility. Historically, news related to Ripple and XRP has had a pronounced effect on the token’s price. Therefore, traders are advised to stay vigilant and consider potential scenarios as the exchange reveals more details. While BitMEX’s enigmatic message leaves much to the imagination, one thing is clear: the announcement could have meaningful implications for XRP holders. As the crypto space waits with bated breath, the anticipation itself underscores the influence of major exchanges in shaping market sentiment. XRP investors and traders will undoubtedly be monitoring BitMEX’s channels closely for any updates that could impact their strategies.

Analysts Say It Might Be the Final Entry",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-magacoin-finance-surpass-xrp-ethereum-and-solana-analysts-say-it-might-be-the-final-entry/,"Introduction As market momentum builds, top analysts are turning their focus to a shortlist of altcoins expected to outperform during the next leg of the 2025 bull cycle. XRP, Ethereum, and Chainlink continue to show strength — but one name is drawing particular attention for its potential to outperform them all: MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 8 nearing its end and speculation mounting about its upcoming listing, some analysts now suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the last major ground-floor opportunity of the year. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why MAGACOINFINANCE Could Outrun the Majors MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized for what it represents: a rare combination of early-stage access, explosive upside potential , and a deeply resonant identity in the political crypto space. Set to list at $0.007 , MAGACOIN FINANCE has attracted attention not only from speculative traders but also from long-term macro investors looking to diversify into asymmetric ROI vehicles . Key factors driving analyst optimism: Clear entry mechanics and a hard listing target Price trajectory models projecting 25x–35x growth A niche that sets it apart from utility-layer tokens like ETH or LINK With limited time remaining before its listing, some insiders say this is the final window for high-leverage entry before institutional capital floods in. XRP’s Repositioning as a Settlement Infrastructure Layer XRP has re-entered the spotlight thanks to regulatory clarity , upcoming CME futures integration , and speculation around ETF approval. Trading above $2.30 , XRP is widely seen as a cornerstone of global payment rails . Analysts now forecast a move toward $5–$15 in the short term, with high-end targets of $30+ if institutional adoption follows a similar path to Bitcoin and Ethereum. While XRP has scale and reputation, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something XRP cannot — early-stage entry with uncapped multiplier potential . Ethereum Maintains Its Macro Dominance Ethereum (ETH) remains the undisputed king of smart contract infrastructure. After reclaiming $2,600 , ETH has set up for a potential run toward $4,000–$6,000 , especially as ETF discussions gain steam. The recent Pectra upgrade has improved throughput and efficiency, which strengthens Ethereum’s position as the default Layer-1 platform for DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized real-world assets. Still, with Ethereum already at large-cap valuations, investors seeking exponential gains are looking down-market — directly into entries like MAGACOIN FINANCE . Chainlink (LINK) Quietly Expands Its Oracle Empire Often operating out of the spotlight, Chainlink (LINK) remains essential infrastructure for DeFi and Web3 projects. Price-wise, LINK is trading steadily, with analysts eyeing a breakout toward $20–$30 as oracles become more widely integrated across Layer-1 and Layer-2 solutions. Its recent CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) upgrade puts LINK in a prime position to serve as the bridge layer for multichain ecosystems — a function many believe will be critical as crypto scales globally. But for all its strength, LINK is not designed for 100x growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, still offers uncapped acceleration potential for those entering now. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Conclusion Ethereum is strong. XRP is validated. Chainlink is essential. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is early — and that alone makes it uniquely positioned as the most aggressive high-ROI opportunity of the current cycle. With Stage 8 nearing its end , a fixed listing price, and rising analyst confidence, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be the final major entry point before the broader market wakes up . For investors aiming to secure placement ahead of the next listing-driven surge, this may be the last and best chance to do so.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) price was trading at $103,000 on Sunday, while the recent Ethereum ( ETH ) surge hit a barrier. Looking ahead, some of the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week will be Ripple ( XRP ), Trump Coin ( TRUMP ), and Zetachain ( ZETA ). XRP in focus ahead of CME futures launch XRP price will be spotlighted this week as CME Group launches the first cash-settled futures on Monday. Futures contracts let traders bet or hedge against the future price of an asset without holding it physically. The launch of XRP futures will be important as it will allow financial services companies to launch exchange-traded funds that track it. A good example is the ProShares Bitcoin ETF, which tracks the CME Bitcoin futures. The launch comes as the XRP price remains under pressure as it dropped from this month’s high of $2.65 to $2.4 today.

Analysis shows that some of the attendees to the dinner will be foreigners, including Tron founder Justin Sun. There is a risk that the Trump Coin price will drop before and after the dinner. As the chart below shows, it has already formed a double-top pattern, a popular bearish reversal sign. An FT analysis also established that some guests have sold their coins at a big profit. More selling could intensify as some who expected to make the cut sell. Also, some of the attendees may sell their coins after the dinner ends.

On Monday, the network will unlock tokens worth $11.34 million, or 5.31% of the float. These monthly unlocks will continue in the next few years since it has a circulating supply of 828 million against a total supply of 2.1 billion coins. The unlock comes at a time when the Zetachain network is not doing well. The ZETA token price has crashed by 18% from its highest point this month, while the total value locked in its network has dropped to $26 million in January to $18 million. Pendle, Melania Meme Coin, Pyth Network, and Solana are other top crypto projects with scheduled unlocks this week. Pyth Network’s unlock of $333 million tokens will be notable as it will represent a 58% of the float.

Right now, three crypto coins to watch are making waves for different reasons. Unstaked has passed $6 million in presale funding and is gaining traction with its AI-focused setup and massive Gleam contest. Pi Network just shot up 114% on talk of a new listing, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) is flashing a rare buy signal that hints at a strong rally. This breakdown looks at how each of these projects is moving and why Unstaked could offer the biggest upside heading into 2027. Pi Network Surges: Will the Rally Keep Going? Pi Network is now at $1.28, jumping 114% in a week and 35% in the last day. The coin bounced 220% from its April low of $0.40 after weeks of flat trading around $0.75. The surge comes ahead of a big May 14 update and growing rumors of a Binance listing. Trading volume has soared to $1.4 billion, up over 150%, showing strong buyer interest. Sentiment is bullish, with 88% of the community votes expecting more gains. Pi has also broken above key moving averages. The RSI is at 85, which signals overbought levels, but that can stay high if the trend stays strong. The MACD is also turning up, which backs the move. If support holds above $1.12, targets of $1.50 and $2 come into play. A break below could send it back toward $0.90. What happens next may depend on the upcoming announcement and if listing rumors turn out to be true. Shiba Inu Shows Buy Signal as Price Eyes $0.0001 Shiba Inu (SHIB) is sending bullish signals. A weekly MACD crossover and a double-bottom pattern suggest a push toward $0.0001. SHIB is trading at $0.000016 and has gained nearly 4% in a day and 27% over the last week. After bouncing from support at $0.0000109, SHIB is now testing resistance between $0.000030 and $0.000033. A breakout there could target $0.000045 and maybe the old high of $0.000088. Despite over $1 million in liquidations, SHIB keeps climbing, showing strong spot demand. Positive funding rates and an RSI over 50 add to the momentum. The Shibarium Layer 2 network is also growing fast, with total value locked nearing $4 billion. More user activity and token burns could help power a breakout in the coming days. Unstaked Hits $6M, Builds AI Features, and Offers $1M in Prizes While Pi Network’s price spike and the recent Shiba Inu (SHIB) buy signal have drawn attention, Unstaked has been moving forward in its own way. The project has now passed $6 million raised in presale Stage 13, with each token priced at $0.00926. With a launch price planned at $0.1819, early buyers could see a 27x return. The long-term goal of $1 by 2027 could even bring returns of more than 100x. Unstaked stands out for its AI-based system called Proof of Intelligence. It tracks how users behave, what tasks they complete, and how often they stay involved. Rewards are based on this activity, aiming to push quality actions instead of short-term hype. The system avoids spam and encourages steady use of the platform. It also includes AI tools that will help users improve their yield choices and decisions. These tools are being designed to give tips without needing users to be technical experts. The UNSD token is used to vote on changes and upgrades, giving the community control over how things move forward. One reason for the growing attention is the $1 million Gleam event. It will give $50,000 each to 20 winners. To join, users need to complete tasks, refer friends, and buy at least $100 in UNSD. The contest is bringing in a large number of users and has helped build interest before the public release. With its AI tools, smart rewards, and strong early numbers, Unstaked is no longer just a presale project. It is now being seen as one of the crypto coins to watch in 2025 . What’s Driving the Buzz Around Unstaked, Pi, and SHIB Unstaked, Pi Network, and Shiba Inu are getting noticed for different reasons, but all three are part of the top group of crypto coins to watch this year. Pi Network’s price has jumped due to big hype and buzz ahead of the May 14 update. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing strong chart signals and more use through Shibarium. Unstaked is offering a mix of real features, AI-based tools, and a price that’s still low. That rare mix makes it stand out more than most presale projects. With $6 million already raised and a target of $1 by 2027, Unstaked might be the biggest long-term pick right now. Whether you’re chasing meme coins or new tech trends, these are the crypto coins to watch next.

The downgrade dragged America down one notch from its top-tier rating. It was the final confirmation that the federal government’s $36 trillion debt is now impossible to ignore. The downgrade came as Republican lawmakers pushed forward a massive tax-and-spending bill in Congress, sending mixed signals to investors already nervous about where all this is heading. The bill, dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” has not cleared key legislative steps, and investors are watching closely. President Donald Trump, now back in the White House, has called for unity around the proposal. But that hasn’t done much to calm the nerves of traders, especially as the bill could add trillions more to the national debt. The Republican-controlled House and Senate are still fighting over its final version, and it’s not clear how they plan to balance more tax cuts with any real cuts to spending. Investors question Congress’ fiscal discipline Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, warned that the downgrade might push investors to become more cautious. She said the bond market is watching “what transpires in Washington this year in particular.” Schleif added that as Congress continues to negotiate, bondholders are ready to pressure lawmakers into sticking to stricter fiscal behavior. Moody’s became the last of the major ratings agencies to pull the plug. Fitch downgraded the US in 2023, and S&P made their move all the way back in 2011. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US rates strategy at TD Securities, said the downgrade likely won’t force mass selling since most investment funds adjusted their rules years ago. But Goldberg also said the downgrade would “refocus the market’s attention” on the tax-and-spending bill being debated in Congress. Source: Reuters Meanwhile, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the bill could add around $3.3 trillion to the national debt by 2034. If temporary policies in the bill are extended, that number jumps to $5.2 trillion. Moody’s also pointed out that multiple administrations have failed to reduce deficits and that it doesn’t expect current proposals to do much to change that. Debt limit panic creeps into bond yields Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the White House is trying to keep 10-year yields from spiking. The current yield is 4.44%, which is still lower than it was before Trump returned to office. But that number could change quickly. Scott has also warned Congress that they need to raise the debt ceiling by mid-July. The US hit its borrowing limit back in January, and the Treasury has been using what it calls “extraordinary measures” to keep the government from defaulting. Without an increase, the country could run out of cash by August — the so-called X-date. That fear is already showing up in bond prices. Yields on Treasury bills due in August are higher than those due before or after, signaling that investors are worried about a potential government cash crunch. Speaker Mike Johnson has said the House hopes to vote on the bill before Memorial Day on May 26. White House rejects Moody’s downgrade as political Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House, dismissed the downgrade and said the critics are “wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump’s tariffs.” Fields claimed that the tariffs led to record investments, strong job growth, and no inflation. Steven Cheung, communications director for the administration, went even further, calling Moody’s economist Mark Zandi a political enemy of Trump. Zandi works for Moody’s Analytics, a separate part of the company, and declined to comment. Some analysts believe the final bill may not be as damaging as it seems. Barclays now projects that the deficit will grow by $2 trillion over the next ten years under the plan — a smaller number than the $3.8 trillion increase expected before Trump came back. They’re pointing to revenue from tariffs and other offsets as the reason. But not everyone agrees.

As attention shifts toward altcoins amid shifting investor sentiment, The Modern Investor (@ModernInvest), a crypto enthusiast on X, has suggested that XRP could reach $9 by September 2025. The Modern Investor posed the scenario of an over 3x surge to challenge holders, asking if they would sell their tokens if the asset hits $9. While speculative, the remark quickly gained traction on X because of the bold prediction and the potential implications for token holders. XRP goes to 9$ in September. Are you selling ? — The Modern Investor (@ModernInvest) May 15, 2025 The asset is currently trading at $2.35. At $9, XRP’s market capitalization would be around $500 billion, rivaling the likes of Mastercard, Netflix, and many other valuable companies. Higher Targets for XRP Although the $9 figure is attention-grabbing, other analysts have gone further, basing their forecasts on market dominance and capital flow assumptions. DK64Trades (@DK64Trades), for example, has argued that XRP could surpass $10 in the current cycle . He pointed out that when XRP reached $3.84 during the 2018 bull market, it held more than 31% of the total cryptocurrency market share. In contrast, its dominance was just 5% when it reached a multi-year high of $3.39 in January. XRP’s dominance has shown notable resilience in 2025 , and if it can regain anything close to its previous dominance, the implications for its valuation are significant. Regaining its dominance would send XRP to $17.80 with a $1.04 trillion market cap within the current global crypto market cap of $3.33 trillion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another prominent market voice, Capt Toblerone (@CaptToblerone), takes the analysis further. He envisions a total crypto market expansion to $35 trillion in the current cycle. If XRP were to capture $1.25 trillion of that, its price could climb to approximately $22. A shift in Bitcoin’s dominance could also aid XRP’s growth. Historical patterns show that falling Bitcoin dominance gives way for altcoins like XRP to grow significantly. The conversation has drawn in figures from outside the typical XRP circles as well. Davinci Jeremie, a long-time Bitcoin supporter, has stated that he sees a realistic path for XRP to reach $24 by the end of the year. Not all projections agree on urgency. Telegaon sees XRP hitting $9 by 2026 in very bullish conditions, and more likely by 2027. Changelly is even more conservative, expecting $9 by 2028. What unites all these perspectives is the assumption that XRP will eventually outpace its past performance. How soon that happens depends on multiple factors.

Dogecoin’s network activity surged 528% on May 13, with active addresses jumping from 74,640 to 469,477, fueled by a spot ETF filing update from 21Shares. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $8,600,000 since its presale began, selling over 481 million tokens to 10,000 holders. These cryptos offer distinct opportunities in a shifting market. Investors see Dogecoin’s speculative spark and Mutuum Finance’s DeFi utility as key drivers. This article explores why these assets are capturing attention, offering insights into their potential for savvy investors. Dogecoin’s Resurgent Momentum Dogecoin (DOGE) is riding a wave of renewed interest. A 70% spike in futures open interest, from $989 million to $1.65 billion last week, signals strong speculative bets despite a recent price dip. Spot buyers dominate, with a 90-day cumulative volume delta showing aggressive purchasing since March, a pattern that sparked a 385% rally to $0.48 in Q4 2024. Long-term holders, clutching coins for over 155 days, now enjoy a net unrealized profit/loss above 0.5, reflecting bullish sentiment. Crypto charts hint at a breakout, with analysts eyeing $0.40 if DOGE clears $0.24 resistance. Yet, its reliance on hype raises questions about sustainability, pushing investors to explore more structured options. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi promise Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project focused on lending and borrowing, enabling users to earn passive income through liquidity pools and overcollateralized loans. Its buy-and-distribute model repurchases MUTM tokens to reward stakers, ensuring steady demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in decentralized finance. Currently in phase 4 of its 11-phase presale, 87% filled at $0.025, the project has drawn 10,000 holders. Phase 5 looms, bringing a 20% price hike to $0.03, offering current investors a 20% gain. The tokenomics ensure a 140% return at the $0.06 listing price, with projections suggesting a climb to $2.50 in 2025, a 9,900% ROI. Unlike Dogecoin’s volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers stability through overcollateralized lending. Borrowers lock assets exceeding loan values, reducing default risks. This practical utility attracts investors seeking the best crypto to buy now, blending innovation with tangible returns. Innovative mechanisms driving MUTM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is enhancing investor trust. The team is finalizing a Certik smart contract audit, with results soon to be shared on social channels. A newly launched dashboard showcases the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank, fostering loyalty. The buy-and-distribute model channels platform revenue into repurchasing MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers. This creates steady demand, shielding against crypto crashes. Lenders earn interest via liquidity pools, while mtTokens, like mtETH, accrue value over time. These features position Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto for long-term gains, outshining Dogecoin’s speculative surges with structured growth. Strategic moves for Cardano investors Cardano holders are strategically stacking Dogecoin and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to balance risk and reward. Dogecoin’s ETF buzz and network activity offer short-term upside, but its meme-driven nature lacks depth. Conversely, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers real-world utility, with phase 4’s $0.025 price—up from $0.01 in phase 1—nearing sell-out. The imminent 20% jump to $0.03 and a projected $2.50 post-launch value make it a compelling crypto investment. Investors eyeing the next big cryptocurrency should act swiftly.

Source: TradingView Recall our Market Watch from this morning, which informed that BTC had returned to familiar ground at around $104,000 after a brief dip below $103,000, which allowed an anonymous whale to open a massive long position worth nearly $400 million on Hyperliquid. Live data from CoinGlass indicates that the large market participant has closed a portion of his position, which is now worth a more modest $337 million.

Now, the same expert is setting their sights on the $1 milestone this summer, and with a surprising twist. While Dogecoin captured mainstream attention as one of the best cryptos to buy in previous cycles, this analyst believes that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has the potential to hit $1 before Dogecoin, thanks to its innovative DeFi model and strong growth indicators. Currently priced at just $0.025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting investors seeking low-risk, high-reward opportunities in the DeFi market. Over $8.6 million has been raised in its presale, indicating strong investor confidence. The project is in phase 4 of its presale which has already sold over 85% and attracted more than 10,000 unique holders. For investors wondering which crypto to buy today for long-term success, this bold prediction adds a fresh perspective to the market of top cryptocurrencies poised to explode. MUTM could be the next big crypto to perform well in 2025. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale is far more than 85% through Phase 4, and the momentum is intensifying. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 20% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. By doing this the periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to the MUTM stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. mtToken System Unlocks Passive Yield With Full Liquidity Mutuum Finance brings a new innovation to mtToken features, the ability to earn yield from assets outside the normal procedure of locking them. Users are not staking, they can freely use their assets and earn passively as well, which is a valuable change to DeFi users who appreciate revenue and usability. In addition, borrowers are able to easily access USDT using the platform’s collateralized loan provision, conformed to given ratio patterns. For example, $7,000 of ETH collateral can be used to unlock $5,000 stablecoins, the process being carried out via open source smart contracts. Stable, Secure, and Built to Last Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, eschewing the collapse risks which have plagued algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is run by open-source, third-party audited smart contracts, laying a good foundation for user trust and institutional adoption. Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as the standout DeFi project of 2025, and time is running out to get in early. With over $8.6 million raised, 10,000+ holders onboarded, and Phase 4 now more than 85% sold out, the momentum is undeniable. Investors who secure MUTM at the current $0.025 price point will lock in a 20% gain when Phase 5 launches, and position themselves for a potential 140% ROI by the $0.06 listing. Backed by experts who predicted Dogecoin’s ATH, this presale window won’t stay open for long. Phase 4 is closing fast, grab your position before the price jumps.

A federal judge has asked the country’s central bank to lift the privacy on Milei’s personal bank accounts. This is part of an ongoing investigation into the LIBRA token scandal now widely known as “CryptoGate.” Judge Targets Milei’s Bank Records Federal Judge María Servini is leading the investigation. She recently told the Central Bank of Argentina to unseal President Milei’s and Karina Milei’s private financial accounts. This move is part of a broader effort to understand the financial ties between Milei and the people behind the LIBRA token, which collapsed shortly after launch. According to reports from a local news outlet, Karina Milei had meetings with some of the LIBRA co-founders before the project went public. Infact, one of the co-founders had allegedly boasted about paying the president’s sister in exchange for promotional favors. This has raised concerns about possible insider dealings. The judge had already frozen the bank accounts of three LIBRA co-founders. Now, new evidence has been added to the case. Reportedly, video footage shows the mother and sister of one of the co-founders emptying safe-deposit boxes the day after the token launch. Prosecutors are now reviewing this suspicious behavior. The Rise and Fall of LIBRA The LIBRA token started with much excitement. It got even more attention when President Milei publicly supported it, calling it a big technological step. His words made many people believe LIBRA was a good investment. However, hours after his endorsement, things went wrong. The token’s value dropped more than 90% , and millions of dollars were lost. Many investors who rushed in with high hopes ended up with almost nothing. The scandal has triggered public anger, with some calling for Milei’s impeachment and accusing him of fraud. Milei later withdrew his support for the token and claimed he was promoting it as a super technology enthusiast. President Milei and Sister Skip Legal Summons President Milei and his sister have also refused to attend a court-ordered mediation. A lawyer speaking for 25 investors requested this meeting. These investors, from Argentina and other countries, lost significant money when the LIBRA token crashed . Many are upset that they did not show up, which has made people even more suspicious. President Milei has denied involvement with the token scandal . Nevertheless, the investigation is moving quickly. The judge’s recent action requesting Milei’s financial records is a big step in the case.

In a new press release , the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia says that Eric Council Jr. – a 26-year-old man from Alabama – has been sentenced to over a year in prison for his role in the exploit, when he and others hacked the X account of the regulator a means of boosting BTC. Authorities say that Council engaged in “SIM swaps,” or attacks on a mobile phone’s Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), which stores and authenticates unique user data and allows cellular devices to connect to mobile networks. Prosecutors say that on January 9th, 2024, Council and others SIM-swapped the cell phone of a person associated with the SEC’s official X account to make a fake post and manipulate the price of BTC. To pull off the scheme, Council created a fake ID card to trick AT&T store employees into giving him a replacement SIM card linked to the victim’s phone line. He then purchased a new iPhone, inserted the new SIM card and proceeded to reset the password of the SEC’s X account and shared the information with his co-conspirators before returning the phone for cash. One of the crew members subsequently made a fake post using the official SEC account about how the regulatory agency had approved BTC-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which at the time were highly anticipated and pending approval. Following the post, BTC’s price rose by $1,000. However, after the SEC regained control of its account and confirmed that the post was fraudulent, BTC dipped by $2,000. As stated by US Attorney Jeanine Pirro, “Schemes of this nature threaten the health and integrity of our market system. SIM swap schemes threaten the financial security of average citizens, financial institutions, and government agencies.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

With the move, it became the latest company to get licensed under the Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework. According to Circle Senior Director for EU Strategy and Policy, Patrick Hansen, who shared the development on X, the firm is now authorized to custody crypto assets, execute orders, receive and transmit orders, and provide crypto transfers on behalf of clients. The license allows Trade Republic to offer all these crypto services throughout the 30 European Economic Area (EEA) countries. However, it would still rely on trading platforms and market makers to execute trades. Hansen described the move as evidence of how financial institutions in the region are already making efforts to get licensed under the MiCA before the transition period ends. He said: “The race is on: neobanks, brokers, other fintechs, and even traditional banks are all moving quickly to secure their MiCA licenses before transition periods end.” The transition period for the unifying crypto regulation for Europe is when crypto entities can operate without MiCA licenses in the EU. It is expected to end by the start of July 2026 or until the regulator grants or refuses authorization for companies that have applied. Trade Republic is one of the leading online brokers in Europe, with over 100 billion in assets under management and eight million customers across several European countries. It expanded to Italy earlier this year. 25 companies have secured MiCA licenses Meanwhile, Trade Republic getting authorization to offer crypto services by BaFIN means that 25 companies have now gotten licenses under the MiCA framework. This highlights how slow the licensing process has been in Europe, given that MiCA went into full force in December 2024. There have been concerns that the region’s regulatory approach may harm its efforts to attract crypto entities, especially when other regulators in Asia, the US, and the Middle East have become more permissive of the industry. However, it appears companies are still making efforts to comply with the new regulatory standards in Europe. Interestingly, the German financial regulator is leading in approval rate, with the BaFIN licensing nine out of the 25 countries. Hansen noted that this is 36% of all regulating crypto service providers on the continent. So far, the biggest name to have secured a license appears to be Circle , the issuer of USDC stablecoin. The company remains the only MiCA-licensed global stablecoin issuer after getting authorization as an electronic money institution from France’s ACPR, allowing it to issue USDC and EURC. Other crypto firms that have obtained licenses include OKX, BitGo Europe, MoonPay, Hidden Road, Socios.com, and BitStaete have also secured licenses. Interestingly, Ripple recently bought Hidden Road, likely to gain easier access to the European markets. Potential impacts of MiCA on the European crypto sector While a few major crypto companies already have MiCA licenses, others, such as Binance, Kraken, Robinhood, and Tether, are currently not licensed in the region. Although most of them have started the application process, there is a risk that some of these companies may not operate in Europe. Tether, for instance, has already decided against getting a MiCA license for its USDT stablecoin, claiming that the requirements are dangerous for stablecoins. This has made MiCA-compliant platforms in the region that delist USDT. However, it is not just the big companies that this affects. Some experts believe that MiCA could leave lasting damage on the crypto startup scene in Europe as most startups may not meet the licensing standards or be able to bear the cost of the process. Crypto attorney Ilja Nikiforov predicted that around 75% of European registered crypto companies would lose their registration by mid-2025 if they cannot get a MiCA license. He added that funding for European crypto startups has declined by more than 90% from the 2022 peak. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Account holders accused the bank of purposefully blocking them from accessing higher interest rates in their savings accounts. Specifically, the bank is accused of misleading clients by not telling them about higher-yielding 360 Performance Savings accounts. This allegedly prevented customers from accessing better interest rates, keeping their 360 Savings account rates as low as 0.3%. The settlement, first reported by Reuters, will require a judge’s approval. It allocates $300 million to compensate depositors for interest they could have earned on 360 Performance Savings accounts, which offered rates up to 4.35% last year. The remaining $125 million will provide additional interest to depositors who currently hold 360 Savings accounts, addressing the lower rates they received. The agreement, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, covers customers with 360 Savings accounts since September 18, 2019. Capital One, based in McLean, Virginia, did not admit wrongdoing and has not released a statement on the settlement at time of publishing.

Recent reports highlight how Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM), two major blockchain-based payment platforms, are making considerable strides in providing instant remittance services in Malaysia. A recent X post by SMQKE emphasized the critical role these blockchain networks play in enhancing payment efficiency and accessibility. Ripple and Stellar —> Providing Instant Payment Remittance services in Malaysia pic.twitter.com/VrvJJxjTJP — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) January 28, 2025 Ripple (XRP) and Its Role in Cross-Border Payments Ripple (XRP) is renowned for its partnership with over 100 banks worldwide, forming a robust network that facilitates seamless cross-border transactions. The platform’s primary goal is to eliminate intermediaries in the payment process, allowing for quick and cost-effective international transfers. By leveraging blockchain technology, Ripple ensures that transactions between banks are completed almost instantaneously, significantly reducing processing time and transaction fees. In Malaysia, the adoption of Ripple’s technology for remittance services is driven by the need for a more efficient and affordable way to transfer funds across borders. The integration of XRP into financial ecosystems supports the seamless exchange of currency, with funds being converted to XRP and subsequently to the local currency within seconds. This feature has proven particularly valuable for migrant workers sending money back to their families. Stellar (XLM) and Financial Inclusion Stellar (XLM) takes a slightly different approach, focusing on providing financial inclusion to underserved communities. Unlike Ripple’s strong banking partnerships, Stellar operates as a non-profit organization aiming to reach economically marginalized areas. The platform facilitates low-cost transactions and supports unbanked individuals by enabling peer-to-peer payments without requiring a traditional banking infrastructure. In Malaysia, Stellar’s presence is growing as more remittance companies adopt its technology to offer quicker, more affordable cross-border payment solutions. The network’s ability to process transactions in real time while maintaining minimal costs aligns well with the financial needs of both rural and urban communities. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Real-World Implementation: Mobile Money and bKash An important milestone for blockchain remittance services in Malaysia came earlier this year when Malaysian remittance company Mobile Money partnered with Bangladesh’s remittance company bKash to utilize RippleNet for cross-border payments. This collaboration facilitates remittances amounting to approximately $1.82 billion annually between the two countries. Through RippleNet, funds are transferred efficiently, enabling faster and cheaper transactions compared to conventional methods. This partnership demonstrates the practical application of blockchain technology in cross-border remittances , particularly for populations heavily reliant on sending and receiving money internationally. As Ripple’s network continues to expand, more companies are expected to leverage its ecosystem to streamline their payment services. The adoption of Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM) in Malaysia underscores the growing acceptance of blockchain solutions in the financial sector, especially for international remittances. By enabling fast, reliable, and cost-effective transactions, both platforms are contributing to the modernization of the global payment infrastructure. As financial technology continues to evolve, Ripple and Stellar remain at the forefront of innovation, bridging the gap between traditional banking systems and the digital economy.

MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Booming as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Slow Down",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/dont-miss-this-magacoin-finance-is-booming-as-bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-slow-down/,"Introduction Bitcoin is holding steady. Ethereum is consolidating. XRP has cooled off. But one altcoin is showing no signs of slowing — and smart investors are now zeroing in before the rest of the market catches up. MAGACOIN FINANCE , along with utility-focused projects like HBAR , is showing powerful momentum as May unfolds. With Stage 8 nearing completion , MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being called the only major token still in breakout mode . Here’s why the capital is shifting — and where it’s going next. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Booming as the Market Pauses CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST While larger tokens are stalling, MAGACOIN FINANCE is accelerating. With a firm listing target of $0.007 and Stage 8 reaching critical demand , the project is now being viewed by analysts as a top-tier early-stage entry — especially for those seeking 25x–35x upside in the current cycle. What’s driving the shift: Structured tokenomics with limited entry windows High conviction positioning ahead of exchange listings A differentiated brand identity that stands out from typical meme or Layer-1 assets MAGACOIN FINANCE is booming not because of hype — but because its structure supports real capital rotation from slow-moving assets . As Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP cool off, buyers are moving into opportunities with visible upward runway — and MAGA fits that criteria better than most. Bitcoin’s Slow Climb Sets the Market Tone Bitcoin (BTC) is still commanding the narrative — but its momentum has slowed. Trading in the $103K–$104K range, BTC is consolidating while ETF inflows stabilize. This is typical mid-cycle behavior. But during these quiet BTC phases, capital usually seeks faster-moving altcoins . As Bitcoin holds the base, early-stage entries like MAGACOIN FINANCE gain attention as shorter-term ROI vehicles . Bitcoin remains the macro anchor — but right now, the velocity is elsewhere. Ethereum Awaits Its Next Catalyst Ethereum (ETH) is locked in a waiting game. With price hovering near $2,600 , ETH is holding steady, but investor appetite is fading in the short term. The next big movement likely hinges on ETF approvals or another Layer-2 breakthrough. In the meantime, investors are rotating some ETH capital into early-stage coins with sharper growth potential . MAGACOIN FINANCE is now showing up in those rotations — especially for those seeking momentum during this holding phase. HBAR Shows Quiet Strength Amid the Shift While many large caps are cooling, Hedera (HBAR) has maintained a surprisingly bullish structure. Currently trading around $0.21 , HBAR recently posted a strong breakout from its earlier consolidation range. Its strength lies in enterprise partnerships and network reliability — and now, it’s being mentioned alongside MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the few tokens that hasn’t lost momentum in May. HBAR may not move as aggressively, but it represents the utility-based, low-volatility pick complementing higher-risk plays like MAGA. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Conclusion The slowdown in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP isn’t bearish — it’s transitional. But while the majors pause, capital is moving — and it’s moving into high-upside early plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE and undervalued utility leaders like HBAR . With Stage 8 nearly complete and MAGA continuing to gain traction, this may be the last opportunity to get in before listings reshape the price range entirely . In a market where timing matters more than ever, the shift is clear — and the next move may already be underway.

Since then, Solana’s price action on the 4-hour chart hasn’t given a clear direction, with the cryptocurrency pulling back to retest a key support zone near $166. Related Reading: Analysis: Crypto Heats Up As $35 Billion Enters Market In Under A Month At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $169.43, up slightly by 0.70% on the day, as it attempts to defend this crucial support level and build a foundation for another upward move. Interestingly, a technical outlook on the TradingView platform has pointed to the paths Solana might take in the coming days. $166 Support Holds Repeated Tests, Break Above $177 Or $183 Will Be Bullish According to a recent analysis posted by TradeCityPro on TradingView, the $166.82 level is serving as a key short-term pivot for Solana. After a bullish leg that began at $142.25 and extended to $177.51, the asset experienced a fake breakout attempt beyond that resistance and was swiftly rejected at $183.86. This rejection brought the price back below $177.51 and into a retest of the $166.82 region. Notably, this support level has been tested twice so far and has held firm. The 4-hour chart is showing strong bullish candles forming around $166, which is an indication of a strong buying interest at this price level. Keeping this in mind, a breakout above either the $177.51 or $183.86 resistance would be the go ahead for a long position, especially if accompanied by the formation of a higher low and higher high beforehand. Until such a breakout occurs, the current setup is one of indecision. A successful breach and daily close above $177 backed by rising volume would likely set the stage for another move toward the $190 to $200 region for Solana. Chart Image From TradingView Short Trade Also Valid Below $166 Support Zone Market volume, however, has declined from last week’s levels. At the time of writing, Solana’s 24-hour trading volume is $2.3 billion, a 36.15% decrease from the previous 24-hour timeframe. As such, a new wave of momentum will be required to drive Solana through the resistance levels at $177 and $183. For now, the Solana price is consolidating tightly above $166, and failure to hold this level could open the door for a retest of the deeper $142.25 support.

Given how the price reacted from this level earlier on April 30 and on May 6, it is expected to act as a strong support again if tested. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $171. up by 1.6% in the past 24 hours.

Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,696.64 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB’s price faced strong buying pressure toward $647.3. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.93 percent of value if looked from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,696.64 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, a level it continues to maintain above in May.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-18 19:06:00

The Moscow Zamoskvoretsky District Court approved a request by investigators to place Smerkis under arrest, according to state news agency TASS. He is under investigation by Article 159 of the Russian Criminal Code, which pertains to fraud. The type of charges remains unspecified and thus subject to speculation within both legal and crypto circles. The arrest was formally sanctioned by the court, showing that prosecutors believe that there is sufficient initial evidence to support detention. Smerkis has not issued a statement on the case in the public sphere. Sudden Departure from Blum One day prior to news of the arrest, Blum shared on social media that Smerkis had officially resigned as co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer. “Smerkis no longer involves in the project development or any co-founder position,” the company posted on X (formerly Twitter). The company posted a second statement, thanking him for the work done on the project and reassuring users that its everyday business and development would go on as normal. The timing of the announcement having been made at this point, shortly prior to his arrest, is what brought eyebrows in terms of whether the two incidents are connected or the company had prior knowledge of the probe. What Is Blum? Blum is a Telegram-integrated tap-to-earn (T2E) crypto mini-app that combines gamified earning mechanics with decentralized exchange (DEX) functionality. Created by a team that includes several former Binance executives, Blum seeks to make crypto trading easier and more fun for new and younger consumers. The app is founded on the concept of earning cryptocurrency via meaningful activities and aspires to bring forth a middle ground between casual use of cryptocurrency and higher-level trading. Legal Issues Cast Shadow The arrest of Smerkis is extremely troubling to the Blum project and its backers, even though the company has attempted to distance itself from it. Article 159 of the Russian Criminal Code, on which Smerkis is being charged, relates to grand fraud and carries the weight of severe punishment. The generality of information regarding the charges does raise doubts as to whether charges relate to his activity at Blum, Binance, or other commercial undertakings. So far, neither the Russian authorities nor Blum representatives have issued additional statements. The crypto community is watching to see what comes next regarding a case that could have additional ramifications for Russian-based high-level crypto business leaders.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-18 19:06:24

Binance was once considered a risky venture, yet it has grown into a leading cryptocurrency exchange. Similarly, Helium (HNT) began with modest expectations and has since achieved significant milestones. These examples highlight the importance of recognizing potential in emerging projects. Now, a new contender, Qubetics ($TICS), is making waves and could be among the top cryptos for significant returns. Qubetics is currently in its 34th presale stage, offering $TICS tokens at $0.2532. The presale structure includes a 7-day cycle with a 10% price increase at the end of each stage, incentivizing timely participation. This approach provides an opportunity for early adopters to engage with a promising project at an advantageous stage. Qubetics’ innovative Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace is setting the stage for the future of digital finance, offering users a platform that bridges the gap between traditional finance and the blockchain world. Qubetics: A Missed Opportunity Among Top Cryptos for Significant Returns Early participants in Qubetics’ presale secured $TICS at just $0.01 when it quietly launched in September 2024. Since then, multiple low-price stages have passed, each offering substantial growth potential for those who recognized early value. Currently, in Stage 34, $TICS is priced at $0.2532, with over $17 million raised and more than 512 million tokens sold to over 26,400 holders. With its strategic structure and rising demand, Qubetics has emerged as one of the top cryptos for significant returns , giving the community a chance to join a presale that’s steadily gaining institutional and retail attention. Investing at the current price presents compelling ROI projections that position Qubetics ahead of many other contenders in the market. For instance, a $2,000 investment could yield approximately $7,896 if $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, translating into a 294.84% ROI. Should the token achieve $10 after the mainnet launch, the same investment could grow to around $79,684, marking a 3,848.42% ROI. These numbers clearly demonstrate why Qubetics is gaining recognition as one of the top cryptos for significant returns, especially for those seeking early entry into a project with long-term growth potential and real-world use cases. Qubetics’ Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace enables users to tokenize tangible assets such as real estate, art, and commodities. This platform allows individuals and businesses to buy, sell, and trade these assets in a decentralized and secure manner. For example, a small business owner needing quick liquidity can tokenize equipment or property, accessing funds without selling the assets outright. This innovation opens up markets previously reserved for the elite, providing broader access to investment opportunities. Helium (HNT): Reflecting on Past Opportunities Helium (HNT) launched its ICO in 2019, initially priced at approximately $0.27. The project aimed to create a decentralized network for IoT devices, allowing them to communicate and share data across the network. By November 2021, HNT reached an all-time high of $55.22, showcasing substantial growth from its initial offering. Despite its impressive rise, HNT has experienced significant volatility, a common trait in the cryptocurrency market. The token’s value has fluctuated due to various factors, including market dynamics and technological developments. Nevertheless, Helium’s journey underscores the potential for substantial returns when investing in innovative crypto projects at an early stage. Seizing the Moment: Top Cryptos for Significant Returns Reflecting on the trajectories of Binance and Helium, it’s evident that early skepticism can overshadow potential opportunities. Qubetics ($TICS) is currently presenting such an opportunity, with its innovative approach to asset tokenization and a structured presale model. As the project progresses towards its mainnet launch in Q2 2025, engaging with this top crypto presale could position participants to benefit from one of the top cryptos for significant returns. Embracing such prospects requires foresight and a willingness to act before the broader market fully understands what’s taking shape.

According to Durov, a Western European government, which he hinted at with a baguette emoji, approached the platform and requested it censor conservative voices, which he flatly denied. Durov wrote in a May 18 Telegram post : ""You can't 'defend democracy' by destroying democracy. You can’t 'fight election interference' by interfering with elections. You either have freedom of speech and fair elections — or you don’t. And the Romanian people deserve both."" The Telegram founder is an ardent defender of free speech , who is highly regarded in the crypto community for his stances on freedom of expression, autonomy, privacy, and individual liberty. Source: Pavel Durov Related: Pavel Durov says Telegram would exit markets before betraying users Durov thrust into the spotlight following arrest in France Pavel Durov was arrested in France in August 2024, sparking widespread condemnation from the crypto community and free speech advocates worldwide, who accused the French government of orchestrating a politically-motivated arrest . French President Emmanuel Macron denied the arrest was political while claiming the French government was ""committed to freedom of expression and communication"" in an August 26 X post . ""You can't keep founders personally liable, and charge them up to 20 years, for not moderating speech, and at the same time claim you are deeply committed to freedom of expression,"" Helius Labs CEO Mert Mumtaz wrote in response to Macron. Shortly after Durov's arrest, Chris Pavlovski, the CEO of Rumble — a free speech online video platform — announced that he safely departed the European Union after France threatened Rumble. The CEO also criticized the French government for the arrest of the Telegram co-founder, characterizing it as an attempt to pressure him into censoring speech on the platform. Durov maintains that Telegram complies with lawful information requests made by law enforcement officials and said that the company has a legal representative in France who handles such requests. The Telegram co-founder also criticized the French government for bypassing the legal representative and choosing to issue an arrest warrant instead.

The real problem is that the company he built is clearly lagging. The structure, the strategy, the way it moves — all of it feels frozen in time while the rest of the global finance world is changing to real-time crypto plays, high-frequency ETF flows, and tech-powered decisions. Warren confirmed his retirement two weeks ago at the annual meeting, and Omaha World-Herald reported he will no longer take the stage at future gatherings. Instead, his successor, Greg Abel, will front the 2026 event on May 2. Warren, who started using Berkshire in 1965 to build his investment vehicle, has managed to grow the share price at 20% per year for 60 years. That’s twice the S&P 500. But the way he did it simply doesn’t work anymore. In the Financial Times , Terry Smith, CEO of Fundsmith, wrote , “I shall not look upon his like again,” after breaking down why no one will be able to repeat Warren’s record. Berkshire’s advantage was float and leverage, not just stock picks Terry said Warren’s real edge came from his understanding of float, the ability to invest other people’s money before it was needed. The first time Warren saw this was with American Express. Back when travelers used paper cheques, they’d buy more than they needed before a trip. That meant Amex had extra cash sitting idle — cash that could be invested. He saw the same thing in Blue Chip Stamps, a company Berkshire took over. Supermarkets had to buy loyalty stamps in advance before giving them to customers. That money sat on the books as float. Warren Edward Buffett. Source: Warren Buffett Twitter/X Warren, with help from Charlie Munger, who died in 2023, used these lessons to fuel his real leverage: insurance. Companies like Geico gave Berkshire upfront premiums every year. As long as underwriting didn’t blow up, the cash was a free loan. That gave Warren firepower, and he used it. On average, he leveraged Berkshire’s portfolio at 1.6 to 1. Not with loans, but with cash that wasn’t technically his. And because he controlled a closed-end company, he didn’t face the pressure most fund managers do when performance dips. Terry pointed out that most fund managers don’t control their funds. They answer to boards and impatient investors. When performance drops, those investors flee or demand buybacks or management changes. Warren never had to deal with that. He could underperform for years and never blink. No one will be allowed to do this again Terry made it clear that this setup won’t be allowed again. Regulators today would never let one man control an insurance empire and throw premiums into equities. They’d demand investment-grade bonds. The fund structure is also dead. The world now pours into ETFs, open-ended funds that price throughout the day and react in real time. That structure makes it impossible to ignore short-term losses, and investors won’t wait around for multi-year strategies to pan out. He also took a shot at the dividend myth. People love to say most equity returns come from dividends. But Berkshire has paid only one, a single 10-cent dividend in 1967 worth $101,755 total. If that payout had been reinvested into Berkshire stock, it would be worth $4.8 billion now. Warren saw the math and shut dividends down forever. Berkshire is now hiding another stock while the market guesses While all this plays out, Berkshire is adding another unknown stock to its portfolio — quietly. A new SEC filing confirmed that the company is requesting confidential treatment again. That allows them to build a large position without moving the price. It’s not the first time. In late 2023 and early 2024, Berkshire kept its Chubb stake under wraps until the buying was complete. That position is now worth around $8 billion. They did the same with Chevron and Verizon back in 2020. This time, the 10Q filing shows a $2 billion jump in “commercial, industrial and other” stocks, plus a $1.1 billion increase in “consumer products.” That’s all the public knows. But Berkshire also doubled down on Constellation Brands, and increased bets on Domino’s Pizza, Pool Corp., and aerospace contractor Heico. Greg Abel, who has been tapped as the next CEO, told the Omaha World-Herald that the 2026 annual meeting will still take place in Omaha on May 2. But Warren won’t be up there. He’ll be in the audience with the board — a quiet exit from the spotlight after six decades of dominance. While the world moves into crypto, ETFs, and 24/7 markets, Berkshire is still quietly building its next big secret play. The problem is, the game has changed — and Warren’s playbook is stuck in the past. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Notably, crypto analyst Amelie recently shared on X, “XRP IS GETTING READY FOR A BREAKOUT. NEXT WEEK WILL BE FIRE. PREPARE FOR A NEW ALL-TIME HIGH!” This sentiment echoes across the crypto community, with various analysts and traders highlighting bullish indicators for XRP in the coming days. #XRP IS GETTING READY FOR A BREAKOUT NEXT WEEK WILL BE PREPARE FOR A NEW ALL-TIME HIGH! pic.twitter.com/bNLUHE5YYb — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 18, 2025 Technical Indicators Point to Imminent Surge XRP’s current trading patterns suggest a potential upward trajectory . Analyst Captain Faibik notes that XRP has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, a formation that often precedes a significant price movement. The key breakout level is identified at $2.50, with a potential surge targeting the $3.70 resistance level. Supporting this outlook, the Stochastic RSI shows a bullish crossover, indicating strengthening upward momentum. Further reinforcing this bullish sentiment, technical analyst Dark Defender observes that XRP has broken through a key descending trendline, signaling renewed bullish momentum. With XRP trading at $2.72 after a 15% price jump, the next targets are set at $5.85 and $8.76 , contingent on securing a daily close above $2.52. Historical Patterns and Analyst Predictions Drawing parallels to past market behaviors, analyst EGRAG CRYPTO highlights that XRP’s recent breakout past the “Final Wake-Up Line” signifies a confirmed multi-year trend reversal. Based on Fibonacci extension levels, projections place XRP’s targets at $9.5, $17, and $27. This analysis suggests that XRP is entering what is termed the “Blue Ocean” zone, characterized by limited historical price action and potential for rapid movement once initial resistance levels are breached. Market Sentiment and On-Chain Metrics Beyond technical charts, on-chain metrics provide additional insights into XRP’s potential breakout. Analyst Ali Martinez reports a 620% increase in active XRP addresses, jumping from 74,589 to 462,650. Such a significant rise in network activity often precedes substantial price movements, indicating heightened investor interest and engagement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Macroeconomic Factors and Institutional Interest Macroeconomic indicators also play a role in shaping XRP’s bullish outlook. The expanding global M2 money supply, coupled with the Federal Reserve’s renewed monetary policies, creates favorable conditions for crypto assets. Analyst Edo Farina emphasizes the correlation between the M2 money supply and crypto rallies, suggesting that XRP could be poised for significant gains shortly. Moreover, Ripple’s recent $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road , a platform processing over 50 million transactions daily, underscores the company’s commitment to expanding XRP’s utility and demand. If a fraction of these settlements transition to the Ripple ledger (XRPL), it could generate massive transaction volumes, potentially driving XRP’s price higher. As XRP currently trades at $2.40, the convergence of technical indicators, historical patterns, on-chain metrics, and macroeconomic factors paints a compelling picture for a potential breakout. While the crypto market remains inherently volatile, the prevailing sentiment among analysts and traders suggests that XRP is on the cusp of a significant upward movement. Investors and enthusiasts will be closely monitoring the asset’s performance in the coming week, anticipating whether it will indeed reach new all-time highs as predicted.

44781641,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=166807,1747596600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/44781641.jpeg,"Bitcoin’s Path to $500K: Why Ethereum, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are the Top Watchlist Picks",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoins-path-to-500k-why-ethereum-xrp-and-magacoin-finance-are-the-top-watchlist-picks/,"Introduction As Bitcoin sets its sights on $500,000 , a growing number of analysts are calling this the most structured and capital-driven bull cycle in crypto history. But while Bitcoin remains the anchor, smart investors are also looking for the tokens best positioned to outperform BTC itself . That shortlist now includes Ethereum (ETH), XRP , and early-stage breakout candidate MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — each offering a different angle: infrastructure, payments, and high-momentum entry. Also catching attention is the TRUMP-themed altcoin trend, which reflects a broader shift toward narrative-driven investing. But only one token in this group still offers true pre-listing entry . Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Called the Final Major Entry of 2025 CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the top watchlist pick among early-stage investors , especially as Stage 8 nears its final phase and exchange listings approach. With a locked listing price of $0.007 , MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering something rare in this market: Clear structure and upside model Projected 25x–35x ROI range from current entry A politically charged brand that cuts through noise and fuels demand Unlike larger caps, MAGA still gives investors the chance to enter before major catalysts , and analysts are treating it as a ground-floor play that mirrors early DOGE or SHIBA entry mechanics — only this time, with tighter supply and price transparency. As Bitcoin lifts the entire market, capital continues rotating into MAGA as one of the only tokens offering 2021-style breakout potential in a mature 2025 landscape. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Strength and ETF Momentum Ethereum (ETH) has regained its strength as crypto’s technical foundation. With the recent Pectra upgrade complete and ETF speculation swirling, ETH is trading near $2,600 , with analysts targeting a breakout to $4,000–$6,000 in the coming months. What makes Ethereum a standout now is its infrastructure-level utility — powering nearly every major DeFi, NFT, and Layer-2 ecosystem. And with institutional access just a catalyst away, many believe ETH will run alongside BTC’s move to $500K, if not lead it at certain moments. For those balancing risk across different time horizons, Ethereum offers a layer of stability in a volatile market — while also serving as a capital springboard into more aggressive altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP Maintains Its Role as Institutional Liquidity Leader XRP continues to hold above $2.30 , supported by legal clarity, increasing use in real-world payments , and the potential for CME futures integration. Now viewed by analysts as the infrastructure layer for digital liquidity , XRP is positioned to benefit as new financial rails are built globally. Short-term forecasts put XRP at $5–$15 , with longer-term price models placing it above $30 if ETF approval and institutional inflows accelerate. As Bitcoin carves a path to $500K, XRP remains one of the only large caps with regulatory clarity and defined real-world utility — giving it continued credibility among both retail and institutional players. TRUMP-Themed Tokens Reflect the Political Shift in Crypto While not a traditional asset class, the rise of TRUMP-themed altcoins is notable. These coins are tapping into a massive base of politically motivated investors and retail traders looking for tokens that represent more than technology. Although speculative in nature, these tokens show that narrative and identity are becoming as powerful as fundamentals in driving altcoin demand. That said, not all politically themed coins are created equal. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE stand apart because they pair cultural narrative with a clear tokenomics structure and strategic rollout , giving them stronger staying power. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion Bitcoin’s road to $500K is setting the macro tone , but the real opportunities lie in where the capital flows next . Ethereum and XRP bring strength and scale, while politically charged trends continue to influence retail behavior. But among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the only token currently offering true early-stage upside , a transparent growth path, and price levels that haven’t yet caught up with market potential. With Stage 8 nearly full and listings approaching, this may be the final major entry point before MAGACOIN FINANCE joins the top tier of traded tokens .

Hyperliquid (HYPE) has continued to see liquidity in the market as its momentum keeps rising. While all eyes are glued to Hyperliquid (HYPE), investors are quietly turning their attention to the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale , with stage one set to end with a landmark amount of investment. 80% Bonus Tokens – Code: FLOPPY80 Investors Flock To Hyperliquid (HYPE) As Top Choice For Perps Trading Hyperliquid (HYPE) is emerging as a disruptive force in the perpetual swaps market, drawing growing investor attention. Hyperliquid’s (HYPE) open interest (OI) in Bitcoin perpetuals recently topped $1.8 billion, outpacing even Deribit’s $1.14 billion, according to Velo data , marking a significant milestone. User growth has followed suit. Since April’s market rebound, daily active users on the Hyperliquid (HYPE) have surged by 900%, jumping from 200 to over 2,000 in just weeks. Meanwhile, the native Hyperliquid (HYPE) token has climbed more than 170% over the same stretch. Technically, a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders pattern is forming on the daily chart, suggesting a potential surge toward $45. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Sets a New Standard for Meme Coins in Crypto FloppyPepe (FPPE) may seem like just another meme coin capitalizing on the current excitement. However, this token has transformed the conversation around meme coins with its distinct features and strategy. Additionally, this project has established collaborations with prominent internet brands and has an active gaming ecosystem that is currently in beta. Furthermore, Floppynomics generates supply pressure, and its rapidly growing community has set the stage for a possible breakout rally. The project places a high priority on the safety and well-being of its community, having completed a SolidProof audit and implemented stringent cybersecurity measures. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Early Investors Positioned for Huge Gains from Ground Level FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) presale pricing positions it in the same realm of “cents on the dollar” that originally drew supporters to today’s top cryptocurrencies. With a low market capitalization, this meme coin offers an unmatched opportunity for expansion: a simple $1,000 investment now could potentially yield returns of at least $10,000 once the token launches. This is an exceptional chance for investors eager to capitalize on the growth potential of meme coins, particularly in contrast to other investments that are less affected by economic volatility. Integrating AI: The Smart Move for Crypto Market Dominance This token has integrated AI agents into its structure, positioning it favorably in the changing landscape of the cryptocurrency market. While other meme coins depend on their community engagement or favorable market conditions for growth, this platform uses tools like Meme-o-Matic , FloppyX , and particularly FloppyAI to operate in real time. This AI tool guarantees that FloppyPepe (FPPE) content remains relevant in the rapidly changing crypto environment. What FloppyAI Can Help With: Offer updates and insights about the project (roadmaps, news, etc.) Provide market data and analysis. Share general knowledge regarding cryptocurrency . FloppyPepe (FPPE): Blending Financial Gains With a Greater Mission This meme coin, FloppyPepe (FPPE), provides substantial utility. For example, every transaction directs 1% towards environmental conservation initiatives. By collaborating with reputable organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), this ecosystem guarantees that meme culture goes beyond simple entertainment to make a meaningful difference. When users stake FloppyPepe (FPPE) tokens, they can earn distinct rewards, including additional token bonuses and early access to future platform features. Staking tokens allows participants to earn passive income through automated redistribution while boosting the ecosystem by increasing liquidity and stability. Early Entry Alert: FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale Price Is About to Rise Identifying a 500x opportunity like FloppyPepe (FPPE) can be challenging. However, its presale provides a chance for investors to benefit from its low ICO price before it rises. Each token is priced at $0.0000002 , but this price may not stay the same in the next 24 hours as the initial stage is nearing its conclusion. Therefore, early investors who have not yet capitalized on this 500x opportunity’s low price are encouraged to take action now. Now is the moment to act; don’t delay until it’s too late.

44781644,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/dogecoin-price-prediction-how-an-11-year-solar-cycle-may-be-driving-the-charts,1747596788,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/44781644.jpeg,Dogecoin Price Prediction: How an 11-Year Solar Cycle May Be Driving the Charts,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/dogecoin-price-prediction-how-an-11-year-solar-cycle-may-be-driving-the-charts,"Dogecoin price prediction theories usually stick to charts and sentiment, but what if something cosmic is quietly pulling strings? A recent study suggests an 11-year solar cycle may align with crypto booms and busts, showing strong correlations between sunspot activity and market performance. As we enter the 6th year of this cycle in 2025 historically linked to cooling trends, some traders are watching closely. And while Dogecoin still has the spotlight, newer names like Dawgz AI are quietly gaining traction before the next major shift. Could this be the calm before the sun flares again? How the 11-Year Solar Cycle Could Impact Dogecoin in 2025 It sounds wild at first, solar flares affecting crypto prices? But there's growing data behind it. According to a study published on SSRN , there’s a noticeable correlation between the 11-year solar cycle and market trends, especially in Bitcoin. During the first half of the cycle (years 1–5), the market tends to rise. But in years 6 through 11, things shift and historically, that’s when slowdowns hit. 2025 marks year 6 of the current solar cycle, and if the pattern holds, we could see a dip or cooling-off period in risk assets, including Dogecoin. The study found a strong positive correlation during early cycle years and a moderate negative correlation as the cycle matures, suggesting optimism fades as solar activity passes its peak. While Dogecoin isn’t Bitcoin, meme coins often follow BTC’s lead during macro trends. If the sun’s activity really does influence investor sentiment (through biological or psychological effects, as the paper hints), DOGE might feel the pressure too. What the Data Says: Year 6 of the Solar Cycle and Market Slowdowns The idea that sunspot activity affects financial markets might sound far-fetched, but the data says otherwise. A study on Bitcoin and Solar Activity (2011–2024) found a clear pattern: crypto prices often rise in the first half of the 11-year solar cycle and slow down in the second half. Specifically, during years 1 to 5, Bitcoin showed strong gains, with a correlation coefficient of +0.71. But from years 6 to 11, that relationship flipped, with a moderate negative correlation of -0.48. Why does this matter now? Because 2025 marks Year 6 of the current solar cycle, and that’s historically when momentum fades. The data shows this mid-cycle period often brings market slowdowns, lower enthusiasm, and weaker price action across speculative assets. Since Dogecoin tends to move with Bitcoin during broader market shifts, it’s worth watching this timing closely. Technical vs Symbolic: Where Dogecoin’s 2025 Forecast Really Stands According to CoinCodex , Dogecoin’s 2025 forecast shows modest gains spread out over the year. The average price is expected to land around $0.140564, with monthly highs ranging from $0.1379 to $0.2143. The best potential return comes in December, with a projected 41.94% ROI, while May offers the lowest at just 0.08%. So far, the data doesn’t point to a massive breakout, but it also doesn’t signal a collapse. It’s a slow, cautious climb. While solar cycle theory suggests 2025 might cool down broader market sentiment, DOGE could still see short-term pops depending on retail interest and momentum. Dawgz AI and the Altcoin Underdogs Preparing for the Next Shift While Dogecoin holds its place as the OG meme coin, fresh contenders are quietly setting up for the next phase of the market cycle. Dawgz AI is one of those underdogs that’s not just chasing hype, it’s building ahead of the curve. At the time of writing, Dawgz AI has already raised over $3.59 million in its presale, with token prices set to increase soon. Early stakers can earn 120% APY, and the project’s been audited by SolidProof , giving it a layer of legitimacy that’s rare in meme coin circles. What sets Dawgz AI apart is its blend of meme branding and real AI-powered utility. Its trading bots run 24/7, and users can buy in with ETH, BNB, SOL, and USDT - making it as accessible as it is ambitious. Looking to learn more about $DAGZ? Check out the video below. Final Thoughts The latest Dogecoin price prediction shows steady but cautious growth through 2025, with some months offering stronger ROI than others. Add in the solar cycle theory, and things get even more interesting, especially as we enter a year historically linked to market slowdowns. Still, the story doesn’t end with DOGE. While it holds legacy status, altcoins like Dawgz AI are quietly gaining ground by mixing real tech with community-driven momentum. Frequently Asked Questions What will DOGE be worth in 2025? Dawgz AI might be gaining early traction, but Dogecoin is still holding attention for 2025. Most forecasts suggest DOGE could trade between $0.12 and $0.21, depending on market conditions and overall crypto sentiment. Will DOGE reach 1 dollar? While Dawgz AI is focusing on steady growth through utility, DOGE would need a massive rally to hit $1. Current projections don’t support that milestone anytime soon, it would take a major shift in market momentum. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? Compared to early-stage coins like Dawgz AI, DOGE is more established, trading around $0.14. That means $500 would currently get you about 3,570 DOGE, though prices fluctuate, so check the latest rate before buying. What will be the price of Dogecoin after 5 years? While Dawgz AI is betting on long-term growth through AI tools and staking, Dogecoin’s 5-year outlook is more uncertain. Some projections place DOGE between $0.30 and $0.70 by 2030, depending on adoption, use cases, and broader market trends.

With eyes on Ripple's XRP and Cardano's ADA , the next few years could reveal some surprising top performers. Both coins have unique strengths and face their own challenges. This article dives into their potential for growth by 2025 and explores whether they might lead the next bull market. XRP Price Surge and Key Levels Define Market Outlook XRP climbed roughly 15% in the past month, rebounding from previous trading ranges. Over the last six months, it surged more than 112%, indicating increased investor interest and vibrant market activity. This price growth showcases XRP's ability to harness broader market enthusiasm during the altcoin season, marking a clear transition from modest gains to significant price appreciation. Current trading levels for XRP are between $1.75 and $2.50, with support around $1.31 and resistance near $2.80 and $3.55. An RSI of 54 and positive momentum suggest moderate bullish pressure, indicating that bulls may have the upper hand. Traders should consider potential entry or exit points as prices fluctuate around these pivotal levels. Cardano: Notable Recent Gains Amid Market Volatility ADA recent activity shows a strong one month upturn of over 21% with a modest six-month gain around 2% that has pulled the price from earlier lower levels. The coin’s performance over the past month reflects a notable rebound after facing a challenging week with a drop that reached about 11%, indicating volatility and rapid changes in direction. Current trading occurs within the $0.55 to $0.78 range. Immediate resistance appears near $0.88 while support settles at $0.41, with further levels at $1.11 and $0.18. The RSI sits at approximately 53, suggesting a neutral stance. There is a mix of bullish and bearish sentiment, and trading opportunities may arise between these key levels as the market seeks direction. Conclusion XRP and ADA show strong potential for growth in 2025. Ripple's ongoing partnerships and projects aim to strengthen its position. Cardano's focus on innovation and development could drive its value. Both cryptocurrencies have ambitious plans that could make them top performers. The current trends and upcoming milestones will be key to watch. Investors may find these coins appealing if the projects continue to evolve positively.

A rising number of wealthy investors are hiring private protection teams, not because of price swings, but because people are literally trying to snatch them or their families off the street. The change began before Coinbase Global Inc. admitted hackers had stolen user addresses and balances, but that breach threw gasoline on a fire that was already burning. According to Bloomberg, Jethro Pijlman, managing director of Amsterdam-based Infinite Risks International, said his firm has seen a steady rise in long-term contracts from clients with large crypto holdings. Jethro explained, “We’ve had more inquiries, more long-term clients, and more proactive requests from crypto investors who don’t want to be caught off guard.” His clients are now taking security just as seriously as their portfolios — armored vehicles, threat assessments, and total digital footprint scrubs are becoming routine. Hackers steal addresses, attackers knock on doors The Coinbase data breach has added a terrifying new layer to the risks. Hackers got hold of names, addresses, ID images, transaction logs, and even account balances — exactly the kind of data someone would need to target high-value individuals. Coinbase claimed less than 1% of active monthly users were affected, but those accounts stayed exposed for months. During that time, criminals used stolen information to manipulate users into handing over their wallets or transferring funds. Several affected users refused to speak publicly, citing safety concerns. Ronghui Gu, co-founder of CertiK and professor at Columbia University, told Bloomberg: “Crypto traders are acutely concerned about their privacy during data leaks. Cryptocurrency can be transferred with just a private key and is extremely difficult to recover. This makes crypto traders prime targets for criminals.” What’s worse is that this trend isn’t limited to cyberspace. Charles Marino, head of Sentinel — a security firm tracking crypto threats — said attackers are now focusing on physical crime because online defenses have improved so much. “Right now, the crypto threat landscape is very high,” he said. That’s not an exaggeration. In January, David Balland, co-founder of Ledger SAS, was kidnapped alongside his partner. Balland was left with a mutilated hand. Just last week in Paris, criminals attempted to kidnap the daughter and grandson of the CEO of Paymium. The plan failed, but it shook the community. France’s Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, responded by announcing a special emergency police line for the crypto industry and promising elite unit support for security briefings and home protection assessments. Crypto firms spend big to protect their own It’s not just private holders taking action. Coinbase itself dropped $6.2 million last year to protect CEO Brian Armstrong. That’s more than JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Nvidia spent combined on their top execs. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Source: Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg And while Coinbase’s business might not match those giants in size, the danger is clearly more immediate. Robinhood spent $1.6 million to protect Vlad Tenev. Circle Internet Group put $800,000 into keeping Jeremy Allaire safe. Meta and Alphabet still outspend them all, but the contrast is striking — crypto companies are smaller, but the threats to their leaders are bigger. Security now includes everything from private drivers and 24-hour bodyguards to sweeping people’s social media for real-time location leaks. Infinite Risks International monitors posts to make sure clients aren’t dropping clues that could help would-be attackers. Jameson Lopp, a well-known Bitcoin security advocate, maintains a running database of physical attacks on crypto holders. He logged more than 20 incidents worldwide already this year. These cases aren’t just happening in France or the Netherlands. It’s global. Kidnappers, scammers, and gangs are watching wallets, tracking down names, and showing up at doors. Events are changing too. Organizers of EthCC, an annual crypto conference in Cannes, announced increased coordination with French police, special forces, and private contractors for this year’s edition. Last year, local police handled security. This year, it’s a full-blown operation. And traders are taking note. Many are now publicly saying they’re skipping trips to France entirely.

Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 140% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. Investors have limited window since phase 4 is almost closing as over 85% has been sold. Turning just $1,500 into $150,000 within months sounds like a dream, but with strong fundamentals and a passionate community behind it, Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as one of the best cryptos to buy now for those seeking astronomical returns. Dogecoin’s Meteoric Rise: From Meme to Millions Dogecoin’s legendary ascent is one of the best stories in cryptocurrency lore, transforming from a joke coin into a cultural phenomenon that delivered stratospheric returns for early investors. Fueled by viral social media hype and a passionate fan base, DOGE turned small investments into life-changing wealth essentially overnight. Although its rise was more of a function of momentum rather than tech, it showed that sentiment can be a powerful force in the marketplace. Now, as investors hunt for the next crypto with the same volatile potential, newer projects like Mutuum Finance are coming into view as possible contenders to equal or even surpass Dogecoin’s record success. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $8.6 million and accumulated 10,000 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.025 before their value will grow to $0.03 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 140% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Social media channels will release the results of an ongoing Certik smart contract audit after the completion of this audit by the team. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. Users who join early gain complete access to premium platform updates which encourages them to stay involved. Mutuum Finance leverages modern lending innovations and secure operational platforms to execute permanent changes within Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Mutuum Finance is no longer flying under the radar. With over $8.6 million raised, 10,000+ holders onboard, and more than 85% of Phase 4 already sold, this presale is racing toward closure. Investors locking in at $0.025 stand to gain 20% immediately in Phase 5 and potentially 140% by launch. Once it hits exchanges at $0.06, early participants could be looking at gains that mirror Dogecoin’s meteoric rise, but this time with real DeFi fundamentals backing the momentum. Time is running out to secure MUTM before the next price hike, join the presale now.

Although this is not ready for public use, the experiment is already raising serious concerns in the global financial markets. CNBC crypto trader Ran Neuner says this will hurt gold’s value as the world’s go-to safe-haven asset and push more people toward Bitcoin (BTC), causing the flagship cryptocurrency’s value to rise. Lab-Grown Gold Raises Alarm Over Scarcity Last week, researchers at CERN used the Large Hadron Collider to remove protons from lead atoms, turning them into gold. Although this method is still expensive and slow, it shows that the precious metal can now be made in a lab. In a recent X post , Ran Neuner quickly responded to the news. He warned that gold may no longer be seen as rare, which could make the precious metal no longer scarce. His view draws from the recent history of diamonds. After lab-grown diamonds entered the market, prices dropped as supply increased. Neuner believes gold may follow the same path if lab-made alternatives become common. Bitcoin Seen as the New Store of Value Neuner argued that this shift will push more people toward Bitcoin. Unlike gold, the digital asset cannot be created in a lab or printed at will. Its fixed supply of over 21 million coins adds to its appeal as a scarce asset. He emphasized that once people realize this, there will be a massive shift into crypto assets. Bitcoin’s strong performance over the past months supports this idea. The digital asset has shown resilience as gold prices rise and fall with global events like the U.S.–China tariff wars . Even though gold value rebounded by 10% after trade talks improved, Bitcoin still holds strong above $103,000, maintaining bullish momentum. Notably, analysts recently said the asset is in its Acceleration phase. Meanwhile, not everyone agrees with Neuner. Peter Schiff, a long-time critic of Bitcoin, dismissed the comparison, saying Bitcoin is not a store of value like gold. However, the market seems to be leaning in Bitcoin’s favor. Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, believes Bitcoin could hit $250,000 in this market cycle because of global financial problems. Other industry leaders, like Arthur Hayes and Samson Mow, predict that the Bitcoin price would climb to $1 million and match gold’s total value. Bitcoin ETFs Surpass Gold as Inflation Hedge Beyond price, Bitcoin is now outperforming gold in investor interest. New data shows a steady shift of funds from gold into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This shows that investors now view Bitcoin as a more vigorous defense against inflation. With lab-grown gold on the horizon and Bitcoin gaining ground, the race for the ultimate safe haven is heating up. For now, Bitcoin is taking the lead.

In a new CNBC interview, the billionaire says that crypto’s correction earlier this year is largely due to an overexuberant investor sentiment along with the launch of speculative assets, including the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) memecoin. But Novogratz notes that the markets needed the correction to cool off and set the stage for Bitcoin and crypto to surge to new all-time highs. “ We had a euphoric top right around [Trump’s] inauguration and a combination of a lot of things: Trump coin and whatnot… Crypto went back and tested where the [US presidential] election breakout was. Now it looks like we’ll take out $106,000, $107,000, $108,000 and make the next to $130,000, $150,000.” Zooming out, Novogratz believes that Bitcoin and crypto will witness a massive surge in market cap over time and rival gold’s current valuation of about $22 trillion. “And at that point, you’re at price discovery. I keep thinking that gold is a $22 trillion asset and crypto is a $2 trillion asset. And at one point, as more and more young people inherit the money from old people who kiss the face of god, you’re going to see crypto equal gold and that’s a long way from here.” Last year, the billionaire said the millennials, who stand to inherit the largest transfer of wealth in history, are more inclined to invest in digital assets than their boomer parents or relatives. The great wealth transfer will hand $90 trillion in assets to millennials over the next 20 years, according to the global real estate consultancy firm Knight Frank’s 2024 Wealth Report.

This is the first publicly confirmed conversation between the two men in nearly three months, and it’s happening at a critical point in the stalled efforts to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. According to the Financial Times, Trump’s aides believe this call could define the US position in the next phase of peace talks. Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz, and Keir Starmer have already scheduled a joint call with Trump on Monday—their second since Friday—in an attempt to influence the president’s strategy before the Kremlin conversation. Merz, the German Chancellor, said, “We can only hope that there will be further progress,” after stressing that both Washington and Europe were working “purposefully” to bring the war to an end. But European leaders still fear Trump might make a solo move that cuts Ukraine out of the picture entirely. Trump plans call, Putin resists, Zelenskyy meets US officials Putin has refused to meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy face-to-face despite suggesting earlier that talks could happen. Last week, the Russian president rejected a meeting in Turkey, offering no reason. Over the past ten days, he’s declined to engage with any terms he didn’t set himself. Even as US officials grew frustrated, Trump’s team avoided blaming the Kremlin. Instead, the president said on Friday, “I always felt a peace deal was not possible without me,” justifying why he personally arranged the call with Putin. Once the Trump–Putin call ends, the president is expected to speak to Zelenskyy directly. In the meantime, Zelenskyy traveled to Rome on Sunday to meet with Vice President JD Vance. It was their first meeting since their public confrontation in Washington back in February. This time, things were calmer. “It was a good meeting,” Zelenskyy said, adding that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was also present. The meeting in Rome focused heavily on the failed negotiations in Istanbul, where Zelenskyy said Russia “sent a low-level delegation with no decision-making authority.” He added, “I reaffirmed Ukraine’s readiness for real diplomacy and stressed the importance of a full and unconditional ceasefire as soon as possible.” Lavrov drafts terms, Europe prepares for fallout Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s Foreign Minister, told Rubio on Saturday that Moscow is drafting a document that will outline what it wants in exchange for a ceasefire. Rubio said in an interview with CBS, “We don’t want to be involved in this process of just endless talks. There has to be some progress, some movement forward.” He made it clear that continued US engagement depends on whether both sides show real willingness to compromise. “If a document is agreed in the next few days… we can feel good about continuing to remain engaged,” he said. “If not, perhaps we’ll have a different assessment.” Back in Kyiv, there’s concern that if Trump’s administration walks away from the process, US military support could be pulled or cut down, giving Russia more ground. Ukraine has relied on coordinated support from Europe and the US, and any gap could be dangerous. That’s why Zelenskyy joined Friday’s call with Trump and the European leaders. He’s staying close to the action—every single step. In another meeting held in Rome on Sunday, Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, said this week would be “crucial” for making progress toward peace. She didn’t give specifics but emphasized that there’s little time left before talks collapse again. While diplomats are talking, Russia is moving forward on the battlefield. Over the weekend, Ukraine’s Air Force reported that Russia launched 273 drones and decoys—the most extensive drone attack since the war began. Ukrainian defense units described it as a deliberate attempt to exhaust air defenses before peace talks pick up.

As more investors look beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, meme coins are emerging as some of the most speculative yet wildly rewarding digital assets. SPX6900, Official Trump, Official Melania, LOFI, Pepe Unchained, Snek, Gigachad, and Simon’s Cat are among the most talked-about tokens in this meme coin surge. One standout contender in this volatile market is Troller Cat ($TCAT), a meme coin that’s rapidly gaining traction for all the right reasons. Its presale is live now, offering early buyers maximum perks and long-term staking rewards. With no minimum entry requirement and a vision built around community, staking, and deflationary utility, Troller Cat is quickly earning its spot among the best cryptos to hold long term. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) The Troller Cat presale is not just another coin launch—it’s a calculated move designed for maximum impact. Launched on May 2, 2025, at 6 PM UTC, the presale kicked off with a humble starting price of $0.000005 per token. In just 14 days, Troller Cat has surged through five presale stages, now priced at $0.00001166—delivering a jaw-dropping ROI of over 4453.17%, or a 60x return. With $125,000 already raised and 21 stages still to go, this deflationary meme coin shows no signs of slowing down. The token will eventually launch at $0.0005309, making early participation an incredible opportunity. What sets this presale apart is its inclusive entry model—there’s no minimum purchase required to join. A $25 minimum applies only for those using a referral code, enabling both small and large investors to get in early. With the token’s visibility growing and the play-to-earn Game Center poised to reduce supply, $TCAT is shaping up as one of the best cryptos to hold long term. Buy TCAT now! 2. SPX6900 ($SPX) SPX6900 leverages internet culture like no other. Inspired by the stock market’s infamous meme momentum, this coin reflects retail investor sentiment wrapped in layers of satire. Its community is fueled by Reddit-style engagement and aggressive marketing, which keeps the token’s momentum alive. Despite its volatility, SPX6900 remains resilient through social influence and trend-driven demand. With active engagement, continuous meme updates, and a limited supply, it has become a speculative favorite. This balance of cultural relevance and risky upside makes SPX6900 one of the most unpredictable yet thrilling digital assets to watch. That’s why this crypto made it to this list. 3. Official Trump ($TRUMP) Official Trump coin capitalizes on the ever-controversial and highly polarized political atmosphere. By aligning itself with a globally recognized political figure, this meme coin transforms debate into digital demand. With constant mentions across social media and news platforms, its visibility is unmatched. The token benefits from organic promotion and divisive opinions, both of which drive engagement. Official Trump plays into the idea that meme coins don’t need utility—they just need virality. For those seeking politically charged gains, this token provides a unique digital battleground. That’s why this crypto made it to this list. 4. Official Melania ($MELANIA) Official Melania entered the meme coin scene as a calm but potent counterpart to its Trump-branded sibling. Where Trump’s coin thrives on chaos, Melania’s token emphasizes elegance and silent strength. The contrast itself is part of the appeal. This token has caught the attention of crypto influencers promoting balance in portfolios, making it a popular pick for diversification in meme coin collections. With a strategic launch and distinct identity, Official Melania stands out in a saturated market. That’s why this crypto made it to this list. 5. LOFI ($LOFI) LOFI brings an entirely different energy to meme coins. Instead of chaos and politics, it focuses on chilled aesthetics and lo-fi culture. Its artwork, branding, and community mirror lo-fi music playlists that promote relaxation and subtle engagement. This coin proves that meme tokens don’t need aggression to thrive. By tapping into digital mindfulness, LOFI has created a serene corner of crypto that appeals to lifestyle-oriented investors. That’s why this crypto made it to this list. 6. Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) Pepe Unchained is not just a continuation of the Pepe meme legacy—it’s a revolution. Unlike earlier versions, this coin is built on a stronger contract and features real tokenomics aimed at long-term holding. Backed by a large meme community and developers focused on performance, Pepe Unchained is evolving from a joke to a movement. Its rebirth through new technology makes it a serious contender among meme coins. That’s why this crypto made it to this list. 7. Snek ($SNEK) Snek might seem like a simple meme at first glance, but it has quickly become a symbol of stealth wealth in the crypto space. With low market cap and sudden price jumps, Snek appeals to those who love catching assets before they slither into mainstream attention. Community support and clever marketing make this coin more than a temporary pump. Snek is growing into a niche favorite with strong holders and high upside. That’s why this crypto made it to this list. 8. Gigachad ($GIGA) Gigachad is all about dominance—digital and symbolic. This coin represents the alpha personality of the meme coin world, leaning into virality, gym culture, and hyper-confidence branding. It’s for investors who don’t just want to win—they want to dominate. With intense meme value and a clear brand, Gigachad is carving out its space among digital assets. Its boldness is its appeal, and in the crypto world, confidence often translates to capital. That’s why this crypto made it to this list. 9. Simon’s Cat ($CAT) Simon’s Cat is one of the most visually engaging meme coins, tapping into animation nostalgia. Its appeal is simple—adorable design with sharp humor. Beyond the visuals, it has integrated NFT collections, bringing an extra layer of collectibility. Fans of the web series are becoming token holders, combining fandom with investment. Simon’s Cat plays smart by mixing charm with blockchain benefits. That’s why this crypto made it to this list. Conclusion: Best Cryptos To Hold Long Term With a blend of politics, culture, and humor, today’s meme coins offer more than laughs—they provide real, albeit risky, investment opportunities. Yet among them all, Troller Cat ($TCAT) remains unmatched. Its presale performance, APY rewards, play-to-earn deflationary model, and transparent audits make it one of the best cryptos to hold long term. While others ride temporary trends, $TCAT is building infrastructure, incentives, and a strong community. The window to buy at $0.00001166 is rapidly closing.

Strategy Could Soon Join S&P 500 Walton wrote in a post on the X app: Q2 is likely going to be the big blow out quarter on Earnings for $MSTR The quarter ends on 6/30 (52 days from now) The earnings release call will likely be on August 5th / 6th Technically Qualifying $MSTR for the S&P500 The market will react surprised & bewildered… — Jeff Walton (@PunterJeff) May 9, 2025 The S&P 500 is the US stock market benchmark comprised of the 500 largest companies in the United States by total market capitalization. Strategy’s entry onto the index would likely cause its share prices to soar. That’s what happened this week after markets slated Coinbase , the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, to join the S&P 500 with a market cap north of $67 billion. Did Michael Saylor lead the Company to Join Coinbase? Coinbase will enter the broad stock benchmark because Capital One Financial will acquire Discover Financial Services, bumping it off the stock exchanges. After that headline broke, COIN shares flew from under $200 to $266 to close the week. That was an easy 33% gain for shareholders like Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood. The investing maven is very bullish on crypto assets and Coinbase stocks. COIN is the third-largest holding in the ARKK ETF. Walton says Strategy could deliver a similar performance in August if it makes it onto the index. The Bitcoin treasury company guarantees returns on BTC investments to its clients with fixed return corporate bonds that retain the option to convert these notes into Strategy stocks. The company’s founder, MIT graduate Michael Saylor, innovated this strategy to spectacular effect. In April, its stock’s 1-year return on investment surpassed Jim Cramer’s “Magnificent Seven” for market returns. In a more recent update, Saylor informed that MSTR is winning the “financial triple crown” due to its Bitcoin-based strategy. $MSTR is winning the Financial Triple Crown: 1st place this quarter 1st place this year 1st place since adopting the Bitcoin Standard Our @Strategy works because it’s built on $BTC . pic.twitter.com/Leq9LQ6lCq — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 17, 2025 The post ‘Digital Capitalist’ Has Hot Bitcoin Stock Tip For Q2 Investors appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-18 20:20:53

On May 16, Mizrachi posted an apparently enigmatic “Bitcoin Reserve” message on X (formerly Twitter), following a meeting with Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert — strategic advisers to El Salvador’s Bitcoin policies. While no official details were revealed, the timing of the post — just before Mizrachi’s scheduled appearance at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas — suggests a potential policy reveal may be imminent. Panama City Eyes Bitcoin, Stablecoin Payments Mayor Mizrachi has already indicated he would be open to receiving municipal fees in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, Tether, and USDC. He indicated, however, that this would need to proceed only when crypto-to-fiat payment infrastructure is online. A complete Bitcoin reserve, à la El Salvador’s, would require legislative protection from Panama’s National Assembly — which Mizrachi has not yet pursued. Learning from El Salvador’s Model Max Keiser, senior advisor to President Nayib Bukele, said their conversation involved Bitcoin mining and financial education. He added Panama’s hydroelectricity and El Salvador’s geothermal energy as Central American assets to further expand Bitcoin use in the region. Stacy Herbert, head of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, revealed Panama City plans to incorporate the “What is Money?” Bitcoin literacy textbook — a key part of El Salvador’s national curriculum — into its online library. Bitcoin Reserve Trend Increases Across the Globe Panama’s potential move is echoed by events in U.S. states like Arizona and New Hampshire, whose legislatures voted to support Bitcoin reserves. Ukraine has also reportedly been eyeing Bitcoin for national reserves. El Salvador currently holds over 6,100 BTC — worth nearly $640 million — as part of its official reserve, a path that Panama City may also want to take. Public Companies Build Up Bitcoin Stockpiles Institutional Bitcoin adoption continues to increase. Strategy, whose CEO Michael Saylor is a firm Bitcoin supporter, said that it will double its capital-raising efforts to $84 billion to buy more BTC. This includes the offering of another $21 billion of common stock and raising its target debt issuance to $42 billion. Japan’s Metaplanet also joined the trend, buying 1,241 BTC at $126 million, bringing its holdings to 6,796 BTC — valued at over $706 million.

MAGACOINFINANCE Is Becoming the New Political Power Play MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the center of the early-stage narrative for one reason: it’s the last major presale with real structure before listings begin . While others chase overpriced tokens, early investors are positioning into MAGA — where the listing target of $0.007 and current Stage 8 entry point create a clear 25x–35x upside model . What’s attracting major crypto whales: Transparent tokenomics with time-sensitive phases Political branding that connects with a specific audience segment No fluff — just a capped supply and a strong runway With major listing events on the horizon, MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer under the radar — it’s the entry that Bitcoin billionaires don’t want to miss twice. XRP’s Institutional Pivot Gets Real XRP is trading near $2.30 , but the next move may be the biggest one yet. With CME futures listings imminent and payment use cases expanding globally, XRP is now seen as the liquidity infrastructure layer for institutional finance . Major investors who missed XRP’s first cycle are now coming back in — and pairing their exposure with early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE to balance stability with explosive growth . Price models continue to show $10–$30 targets , and with ETF speculation swirling, XRP remains a macro-level altcoin for serious portfolios. Ethereum Leads Smart Contract Capital Flows Ethereum (ETH) remains the top institutional Layer-1 , and its recent $2,600 support zone is proving strong as ETF attention builds. What’s making Ethereum a buy for long-term holders in 2025: Network upgrades that boost throughput (Pectra) Dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and L2 infrastructure Imminent ETF approval expectations But ETH is more than a safe hold — it’s the platform that supports a full altcoin ecosystem. For that reason, whales are using it alongside entries into high-upside tokens like MAGA , creating dual-layer portfolios for both growth and security. Injective (INJ) Rises as a DeFi Infrastructure Play Injective (INJ) has emerged as one of the strongest DeFi platforms of 2025. While often overlooked, INJ has shown consistent performance due to its focus on derivatives, orderbooks, and cross-chain protocol development. Currently trading near the top of its yearly range, INJ remains a high-conviction mid-cap for those seeking real use cases and long-term viability. However, even large holders of INJ are now diversifying into lower-cap pre-listing opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE — where asymmetric upside remains unmatched. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Bitcoin whales may have missed SHIBA and TRUMP , but they’re not making the same mistake twice. With MAGACOIN FINANCE closing out Stage 8, and XRP, ETH, and INJ gaining real traction, the capital is flowing into four strategic assets that combine legacy strength with next-phase upside . Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the only project still offering true early-stage exposure — and smart money is already in motion.

In an interview with Cryptopolitan, Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu laid out how digital property rights, AI agents, and decentralized identities will shape the internet’s future and why the next crypto cycle is about more than just price action. If you think Animoca Brands is just a gaming company or a venture capital firm, you’re not thinking big enough. According to Yat Siu, Animoca’s true identity is as an ecosystem builder, one on a mission to make digital property rights a global standard. “Basically, if you think of us as an ecosystem builder, our mission is to make digital property rights standard in the world,” Siu explains. “We do this through gaming. We also do some investments. But if you want to make the whole world accept digital property, you can’t do it alone.” Animoca bets on gaming tokens revival Since its entrance into the blockchain space in 2017, Animoca has deployed capital into over 570 projects, with more than 165 of those directly tied to gaming. When asked why Animoca has invested so broadly, from games to infrastructure, Siu emphasized that the company is not a traditional VC. “All of our investments come from our balance sheet. We don’t run a fund. It’s more like how Apple should be operating,” he explained. “Apple has $300 billion in cash. Do they have a VC fund? No. Should they? Yes, If they put even 1% of that into building apps for the App Store, they would build a bigger ecosystem.” What was the spark that ignited Animoca’s Web3 gaming ambitions? We asked. He highlighted that it was CryptoKitties, the collectible cat NFTs that first hinted at a programmable, ownable internet in 2017. Siu compares it to the early mobile gaming boom. “It wasn’t really a game. It was NFTs you could breed. Was it a great game? No. But it was the moment we understood this was big.” Even after hundreds of investments, not everything has gone smoothly. Siu acknowledges some missteps, especially during crypto bear markets. Token launches—such as Gunzilla’s Off The Grid and other projects—underwhelmed, often because of macro conditions rather than product quality. “Gaming macro was bad. All gaming tokens were doing badly,” Siu notes. Still, he remains optimistic. He believes gaming and metaverse tokens like SAND (from Animoca-backed The Sandbox) are primed for a strong comeback by the end of the year, driven by renewed mainstream attention thanks to events like GTA VI’s release and new Nintendo hardware. “We believe existing gaming projects that are already listed have an opportunity because they’re underpriced. They’re currently priced relative to utility, not sentiment.” Mocaverse is Animoca’s next big play As bullish as he is on gaming, Siu is placing major bets on two less-hyped areas: digital identity and education. He sees digital identity, specifically Animoca’s Mocaverse project as crucial to building a robust, reputation-based Web3 economy. “Digital identity with multiples is a huge bet we’re taking. We think it’ll create a mass market in terms of digital reputation and make a huge impact.” He also sees education as fertile ground for Web3 applications, though details on Animoca’s approach remain under wraps. Meanwhile, the rise of AI has only strengthened his thesis. Far from a threat, Siu sees AI as a catalyst for Web3 mass adoption. “Your wallet won’t be MetaMask. It’ll be an AI agent that does MetaMask for you, the kind of wallet I can give my grandma,” he says. AI will also unlock explosive growth in user-generated content, composable NFTs, and autonomous agents transacting in crypto. “The native currency of AI agents is crypto. It’s nothing else.” Despite all the futuristic visions, Siu remains grounded in gaming culture. A self-professed first-person shooter fan, he acknowledges the massive appeal of hyper-casual and idle games but doesn’t view them as competition in the traditional sense. “The competitor of idle games isn’t other games, it’s TikTok. It’s all about attention,” he said. For Siu, the magic of gaming lies in its cultural universality, whether it’s Prince of Persia sparking curiosity about Persia or modern Chinese games finding global audiences. “Gaming is culture. You have to hit something that fits into the cultural narrative.” Tariffs won’t stop gaming, they’re borderless Turning to geopolitics, when asked about the impact of rising US-China tariffs and trade tensions, Siu offered a surprising take. “Tariffs are positive for digital industries. If people can’t buy goods as easily, they turn to entertainment and games, and remember, there’s no tariff on software or Bitcoin,” he noted. As physical goods become pricier, Siu expects people to spend more time in digital spaces, where tariffs don’t apply. “Games are neutral, I can play Fortnite, The Sandbox, or Axie Infinity without worrying about tariffs,” he said. Even when it comes to crypto, the borderless nature of digital assets stands out. “If I send you Bitcoin from China, there’s no tariff on that,” Siu added. Wrapping up the conversation, I asked Yat Siu whether he believes most gaming-related tokens are fundamentally overvalued. His response was clear: “No, I think they’re fundamentally undervalued.” Siu explained that gaming tokens reflect much more than just current speculation, they mirror the broader macro trends within the digital economy. “If we believe, as we do, that gaming’s role in the global economy will grow by the end of the year, then these tokens are undervalued,” he said confidently.

This was related to the excess of mismatched positions, short closings, and then reopening of positions. This bullish wave is actually ETH catching up with its peers like BTC and SOL,” Duong said on social media. Duong said that this recovery in ETH price does not imply a general appetite for capital allocation in the market: “Such price movements do not mean that the market is willing to allocate ETH on a large scale; demand is still limited.” Related News: Will the Next Move in Bitcoin Prices Lead to a Record or Is a Correction on the Way? Analyst Outlines Two Price Scenarios On the other hand, Duong also drew a positive picture in his comments about Bitcoin (BTC): “BTC is on the rise and its dominance can still increase.” In terms of the macroeconomic outlook, Duong said that the softening in trade relations between the US and China has increased investor sentiment in the last week. In particular, Duong stated that the US’s $600 billion trade agreement with Saudi Arabia has reinforced this optimism, and that this has pushed back expectations of a recession in the US this year. But things are more complicated on the Japanese side, Duong said, with the country's upper house elections in July likely to harden Tokyo's stance, despite earlier statements calling for a trade deal by June. *This is not investment advice.

BTFD Presale’s Unmissable—FLOKI and MOG Are Also in the List of Top 5 Meme Coins to Buy and Hold!",https://timestabloid.com/0-0002-now-0-006-soon-btfd-presales-unmissable-floki/,"What happens when crypto whales stop lurking and start buying? The answer might just be unfolding in real-time. Meme coin markets are popping off again—fueled by bullish retail buyers, cheeky coin launches, and an onslaught of meme-fueled speculation. The shift? It’s not about hype anymore; it’s about timing. And right now, a few coins are making serious noise, especially for those ready to pounce before the next bull charge. BTFD Coin (BTFD) has stormed into Stage 15 of its presale, offering one of the most explosive setups in meme coin history. But don’t blink. The final presale stage closes at 23:59 UTC on May 26—just hours before launch. And crypto whales are loading up while they still can. Below are the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold right now, led by the monstrous momentum of BTFD. If you’re looking for ROI, staking power, and serious moon math, scroll on. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Last Dip Before Takeoff Picture this: you invest $5,000 today at $0.0002 per token. That gives you 25 million BTFD tokens. With the LAUNCH200 code giving you 200% bonus tokens , your total jumps to 75 million. If BTFD hits its listing price of $0.0006 at launch, your $5,000 would turn into $45,000. And if the moon price prediction of $0.006 holds? You’re staring down a jaw-dropping $450,000 return. That’s a clean 8900% ROI—not in years, but potentially in a matter of weeks. The buzz isn’t just community chatter. Analysts are tracking this as a real-deal launch. The presale started at $0.000004 and has already raised over $7 million, with more than 74 billion tokens sold to over 12,200 bulls . This is not your average meme coin pump. With 90% APY staking rewards, a fully launched P2E game, and an electric Ethereum-based ecosystem, BTFD has utility under the hood. One more kicker? Whales are waking up to Stage 15 and buying heavily before Stage 16 closes the gates forever. Want in? Here are the Steps to Follow: Visit the BTFD presale site Connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet) Enter code LAUNCH200 to claim 200% bonus tokens Finalize your purchase before May 26 at 23:59 UTC You’ve got hours, not days. Make that move before this bullish rocket takes off. Why is BTFD Coin shining as a goldmine among the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold? Because there’s just one stage left before it launches—and 8900% ROI isn’t a maybe, it’s math. 2. Floki Inu (FLOKI): Meme Power Meets Utility FLOKI’s move into real-world partnerships and its Valhalla metaverse push have shaken off its early meme-only identity. From schools in Ghana to DeFi integrations, the Floki ecosystem continues to grow stronger. As one of the most resilient dog-themed tokens post-2021, its cult following remains rock solid. Why does FLOKI make the cut? Because it’s built staying power into its memes. 3. Banana For Scale (BANANAS31): The Meme with Massive Potential This quirky coin took Reddit by storm with its tongue-in-cheek nod to scale and absurdity. But what makes it stand out is its commitment to community governance and surprise airdrops. Traders looking for the next viral blast are watching BANANAS31 closely as it moves beyond novelty into community-driven growth. Why’s BANANAS31 on this list of the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold? Because it’s got meme muscle and governance growing. 4. Mog Coin (MOG): Born from the Internet’s Chaos MOG is that unhinged coin that somehow keeps climbing. With its roots in internet culture and relentless memeability, it’s gained unexpected traction in degen circles. The devs are experimenting with surprise listings and stealth drops that keep traders on edge. Why’s MOG included? Because it thrives on unpredictability, and the crowd loves it. 5. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Comeback Kid After Solana’s rough patches, BONK brought some serious fun back to the chain. Now that Solana’s back in favor with devs and traders, BONK has seen a second wave of attention. With more liquidity pools and utility play on the horizon, BONK isn’t fading anytime soon. Why’s BONK still making noise among the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold? Because when Solana wins, BONK barks the loudest. Time’s Almost Up: Are You In or Watching From the Sidelines? The meme market isn’t slowing down—it’s shifting into high gear. Coins like FLOKI, BONK, and MOG offer personality and pump. But BTFD Coin? It offers raw math and a ticking clock. Remember, these are the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold, not just for fun but for gains. With only one stage left in this rocketing meme coin presale , BTFD Coin is still priced at $0.0002, but it won’t stay there. Presale ends May 26 at 23:59 UTC, and the 200% bonus with LAUNCH200 is active right now. Jump in before the gate closes. Don’t watch others cash out—be one of them. Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs How do I claim the 200% bonus on BTFD Coin?

The presale officially ends on May 26 at 23:59 UTC, and Stage 15 is the final opportunity to buy in before the launch. What’s the ROI potential of BTFD Coin? If you buy at $0.0002 and BTFD hits its projected moon price of $0.006, your return could reach 8900%. Why are meme coin presales safer than post-launch buys? Presales like BTFD let investors avoid early pump volatility while locking in low prices before demand surges. What makes BTFD different from other meme coins? BTFD offers staking (90% APY), a full P2E game, Ethereum-based security, and an active community—plus major presale rewards.

The crypto market is on a recovery path as macro sentiments build up amid weakened trade tensions. With billions flowing into the space, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could be set for a new price uptick. XRP Traders Build Momentum Expert trader Ali Martinez highlighted the chances of XRP moving past $2.70 as the wider market flips green. The asset has recorded significant growth after breaking the $2 level. At press time, XRP trades at $2.36, a 9% rally in the last 24 hours, doubling down on last week’s gains. The XRP price forms an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating sustained growth. According to Martinez, the current stretch favors a breakout to the psychological level of $2.70. If the asset beats this mark, it could trigger wider inflows from retail and institutional investors, setting the pace for the $9 milestone. This year, the institutional favorite nosedived from multi-year highs after it flipped Tether as the third-largest crypto asset by market cap. While institutional traders offloaded assets, the sell-off from retail holders summed up the general market sentiment. Growing macro tensions due to the United States’ trade wars jolted markets, leading to a bearish pattern. However, cooling tensions have ushered in stronger trading metrics and optimism. President Trump’s tariff suspension in the last two weeks led to a bullish swing as institutional adoption soared. Bitcoin price now stands above $100k, while altcoins recovered lost ground. CoinShares Weekly Fund Flow report shows the total market ended consecutive seven-day outflows to record gains. XRP led altcoin gains with $37.7 million in its products, stretching monthly figures. Teucrium CEO Backs XRP Amid growing XRP adoption, Teucrium CEO praised the asset’s utility compared to others. In a recent Bloomberg interview, he stated that XRP has the most utility among crypto assets, adding that Bitcoin is a store of value, but XRP has a true use case. Recently, the company rolled out a 2X Leverages XRP ETF , which targets short-term traders projecting daily price movements. “We chose XRP because we believe it’s the coin with the most utility. It’s not just speculation; it facilitates real transactions. Ripple is a team of true professionals.”",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-18 20:47:57

Indicators are aligning, hinting at a possible surge soon. Investors might find now to be an opportune moment to join before the market takes off. The article explores the factors contributing to this promising scenario. Discover which digital currencies are poised for impressive growth. Pepe Price Analysis: Last Month Rally, Half-Year Dip, and Key Levels Pepe surged by 72.46% over the last month but experienced a decline of 39.11% over the past six months, with a weekly dip of 8.63%. Price action has shown high volatility, reflecting mixed market sentiment with strong short-term movements followed by longer-term pullbacks. The coin’s behavior during these periods indicates significant fluctuations that have drawn the attention of traders and maintained market interest. Current trading sees Pepe priced between $0.000006 and $0.000010. Bulls are pushing against resistance at $0.000012, while support is established near $0.000004, with an additional level at $0.000016. The RSI at 62.69 suggests a balance of buying interest and caution, encouraging traders to keep an eye on these levels for potential breakouts or stabilizations. Dogwifhat Price Rally and Pullback Observations WIF 's strong one month gain of 158.05% contrasted with a 71.89% drop over six months illustrates a volatile journey with rapid surges and deeper declines. Price swings reveal high short-term dynamism, reflecting the coin’s sensitivity to changing market sentiment and risk appetite. Current trading sees the coin in a price band from $0.39 to $0.80, with immediate resistance at $0.97 and support near $0.14, while a second resistance lies at $1.38.

Polkadot and BNB Hold Their Ground,https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-top-crypto-presale-of-2025-polkadot-and-bnb-hold-their-ground/,"Blockchain adoption is rapidly transforming enterprise, consumer, and developer ecosystems, creating heightened demand for next-generation digital assets that serve more than speculative purposes. The leading crypto projects of 2025 aren’t just defined by their tokenomics or community strength—they’re solving complex technical problems through real-world integration and developer-centric innovation.Among the standout names gaining traction this year, Qubetics has emerged as a serious contender for the top crypto presale of 2025. With a rapidly growing community, strong interoperability infrastructure, and development tools that streamline multi-chain creation, Qubetics positions itself as more than just another Layer 1 solution. Its emergence coincides with the continued dominance of established ecosystems like Polkadot and BNB Chain, each offering unique value to enterprise and blockchain communities across the globe. Qubetics (TICS): Empowering Developers with QubeQode and IDE Tools Qubetics is swiftly being recognized as one of the top crypto presale projects of 2025. It’s not just the numbers that command attention, but the foundational technology Qubetics brings to the market. The platform introduces QubeQode, a low-code modular framework that allows developers—from enterprise architects to independent coders—to build scalable, secure, and interoperable applications across multiple blockchains. QubeQode integrates a visual interface and AI-guided build logic, accelerating the development lifecycle for dApps, middleware protocols, and even cross-chain DAOs. Complementing QubeQode is the Qubetics IDE, a fully integrated development environment tailored for Web3 creation. This suite supports real-time debugging, visual smart contract auditing, and deployment to multiple blockchain environments from a single interface. Businesses can rapidly prototype permissioned chains, while professionals can create multichain token systems or DeFi solutions with a fraction of the effort typically required. Real-life scenarios reflect the platform’s practical value. A logistics provider recently leveraged QubeQode to develop a supply chain tracker bridging Ethereum and Hyperledger. A decentralized insurance firm used Qubetics IDE to deploy smart contracts that dynamically adjust premiums based on real-time Chainlink oracles. Even freelancers have begun using its dev suite to build NFT-based contracts that interact with both Solana and Polygon ecosystems—without needing to write dual-network code. This is why Qubetics is being spotlighted by Web3 analysts, not only for its interoperability architecture but also for its enabling technologies that drastically reduce the technical barrier to entry. Presale Milestones and Analyst Projections for Qubetics The Qubetics crypto presale is currently in its 34th stage. More than 512 million $TICS tokens have been purchased by over 26,500 holders. The project has raised over $17 million so far, making it one of the most successful ongoing presales of the year. Tokens are available at $0.2532 per unit in this stage. Analysts predict sharp growth for $TICS post-presale. If it hits $1, early adopters could see a 294% return. At $5, the ROI reaches 1,874%. Should the price climb to $6, gains extend to 2,269%. Price projections of $10 would yield 3,848%, and if it achieves $15 following mainnet deployment, the ROI could exceed 5,822%. These forecasts are generating widespread participation from community members across DeFi, enterprise tech, and blockchain development. Qubetics is redefining Web3 accessibility through development tools and modular frameworks while offering one of the most lucrative presale structures in 2025. Polkadot (DOT): Pioneering Interchain Communication Through Scalable Parachains Polkadot has long held its reputation as one of the most technically ambitious Layer 0 protocols in the blockchain space. Its primary innovation lies in its relay chain and parachain architecture—enabling multiple, sovereign blockchains to interoperate under shared security. Rather than competing with Ethereum or Solana, Polkadot offers infrastructure for building application-specific blockchains that can plug into a shared consensus mechanism. This has made Polkadot the go-to solution for projects that demand customization at the chain level without sacrificing interoperability. Its consensus model, based on nominated proof-of-stake, allows for scalable throughput and robust governance, supporting everything from DeFi platforms to decentralized identity systems. The ecosystem’s strength is amplified by the Substrate framework, which empowers developers to build new blockchains from scratch using modular components. Several high-utility networks, including Moonbeam (a cross-chain smart contract parachain) and Acala (a DeFi-focused chain), owe their success to the Polkadot infrastructure. Furthermore, Polkadot’s treasury system, robust governance via referenda, and transparent validator incentives create a sustainable ecosystem driven by community consensus rather than centralized development. Polkadot remains a vital blockchain for community members focused on scalable, interoperable ecosystems built through modular architecture and democratic governance. BNB Chain (BNB): Mass Adoption Through Performance and Ecosystem Integration BNB Chain, originally born from the Binance ecosystem, has transformed into a powerful decentralized platform supporting smart contracts, DeFi applications, GameFi, and more. Known for its exceptionally low fees and high throughput, BNB Chain delivers a fast, reliable, and developer-friendly environment for building dApps and digital asset platforms at scale. One of BNB Chain’s most strategic advantages is its seamless integration with Binance’s broader financial and exchange infrastructure. This not only facilitates easier onboarding for users but also provides liquidity benefits for dApps and protocols launching within its ecosystem. Its dual-chain architecture—consisting of the BNB Beacon Chain for governance and BNB Smart Chain for smart contract execution—offers flexibility that appeals to a wide spectrum of blockchain users, from retail adopters to enterprise developers. The ecosystem hosts a wide array of projects, including PancakeSwap (a leading DEX), Venus (a lending protocol), and dozens of gaming and NFT platforms. BNB Chain’s EVM compatibility and tools like the BNB Sidechain framework continue to make it a preferred choice for fast deployment and scalability. Additionally, the network has maintained decentralization improvements through validator expansion and ecosystem grants, further empowering innovation without over-reliance on centralized control. BNB Chain continues to serve as a foundational platform for scalable application deployment, balancing accessibility, speed, and liquidity integration within a maturing Web3 framework. Final Thoughts As the digital asset landscape matures, the search for sustainable, utility-driven blockchain projects intensifies. Qubetics, Polkadot, and BNB Chain each provide distinctive advantages to community members, developers, and institutions navigating the decentralization wave of 2025. Qubetics stands out as the top crypto presale of 2025, not only because of its impressive token sales or early-stage valuation projections, but due to its tangible, developer-first tools like QubeQode and Qubetics IDE. These platforms enable seamless cross-chain development and deployment, fostering real-world adoption across industries ranging from logistics to fintech. Polkadot, meanwhile, continues to validate its Layer 0 thesis through its growing parachain ecosystem, democratic governance, and modular blockchain toolkit. Its longevity is rooted in its commitment to interoperability and scalable infrastructure. BNB Chain, leveraging Binance’s reach and technical evolution, remains a staple of rapid blockchain development, delivering scalability, affordability, and liquidity support to the global Web3 builder base. For those actively participating in the 2025 blockchain expansion, understanding the use-case clarity, technological advantage, and ecosystem maturity of each of these assets can significantly inform capital allocation decisions.

Speaking on CNN’s State of the Union with Jake Tapper, Bessent said the administration has “put them on notice” that duties will “ratchet back up to your April 2 level” if talks fail. Eighteen “important” partners are the main focus, he added, though he did not give a timetable for how fast higher rates could return. Bessent suggested some pacts may be regional, saying officials could set one common figure “for Central America” or “for this part of Africa” while smaller bilateral ties might simply receive a fixed number. Scott Bessent while announcing U.S China trade deal on Sunday. Source: New york Post The 90-day clock began after Trump ordered a temporary pull-back from the sweeping tariffs he rolled out on April 2, a day the president labeled “Liberation Day.” That order had imposed “reciprocal” duties but was later softened to a baseline 10% while talks proceeded. On Friday, during a business roundtable in Abu Dhabi, Trump warned that “time is running out.” More than 150 countries want to talk, he said, but the administration cannot meet with all of them. Within “two to three weeks,” Trump added, Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick would start sending letters that spell out “what they’ll be paying to do business in the United States.” He promised the process would be “very fair.” Stocks jumped on Monday after Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer disclosed in Geneva a temporary cooling of the trade fight with China. Washington cut tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% from 145%, while Beijing trimmed its duties on American products to 10% from 125%. The S&P 500 rallied 5.3 percent last week, logging five straight days of gains. U.S leans on ‘strategic uncertainty’ to secure better deals The constant back-and-forth in tariff levels has left U.S. businesses on edge. Commenting on the sudden shift in rates, Bessent described the White House approach as “strategic uncertainty.” Providing too much certainty, he argued, would let other countries “play us in the negotiations.” He predicted that when bargaining ends, “retailers, the American people and the American workers will be better off.” Small businesses that rely on Chinese inputs voice concern that rising costs and unclear rules disturb investment plans. Bessent told CNN he expects trade in the kinds of goods those firms need will continue “at lower tariff levels,” though many owners fear they will have to keep raising prices to protect profit margins. Bessent confirms Walmart will pay some tariffs while charging shoppers for the rest Walmart recently told customers that prices could rise. On Saturday, the president replied on Truth Social, urging the chain to “eat the tariffs.” Bessent said he spoke directly with Walmart chief executive Doug McMillon the same day. “Walmart will be absorbing some of the tariffs,” the secretary said, adding that “some may get passed on to consumers.” Moreover, rating agency Moody’s on Friday cut the U.S. sovereign rating one notch to Aa1, erasing the last triple-A badge the country held. Fitch lowered its grade in 2023, and S&P did so in 2011. Moody’s pointed to America’s $36 trillion debt and political deadlock over a White House budget plan that the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates would add $3.3 trillion more over the next decade. Bessent downplayed the downgrade. “I do not put much credence in the Moody’s,” he told CNN. Still, a lower rating could make investors demand higher yields on Treasuries, pushing up borrowing costs that influence everything from home mortgages to contracts around the world.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Ethereum Could Lead the 10,000% Altcoin Run",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrps-next-leg-up-magacoin-finance-solana-and-ethereum-could-lead-the-10000-altcoin-run/,"Introduction The market’s momentum is shifting again — and the next altcoin breakout wave is forming fast. With XRP showing signs of a renewed breakout , traders are already identifying the top tokens that could lead a 10,000% surge across the altcoin space . Near the top of every list? MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, Ethereum , and the rising star SUI . Each one offers a unique setup for growth: from early-stage opportunity to infrastructure dominance, this could be the most explosive lineup of the cycle . CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Why MAGACOINFINANCE Could Be the Most Aggressive Entry Left MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly become a market standout — not just for its branding, but for its ability to offer structured early-stage ROI with a transparent listing price of $0.007 . Now approaching Stage 9 , MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention from traders and analysts who believe the window for exponential growth is closing fast. What makes it part of the 10,000% conversation: Clean tokenomics and a limited-cap entry phase A projected 25x–35x upside from current levels Structural timing that mirrors SHIBA and DOGE in their earliest days Unlike large-cap assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still undiscovered at the exchange level , making it one of the few altcoins where a small allocation could potentially yield seven-figure upside . Solana (SOL) Maintains Its Position as the Fastest Layer-1 Solana (SOL) has outpaced nearly every other major blockchain in terms of speed, scalability, and real-world application . Now trading between $165–$180 , SOL is firmly in control of the Layer-1 narrative — particularly as DeFi activity continues to grow. SOL’s technicals remain bullish, with analysts forecasting a run toward $300–$400 . Its thriving developer ecosystem, lightning-fast transaction speed, and rapidly increasing Total Value Locked (TVL) put it at the forefront of capital inflow. While SOL may not offer 10,000% at this stage, it acts as the infrastructure driver that amplifies smaller-cap growth — like MAGA . Ethereum (ETH) Holds the Institutional Lane Ethereum (ETH) is the stable pillar of the altcoin ecosystem. With the Pectra upgrade now live and ETF speculation swirling, ETH is expected to lead institutional altcoin exposure through the rest of 2025. Currently priced near $2,600 , ETH is primed for a move toward $4,000–$6,000 , especially as gas optimizations and Layer-2 adoption take hold. But more than price, Ethereum represents market maturity , and that attracts deep-pocketed capital. Ethereum’s real value in this cycle may not be ROI alone — it’s the platform supporting the launch and liquidity paths of newer tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE . SUI: A New Altcoin Challenger Joins the Race SUI has emerged as a powerful new L1 contender, built with scalability, parallel execution, and cross-chain interoperability at its core. After a sharp recovery, SUI is now hovering near $3.95 , with bullish projections heading into $6–$10+ territory . Recent integration with the Axelar Network has enhanced its utility, allowing SUI to communicate across ecosystems — a key advantage in a multichain future. SUI is now being watched as a potential breakout leader among newer-generation chains , and it shares early-stage appeal with MAGACOIN FINANCE for those seeking to position ahead of the next wave . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion The next altcoin supercycle is forming. And while XRP may lead the next leg up, the real upside lies in assets that are still underpriced, underexposed, and structurally early . MAGACOIN FINANCE is that rare token — sitting just ahead of listings with strong momentum and stage-based growth. Meanwhile, Solana, Ethereum, and SUI provide the infrastructure and capital flows that help lift breakout projects. For investors seeking seven-figure returns from small allocations, these are the four to watch as we move into the cycle’s next explosive chapter .

The operation led to one arrest and the deportation of three foreign nationals. This event, still under investigation, has raised new concerns about security in areas rich in energy and crypto activity. Attempted Break-In at Teratech Mining Site Four individuals reportedly broke into a restricted area of Teratech SA’s crypto mining site in Coronel Bogado on May 15. Local police acted fast and stopped the suspects before they could run away. Prosecutor Irene Rolón, who is in charge of the case, confirmed that the event happened and that the investigation is still ongoing. Three of the suspects are Chinese nationals: Jinping Duan, Tian Jianyun, and Zheng Guanglong. Authorities found no official records of their entry into Paraguay. Investigators believe they may have entered illegally through Brazil or Bolivia. All three have now been deported. The fourth suspect, Nahun María Velázquez Garcete, is a Paraguayan citizen. He was seriously injured and hospitalized before being placed in pretrial detention. He is facing charges of aggravated theft. Authorities believe the group may have previously worked as independent contractors at Teratech. However, this has not been confirmed. Prosecutors are waiting for a statement from Teratech’s CEO. The undocumented individuals claimed to be programmers and may have been in the area for months. However, their connections to the crypto facility are still unclear. The investigation is still open, and officials suspect more people could be involved. More Crypto Mining Now Uses Clean Energy The Itaipu dam is one of the biggest hydroelectric plants in the world. It offers cheap electricity, which makes Paraguay a good place for crypto mining. However, this recent incident shows that important places like this need better security. At the same time, the Bitcoin mining industry is changing. A study from Cambridge University shows that 52.4% of Bitcoin mining now uses clean energy, higher than 37.6% in 2022. 42.6% of the clean energy comes from wind and water, while another 9.8% comes from nuclear power. Natural gas is now the top source of energy for Bitcoin mining , rising from 25% in 2022 to 38.2%. In 2021, US Senator Ted Cruz shared that mining Bitcoin with natural gas could be an avenue to generate In comparison, Coal use has decreased, from 36.6% in 2022 to just 8.9% now. The U.S. Leads the Way in Crypto Mining When China banned crypto mining in 2021, the U.S. became the dominant force in the sector. A January report shows that the country controls over 40% of the global hashrate . The election of pro-crypto President Donald Trump has also raised hopes for the industry.

According to a May 16 letter from Storm's attorneys to Judge Katherine Polk Failla, the FinCEN documents show that non-custodial crypto mixers do not fall under the legal definition of a ""money transmitting business"" and that prosecutors have known this since at least 2023. Despite having knowledge of the FinCEN guidance on crypto mixers, state prosecutors still proceeded with cases against the Samourai Wallet developers and Tornado Cash, the attorneys alleged. Letter sent by Roman Storm’s attorneys to Judge Failla. Source: Court Listener US prosecutors denied they withheld the evidence , claiming they submitted the FinCEN communications within the stipulated timeframe to produce the documents for the defense and the court during legal discovery. Storm's defense cited the same legal documents and the same argument the Samourai Wallet developer’s attorneys posed to the court in a May 5 legal letter . Storm's attorneys wrote: ""The disclosures in the Samourai case reveal that the government, at the very least, played fast and loose and, at worst, affirmatively misled this Court with its arguments about FinCEN guidance when responding to the motions to dismiss and to compel discovery."" The letter went on to argue that although the government continues to claim that the cases bear only ""superficial similarities"" to each other, they share the core characteristics of cryptocurrency mixers under the law, thus making the FinCEN documents salient to dismissing the case against Storm.

Despite this, US federal prosecutors still moved ahead with the case against Storm although the charges have been modified.

As more major coins enter consolidation zones, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing accelerated demand — and many analysts are calling this the last major entry window before listings take the price discovery public . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Seeing Pre-Listing Accumulation MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the few remaining presale tokens with both clear structure and strategic upside . With a fixed listing target of $0.007 , and Stage 8 already nearing completion, traders are viewing this as the last clean shot at early-cycle positioning . Key factors driving MAGA’s momentum: Projected 25x–35x growth from current levels Distinct political narrative and identity-based branding Transparent tokenomics and imminent exchange visibility What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is not hype — it’s clarity . For Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP holders looking for higher risk/reward ratios, MAGA offers exactly what’s missing from the large caps right now: entry-level positioning with real upside potential . Bitcoin Holds Steady as Investors Hunt for Altcoin Multipliers Bitcoin (BTC) continues to maintain its dominance in the market, consolidating above $103K with strong support. While ETF flows remain consistent and long-term targets still range between $150K and $250K , BTC’s short-term movement has flattened. For this reason, many BTC holders are reallocating portions of their portfolios into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE to balance stability with speculative opportunity . Bitcoin builds confidence — MAGA builds exponential potential. Cardano (ADA) Prepares for a Potential Breakout Cardano (ADA) is currently trading around $0.75–$0.80 , and analysts are watching closely as it nears a possible breakout above the psychological $1.00 mark. Recent updates to the network have enhanced performance and scalability, and Cardano remains a favorite among long-term blockchain investors. However, ADA is not known for rapid moves — which is why some ADA holders are moving capital into shorter-term high-reward plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE . SEI: Stable, But Yet to Ignite SEI has built a strong presence in the Cosmos ecosystem and continues to be seen as a reliable platform. While the broader infrastructure thesis remains intact, SEI has yet to ignite a full bull-phase move , and is trading in a tight range. Investors seeking faster upside are taking profits from SEI and shifting into earlier-stage tokens that still have room to run — with MAGA becoming one of the primary destinations for that capital. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer a secret — and with Stage 9 approaching fast, traders from all sides of the market are taking positions. Bitcoin holders are rotating small stacks. ADA and XRP communities are diversifying. SEI investors are looking for speed. Among all of them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the final early-stage plays with structured ROI, clear timing, and high-conviction sentiment . This may be the last low-level entry before listings go live — and those watching closely are already making their move.

Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov resists French pressure to censor Romanian election content Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov claims that he rejected requests from a high-ranking French intelligence official to censor pro-conservative voices and content on the Telegram messaging platform ahead of the presidential elections in Romania. Durov did not immediately name the French government in his initial Telegram post but later confirmed that it was French intelligence services that approached him. Durov wrote in a May 18 X post : ""This spring, at the Salon des Batailles in the Hôtel de Crillon, Nicolas Lerner, head of French intelligence, asked me to ban conservative voices in Romania ahead of elections. I refused. We did not block protesters in Russia, Belarus, or Iran — We won’t start doing it in Europe."" Durov continues to be an outspoken advocate for free speech, autonomy, privacy, and individual liberty, despite repeated threats and legal action from state officials. Source: Pavel Durov Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonator Retired artist Ed Suman lost over $2 million in cryptocurrency earlier this year after falling victim to a scam involving someone posing as a Coinbase support representative. Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg. After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin and 225 Ether — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings. He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access. After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman’s funds were stored in a hardware wallet. He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase’s interface. Nine days later, a second caller claiming to be from Coinbase repeated the process. By the end of that call, all of Suman’s crypto holdings were gone. Crypto scammers impersonate Coinbase support.

According to the announcement , the agency forecasts higher US government debt, fueled by increasing interest expense on the debt, and a lack of cost-cutting measures curtailing government spending. The report noted: ""Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat. In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher."" ""The US' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly-rated sovereigns,"" the newly revised credit outlook predicted. The United States national debt is more than $36 trillion and growing.
