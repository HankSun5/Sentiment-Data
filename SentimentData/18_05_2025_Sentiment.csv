According to the May 16 announcement from the rating agency, US lawmakers have failed to stem annual deficits or reduce spending over the years, leading to a growing national debt . The rating agency wrote: ""We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from the current fiscal proposals under consideration. Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat."" The credit downgrade is only one degree out of the 21-notch rating scale used by the company to assess the credit health of an entity. An overview of the US national debt. Source: US National Debt Clock Despite the negative short to medium-term credit outlook, Moody's maintained a positive outlook on the long-term health of the United States, citing its robust economy and the status of the US dollar as the global reserve currency as strengths, reflecting ""balanced"" lending risks. Related: Asia’s wealthy shifting from US dollar to crypto, gold, China: UBS Investors react to Moody's US credit revision Moody's announcement drew mixed reactions from investors and market participants, leaving many unconvinced by the agency's revised outlook. Gabor Gurbacs, CEO and founder of crypto loyalty rewards company Pointsville, cited the rating agency's previous credit assessments during times of financial stress as unreliable, signaling that the outlook was too optimistic. ""This is the same Moody’s that gave Aaa ratings to sub-prime mortgage-backed securities that led to the 2007-2008 financial crisis,"" the executive wrote in a May 17 X post . However, macroeconomic investor Jim Bianco argued that the recent Moody's credit outlook does not reflect a real downgrade in the perception of US government creditworthiness and characterized the announcement as a ""nothing burger."" Interest rates on the 30-year US Treasury Bond spiked to nearly 5% in May 2025, signaling reduced long-term investor confidence in US debt. Source: TradingView US government debt surpassed $36 trillion in January 2025 and shows no signs of slowing, despite recent efforts by Elon Musk and others to reduce federal spending and curtail the national debt. As the debt climbs and investors lose faith in US government securities, bond yields will spike, causing the debt service payments to go up, further inflating the national debt. This creates a vicious cycle as the government will have to entice investors with ever-greater yields to incentivize them to purchase government debt.

As the market braces for what could be a historic 2025 bull run, newer and more dynamic tokens are emerging as serious contenders. Leading the charge are PEPE, a viral sensation with an ever-growing cult following, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi powerhouse with real-world utility and explosive upside potential. The MUTM presale has attracted over 10,000 participants, and many anticipate that the token price will rise to $0.03 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 140% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. Investors have limited window since phase 4 is almost closing as over 80% has been sold. While Shiba Inu still holds nostalgic value, seasoned investors are shifting focus to what could be the next big cryptocurrency breakouts. If you’re scanning the horizon for the best crypto to buy now, these two might just be the spark that ignites the next massive rally. PEPE’s Viral Surge Positions It as a Meme Coin Powerhouse in 2025 Trading at $0.000014 with a market capitalization of nearly $6 billion, PEPE has rapidly ascended the ranks of meme coins, surpassing veteran favorites like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in recent weeks. Its 77% weekly gain is propelled by an incredibly passionate community and strategic exchange listings, which are signs of overwhelming investor confidence. While the crypto world awaits the 2025 bull run, the movement of PEPE suggests that it could be a force to be reckoned with among the top performers. For those investors searching for the next big thing in crypto, PEPE’s performance is notable, with future projects like Mutuum Finance holding promising potential within the crypto universe. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $8.5 million and accumulated 10,000 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.025 before their value will grow to $0.03 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 140% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Social media channels will release the results of an ongoing Certik smart contract audit after the completion of this audit by the team. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. Users who join early gain complete access to premium platform updates which encourages them to stay involved. Mutuum Finance leverages modern lending innovations and secure operational platforms to execute permanent changes within Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Mutuum Finance is more than a trending token, it’s shaping up to be one of 2025’s breakout stars. Over 80% of Phase 4 is already sold out, and once the price jumps to $0.03 in Phase 5, today’s $0.025 entry point will be gone forever. With a 140% return potential by launch and price targets as high as $5 by 2026, the upside is enormous, but only for those who act early. If you missed SHIB or PEPE at the bottom, this is your second shot, don’t miss it again. Lock in your MUTM tokens now before the presale window slams shut. Join the presale now.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing interest for solid reasons—well beyond just its affordable price point. With the presale heating up and the platform nearing launch, MUTM is quickly being recognized as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in right now. The numbers say it all. More than $8.5 million has already been raised, and the presale is over 83% through its fourth phase. With the price still at $0.025, it’s an accessible entry—but that opportunity is quickly slipping away. Once this phase closes, the price will rise to $0.03, and with a confirmed listing target of $0.06, early adopters could lock in a significant upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is structured to serve both passive investors and active users. The platform offers two ways to lend crypto: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users deposit digital assets—such as ETH, AVAX, or stablecoins—into liquidity pools managed by the protocol. In return, they receive mtTokens, which represent their deposit and automatically increase in value over time. These mtTokens reflect the growing interest paid by borrowers who access the pool’s funds. Users don’t need to negotiate or manage anything manually; once they deposit, they begin earning yield based on the pool’s usage rate. This setup allows anyone to earn passive income with minimal effort. The more the pool is utilized by borrowers, the higher the returns for depositors. It’s one of the simplest and most efficient ways to earn from crypto without trading or micromanaging positions. Mutuum also offers a P2P lending option, which gives users more control. Instead of contributing to a shared pool, lenders can choose to fund specific loan requests from individual borrowers. Terms like interest rate, duration, and collateral are all customizable. Here’s how it might look: A borrower offers AVAX as collateral and requests a loan in USDC. As a lender, you evaluate the request, propose an interest rate, and once both sides agree, the smart contract handles the rest. The borrower gets the funds, and you receive full repayment plus interest once the loan is repaid. This model is ideal for those who want to target higher returns or lend less common tokens. It opens up more strategic lending opportunities, while still being managed on-chain with full transparency. Mutuum enables borrowers to access liquidity while keeping full ownership of their existing assets. This is especially useful for investors who want to maintain exposure to their crypto but need short-term funds. Let’s say you’re holding LINK and expect its price to go up. Instead of selling, you can lock it as collateral and borrow USDC through Mutuum. You keep your LINK position while accessing the funds you need. There’s no fixed repayment schedule either—as long as your collateral-to-loan ratio stays above the required threshold, your position remains open. This feature gives borrowers a flexible way to participate in the market, cover expenses, or even take advantage of other opportunities without triggering taxable events or losing potential gains. One of the standout features of Mutuum is how it generates and redistributes revenue. Interest paid by borrowers is used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market, and these tokens are then distributed to mtToken holders who engage with the protocol’s reward system. Mutuum ties its reward model directly to platform usage. The more activity on the platform, the greater the buying pressure for MUTM—and the more rewards for engaged users. This design helps maintain value while encouraging long-term participation. As the protocol approaches its beta release, excitement around MUTM is rising. With utilities like lending, borrowing, and passive income already built into the design—and a stablecoin also in development—the foundation is clearly in place. For those wondering what crypto to invest in now, this project checks all the boxes: low entry price, working model, and early-stage demand. The presale is still open, but with more than 83% of this phase completed, time is running out to grab tokens at $0.025. Once the next round kicks in, that price increases by 20%, and momentum will likely continue to grow as the launch approaches. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy before the market’s next breakout, MUTM offers both opportunity and timing. While the rest of the market stalls, this one is moving—and it’s still early enough to enter before the curve steepens.

These DOGE Rivals Will Get Everyone Talking Soon,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-crypto-to-buy-today-these-doge-rivals-will-get-everyone-talking-soon/,"The crypto market pulses with opportunity, and three DOGE rivals—Cardano (ADA), XRP, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—are stealing the spotlight. Cardano’s integration with Brave’s 85 million users sparks chatter about its climb to $3. XRP’s failed bearish pattern signals a potential surge to $3.40. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing crowds with its presale, raising $8,500,000 and selling over 476 million tokens to 10,000 holders. These coins aren’t just riding trends; they’re carving paths in decentralized finance and cross-border payments. Investors are buzzing about which crypto to buy now, and these three top cryptocurrencies demand attention. Cardano’s Brave Leap Forward Cardano (ADA) is gaining traction with a bold move. The blockchain’s integration into Brave’s multi-chain wallet exposes it to 85 million users, a massive pool of crypto enthusiasts. Priced at $0.83, ADA has already climbed 60% from April’s $0.51 low. If an altcoin season ignites, analysts see it hitting $1.30 soon, with $3 in sight by late 2025. Yet, Cardano lags behind Ethereum and Solana in total value locked, limiting its immediate adoption. Still, projects like BitcoinOS and Midnight bolster its DeFi and privacy credentials. For investors eyeing the best cheap crypto to buy now, ADA offers long-term promise but requires patience. XRP’s Bullish Breakout XRP is charging forward after dodging a bearish trap. A head-and-shoulders pattern collapsed in April, but prices rebounded from $1.60 to above $2.50. Analysts now project $2.85 by June, with $3.40 possible in 2025. High trading volumes and a position above the 200-day moving average fuel this optimism. Ripple’s court wins and a crypto-friendly U.S. administration add tailwinds. However, XRP’s reliance on Ripple’s cross-border payment narrative narrows its appeal compared to broader DeFi platforms. For those asking what crypto to buy for short-term gains, XRP’s momentum makes it a top crypto to buy, though its ceiling may be limited. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor fervor in phase 4 of its presale, now 80% filled at $0.025 per token. Since the opening phase at $0.01, prices have jumped, and phase 5 will bring a 20% hike to $0.03, yielding a 20% gain for current buyers. The project’s lending and borrowing platform offers real utility, letting users earn passive income via mtTokens, like mtETH, which accrue interest. A buy-and-distribute system boosts demand by redistributing tokens to stakers. Recently, the team launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens. For those seeking the next big crypto, MUTM’s structured growth is hard to ignore. Security and Scalability in Focus The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is prioritizing trust, actively pursuing a Certik audit for its smart contract. An announcement will hit socials once finalized, boosting confidence. The presale’s tokenomics promise a 140% return at the $0.06 listing price, with analysts eyeing $2 post-launch for a 7,900% ROI. Phase 4’s rapid sell-out fuels FOMO, as investors rush to secure tokens before the price climbs. Unlike speculative coins, MUTM’s overcollateralized lending model ensures stability. This focus on security and scalability positions it as the best cryptocurrency to invest in for those chasing the next crypto to hit $1. Why These Coins Shine Cardano, XRP, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) each bring unique strengths to the crypto market. ADA’s Brave integration opens new doors, but its adoption trails competitors. XRP’s bullish breakout excites traders, yet its niche focus limits versatility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, blends DeFi utility with presale momentum, outshining its rivals. Its $8,500,000 raise and 10,000 holders signal fierce demand. Investors wondering what’s the best crypto to buy should act fast, especially with MUTM’s phase 4 nearing its end.

According to the data, in today's transactions, the crypto whale with the short address 0x6ea withdrew 1.79 trillion PEPE tokens worth $22.35 million via Binance. With the decrease in the price of PEPE after the whale purchased the wallet, at the time of writing this article, this whale has $21.9 million worth of PEPE in its crypto wallet. PEPE price has lost 8% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.00001222. The decline came during a general decline on the altcoin side, but PEPE was one of the biggest cryptocurrencies that was most affected by these losses. Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, Pi Coin lost the most value with 11%. The sharp declines were concentrated in memecoins.

Federal prosecutors confirm that Storm conspired to launder money, circumvent U.S. sanctions, and conduct an unlicensed money transfer business through Tornado Cash. The trial is set to begin in less than two months. Recent court documents show that prosecutors have agreed to drop the portion of the charge related to operating a money-transfer business without a license, acknowledging inconsistencies with federal regulations. In 2019, FinCEN clarified that ”non-custodial entities” such as Tornado Cash are not classified as money transfer operators. ”The provider of anonymizing software is not a money remitter. The rules exclude from the definition those persons who provide only delivery, communication, or network access services used to transmit funds,” the agency's guidance states. The proceedings against Storm continue despite an internal service memo circulated last month about the DOJ changing its approach to handling cases involving cryptocurrency mixing services. It indicated that the agency would focus on prosecuting individuals who use crypto tools for criminal purposes, rather than prosecuting the platforms themselves. Tornado Cash co-founder Alexey Pertsev was sentenced to more than five years in prison in May 2022 for laundering $1.2 billion through a mixer, but was released to electronic monitoring in February 2025 pending appeal. Tornado Cash found itself under OFAC sanctions in August 2022 due to its role in money laundering. According to the U.S. authorities, since the creation of the service, attackers have spent more than $7 billion through it. Tornado Cash was used in particular by the North Korean group Lazarus. Recall that on January 21, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit revoked the sanctions due to ”abuse of authority” by OFAC and sent the case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas for further proceedings.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-17 20:48:45

Why? Because the fundamentals go beyond hype. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just another trending presale — it’s a structured, politically resonant project with long-term strategy, real traction, and serious upside. XRP and ETH Gains Are Slowing — Investors Seek Next-Phase Growth XRP has seen major rallies this year, surging as high as $3.93 , but recent pullbacks to $2.45 have triggered warnings of a 50% correction. While Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin rollout and ETF chatter still support bullish long-term sentiment, short-term volatility is pushing XRP holders to rebalance. Ethereum , trading around $1,826 , is projected to climb above $1,895 this quarter, but growth is expected to be moderate compared to earlier cycles. Institutions remain committed, but retail investors are hunting higher-multiple opportunities. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture. MAGACOIN FINANCE Stage 8 Is Live — And the Clock Is Ticking MAGACOIN FINANCE recently passed $8 million raised , but this isn’t about milestones — it’s about what comes next. Stage 8 is live , and each phase is becoming more exclusive. With Stage 9 approaching , investors are securing allocations ahead of a series of major announcements , including integrations, media expansions, and roadmap updates. The project remains under $0.001 , and promo code MAGA50X offers a 50% token bonus — a key reason why whales are buying in now, not waiting for listings. Built for Longevity — Not Just Hype With no centralized exchange dilution yet, a scalable model, and politically driven branding, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as a top altcoin to watch — not just in presale charts, but across analyst dashboards. XRP and ETH holders see the writing on the wall: this is still early , and the upside is asymmetric. In a market full of recycled narratives and overextended tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out — not for what it’s promised, but for how it’s built. Stage 8 is open. Stage 9 is next. And XRP and ETH whales aren’t waiting.

This incident is part of a trend of violent cases targeting individuals connected to the crypto industry in France. Crypto Exec’s Family Targeted in Attack According to a BBC report , the attack happened around 8:20 a.m. in the city’s 11th district and was captured on video by an onlooker. Local media revealed that the woman and her husband were getting out of their car with their child when three men jumped out of a white van and tried to pull them away. The couple fought back, which resulted in the husband being hit several times on the head while trying to protect his family. Meanwhile, the wife managed to grab a gun from one of the culprits and threw it into the street. Police later confirmed the weapon was a replica air gun. Despite the busy street and children on their way to school nearby, passers-by hesitated to intervene at first. However, as more people began to react, the attackers abandoned the attempt and ran back to the van, where a fourth person was waiting inside. As the culprits drove away, one witness threw a fire extinguisher at the vehicle. Following the incident, the family was taken to a hospital and treated for minor injuries. Police sources confirmed that the woman is the daughter of a crypto company boss. AFP said the victims are relatives of the co-founder of French Bitcoin exchange Paymium. The Paris police unit that handles armed robbery is now investigating the incident. A Series of Crypto-Related Kidnappings This development follows a similar case just over a week earlier, where the father of a crypto millionaire was kidnapped in another part of Paris while walking his dog. In this instance, the abductee was held for ransom. After being in captivity for three days, he was released with one of his fingers cut off. Several people have been arrested in connection with the case. Another high-profile incident happened in January when David Balland, co-founder of crypto wallet firm Ledger, and his wife were taken at their home in central France, with the culprits demanding a 10 million euro ransom for their release. While they were later rescued, Balland was also found missing a finger. Around the same time, rumors spread about another abduction involving Ledger’s other co-founder, Eric Larchevêque. However, these claims were later denied by French media. Authorities have not confirmed whether the incidents are connected, but all victims involved had some link to crypto.

The last week, however, saw a slight drop of 4.49%, highlighting intermittent volatility. This suggests a pattern of quick surges interspersed with periods of consolidation, characterized by small pullbacks in weekly trading. Current values are fluctuating between $2.19 and $4.35, with immediate resistance at $5.19 and secondary resistance around $7.34. Support is positioned near $0.88. The market shows neither strong bullish momentum nor dominant bearish pressure, offering opportunities for traders to either aim for breakouts above resistance levels or look to accumulate near support. Avalanche Price Trends: Short-Term Rebounds Amid Long-Term Dips Avalanche posted a 21% gain in the past month while dipping about 34% over six months. A one-week decline of around 2.5% hints at recent downward pressure amid earlier rallies. The mixed movements indicate that, despite bursts of strength, the coin still struggles to recover from an extended slippage period. Current prices hover between $16 and $24 with resistance seen at roughly $28 and support near $11. Technical indicators like an RSI around 52 and a slightly bearish moving average suggest a cautious market. Traders might watch for a breakout above resistance or consider positions near support within this defined range. Conclusion SUI appears to have strong support near its neckline, suggesting a potential for upward movement. AVAX has shown significant strength with a strong breakout, indicating further gains may be possible. Both coins are worth watching closely for their next price moves in the market.

While meme coins like Shiba Inu had their moment, smart money is shifting toward real utility, and that’s where Mutuum Finance comes in. Positioned as a potential millionaire-maker crypto of 2025, this innovative DeFi project is gaining serious traction among altcoin enthusiasts and early adopters alike. The presale has raised more than $8.5 million and attracted over 10,000 participants, ahead of a token price rise to $0.03 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 140% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. Investors have limited window since phase 4 is almost closing as over 80% has been sold. If you’re searching for the best cryptocurrency to invest in today, don’t overlook this rising star in the world of decentralized finance. Why Shiba Inu’s Hype May Not Translate Into Long-Term Wealth Shiba Inu swept the world in the last bull run, turning early buyers into overnight millionaires and solidifying its position as one of the most hyped meme coins in crypto history. However, the coin’s astronomical growth was fueled less by inherent utility and more by social media hype and speculative mania. As the market matures and investor focus shifts towards long-term value and real-world use cases, Shiba Inu’s lack of innovation becomes more and more apparent. While it remains a cultural phenomenon in the market, investors looking to invest in the best cryptocurrency for the 2025 cycle will want to look at projects with stronger fundamentals, like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market.

According to the investigation, this notorious group moved over HK$118 million, worth about $15 million, through local banks and crypto exchange shops. Authorities say this operation is part of Hong Kong’s broader crackdown on digital asset crime. How The Criminal Syndicate Operates The Commercial Crime Bureau led the investigation. Officers arrested two Hong Kong residents who were key members of the group. They also arrested ten people from mainland China. In total, nine men and three women, ages 20 to 42, were reportedly taken into custody, The local members helped the mainland suspects open fake bank accounts in Hong Kong. These accounts were created in both regular and digital banks, and the goal was to hide the source of the money. Crypto Shops Used to Hide Funds Source According to Police Superintendent Shirley Kwok Ching-yee, the group also used other people’s bank cards to withdraw large amounts of cash. The cash was then taken to crypto exchange shops in Hong Kong, converted into cryptocurrency. This method made it harder to track where the money came from. The syndicate created around 500 fake accounts to carry out its activities. Police reported that 58 scams earned at least HKD 10 million, valued at around $1.3 million. These bad actors tricked victims and funneled the stolen money through the group’s accounts. Notably, authorities worldwide are increasingly cracking down on crypto exchange shops that engage in illegal activities . Rising Fraud Cases in Hong Kong The Hong Kong enforcement team also shared that fraud cases in the city are growing. Compared to last year, fraud reports are up by nearly 12%. So far, more than 10,000 suspects have been arrested for fraud-related crimes in Hong Kong. Similarly, in the U.S., crypto scams and illegal activities are on the rise. In April, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) shared in its 2024 report that digital asset scams have hit record levels. The IC3 received over 140,000 crypto-related complaints last year, with total losses reaching $9.3 billion. This is a sharp 66% increase from the $5.6 billion reported in 2023. While Hong Kong is working hard to promote the growth of digital assets, the government is also increasing its efforts to fight financial crimes. Officials say stopping money laundering is key to keeping the city’s economic system safe and trusted. Notably, many countries are doing the same by tightening crypto rules and increasing enforcement to prevent financial crimes and protect investors.

In a post on X, one of the popular members of the Pi Community, Dr Picoin, claimed that insiders have dumped millions of tokens. According to Dr Picoin , the sell-offs by insiders followed recent announcements about upgrades and improvements to the Pi Network at Consensus 2025. He claimed that the hype around these announcements pumped PI value, and insiders used that opportunity to sell. He said: “The Core Team sold tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of Pi at the peak — all while the community was distracted by announcements and the illusion of progress.” Interestingly, the users alleging rug pull and sell-offs point to blockchain data showing that a wallet allegedly controlled by the Pi Core Team transferred 12 million PI in the last 24 hours. Screenshot of transaction data shared by Dr Picoin as proof of sell-off (Source: Dr Picoin) However, some other users have pushed back against the claims, noting no rug pull. Pinewszone on X explained that the wallet that many claim is selling is a distribution wallet that the Pi Core Team uses to migrate user balances to the mainnet. They posted: “Don’t be misled by fake information circulating on X. Coreteam is not selling pi. You are just being influenced to panic sell so that they can buy at a lower price.” While community members are arguing about what is happening, the Pi Core Team has been quiet, further allowing the fear of uncertainty and doubt (FUD) to spread among users. PI token loses more than 50% within a week as users wait for mainnet Meanwhile, most of the concerns from users alleging rug pull appear to be tied to the sharp drop in PI price this week. The token reached $1.60 on May 12 but started dumping since then and is now at 0.679, representing around a 58% decline. Dr Picoin posted : “Don’t question me—demand an explanation from the Co-founders: why did the price suddenly drop from $1.60 to $0.70 when, in reality, the update from PCT should have been seen as a positive development?” However, the decline is mostly due to the disappointing wait for most users looking forward to the network transitioning to mainnet. A post from the official Pi Core Team account sparked excitement last week when it teased a huge announcement. Most people expected that the announcement would have something to do with the long-awaited mainnet launch, but it was about to be the launch of the Pi Network Venture fund. The news of a $100 million fund for a Pi Network-based project was underwhelming for most users. PI token daily trading volume for the past seven days peaked on May 13 (Source: CoinMarketCap) Interestingly, trading volume for PI declined 34% to $328.54 million in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Trading volume has also declined since peaking at $2.03 billion on May 13. This shows holders sold the rumor, i.e., they dumped the token when it was still pumping before the team announced the launch of the Venture Fund. Since the announcement on May 14, trading volume has fallen well below $1 billion. Pi Network announces new upgrades at Consensus 2025 Meanwhile, Pi Network has continued to evolve even as users wait for the mainnet launch, which has no scheduled date yet. The network founder, Dr Nicholas Kokkalis, disclosed at Consensus that Pi Network has now shut down its central node to enable full decentralization of the network. He added that its node operating software now has a new version called Horizon, which is available for node operators to upgrade. Horizon reportedly offers security, performance, and protocol. Interestingly, Kokkalis said in his talk titled “Unleashing Mainstream Adoption with Al + Blockchain Infrastructure” that Pi Network will integrate artificial intelligence. He called on AI companies to build AI apps on the network, adding that there is a plan to improve Pi Network’s technical infrastructure.

In line with the bullish rhythm of the crypto market, the prominent altcoin has recorded significant price leaps in the past month, resulting in a total gain of 61.92% in this period. However, price patterns indicate that Ethereum is headed for a major encounter at $4,000, a price level with potential to neutralize or validate the current price uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Multi-Year Consolidation Could Spark A Parabolic Move – Details ETH Must Surpass Long-Standing Resistance To Ignite Mega Rally In an X post on May 16, OKC partner and crypto analyst Ted Pillows highlighted an important price level for Ethereum amidst the ongoing bull trend. Notably, ETH has moved by over 60% in the past few weeks from $1400 to trade above $2,600. Based on the growing chart pattern and underlying market fundamentals, the altcoin is likely to maintain this uptrend in the short term. According to Ted Pillows, $4,000 can be described as a crucial price region for ETH bulls based on historical price data. Notably, Ethereum has been trading within a massive symmetrical triangle that began in Q3 2020 and has lasted over 1,500 days. The $4,000 price level currently sits just below the upper boundary of this triangle, representing a significant opposition to further price gains. In 2024, Ethereum popularly faced rejection thrice at the $4,000 price level, even amidst general market upswings, raising speculations over the altcoin’s long-term profitability. If the ETH bulls can sustain the current market demand, another encounter with this major resistance level is likely on the cards. To confirm the altcoin’s participation in a brewing crypto bull run and altseason, Ethereum must push past $4,000, flipping this price zone into an effective support level that could strengthen the current market structure with bullish targets set as high as $12,000. However, if ETH faces another rejection at this resistance zone, a price correction could occur with potential for price lows around $1,700 in line with the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle.

Institutional investments are strong bullish signals of long-term profitability for the ETH market as they indicate a strong demand from these traditional financial institutions with relatively high amounts of liquidity.

With altcoin narratives back in play and sentiment shifting, these three are back on the radar — but in a cycle increasingly driven by breakout timing and asymmetric entries, traders are asking: can these legacy tokens still deliver the explosive moves they once did? While SOL, ADA, and TRX build momentum, some investors are pivoting toward breakout-stage opportunities — tokens with more upside, stronger timing, and no legacy baggage. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE is now making a serious entrance. Solana and Cardano Reclaim Strength — But Capped by Expectations Solana has pushed back into its $170+ range, and Cardano is once again holding above $0.77 — both signs of resilience in a choppy Q2 market. TRON, meanwhile, has benefited from stablecoin inflows and network stability. Yet despite these gains, all three now face the same challenge: they’re expected to perform. With so many traders already positioned, and price caps well-known, the potential for fresh breakout energy is limited . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why Capital Is Rotating Into High-Potential Breakout Plays The prevailing trend in 2025 is unmistakable: traders are targeting tokens with clean technical setups, early-stage entry points, and compelling narratives. Rather than favoring stability, the market is flowing toward assets on the verge of breakout — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a clear beneficiary of this shift. Unlike Solana or Cardano, which have matured into infrastructure giants, MAGACOIN FINANCE is pursuing a different trajectory — one that combines grassroots momentum, scarcity-driven mechanics, and narrative strength. This unique positioning is allowing it to stand out amid a saturated market. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Entering at the Optimal Phase of the Cycle What gives MAGACOIN FINANCE its edge isn’t just pricing — it’s the lifecycle stage. While most top-tier tokens are well into their multi-year paths, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in its pre-listing phase — historically the window where asymmetric upside is most accessible. Traders are paying attention for several key reasons: The entry price is still under $0.001 , with a projected listing target of $0.007 45% of the supply is allocated to early backers, reinforcing exclusivity and scarcity It presents a second-chance setup for those who missed Solana’s early surge or Cardano’s 2021 rally The project is gaining recognition across altcoin communities and scanning platforms — signaling growing sentiment ahead of broader market exposure With these dynamics in play, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a favored early-stage entry for traders seeking breakout positioning ahead of the curve. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thought: Legacy or Lift-Off? Solana, Cardano, and TRON still have strong fundamentals — but fundamentals are not always what drives breakout cycles . In the current environment, fresh narratives and early entries are pulling the biggest moves. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t replacing these giants — it’s offering what they can’t right now: a clean chart, open upside, and cycle-perfect timing .

The executive explained: ""We have validators all around the world. Rotating leader schedules all the time. And then they switch from having to be massive consumers of data to extremely massive broadcasters of data. So that means that they need huge amounts of resources both on ingress and egress."" The executive added that the constraint posed by public internet infrastructure is now the limiting factor in blockchain performance and not compute power or software development.

The goal of the project is to reduce latency, the time it takes for data to travel in a network, and bandwidth — the maximum data traffic a network can handle at once. In April 2025, DoubleZero conducted a validator token sale to sell token purchase agreements to interested node operators seeking to become validators for the network. The token sale was only available to accredited investors and already active validators on high-throughput blockchain networks including, Solana, Celestia, Sui, Aptos, and Avalanche.

Moody's rating agency degrades US credit rating Moody's, one of the major credit ratings agencies, downgraded the US government's creditworthiness from Aaa to Aa1 on May 16, citing increased deficits and a mounting national debt. According to the announcement , the agency forecasts higher US government debt, fueled by increasing interest expense on the debt, and a lack of cost-cutting measures curtailing government spending. The report noted: ""Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat. In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher."" ""The US' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly-rated sovereigns,"" the newly revised credit outlook predicted.

Speaking in a recent interview , Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up. “250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years. “It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market. The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” Melker explained. World Liberty Financial brushes off oversight concerns from Congress Zach Witkoff, one of the co-founders of the Donald Trump family-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), has rebuffed efforts by US lawmakers to investigate the president’s potential conflicts of interest. In a May 15 letter to Senator Richard Blumenthal, lawyers for World Liberty Financial claimed a call to investigate the crypto platform was based on “fundamentally flawed premises and inaccuracies.” Witkoff did not specifically address any allegations, claiming that WLFI was “too busy building” for oversight. “The Company rejects the false choice between innovation and oversight,” said the letter. “What it opposes is the misuses of regulatory authority and uncertainty to suppress lawful innovation.” May 15 letter to Sen.

As the 2025 bull run approaches, attention is turning to high-potential XRP substitutes that offer stronger ecosystems, faster scalability, and more robust DeFi integrations. Whether you’re hunting for the next big cryptocurrency or simply want exposure beyond Ripple, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and the emerging Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are quickly becoming the top altcoins to invest in today, each offering unique value in a rapidly advancing crypto market. Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Phase 4 which is over 80% sold out, already raking in over $8.5 million with over 10,000 investors participating. With a public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 4 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 140% by the time the token hits exchanges. Why Solana and Cardano Are Outshining XRP in 2025 As XRP keeps venturing regulatory seas and making it on the world stage in terms of international remittances, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are gaining attention from investors but for distinctly different reasons. Solana’s fire-throughput capabilities and negligible fee costs have endeared itself to NFT websites and DeFi developers both, while Cardano’s academically-oriented bent and priority placed on peer-reviewed upgrades endears itself to those looking for sustained blockchain sustainability. Relative to XRP, centralised both in governance and use case, the two ecosystems are thriving in innovation and expanding bases. As altcoin buyers remain to consider their alternatives and make investments in this year’s hottest altcoins, SOL and ADA each offer robust alternatives, along with newcomer Mutuum Finance (MUTM) adding further added fuel to XRP alternative investors will need to keep an eye on. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance is being third-party audited, and their open-source smart contracts are secure in design while creating trust among users. The platform is also set to be compatible with non-EVM and EVM blockchains, and the gates swing wider with more liquidity in other ecosystems. Presale Momentum At today’s $0.025, the MUTM token is of huge interest to early investors. A Phase 5 20% price jump will give the token a boost to $0.03. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there’s plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance one of the most-watched low-market-price DeFi plays. XRP’s future remains clouded by regulatory hurdles and stagnating innovation, prompting savvy investors to pivot toward high-utility altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and the rapidly rising Mutuum Finance. Over $8.5 million has already been raised by more than 10,000 adopters, all anticipating serious upside as the presale races toward completion. Phase 4 is over 80% sold out, and the current entry price of $0.025 won’t last long. Phase 5 will jump to $0.03 and the public launch is set at $0.06, locking in up to 140% in potential gains. Analyst chatter points to post-launch prices as high as $3, making this one of the most talked-about DeFi tokens of the year. Act now or risk missing out, Mutuum Finance could be the altcoin breakout of the 2025 bull run.

Their mid-term price predictions spark curiosity, and their positions in the upcoming surge become a topic of debate. This article delves into which of these coins might be primed for a significant rise. Bitcoin Cash Price Trends: Monthly Surge Amid Semi-Annual Dip Bitcoin Cash showed a 23.06% gain over the past month with a notable jump in price, while the six-month performance slipped by 8.38%. The short-term rally indicates renewed market interest, contrasting with a broader decline over a longer period. Price movement has been volatile, reflecting bursts of optimism alongside persistent pressure evident over the last six months. Trading now falls within a range of $282 to $417, with immediate resistance at $469 and a secondary resistance at $605. Strong support appears at $197 and lower at $62. Bulls and bears are in a tug-of-war with no clear trend, making it worthwhile to trade cautiously within these levels while monitoring for significant moves. Litecoin Rally and Support Zones A monthly gain of 33.40% contrasts with a slower 6-month increase of 13.79%, suggesting a recent burst of activity amid overall steady progress. Weekly performance dipped slightly by 1.34%, reflecting some short-term hesitance in price movement. Price levels have oscillated within a moderate range over these periods, showing renewed energy compared to the past half-year. Current trading shows Litecoin positioned between a range of $68.29 and $93.67. The nearest resistance at $103.77 and support near $53.01 form key decision levels. Indicators hint at balanced energy, with neither bulls nor bears decisively controlling the market. Traders might explore opportunities on short-term moves towards resistance or cautious entries near support. Conclusion In 2025, BCH and LTC are expected to play key roles in the crypto market. BCH, with its strong transaction capability, and LTC, known for its fast processing times, could see significant growth. Both coins have established their positions and maintain active communities. They will likely be important players in the mid-term crypto rally. These two cryptocurrencies might attract more investors looking for reliable alternatives to other well-known options.

However, while established players continue leading, early buyers focus on something more promising. Web3 ai, the platform set to launch with a fully operational AI product suite has taken the spotlight where every feature relies on the $WAI coin. It has raised $500K within 24 hours and over $4 million in its presale. It prioritizes real utility instead of speculation. At its current price of $0.000365 in stage 5, with a locked listing price of $0.005242, the Web3 ai ($WAI) offers a 1747% ROI before launch. This is a rare opportunity for those looking to enter a promising crypto. Uniswap Trading Volume Hits $3 Trillion Uniswap has reached a major milestone by surpassing $3 trillion in trading volume, cementing its position as the top decentralized exchange. In response, the UNI coin surged to $6.89, marking a 41% increase over the past week, although some pullback may occur short-term. Uniswap also introduced a rewards tracking feature in its Web App, allowing liquidity providers (LPs) to monitor real-time earnings. Additionally, ERC-7683, a cross-chain liquidity standard, aims to unify markets. A court ruling that protects Uniswap Labs from third-party fraud strengthens its position, reinforcing Uniswap’s solid fundamentals. Dogecoin Price Target Reaches $2 Dogecoin’s price target has been set as high as $2 due to whale buys and ETF speculation. Currently priced between $0.23 and $0.26, analysts are keeping a close eye on the situation after Bitwise registered a “BITWISE DOGECOIN ETF” entity in Delaware, indicating growing institutional interest. Additionally, large holders acquired 590 million DOGE in one day, now controlling about 30% of the supply. Technical indicators, such as MACD crossover and rounded bottom patterns, suggest a bullish trend. Conservative predictions forecast a range of $0.24, while some models predict a rise to $0.57 to $2. Web3 ai’s Real-World Utility Drives Buyers Interest Web3 ai attracts significant attention because it’s geared to delivering results. The project has raised over $4 million, with $500K coming in just 24 hours, reflecting the growing interest from both retail and institutional buyers. The platform offers a range of AI-powered tools, including automated trading signals, portfolio tracking, DeFi yield recommendations, fraud detection, and risk monitoring. Every tool requires the $WAI coin to operate, creating a direct link between platform usage and increased coin demand. Currently, the presale is in Stage 5, priced at $0.000365, with a locked listing price of $0.005242. This offers a potential 1747% return on assets before the official launch. The presale consists of 50 stages, and as the supply becomes more limited, the opportunity to get in at these early stages is shrinking. What sets Web3 ai apart is its execution. The platform’s tools will go live once WAI lists on exchanges, with AI integrated as the core function. Fund managers recognize that the next major opportunity in the market isn’t about following trends but buying solid infrastructure. Web3 ai’s blend of utility and growth potential positions it as a strong candidate for long-term success, making it an appealing asset choice for those looking for real-world value in the crypto space. Final Thoughts Web3 ai stands out not due to speculative potential but because it is already providing real-world utility. The project has raised over $4 million, with $500K coming in just one day, attracting both retail and institutional attention. Its AI-powered tools cover automated trading, portfolio tracking, DeFi yield recommendations, fraud detection, and risk monitoring. Every tool relies on the $WAI coin, ensuring increasing demand as the platform grows. With the presale priced at $0.000365, Web3 ai offers a 1747% ROI at listing.

Daily RSI Shows Only Mild Bullish Momentum,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bull-run-on-daily-rsi-signals-bullish-weakness/,"The price of Bitcoin has been on quite the run since mid-April, finding its way from beneath the $85,000 mark to as high as $104,700 over the past month. The largest cryptocurrency market enjoyed a positive shift in investor sentiment and a fresh influx of capital, especially through the BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Interestingly, the premier cryptocurrency seems to be showing some signs of fatigue, especially after failing to break out of the $102,000 – $105,000 consolidation range over the past week. This sluggish round of price action has called into question the authenticity of the recent bullish impulse. BTC Still Missing Its Bullish Aggression: Crypto Expert Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Tony Severino took to the X platform to share an interesting insight into the price action of Bitcoin over the last few weeks. According to the crypto expert, the price of BTC might be missing a classic technical behavior, often correlated with aggressive bullish impulses. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones—What It Means for ETH The rationale behind this observation is the recent movement of the daily relative strength index (RSI) indicator on the Bitcoin price chart. The relative strength index is a momentum indicator used in technical price analysis to estimate the speed and magnitude of an asset’s price changes. The RSI oscillator is typically used to analyze whether a crypto asset is being overbought or oversold, signaling a potential trend/price reversal. An RSI reading of above 70 usually indicates an overbought market condition, while a relative strength index value below 30 signals an oversold condition. According to Severino, Bitcoin bull runs historically coincide with a rapid surge of the RSI oscillator above the 70 threshold, reflecting overwhelming buying pressure in the market. This pattern is noticeable in the chart below, as highlighted during the October 2023 rally and the November 2024 post-election breakout. However, Bitcoin’s current price action appears more cautious and less convincing. While the market leader has been recovering from its early-year blues, the relative strength index has yet to exhibit the clean upward break (above 70) typical of significant bullish expansions. Severino did note that the Bitcoin bullish impulse—signaled by the RSI break above 70—could emerge at any moment. If the bullish strength does come, investors could see the price of BTC break out of the current consolidation range and toward its all-time high. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, BTC is valued at around $103,676, reflecting no significant price movements in the past 24 hours. The past day’s sluggishness underscores the premier cryptocurrency’s performance in the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the Bitcoin price has increased by merely 0.8% in the last seven days.

From trader forums to presale trackers, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing up as one of the most-watched early-stage entries of the cycle . Key reasons why early buyers are moving fast: A still-undervalued entry price below $0.001 A projected listing at $0.007 , offering built-in upside A hard supply cap of 100 billion tokens , with strong demand from politically driven and speculative traders alike This is not just about tokenomics — it’s about timing, narrative, and community alignment , all colliding at the right moment.

MAGACOIN FINANCE has managed to do all three. Unlike meme tokens that rely purely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as a serious early-stage altcoin setup with structure behind it. Buyers aren’t aping in blindly — they’re making timed entries based on breakout-stage signals . The project has now become a favorite among traders migrating from: XRP , looking for higher ROI SOL and AVAX , seeking new volatility plays DOGE and PEPE , chasing the next political meme breakout — but with stronger mechanics Analysts Are Already Flagging It as the Cycle’s Smartest Early Entry With listings expected to follow soon, analysts are starting to compare MAGACOIN FINANCE’s structure to early Shiba Inu or Trump Coin momentum phases — but with more control, better entry ratios, and tighter token distribution. Some forecasts now point to 40x–50x potential , depending on post-listing liquidity and community retention. What’s clear is this: the early window is closing fast . CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Word: The Standout Pre-Sale of 2025 In a crowded market filled with fleeting hype, only a select few tokens truly shape the early-stage narrative each year.

SUI — Scalable Ecosystem, Surging Sentiment SUI has been one of 2025’s quiet giants, with a 302.57% gain over the past year and an 81.99% jump just this month . A minor token unlock this week hasn’t shaken investor confidence, as the project continues to attract strong volume and developer attention. With key support at $3.76 and bullish price targets as high as $5.21 in May alone, many traders see SUI as a breakout Layer 1 leader. With over $1.74 billion in daily volume and ecosystem momentum building, SUI has the scalability and market interest to push toward the top-10 market cap rankings in the next bull run. 2. Litecoin — Classic Asset With New Technical Strength Often overlooked in favor of flashier tokens, Litecoin is staging a strong comeback. Analysts forecast a potential pullback to $81.06 , but longer-term projections range from $199 to $255 if bullish momentum builds. The formation of a W-reversal pattern signals a potential breakout ahead — especially if LTC can surpass the critical $132.23 resistance level. Litecoin has held up better than many altcoins during market turbulence, and its simplicity, liquidity, and wide acceptance make it a reliable mid-cap bet for the next cycle. 3. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Early-Stage ROI Play With Breakout Potential With over $8 million raised and momentum accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025. Unlike many presales that fade after launch, this project is built on long-term scalability, politically resonant branding, and a viral narrative that continues to attract both whales and retail buyers. Stage 8 is live, and Stage 9 is approaching fast — making access increasingly exclusive. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE from the rest is its strategic timing: the token is aligned with a political cycle that could fuel mainstream media attention and cultural virality just as exchange listings go live. Analysts say the upside isn’t just in price — it’s in positioning. Promo code MAGA50X offers a 50% token bonus, giving early participants more allocation strength ahead of what insiders call a wave of key announcements. These include major integrations, updated roadmap milestones, and wider media exposure already in motion. There are no centralized exchange dilution risks at this stage. Instead, MAGACOIN FINANCE is growing organically through word-of-mouth, verified on-chain whale activity, and an increasingly active global community. It’s the kind of project seasoned investors recognise early — not just for what it is now, but for what it’s setting up to become.

The project’s unique combination of fixed supply, narrative appeal, and a tiered pricing model has helped create one of the most consistent presale performances of 2025. With the presale now advancing into later stages, urgency among buyers is climbing. Current prices remain below the public exchange target of $0.007 , offering projected returns of 25x to 40x for early participants. As each round fills, new buyers are entering at higher price points, reinforcing the growth trend. THE CLOCK IS TICKING FAST – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE Offers More Than Hype Backed by a HASHEX audit , MAGACOIN FINANCE maintains a clear structure and transparent rollout process. The token supply is deliberately limited, and the presale is designed to reward those who take early action. Community channels now exceed 20,000 members , with high levels of activity and ongoing discussion about future use cases. The project also continues to reward proactive investors through its MAGA50X bonus code, which provides a 50% token bonus for qualifying purchases. This has helped enhance investor confidence while fueling continued allocation ahead of the token’s official launch. Why Analysts Are Watching Closely Analysts are tracking MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top early-stage contender this quarter, citing its strong presale consistency and alignment with growing demand for political meme projects that offer real structure. While many meme tokens rely on short-term trends, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing signs of being built for sustainable growth through its phased rollout and steady engagement metrics. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Final Thought: The Window Is Narrowing As momentum builds and price stages rise, investors are locking in positions before the next jump.

Eyes are turning to specific coins, hinting at significant opportunities. Kaspa , Raydium , and AAVE are emerging as strong contenders, possibly poised for impressive growth. This article delves into why these cryptos could lead the way, sparking keen interest for May 2025. Kaspa Breakout: Short-Term Gains Amid Longer-Term Corrections Kaspa experienced rapid gains with a 54% rise in one month and an 11% increase in one week. A six-month decline of nearly 23% reflects earlier bearish trends before the recent surge. Price movements show volatility with periods of strong recovery following earlier drops, highlighting the coin's quick rebound even after broader corrections. At present, Kaspa trades between $0.0585 and $0.1150 with key resistance at $0.1403 and a secondary barrier near $0.1967, while support holds at $0.0274. Bulls push the price in the short term, but a clear trend is yet to emerge. Traders might explore long positions on a sustained break above $0.1403 while staying alert to potential pullbacks toward support levels. Raydium RAY: Recent Surge Amid Long-Term Decline and Key Levels Last month RAY shows a notable rebound with an increase of nearly 40%, while the six-month trend reflects a sharper decline of almost 46%. Price movement illustrates a period of volatility where a short-term rally contrasts with a longer-term downward drift. Historical data reveals a mix of recovery dynamics driven by sudden upward momentum alongside a broader bearish sentiment. Current trading lies between a range of about $1.73 and $3.50, with a nearby resistance at $4.21 and support near $0.68. Bulls appear active, hinting at attempts to breach $4.21, yet the clear trend remains unformed. A cautious approach is advised, considering trades at key levels while respecting the existing range. Aave Surge: Rising Momentum with Key Price Zones in Focus Aave has experienced strong upward movements over the past month, with prices jumping by nearly 68% while recording a solid 40% rise over the last six months. A modest weekly increase of around 7% hints at renewed trading interest and dynamic market activity, reflecting a period of significant recovery and speed in price action. At present, the coin trades between approximately $125 and $191s. Immediate resistance appears near $218 with support around $87, and a further swing to resistance may target the $283 mark while deeper support lies near $22. The interplay of bullish pressure with occasional bearish signals creates a mixed trend environment, prompting strategies that favor cautious breakdowns above resistance or buying near established support levels. Conclusion Kaspa (KAS) , Raydium (RAY) , and AAVE show potential for strong performance by May 2025. Kaspa continues to gain traction with its novel technology. Raydium is making significant strides in decentralized finance. AAVE remains a powerful player with its lending and borrowing platform. These coins have promising futures.

With blue chips already rallying, savvy investors are scanning the market for cryptocurrencies that could explode in the next bull cycle. Projects like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) continue to prove their staying power with solid ecosystems, while Dogecoin (DOGE) rides renewed momentum in meme-driven investing. But beneath the surface, a newer altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is emerging as a potential XRP-level breakout candidate, offering both utility and growth potential. The project is already at Phase 4 of its presale and has already raised more than $8.5 million and more than 10,000 investors. With over 80% sold out during this stage, the price will go up by 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5 and with an expected launch price of $0.06. These four tokens are quickly becoming the top crypto to watch as the next wave of gains builds. Cardano, Solana, and Dogecoin: The Top Altcoins Shaping 2025 While the crypto market readies itself for a massive 2025 surge, Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are emerging as players for investors seeking high returns. Cardano’s research-driven approach continues to attract those in search of a reliable blockchain solution focused on security and scalability. On the other hand, Solana’s speed network and low costs have made it the go-to for developers and DeFi projects to scale quickly. Meanwhile, although Dogecoin did begin as a meme coin, its durability with a devoted following and increasing use cases beyond simple entertainment is nothing short of phenomenal. While these altcoins are causing a stir as among the most high-potential cryptos to invest in today, newer altcoins like Mutuum Finance are making a strong case to stay relevant in the DeFi market, setting the stage for the next cryptocurrency explosion. Mutuum Finance: A New Era in DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance is not just another DeFi wave-rider project. It provides a twin lending mechanism incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) capabilities. The hybrid system offers stability as well as control to users. P2C Lending enables investors to receive yield by providing stablecoins such as USDT to lending pools that are governed by smart contracts, providing a safe and automated means of earning passive income. In contrast, P2P Lending allows direct borrowing and lending relations between users with no middlemen. This aspect enhances privacy and allows for more personalized lending, giving users more control over the transaction. Through this novel setup Mutuum Finance is now a viable and scalable product within the DeFi ecosystem. It is also currently undergoing a third-party audit by Certik to further enhance transparency and investor trust. Fueling Growth Through Community and Rewards The platform is also developing a thriving community with reward-based mechanics. There is an active leaderboard that shows the top 50 token holders and rewarding them with additional MUTM tokens. In addition, there is a token giveaway with a $100,000 prize ongoing, in which ten winners will receive $10,000 each in MUTM. A referral program also incentivizes user growth by rewarding participants who refer new users to the platform. The combination of well-established altcoins like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) with the emerging potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) makes May 2025 an exciting time for crypto investors. With Mutuum already raising over $8.5 million from 10,000+ investors and over 80% of its Phase 4 presale sold out, the momentum is undeniable. As the price of MUTM is set to increase by 20% in the upcoming Phase 5, those who act now can capitalize on its early-stage growth.

Far from being a fleeting trend, it has carved out a leadership position within the political meme space, demonstrating real traction and breakout-level potential. While many imitators rely solely on virality, MAGACOIN FINANCE has taken a more strategic approach — building a community-driven ecosystem underpinned by strong growth metrics, early-access incentives, and clear market appeal. The result is a token that continues to attract capital from across the altcoin spectrum. From Meme Token to Market Contender — MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Rapid Ascent Unlike most meme coins that burn out after a brief wave of social hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing sustained acceleration — propelled by data-backed momentum rather than flash-in-the-pan attention. Key drivers behind its continued rise: A pricing model that rewards early participants with structured upside mechanics A unique blend of cultural relevance and growth-focused positioning Increasing visibility in real-time trading tools and scanner platforms, not just social media mentions This evolution from meme coin to market contender underscores MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growing stature — and positions it as a standout asset with staying power in an otherwise volatile sector. SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE vs. the Rest of the Political Meme Field TRUMP Coin and other political tokens have gained headlines, but many lack consistent volume, stable growth, or trusted mechanics. MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning a different reputation — as a strategic altcoin entry , not a flash-in-the-pan meme. Here’s what makes it stand out: Organic demand that continues to build, with engaged holders and real transaction activity A scarcity-focused supply model, creating urgency among buyers entering before listings Surging relevance in altcoin communities migrating from XRP, SHIBA, and SOL , where traders seek the next fast-moving opportunity CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just benefiting from political hype — it’s outpacing its peers by maintaining consistent upward pressure and capturing attention where it matters . Breakout-Stage Behavior Suggests Next Phase Is Close Technical traders are now spotting accumulation patterns and buy-side volume growth that mirror early breakouts seen in top 2021–2023 tokens. This is no longer a project with just “potential” — it’s becoming one of the most speculatively optimized setups of the year. As listing anticipation builds and market participation increases, many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering its most aggressive phase yet — fueled not by promises, but by real market structure and capital flow . Final Take: MAGACOIN FINANCE Is No Longer Just a Meme — It’s a Momentum Asset This cycle will see many coins pump. But very few will combine timing, traction, and early-stage appeal like MAGACOIN FINANCE is doing right now. It’s gone from being “the next political meme” to being the political meme that’s already delivering traction .

The syndicate was dismantled on May 15, resulting in the arrest of nine men and three women in mainland China and Hong Kong. The suspects allegedly recruited others to open bank accounts to receive proceeds from fraud cases, which were then converted into crypto at crypto exchange shops to launder the illicit funds, Hong Kong Commercial Daily reported on May 17. The criminal organization rented a residential unit in the Hong Kong neighborhood of Mong Kok to plan and carry out its money laundering activities. Of the $15 million laundered, more than $1.2 million was linked to 58 reported fraud cases. Caught in action The bust followed police surveillance on May 15, when two recruits left the syndicate’s Mong Kok base — one visiting a bank, the other an ATM — before both went to convert the cash into crypto at a crypto exchange shop in the neighborhood of Tsim Sha Tsui. Police arrested both individuals on the spot, seizing around HK$770,000 ($98,540) in cash before the funds could be laundered. The other 10 individuals, aged between 20 and 41, were arrested soon after. Police seized approximately HK$1.05 million ($134,370) in cash, over 560 ATM cards, multiple mobile phones, bank documents and records related to crypto transactions. Senior Inspector Tse Ka-lun of Hong Kong’s Commercial Crime Bureau claimed that the individuals often used bank accounts from their friends and family to launder the stolen funds. Hong Kong reported a 12% year-on-year increase in fraud reports in 2024, with authorities making more than 10,000 fraud-related arrests. Of those arrests, around 73% involved individuals who held stooge bank accounts. Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbers The crackdown comes as Hong Kong continues to roll out its crypto regulatory framework to support local innovation, protect consumers and establish itself as a crypto hub. Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission introduced new rules for crypto exchanges offering staking services in April. Two months earlier, the securities regulator rolled out a roadmap to improve market access, optimize compliance, expand product offerings, strengthen crypto infrastructure and foster relationships with industry players.

Experts Predict Ruvi AI (RUVI) Will Turn a $2,000 Investment into $960,000 in 2025",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-cardano-ada-reach-1-00-experts-predict-ruvi-ai-ruvi-will-turn-a-2000-investment-into-960000-in-2025/,"Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.76 and is on the rise to $1 , a level many believe will make it a major player in the market. This optimism is fueled by bullish patterns like the inverse head-and-shoulders setup and an imminent Cardano ETF approval . While ADA is getting all the attention, another cryptocurrency is rising to the top – Ruvi . With its groundbreaking AI integration and high returns, Ruvi is carving out its own path to change the blockchain space. Cardano’s Journey to $1 Cardano has always been a pioneer, staying ahead of the curve as a trusted blockchain platform through innovation and market movements. Recent highlights of Cardano’s developments include: $0.75 Support Analysts say Cardano is defending a key support zone. A successful consolidation could take ADA to $1 and beyond . Bullish Patterns Breakouts from falling wedge patterns and the inverse head-and-shoulders setup mean ADA is ready to move up. Cardano ETF The upcoming Cardano ETF filed by Grayscale has increased the chances of ADA getting institutional exposure. Bloomberg analysts predict a 75% chance of approval, which will boost demand. With all these happening, it’s clear why Cardano is getting all the hype, but Ruvi is emerging alongside and that’s a whole different level of innovation in crypto. What Makes Ruvi a Game-Changer? Unlike Cardano’s focus on blockchain and smart contracts, Ruvi uses artificial intelligence to solve real world problems across industries. From predictive analytics to cutting edge applications in logistics and finance, Ruvi has more utility and a stronger narrative for future adoption. Why Ruvi Stands Out AI Powered Ruvi integrates advanced AI to provide actionable insights and optimized solutions, it’s more than just a digital currency. Limited Token Supply With only 5 billion tokens in supply, Ruvi’s deflationary model will create scarcity and drive price up over time.3. Real-World Use Ruvi’s application goes beyond traditional crypto trading, for businesses and individuals alike for wider adoption. Where Cardano is improving its technology to stay competitive, Ruvi is changing the way we think about AI cryptocurrency . Ruvi’s Record-Breaking Presale Getting in early on game-changing projects is where the big profits are and Ruvi is proving this true. The project has already completed a successful phase 1 presale, selling over 100 million tokens and raising $1 million . With over 1,000 investors on board, phase 2 is now open, offering tokens at just $0.015 – an entry point for massive returns. How Much Can You Earn with Ruvi? Ruvi’s presale is packed with bonus incentives . Here’s how your money can turn into life-changing returns: Entry-Level ($600) Tokens at $0.015 = 40,000 Bonus Tokens (20%) = 8,000 Total Tokens = 48,000 Value at $1 = $48,000 Mid-Level ($2,000) Tokens at $0.015 = 133,333 Bonus Tokens (60%) = 80,000 Total Tokens = 213,333 Value at $2 = $426,666 High-Level ($12,000) Tokens at $0.015 = 800,000 Bonus Tokens (100%) = 800,000 Total Tokens = 1.6 million Value at $3 = $4.8 million These numbers show how Ruvi’s model can generate huge returns, especially for those who act now. Ruvi AI vs Cardano Cardano’s strength is in its existing market presence and ecosystem upgrades like Ouroboros Leios to improve blockchain. While ADA is getting to $1, Ruvi is focused on AI and multiple use cases for long term growth. Where Cardano consolidates gains through tech innovation, Ruvi is disrupting the norm by adding artificial intelligence to the equation. Don’t Miss Out on Ruvi The cryptocurrency market doesn’t often give us a chance to be an early adopter of a future winner, and Ruvi is one of them. While Cardano’s ETF and $1 are milestones to watch, Ruvi is changing the conversation with its AI applications and deflationary tokenomics.

Powered by advanced algorithms and AI-driven analytics, experts are projecting Mutuum’s price to hit $2.5 shortly after launch, followed by a potential surge to $5 by the end of 2025. Looking even further ahead, many are optimistic that MUTM could reach a massive $25 by 2030, reflecting its utility and growing adoption in the crypto market. At $0.025 per token in Presale Phase 4, Mutuum Finance already has more than 10,000 investors and collected a total of $8.5 million. There are fast moving adopters in this phase with more than 80% of Phase 4 already sold. If you invest in phase 4, your investment will grow by 20% by phase 5 and up to 140% at launch. This is the time to enter. Investors are increasingly eyeing Mutuum Finance as one of the top cryptos to buy now, positioning themselves for the next big wave in decentralized finance. Mutuum Finance Gathers Steam Investor interest in Mutuum Finance is rising fast as its presale gains serious traction. At the current price of $0.025, buyers are positioning themselves for a 20% gain when Phase 5 launches and pushes the token to $0.03. With a planned market launch at $0.06, Phase 4 investors are eyeing a potential 140% ROI. Over $8.5 million has already poured into the project from more than 10,000 backers, and that number continues to grow. The platform diverges a lot from traditional methods since it embraces its buy and distribute strategy. Using this strategy, Mutuum Finance receives the market tokens allocated to stakers, which slowly helps to increase participation as well as improving overall project economics. Besides, a constant flow of incentives is provided in order to encourage ongoing engagement. Leaderboard Rewards System Boosts Engagement The Mutuum Finance platform now has a real-time leaderboard used to showcase the top 50 MUTM holders and community engagement. Keeping their position, gives users additional motivations, thus fuelling the atmosphere of rivalry as well as loyalty which increases the overall community involvement. Security continues to be a vital objective among the team behind Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance has tapped in blockchain security pioneer CertiK to carry out a comprehensive audit of the smart contracts. After the audit is complete, it will be possible to see on Mutuum’s social networks all results, providing the users to see for themselves the safety and credibility of their investments. MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance is also gamifying the user interface with a leaderboard of the top 50 holders of tokens, who are to be rewarded with additional MUTM tokens. On top of that, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on, with ten winners selected to each receive $10,000 in tokens. There is also a referral program running, which rewards users for helping to grow the platform through organic, grassroots outreach. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining attention as one of the most promising DeFi projects, and predictions for its price trajectory are creating serious buzz. AI-driven analytics forecast that Mutuum Finance could hit $2.5 shortly after launch, reach $5 by the end of 2025, and potentially surge to $25 by 2030. As Phase 4 is 80% sold out, the opportunity to buy in at $0.025 is slipping away. Investors who secure tokens now will enjoy a 20% price increase in Phase 5 and a potential 140% ROI at launch. Act fast, Phase 4 is almost gone, and this opportunity may not come again. Secure your position today before the price climbs.

While Stellar eyes a potential 126% breakout and Ethereum wrestles with inflation and slowing activity, Unstaked ($UNSD) is focused on performance over promises. Currently in Presale Stage 12, $UNSD is priced at $0.008997 with a projected launch price of $0.1819. That positions early participants for a potential 28x upside, grounded in an ecosystem that rewards measurable engagement, not speculation. Unstaked allows users to deploy AI agents that grow communities across X and Telegram, with every action recorded on-chain. Its $1 million campaign is also live, awarding 20 winners with $50,000 each for task completion, referrals, and a $100 purchase. With $2 million raised in 48 hours and no VC involvement, Unstaked is proving that real utility can still lead the conversation. Stellar Eyes $0.68 Breakout, But Volume Will Decide the Move Stellar (XLM) is gaining attention as it forms a promising bull flag alongside an inverse head and shoulders pattern. If confirmed, this structure targets a move to $0.681, a potential 126% increase from current levels. Analysts are watching for a breakout above $0.3021 with strong support zones between $0.25 and $0.26 offering a solid base. Momentum indicators add weight to the setup. The RSI is rising at 64 without signaling overbought territory, and MACD shows early signs of a bullish crossover. Still, Stellar has faced similar patterns in the past, and without consistent volume, timing becomes everything. Unlike Unstaked, the window here may not stay open long. Ethereum Faces Growth Pressure Despite 33% Rebound Ethereum (ETH) may have rebounded 33% this week, but its long-term strength is under scrutiny. The total ETH supply has reached a record 120.07 million, reversing the network’s deflationary trend. The Dencun upgrade reduced gas fees but also slashed the burn rate, raising new concerns about inflation. At the same time, on-chain activity is slowing as users shift to Layer 2 networks. Staked ETH has dropped from 35 million to 34.04 million, while ETF holdings have fallen by 400,000 ETH since February. As Unstaked introduces a reward-based AI utility, Ethereum’s broad narrative feels less aligned with high-growth potential. Unstaked Raised Over $6M in Presale Without VC or Hype Unstaked is not fueled by hype, it is built on verifiable action. At the heart of its system is the $UNSD token, which earns rewards only when deployed AI agents deliver real engagement across platforms like X and Telegram. These agents are not bots running on scripts. They interact, post, respond, and evolve. Every action is recorded on-chain, tying value to transparent output rather than passive holding. In just 48 hours, Unstaked raised more than $2 million, and total presale funding has now exceeded $6 million. That growth came without private allocations, seed deals, or VC padding. Every participant entered on equal terms. At a current Stage 12 price of $0.008997 and a fixed launch price of $0.1819, the potential upside sits at over 2,000% for early buyers. Adding to its momentum is the $1 million competition. This campaign will reward 20 participants with $50,000 in $UNSD each, but access is earned, not gifted. Users must refer others, complete engagement tasks, and purchase at least $100 worth of tokens to qualify. The structure promotes meaningful growth rather than empty exposure. With $20 million committed to launch liquidity, Unstaked is not offering vague promises. It is delivering a fully operational framework that aligns community action with measurable results. This is not a future vision. It is already working. Quick Recap Stellar has a strong technical setup and Ethereum continues to anchor the ecosystem, but both lack the early-stage advantage and performance-linked mechanics that Unstaked brings to the table. Their roles are established, while Unstaked is still expanding, giving it room to grow where others have already matured. With a $0.008997 entry price, over $6 million raised, up to a 28x upside window, and a $1 million giveaway in motion, Unstaked is more than a promising presale. It is proving to be one of the top crypto coins to buy in 2025 and possibly the most strategic early entry available right now.

Notably, the flagship cryptocurrency has seen a market cool-off in the past two weeks following a 10.7% price leap in early May. Interesting, a crypto analyst with X handle TATrader_Alan, popularly known as Trader Alan, has highlighted a bullish pattern that points to a price target around $115,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Strengthens Vs. Gold, Analyst Sees ‘Higher Than Expected’ Returns Bitcoin Climbs With Precision: $115,000 May Be The Next Stop Amidst an extended crypto market correction in 2025, Bitcoin prices crashed from $109,000 in January to less than $75,000 in mid-April. Since hitting the local bottom at $74,600, the premier cryptocurrency has recorded an impressive market rebound, rising by over 39.1% in the past month to hit a local peak of $105,800. In an X post on May 16, Trader Alan provided an interesting technical insight into this uptrend, highlighting that Bitcoin has repeatedly produced the same leap in dollar value, separated by a period of consolidation. The trading chart from the analyst explains that when Bitcoin surges approximately $10,000, it enters a 7-10 period of sideways consolidation before resuming its ascent. This bullish behaviour has been repeatedly seen with Bitcoin’s leap from $75,000 to $85,000, then to $95,000, and $105,000. Going by this pattern, the crypto market leader is tipped to hit the $115,000 target following a potential breakout from its current price consolidation. If this projection realizes, Bitcoin would achieve a 10.57% gain from current prices, breaking into a new price discovery. This kind of price movement is characteristic of a strong uptrend marked by healthy pauses. The consolidations typically allow the market to cool off after sharp runs, allowing traders to accumulate in preparation for the next leg higher. Importantly, these consolidation zones often act as new support levels, strengthening the bull market structure.

On May 15, the largest Bitcoin holders acquired an additional 2,180 BTC valued at $226,750,000, signaling a strong market confidence. Generally, large accumulations by Bitcoin whales are a typical bullish signal, especially amidst the current uptrend, signalling a strong potential for future price appreciation in line with Trader Alan’s prediction. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $103,281 following a 0.90% decline in the last day. In tandem, the asset’s trading volume is down by 15.76%, suggesting a decline in market interest.

In a sea of hype and speculation, CertiK-audited projects with actual products and traction stand out. As the calendar counts down to June 13, BlockDAG is stealing the spotlight with a massive reveal that could reshape its trajectory and investor portfolios. Here’s a curated list of the top 5 CertiK-audited crypto projects to keep on your radar right now, ranked based on momentum, utility, audit strength, and real-world activity. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) BlockDAG is hands-down the most talked-about crypto with real utility in 2025 right now. The hype is real and backed by numbers. With $253 million raised in presale funding, over 20.6 billion coins sold, and a staggering 2,520% ROI since batch 1, BlockDAG is charging into the market with unmatched momentum. It’s currently in batch 28, and the presale price is frozen at $0.0020 until June 13. But what makes BlockDAG more than just another coin is the delivery of real hardware. Miner shipments have begun, with delivery proof videos to be released soon. This isn’t a concept on a roadmap, it’s a functioning network that is putting hardware into users’ hands today. June 13 is when the big picture comes into full view. The GO LIVE reveal will unveil all 20 exchange listings, an upgrade from the original 10 promised in Keynote 1. Five exchanges, MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart, have already been confirmed. The remaining 15 top-tier listings will be announced during the event. Until then, the limited-time $0.0020 entry point is creating serious FOMO among early investors. Community engagement is spiking thanks to a growing referral program and heated Buyer Battles. BlockDAG is not just building hype, it’s rewarding participation and delivering results. For anyone searching for crypto with real utility in 2025, BlockDAG is the one to watch before the June 13 reveal. 2. Injective (INJ) Injective has consistently delivered strong DeFi infrastructure and maintains a clean track record with its CertiK audit. Its permissionless smart contract environment is tailored for decentralized finance applications, giving developers flexibility without sacrificing security. The native INJ token plays a central role in protocol governance and value capture, adding to its long-term appeal. Unlike many DeFi projects that are still in experimental phases, Injective has real adoption and product depth. It’s not just about the token price, this is a project with user-facing value. For investors looking at crypto with real utility in 2025, Injective sits comfortably on the shortlist. 3. Sui (SUI) Sui is built for speed. Backed by Mysten Labs and boasting one of the fastest transaction finality rates among Layer 1 chains, Sui is tailored for developers needing real-time responsiveness and low fees. Its infrastructure is CertiK-audited, and the ecosystem has steadily expanded to support tools, gaming, and smart contracts. While its price has seen fluctuations, the core technology is solid and increasingly attracting developer attention. With the narrative of scalable infrastructure gaining traction, Sui has carved a niche for itself as a crypto with real utility 2025 worth monitoring. 4. Kava (KAVA) Kava has been building steadily, integrating both Cosmos and Ethereum co-chains into its Layer-1 design. This dual support makes it compatible with a wide range of applications and tokens. Kava’s CertiK audit validates its security posture, and it’s already seeing traction in DeFi circles thanks to lending and yield farming products. Kava may not be the flashiest token on the market, but its slow and steady growth, coupled with a firm audit record, makes it a smart entry in the crypto with real utility 2025 category. 5. Aptos (APT) Aptos came in strong with backing from big names and a strong development team, and it passed CertiK’s rigorous auditing process. The network is known for its parallel execution model, offering high throughput potential. However, Aptos is still wrestling with adoption issues. Despite the technical horsepower, the ecosystem hasn’t grown at the pace investors expected. Still, with its secure foundation and development potential, Aptos remains a watch-worthy project. For those looking at early-stage upside within the crypto with real utility 2025 theme, Aptos could pay off if its user base grows. Final Take As the market sharpens its focus on tokens that offer more than promises, crypto with real utility in 2025 is the defining filter investors are applying. Projects with working products, security audits, and user growth are outperforming the rest. BlockDAG isn’t just checking the boxes, it’s rewriting the playbook with its June 13 GO LIVE event, real hardware deployments, and massive presale traction. If you’re not watching it now, you’re already behind.

While these assets still dominate headlines, investor behavior is shifting beneath the surface. The new beneficiary of that shift? MAGACOIN FINANCE — a smaller altcoin project that’s gaining serious momentum thanks to its community-first approach and powerful early-stage performance. Though not yet on major exchanges, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already attracting attention for one clear reason: ROI potential far above the market average . CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT XRP and Solana Remain Prominent — But Momentum Appears to Be Fading XRP entered 2025 buoyed by renewed optimism tied to regulatory developments, yet its growth trajectory has since moderated. Similarly, Solana (SOL), despite its robust ecosystem and consistent development pace, is beginning to show signs of liquidity fatigue — with much of the earlier upside already realized. In response, investors are recalibrating their strategies, seeking out early-stage assets that offer stronger entry points and more room to run. MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as one such opportunity — still in its early phase, attractively priced, and yet to reach broader market exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Lean Altcoin With Outsized Return Potential In contrast to major projects deploying extensive marketing budgets, MAGACOIN FINANCE has delivered notable performance with limited resources. On key campaign days when all elements align, its return per dollar spent has exceeded that of high-profile pre-sales — a rare achievement in a market often characterized by high funding and underwhelming delivery.

One standout altcoin, Mutuum Finance is drawing serious attention as a Solana alternative with DeFi functionality and long-term growth baked into its roadmap. Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Phase 4 which is over 80% sold out, already raking in over $8.5 million with over 10,000 investors participating. Investors have less time before this phase concludes. With a public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 4 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 140% by the time the token hits exchanges. This project is emerging as one of the best cryptos to invest in today, with market sentiment turning bullish and blockchain innovation accelerating. Analysts and early adopters alike are eyeing a potential surge to $5 by 2026, a move that could rival some of the top crypto gains of previous cycles. That altcoin is Mutuum Finance, a rising star that’s quickly becoming a top contender in the decentralized finance arena. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself through its innovative dual-lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, users can freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools where interest rates adjust dynamically. The P2P model, by contrast, removes intermediaries, giving users full control over their lending agreements. This combination creates a flexible and efficient lending system, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a strong coin for those considering what crypto to invest in or looking for the best crypto to invest in within the changing DeFi market. Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being third-party audited, and their open-source smart contracts are secure in design while creating trust among users. The platform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also set to be compatible with non-EVM and EVM blockchains, and the gates swing wider with more liquidity in other ecosystems. Presale Momentum At today’s $0.025, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token is of huge interest to early investors. A Phase 20% price jump in phase 5 will give the token a boost to $0.03. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there’s plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the most-watched low-market-price DeFi plays. Gamified Ecosystem and Community Incentives Mutuum Finance is also gamifying the user interface with a leaderboard of the top 50 holders of tokens, who are to be rewarded with additional MUTM tokens. On top of that, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on, with ten winners selected to each receive $10,000 in tokens. There is also a referral program running, which rewards users for helping to grow the platform through organic, grassroots outreach. As the market looks toward the next big altcoin, Mutuum Finance stands poised to be a top Solana alternative with its innovative DeFi lending model and explosive presale momentum. $8.5 million raised, 10,000+ investors, and Phase 4 nearly sold out, this token is attracting attention for good reason. At just $0.025 now, investors can expect a 140% return when the price hits $0.06 at launch, with some analysts predicting $3 to $5 in the coming years. Don’t miss your chance to get in early on this rapidly growing DeFi project, as the presale nears its end. Mutuum Finance could be the best crypto to buy now for 2025 and beyond.

UNI token dropped below $6 on Sunday, down from this month’s high of $7.5500. It has also tumbled by over 70% from its highest point in December despite some notable tailwinds. This article explores whether the UNI price has more upside to go. Uniswap has numerous tailwinds Uniswap, the biggest player in the decentralized exchange industry, faces some notable tailwinds that may benefit the UNI token in the future. First, despite strong competition from other decentralized exchanges, it still maintains its robust market share. A good example of this is what happened in the last 30 days when it processed transactions worth over $64 billion , a bigger number compared to its top peers. PancakeSwap handled transactions worth $51.1 billion, while Raydium and Meteora processed $26 billion and $17.8 billion, respectively. This growth is likely because Uniswap exists in more chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, and Avalanche. Second, Uniswap launched Unichain earlier this year, a process that has become highly successful. Unichain is a layer-2 network that aims to be a market leader in the industry. A few months after launch, it has already attracted over 20 developers, and more are on the way. DEX networks in the Unichain project have continued to attract users and volume. For example, Unichain handled over $318 million in the last 24 hours, making it the seventh-biggest player in the industry. It has handled $3.5 billion in the last seven days, a 18% increase from the previous week. Also, Unichain has cumulatively handled over $10 billion since inception. These numbers mean that Unichain has already overtaken some of the oldest and most popular chains in the crypto industry. For example, it has handled more transactions than Cardano, whose cumulative volume is $4.93 billion. It is also beating some popular chains like Tron, Avalanche, and Polygon. The other top Uniswap tailwind is that the network is making a lot of money as volume in the network jump. Data shows that Uniswap has become the second most profitable player in decentralized finance this year. It has made $357 million so far this year, beating other top players in DeFi like Lido, AAVE, and PancakeSwap. Uniswap price analysis UNI price chart | Source: TradingView The 3-day chart shows that the UNI price peaked at $19.42 in November and then retreated to the current $5.7. Its recent attempt to rebound found substantial resistance at the 50-day moving average at $7.54. The coin remains above the important support at $4.6763, the lowest swing on August 1 last year. It is also higher than the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since June last year. Therefore, UNI price will likely remain under pressure for a while and then bounce back once the crypto bull run resumes. Such a move will push it to the next resistance level at $15. A drop below the ascending trendline will invalidate the bullish outlook.

While ADA cools off after a 3% drop, trader sentiment is still looking up, with on-chain signals hinting at a rebound. Meanwhile, the latest Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis shows bullish pressure building fast, with top analysts calling for a $20 breakout as trading volume surges and resistance thins. But there’s another crypto quietly building momentum, one that analysts say could become the best long term crypto pick of 2025. Web3 ai is not just another AI token. Its tools are already live, offering real-time trading signals, portfolio optimization, and price predictions. The $WAI token isn’t hype, it’s utility in action. With more than $3 million raised and predictions soaring past $1, analysts believe Web3 ai is on track to become a blue-chip AI asset in the top 50 cryptos. Web3 ai Targets $1: Analysts Say It’s Just Getting Started Web3 ai is building an AI-powered ecosystem focused on real-time tools for crypto traders. From trade signals to portfolio optimization and price predictions, it’s all designed to run through one interface backed by powerful machine learning. While some platforms are still working on what to build, Web3 ai already has its blueprint, and analysts say that’s why $WAI is catching serious attention. Currently in its presale phase, Web3 ai has 50 total stages, with the token priced at just $0.000365 right now. By the final stage, that price climbs to $0.003267, and then hits $0.005242 when it lists. That’s a projected ROI of 1747%, a number that’s making traders reconsider their picks for the best long term crypto to hold in 2025. What makes this run-up more compelling is that Web3 ai’s value doesn’t just come from hype. The tools it’s building are rooted in real use cases: smarter trading, better portfolio moves, and cleaner exits and entries. This isn’t a general-purpose AI coin, it’s targeted, and it’s built for people who want an edge. With crypto narratives shifting toward utility and AI-driven innovation, $WAI is being called a future blue-chip. Analysts predict it could break $1 after listing and secure a spot among the top 50 tokens. For those hunting the best long term crypto, Web3 ai is turning into the one to watch. Bullish Momentum Builds: Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Points to $20 Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis shows the token pushing toward a breakout, with analysts like Michaël van de Poppe eyeing $20 as the next big target. LINK is already trading above $14.70, and the momentum is picking up fast. Daily RSI is near 62, trading volume is up 15%, and on-chain activity has jumped 12% in a week, these are the kind of signals that often trigger fast upward moves. LINK is also benefiting from positive sentiment in traditional markets. As the Nasdaq posts gains, crypto assets like LINK are seeing renewed interest. A key level to watch is $16.50, breaking it could trigger a run straight to $20. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis is now closely tied to rising institutional interest in DeFi infrastructure, and that’s where LINK continues to play a central role. Trader Sentiment Rises Despite Cardano (ADA) Decline The Cardano (ADA) decline of 3% over the last 24 hours reflects a short-term pullback, but trader confidence hasn’t disappeared. On-chain metrics show that most holders are sitting at a loss, and that usually reduces sell pressure. Sentiment data from Santiment puts ADA’s weighted score at 1.33, still on an upward trend, suggesting optimism is quietly building. Technical charts show ADA stuck between $0.76 and $0.84, with resistance holding strong for now. But if sentiment keeps climbing and selling stays low, ADA could break past $0.84 and test $0.92. The Cardano (ADA) decline might just be a setup for a reversal, especially with buyers showing interest again around support levels. Traders watching for medium-term moves are keeping ADA on the radar. Why Web3 ai Could Be the Best Long Term Crypto Pick The Cardano (ADA) decline hasn’t shaken trader confidence, with positive sentiment and reduced sell pressure hinting at a bounce from the $0.76 support. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis points to a run toward $20, as volume rises and momentum builds above key resistance levels. But the real story may be unfolding in Web3 ai’s presale. With $WAI currently priced at $0.000365 and projected to hit $0.005242 at listing, the potential 1747% ROI is turning heads. Its AI-driven tools will have the power to shape smarter trades, forecasts, and portfolio optimization. Analysts say Web3 ai could soon be viewed as a best long term crypto and expect $WAI to break $1 and land in the top 50 market cap rankings. In a cycle filled with noise, this looks like one of the few tokens with real utility and breakout potential.

As ETH and XRP face mounting resistance and regulatory delays, attention is rapidly shifting toward a rising opportunity that is already dominating the altcoin conversation: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Ethereum Faces ETF Drag Despite Upgrade Momentum Ethereum recently surged over 43% in early May , powered by the Pectra upgrade and renewed on-chain activity. However, that momentum has begun to stall. Despite institutional optimism, ETF outflows and regulatory hesitation are holding back a sustained move past the $2,600–$2,740 resistance zone. Even with support from the “Trillion Dollar Security Initiative” and AI network integrations, many analysts believe Ethereum needs in-kind ETF creation and staking approval before it can retest the $4,000–$5,000 range. Until then, Ethereum holders may face diminishing returns amid increased volatility and slower growth. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW XRP’s Legal Victory Fuels Hype — But Is It Priced In? XRP soared to $2.65 this month after Ripple finalized a long-awaited SEC settlement, unlocking funds and clearing legal hurdles. The approval of XRP futures-based ETFs and a likely spot ETF decision in June have made headlines — and rightly so. Yet analysts warn that much of the bullish news may already be priced in. With short-term targets around $2.85–$3.40 , many investors believe XRP’s biggest gains may be behind it for now, especially given overbought indicators and slowing network activity. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Talk Among Smart Money While ETH and XRP consolidate, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as the breakout altcoin attracting serious capital. Within minutes of launching, MAGACOIN FINANCE saw instant traction — with early buyers jumping in amid growing excitement over its decentralized, no-middlemen structure . Its momentum has only intensified since, with MAGACOIN FINANCE being described by insiders as a pure financial freedom asset — no banks, no institutions, just ownership and opportunity. Why Investors Are Positioning in MAGACOIN FINANCE Ahead of Exchange Listings As Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) navigate technical hurdles and ETF-related stagnation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a compelling alternative — offering the kind of early-stage growth potential no longer available in these established assets. Analysts monitoring on-chain activity have noted an uptick in large wallet accumulation, signaling growing confidence in the project’s ROI prospects before it debuts on major exchanges. With no institutional overhead and a community-driven framework, MAGACOIN FINANCE is resonating with experienced altcoin investors who are targeting the market’s next breakout performer. The project’s early traction was unmistakable — with significant capital inflows from its inception, it has quickly solidified itself as a strategic entry for growth-focused traders. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST What’s Fueling the Market Rotation Ethereum and XRP continue to encounter resistance and overbought technical signals Institutional participation in ETH ETFs remains underwhelming, limiting near-term upside XRP’s ETF-driven momentum appears increasingly priced in MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a clean slate — early, agile, and powered by a rapidly growing community High-volume wallet activity is accelerating, pointing to coordinated accumulation As market participants scan for stronger ROI setups, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping in to meet that demand — offering a timely, high-upside entry while legacy coins fight for incremental movement.

In particular, GateToken is gaining traction as part of its growing exchange ecosystem, and Bitget Token continues to expand globally with notable liquidity milestones. But amid these developments, one name is increasingly surfacing in serious crypto conversations— Qubetics ($TICS). More than just another token, Qubetics offers infrastructure-level innovation that solves a real bottleneck in today’s digital asset environment: cross-border transactions across multiple blockchains. Paired with a structured presale nearing $18 million raised, Qubetics is now making a case for itself as the best crypto to get rich—not just by hype, but by utility, traction, and math. Qubetics Bridges Chains and Economies with Real-World Applications Most token projects position themselves as “solutions,” but few offer tangible pathways to actually replace or improve broken legacy systems. Qubetics does exactly that through its robust cross-border transaction architecture. It’s designed as a Web3 aggregator—the first of its kind—that allows assets, contracts, and users to move across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, and beyond, in real time and without centralized bottlenecks. Imagine a logistics company in Mexico paying suppliers in India and freelancers in Germany—all with digital assets. Using Qubetics, they can streamline multi-chain payments, reduce costs, and eliminate the need for third-party conversions or bridge risks. Likewise, a decentralized payroll startup in Canada can manage on-chain salaries across Solana and Avalanche in one unified dashboard—courtesy of the Qubetics backend. This multi-chain orchestration is where Qubetics separates itself. It doesn’t just theorize interoperability—it builds it. For users searching for the best crypto to get rich, the practical value of being positioned early in a project that solves a core Web3 hurdle is difficult to ignore. Qubetics Presale Nears $18M—Is It the Best Crypto to Get Rich at Entry Level? The Qubetics presale is currently in Stage 34, priced at $0.2532 per $TICS token. Over 512 million tokens have already been sold, with more than 26,500 participants onboarded. What’s turning heads is the precision in timing—each stage lasts only 7 days, and every Sunday at midnight, the token price increases by 10%. This isn’t randomness—it’s a formula designed to reward early entries and reflect real-time demand. At the current stage, a $100 allocation yields approximately 394.82 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits $1 after the presale, that turns into a 294.84% return. If it reaches $5, the ROI becomes 1,874.21%. At $10, the value climbs to 3,848.42%, and a future price of $15 after the Q2 2025 mainnet launch could result in a 5,822.63% ROI, or $5,922.30 from a $100 entry. Such math explains why the Qubetics presale is being viewed not just as a strong early-stage project, but as one of the best crypto pre sale opportunities on the market. The utility, structure, and velocity of funding all reinforce its status as a serious contender for those seeking the best crypto to get rich —especially with the mainnet just months away. Bitget Token Expands Global Footprint Amid Growing Futures Volume Bitget Token (BGB), the native utility token of the Bitget exchange, has made significant strides this year. According to recent announcements and platform updates, Bitget has expanded its user base to over 25 million globally, with its derivatives trading volume consistently ranking in the top five across all exchanges. BGB plays a central role in Bitget’s growing ecosystem. It offers fee discounts, staking opportunities, and priority access to new token listings and launchpad events. More recently, the exchange has also expanded its Launchpool offerings, which has driven higher demand for BGB tokens in liquidity farming activities. However, BGB remains closely tied to the growth and performance of the Bitget exchange itself. While that’s not inherently negative, it means token upside is dependent on exchange volume and product rollouts. For those seeking exposure to high-volume platforms, BGB offers solid short-term positioning. But for those scanning the horizon for the best crypto to get rich, its reliance on centralized infrastructure could cap its ceiling compared to infrastructure-level plays like Qubetics. GateToken Gains Utility as Ecosystem Activity Ramps Up GateToken (GT), the native asset of Gate.io, has also gained renewed attention as the platform accelerates product launches and ecosystem initiatives. Over the past six months, Gate.io has introduced several high-yield structured products and upgraded its smart contract insurance layer—each one reinforcing GT’s functional relevance. Users holding GT now gain access to lower trading fees, early participation in startup projects, and yield enhancements on staking programs within the Gate ecosystem. Notably, the Gate Grants Program has channeled over $10 million into early-stage blockchain development, driving GT adoption among new builders. Despite this growing utility, GT still trades below its 2021 highs and faces heavy competition from other exchange-based tokens. Its upside is respectable but limited to exchange growth and ecosystem retention. While it may appeal to short-term market participants, it lacks the explosive ROI structure that Qubetics offers through its presale and real-world application. For community members hunting for the best crypto to get rich, GT appears more of a supporting role than a breakout lead. Conclusion: What’s the Best Crypto to Get Rich in This Cycle? Bitget Token is expanding reach, and GateToken is layering in new utility at the exchange level. Both play important roles within their ecosystems and could see consistent upward movement tied to platform adoption. But when it comes to structured opportunity, real-world utility, and long-term scalability, Qubetics is delivering at every level. Its cross-border transaction application, Web3 aggregator status, and precise 10% weekly price model in the presale—backed by $17M+ already raised—create a compelling financial and technological case. With the Qubetics presale still active, and its Q2 2025 mainnet launch on the horizon, early participants are positioning themselves at what could be the ground floor of the best crypto presale this year. For those asking what’s the best crypto to get rich without relying on hype or market noise, Qubetics is standing tall—fully built, fully funded, and just getting started. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the best crypto to get rich in 2025? Qubetics is emerging as the best crypto to get rich due to its cross-chain application, structured ROI model, and presale growth momentum. How does the Qubetics presale work? Each stage lasts 7 days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday. The current price is $0.2532, with over 512M tokens sold and $17M+ raised. Are exchange tokens like Bitget and GateToken still worth holding? Yes, they offer steady growth tied to platform success. But they may lack the explosive potential of infrastructure-based projects like Qubetics.

Mutuum Finance Phase 4 presale which is over 80% sold, is currently offering tokens at $0.025, with strong investor support driving the acquisition by over 10,000 buyers, raising a total of $8.5 million. Investors participating in this phase stand to earn a 140% profit when the token reaches $0.06 at its exchange launch. As the market heats up again, traders are wondering which crypto to buy today for short-term gains, and more importantly, which could be the next to hit $1. Dogecoin, with its loyal fanbase, still dominates headlines, but Mutuum’s utility-driven model could give it the edge in the 2025 bull run. Mutuum Finance may get there first. Dogecoin’s Road to $1: Hype or Real Possibility? Dogecoin began as a joke, but its journey has been anything but funny. With the backing of an enthusiastic internet community, Dogecoin has surprised everyone and stayed one of the top cryptocurrencies even without a clear use case. Its price surges are usually fueled more by social sentiment than utility, so it’s a volatile but fascinating short-term trading vehicle. Even though meme culture continues to fuel crypto investment, others remain convinced that Dogecoin has a shot at the elusive $1 price target. But in an ecosystem that is increasingly obsessed with utility and DeFi advancements, newer players like Mutuum Finance offer a more pragmatic path to long-term appreciation. Mutuum Finance Presale The investor support for Mutuum Finance Phase 4 presale continues to grow steadily throughout its development cycle. Buyers are investing in the platform due to its sustainable DeFi solution, which is built on a more robust development scale than typical meme coin volatility. So far, the presale has collected more than $8.5 million from investors while gathering over 10,000 token holders, an early sign that it could be one of the best crypto projects to watch as momentum builds. Early participants find Phase 4 tokens highly appealing because they are available at $0.025 during the ongoing phase. The platform launch will raise token prices to $0.06 at launch thereby delivering a 140% profit to Phase 4 investors. Analysts anticipate MUTM will achieve a post-listing price of $2.50 which would significantly enhance its market value. Investors can anticipate a price enhancement to $0.03 in phase 5 which indicates future price growth for MUTM. A recently unveiled dashboard of Mutuum Finance presents a leaderboard ranking of token holders where top 50 holders who stay in their position earn bonus tokens to boost long-term investor interest. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Dual-Model System Mutuum has a special dual-lending system. It combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) methods. This offers maximum flexibility. P2C System: Smart contracts through P2C System regulate lending pools by modifying interest rates according to market trends which provides lenders with financial stability while securing loans for borrowers. P2P System: This decentralized system removes middlemen. It creates direct links between lenders and borrowers. This gives both borrowers and lenders full control over the process. Dogecoin may still win headlines through hype and celebrity endorsements, but smart capital is flowing into platforms delivering real innovation. Mutuum Finance has already attracted over 10,000 investors and secured $8.5 million during its presale, which is now over 80% sold out. The current price of $0.025 won’t last long, Phase 5 will bump it to $0.03, and launch is set at $0.06, offering a 140% return as it hits the open market. Secure your MUTM tokens now or risk watching from the sidelines as others ride this DeFi rocket toward $1 and beyond.

Solana (SOL) continues to scale. Yet amid these large-cap movements, one emerging project is capturing sustained attention from seasoned market participants: MAGACOINFINANCE . As traders increasingly pursue early-stage entries with higher return potential, MAGACOINFINANCE remains at the forefront of the 2025 altcoin landscape . While ETH and SOL remain fundamentally sound, the data signals a clear trend — strategic capital is flowing toward MAGACOINFINANCE for its asymmetric reward profile and high-growth positioning. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Ethereum’s Recovery Is Not Without Limits Following a challenging start to the year, Ethereum is beginning to show signs of renewed strength. Growth in Layer 2 ecosystems and renewed focus on scalability, particularly from Vitalik Buterin’s latest proposals, have bolstered investor confidence. However, despite these developments, ETH’s price trajectory remains relatively constrained — influenced by its large market capitalization and mature valuation. In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE delivers what Ethereum currently cannot: meaningful upside potential. With a defined listing target and significant spread between current levels and projected highs, it is being positioned by traders as a rare-cycle opportunity that offers outsized return potential in a market that rewards timing and bold entry decisions. Solana Pushes Forward — But the Big Speculative Bets Are Still on MAGACOIN FINANCE Solana’s user base continues to climb, and DEX volume shows impressive strength. It is arguably the most efficient L1 on the market today. Still, the breakout potential is viewed as steady rather than exponential. That is where MAGACOIN FINANCE draws its strength — not from slow-and-steady adoption, but from being a high-momentum coin built for this exact kind of cycle . In a year where precision timing matters more than ever, it is no surprise that buyers are prioritizing entries that offer the clearest path to a 25x or 35x outcome — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is at the top of that list. MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Lead the 2025 Altcoin Rally Analysts reviewing altcoin trends across Q2 are already flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the few tokens that continues to build traction despite fierce competition. The reason? Its structure is intentionally designed to reward early positioning — and the market is responding. With limited supply access, clear ROI targets, and widespread visibility across trading circles, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to deliver the kind of setup that seasoned market watchers seek when the altcoin window opens . Its presence isn’t just about hype. It’s about precision timing, calculated entries, and a clear narrative heading toward listings — the same combination that has defined previous altcoin leaders. Final Take: Confidence Remains High While Ethereum and Solana deserve their recent gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in its own lane — and that’s exactly where many traders want to be. The confidence is not accidental. It is a reflection of the metrics, the mechanics, and the message behind MAGACOIN FINANCE. This is not a coin hoping to catch a wave. This is a project built to lead one . To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, please visit: Website: https://magacoinfinance.com Twitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance.

Although a short-term volatility is currently playing out, the long-term outlook is undoubtedly bullish. Related Reading: Analysis: Crypto Heats Up As $35 Billion Enters Market In Under A Month Some analysts are looking to long-term cycle indicators for direction. One such tool, the Golden Ratio Multiplier, which called the Bitcoin top in 2021, has resurfaced with another interesting top for the current Bitcoin cycle. Golden Ratio Multiplier Identified 2021 Top, Now Points To New Peak Taking to a post on social media platform X, popular crypto analyst CryptoCon highlighted the reliability of the Golden Ratio Multiplier in predicting Bitcoin’s price top in each cycle. The Golden Ratio Multiplier is a logarithmic model that incorporates Fibonacci-derived multipliers to anticipate Bitcoin’s macro trends. Notably, this metric was among the few to accurately call the April 2021 cycle top in real time, the same as the 2017 and 2013 price tops. This cycle, the model has already flagged a significant peak in March 2024, although the crypto analyst interpreted this not as the final high but as a mid-top. CryptoCon explained that Bitcoin’s price action has already hit Level 4 of the multiplier chart this cycle, but this isn’t the final peak. “We’ve already hit our cycle top level this cycle once, but this was for the cycle mid-top in March 2024, which means we’re bound to do it again,” he wrote. The Level 5 band now sits around $160,000 and continues to trend upward. Drawing a parallel to past cycles, CryptoCon noted that the structure of the current cycle shows strong similarities to the 2015 to 2017 period, when Bitcoin saw a gradual build-up followed by an explosive breakout. Based on this comparison, the current market phase is seen as equivalent to April 2017, right before Bitcoin went on a rally in the months that followed. Golden Multiplier Ratio Suggests $160k Is Next Major Target The chart accompanying CryptoCon’s post paints a familiar picture with the Golden Multiplier Ratio. Each band, ranging from Level 1 to Level 10, is based on a multiplier level derived from the 350-day moving average. Bitcoin has topped at various levels: Level 10 in 2011, Level 9 and 8 in 2013, Level 7 in 2017, and Level 6 in 2021. The current cycle’s peak should most likely be Level 5, but the Bitcoin price is yet to get there. Related Reading: ‘Judgment Day Is Coming’—XRP Set To Explode, Analyst Warns Should the market continue to respect this structure, Bitcoin could be preparing for a rally toward the Level 5 mark of $160,000 sometime later in the year, which could mark the final high of this cycle. The current range around $103,000 may well be the calm before the final breakout. “Slower buildup, then all at once,” the analyst said. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $102,971.

At its current price point, many are wondering whether this rising DeFi crypto has the potential to hit $5. With its innovative approach to decentralized finance and increasing adoption in the altcoin market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be on the brink of explosive growth. The project has reached Phase 4 of its presale surpassing $8.5 million in funding, backed by more than 10,000 investors. Currently priced at $0.025, MUTM will enjoy a 20% increase in the next Phase 5, reaching $0.03. Investors have already bought over 80% of Phase 4, meaning you have less time before it concludes. As MUTM continues to build momentum, it might not be long before it joins the ranks of the most talked-about projects, as investors eye it as a long-term investment in the crypto ecosystem. Mutuum Finance: Rising Star of DeFi Innovation Mutuum Finance is soon going to become a trendsetter in the field of decentralized finance (DeFi) with its path-breaking double-lending platform. By bringing Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models in an innovative manner uniquely, the platform has already caught a lot of attention. Already, over 10,000 investors have put in presale more than $8.5 million, depicting the very high confidence and appeal of the project. With the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token price of $0.025 during Phase 4, there should be a 20% appreciation in price when the platform enters Phase 5, with an early opportunity for meaningful profit prior to reaching the projected market listing price of $0.06. For those searching for the next crypto to explode, MUTM presents a strong case as a project with high upside potential. Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Lending Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) technological edge is its hybrid lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model permits users to make passive income by loaning the USDT to liquidity pools operated through the use of smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model on the other hand removes the middleman. It allows users to lend and borrow directly. This gives them more control and privacy. By combining these two systems, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as one of the best cryptos to invest in today. It offers decentralization, security, and efficiency. Gamified Ecosystem and Community Incentives Mutuum Finance is also gamifying the user interface with a leaderboard of the top 50 holders of tokens, who are to be rewarded with additional MUTM tokens. On top of that, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on, with ten winners selected to each receive $10,000 in tokens. There is also a referral program running, which rewards users for helping to grow the platform through organic, grassroots outreach. Mutuum Finance isn’t just another presale token, it’s shaping up to be a DeFi powerhouse as investors rush to secure positions before Phase 4 fully sells out. Over $8.5 million raised and 10,000+ backers signal growing market trust in MUTM’s vision. Early adopters buying at $0.025 could see a 140% return by launch and potentially a 20,000% surge if the $5 target by 2025 is reached, as some analysts predict. Momentum is accelerating fast, and presale slots are disappearing by the hour. Once Phase 4 ends, this price is gone for good, don’t wait until headlines announce the $1 breakout. Lock in your position now or risk watching others 10x while you’re stuck on the sidelines.

Dogecoin and Cardano are both making strides, one through price structure, the other via ecosystem investment, but it’s BlockDAG that’s capturing wider attention in early-stage strategies. With nearly $255 million secured in its presale and a fixed $0.0020 coin price until June 13, BlockDAG presents more than a bet, it offers a system backed by milestones. Its upcoming Go Live Reveal will confirm listings on 20 exchanges, five of which are already disclosed. Alongside this, miner shipments are already being fulfilled and the Buyer Battles campaign keeps driving participation by distributing 150 million BDAG daily. Unlike many passive presales, BlockDAG has built a campaign around transparency and ongoing delivery. While ADA and SHIB move forward with network progress, BlockDAG is presenting a compelling case as a next-generation Layer-1 network to watch. Dogecoin Aims for $0.27 as Technical Setup Strengthens Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to hold interest among short-term traders focused on technical signals. A familiar ascending triangle pattern is now taking shape, which often hints at a potential breakout to the upside. If DOGE manages to maintain its current support at $0.20, analysts suggest a move toward $0.27 could follow. Additional on-chain data adds weight to this outlook. Wallet activity has grown, and a rise in large transactions suggests whales are showing renewed interest. Historically, this kind of behavior has preceded wider retail entry, especially when chart patterns align. However, DOGE remains largely tied to market sentiment. For a breakout to sustain, the coin will likely need consistent optimism and possibly external triggers. Still, its renewed attention from traders makes it a key token to monitor in the short term. Cardano’s $225M Funding Push Highlights Long-Term Vision Cardano (ADA) is gaining traction following the reveal of a $225 million ecosystem development proposal. This funding is intended to drive forward protocol enhancements, decentralized apps, and governance improvements, further reinforcing Cardano’s efforts to stay relevant in the evolving blockchain space. Though some buyers are asking how the funds will be allocated and whether it may affect token supply, the market has responded with stability. ADA is currently holding around $0.78, with analysts identifying $0.80 as a key breakout point. If resistance at that level is surpassed, ADA may reach $0.85 in the short term. More importantly, the size of this funding round shows that Cardano is serious about competing with newer, faster-moving platforms by committing to its long-term development roadmap. BlockDAG’s Presale Framework & June Reveal Attract Serious Buyers While DOGE and ADA show signs of growth in their respective sectors, BlockDAG is emerging with a different kind of appeal, structure and clarity. With nearly $255 million already raised in its presale, BlockDAG is becoming one of the most heavily funded Layer-1 chains before launch. The upcoming Go Live reveal on June 13 is a critical moment, when all 20 exchanges supporting BDAG will be announced. So far, five exchanges have been confirmed: MEXC, LBank, Coinstore, XT.com, and BitMart. These names offer wide access and liquidity, which adds legitimacy to the listing roadmap. Unlike many early-stage coins that delay launches or hide exchange plans, BlockDAG is openly proving its progress before going live. It’s important to note that trading won’t start on June 13. The actual listing will occur once the $600 million presale target is reached. But with the coin price locked at $0.0020 until that reveal date, there’s a clear window for buyers to enter before market volatility begins. Beyond announcements, BlockDAG is actively engaging its community through a unique Buyer Battles system. Each day, 150 million BDAG are distributed among contributors, and if any coins remain unsold, the largest buyer receives them. This gamified structure keeps energy high and rewards those who commit early. Why BlockDAG Is Gaining an Edge in the 2025 Market Dogecoin and Cardano both present solid mid-year cases. DOGE’s bullish triangle pattern suggests an approaching move, while Cardano’s massive development budget underlines its growth ambitions. Yet BlockDAG offers something they currently do not, a confirmed, structured presale process backed by listings and real utility. With its price fixed at $0.0020 until June 13, five major exchanges already secured, and momentum building through both infrastructure and incentives, BlockDAG is fast becoming the most strategically positioned Layer-1 launch of 2025. For those seeking strong upside backed by measurable progress, the time to act may be right now, before this presale window closes.

While Ethereum (ETH) , Avalanche (AVAX) , and Cardano (ADA) maintain strong fundamentals, a wave of traders is now turning toward MAGACOIN FINANCE —the meme-powered altcoin drawing serious attention with real upside potential. Ethereum (ETH): Solid but Seeking Momentum Ethereum remains the dominant force in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 infrastructure, with a market cap nearing $291 billion . But with ETH consolidating in the mid-$2,400s and lacking short-term catalysts, traders are eyeing younger projects with sharper ROI prospects.

While its fundamentals remain intact, the growth pace has slowed—leading many investors to seek higher-beta altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE for better exposure to explosive moves. Cardano (ADA): Technically Sound, But Sluggish ADA is trading near $0.68 , supported between $0.63–$0.66 , yet lacks clear momentum. Long-term holders remain loyal, but fast-moving traders are chasing opportunities with immediate potential—and that’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the scene.

While the session lacked a clear directional push, he noted that this kind of pause often precedes a sharper move. CRYPTOWZRD plans to monitor the intraday chart tomorrow for a potential reversal setup above the $15.85 mark, which he views as the first sign of bullish intent. However, a sustained move above $16.80 would offer a more confirmed breakout and a stronger long opportunity, indicating buyers are beginning to take control. Can Chainlink Break Free From Current Stagnation? In his latest analysis, CRYPTOWZRD pointed out that LINK and LINKBTC closed today’s session indecisively, with daily candles reflecting weakness in the price action. While the lack of a clear direction is notable, both assets will need to see a surge in buying pressure from these levels in order to establish a new bullish trend. Related Reading: Chainlink Flashes Daily Buy Signal – Breakout Next? Particularly for LINKBTC, CRYPTOWZRD suggested that a potential push higher could materialize as Bitcoin dominance nears its resistance target. This rise in Bitcoin dominance could provide the necessary tailwind for LINK to gain momentum and transition into a bullish phase in tandem with broader market movement. For LINK, the $16 level has become an important support zone as a bullish reversal from this area would add impulsive price action, potentially driving Chainlink toward the $19.50 resistance target in the near term. If Chainlink breaks decisively above $19.50, CRYPTOWZRD anticipates a more substantial rally that could propel the asset towards the $30 resistance level. However, these bullish outcomes hinge on a consistent upside pressure and a healthy price structure to support the move. At this juncture, the market is waiting for the formation of the next trade setup, whether it be a strong reversal off support or a clean breakout above resistance, to provide momentum for the next significant move. Watch For Breakout Or Consolidation In conclusion, the analyst observed that today’s intraday chart was characterized by choppy and slow price action, with no clear direction established. Given the lack of momentum, the expectation is heightened volatility as the market works through these levels. However, the price needs to break decisively above the $16.80 intraday resistance level to trigger a solid long entry. Related Reading: Chainlink Just Retested Key Support – Here’s Where Price Could Be Headed Next That said, there is also the possibility that price may move sideways in the near term, consolidating within a range. If that occurs, $15.85 will act as the key intraday support target, where the market could find temporary stability before deciding its next move. With the current indecisiveness in the market, the best course of action is to wait for a well-formed chart pattern or a clear setup that provides a high-probability trade entry.

Let’s take a closer look at the latest price analysis and what could happen next. XRP Price Analysis: Key Levels to Watch On the daily chart, XRP recently fell below an importan t support line around $2.44, which is a short-term bearish sign. Right now, the price is finding some support near $2.30. If XRP breaks below $2.30, the next support level to watch would be between $2.10 and $2.15. On the other hand, resistance is now sitting between $2.43 and $2.44. If the price manages to move up, another major resistance lies at $2.60. Fibonacci Levels Show Strong Resistance Ahead Looking at the Fibonacci retracement tool, a key resistance zone known as the golden pocket sits between $2.55 and $2.62. If XRP breaks above $2.62 with strong confirmation (meaning daily candle closes above this level), it could trigger a bullish rally towards $2.90. Is There a Bullish Pattern Forming? There’s a chance XRP might form a large inverse head and shoulders pattern, a bullish chart formation. However, this isn’t confirmed yet. For this pattern to complete: XRP would need to drop further towards $2.10-$2.15 Then bounce back up towards $2.60 And finally break above $2.60 with confirmation If this happens, it could set XRP up for a strong rally, possibly pushing the price above $3 and towards new all-time highs.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-18 03:53:53

The chances of an ETF centered on Cardano are rising, now at 55%. Amid these shifts, could emerging player XYZVerse be poised to outdo the market with expected growth of 1.5 times? This article explores these developments and what they could mean for investors. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $13 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333 . At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Cardano’s ADA: A Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain designed for flexibility, sustainability, and scalability. It supports smart contracts, facilitating the development of decentralized finance applications, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and participate in staking on the network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more energy-efficient compared to traditional proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This structure enhances its ability to process a high number of transactions, potentially up to a million per second. Introduced in March 2021, Cardano’s native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. The platform’s focus on scalability and energy efficiency sets a new benchmark for blockchain technology. In the current market cycle, ADA’s features may appeal to users and developers interested in sustainable and scalable blockchain solutions. The technology underlying Cardano positions it as a significant option for those looking to engage with decentralized applications and smart contracts. Conclusion While ADA targets a 15% rise, XYZVerse’s innovative sports memecoin aims for 20,000% growth, offering early investors a unique, community-driven opportunity.

Unstaked has emerged with strong momentum, securing over $6 million in funding and drawing widespread attention. Its expanding community, upcoming AI-driven tools, and a five-month $1 million Gleam contest with thousands participating are placing it firmly in discussions about standout 2025 crypto stories. The key question is whether Unstaked can outperform established top crypto coins like Aave (AAVE) and Hedera (HBAR) in the upcoming rally. While Aave continues on a steady path and Hedera struggles with investor confidence, Unstaked is gaining recognition as a unique contender. This article outlines how Unstaked measures up against these well-known coins, and whether its budget-friendly stage price and expanding visibility could drive it toward the $1 milestone by 2027. Aave (AAVE): Steady Lending Protocol with Slower Upside Aave is still a leader in decentralized lending protocols. As of May 2025, the platform holds over $40 billion in deposits, mainly in its v3 protocol. Most of its activity comes from Ethereum and related assets, highlighting strong borrowing and lending demand. Despite these numbers, Aave’s price outlook points to modest gains. With Ethereum recovering to $2,500 and AAVE up 25% in the past week, analysts see slow and consistent growth. However, for those looking for steeper price movement, newer names like Unstaked offer a more compelling outlook. This gap between Aave’s solid tech and limited price action has created space for other top crypto coins with stronger appeal to users and more accessible entry points. Hedera (HBAR): Strong Infrastructure, Limited Price Lift Hedera has long been promoted for its enterprise-ready design. Its fast confirmations, low fees, and secure Hashgraph base give it strong appeal to sectors like supply chain, identity, and payments. Still, the Hedera (HBAR) price prediction remains unimpressive. Even with a 30% gain in the past month, HBAR has not sustained prices above $0.5, and the $1 target remains uncertain. Years of low price movement have cast doubt over its growth expectations. Compared to other top crypto coins, Hedera has had difficulty gaining attention from everyday users. The price and adoption disconnect continues to be a major barrier. Unstaked: Real-Use Features, Rapid Growth, and a Clear $1 Target Unstaked is quickly picking up speed, moving from an early-stage project to a standout with $6 million raised by Stage 12. The current price of $0.008997 remains within reach for everyday users, with its launch price set at $0.1819. This offers nearly a 27x growth chance based on current numbers. What makes Unstaked different is its plan to deliver simple, useful crypto tools. It aims to launch AI-powered agents that assist users in managing returns and navigating DeFi without confusion. This approach appeals to those looking for easier ways to engage with crypto tools. Its biggest draw is the ongoing $1 million Gleam campaign, a five-month giveaway offering 20 prizes of $50,000 each. To qualify, users must take part in social actions, refer new participants, and hold $100 or more in UNSD. Thousands have already joined, making it one of the largest promotions in the 2025 crypto cycle. This isn’t just exposure, it’s fueling growth through community involvement and awareness. Projections suggest Unstaked could reach the $1 mark by 2027, representing a potential 100x increase from its current price. Compared to Aave’s more conservative forecast and Hedera’s unclear outlook, Unstaked shows a faster growth route. Aave focuses on financial protocols, Hedera caters to institutions, but Unstaked is designed for individuals. As attention shifts toward ease of use and community support in 2025, Unstaked may emerge as a frontrunner. Final Words! With $6 million secured and its headline Gleam campaign gaining traction, Unstaked is standing out. Priced at $0.008997 and aiming for a $1 target by 2027, the growth possibility is significant. Against Aave’s gradual path and Hedera’s uncertain prediction, Unstaked holds a more exciting potential. Among the top crypto coins of 2025 , few combine strong interest and low cost like Unstaked does. For those entering early and aiming for large returns, this project could be one of the top names to track.

After a volatile start to Q2, both assets are showing early technical strength , raising the question: can they revisit their 2023 highs in time — or will broader market forces keep them range-bound? With inflation data cooling and traders beginning to rotate back into altcoins, Cardano and Ethereum are benefiting from renewed interest , but another project is quietly entering the conversation — and potentially offering something both lack at this stage: early-stage upside and faster momentum . Ethereum Rebuilds as Scaling and Sentiment Improve Ethereum currently trades above $2,500, a level that has been heavily defended in May. While down from its 2023 peak, the asset is showing resilience. Several bullish factors are aligning, including: A sharp uptick in Layer 2 network usage Renewed community support behind Vitalik Buterin’s new scalability proposals Rising transaction volume across DeFi protocols Analysts see Ethereum reclaiming its 2023 highs near $3,700 if the broader market breaks higher. However, many agree that while the long-term outlook remains strong, short-term gains may be more limited due to its size and current valuation. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW Cardano Eyes $1.20 With Momentum From Airdrop and Technicals Cardano, meanwhile, has been one of the most active large-cap performers this quarter. After successfully defending the $0.75 support level , ADA has surged on the back of: A massive multi-chain airdrop targeting over 37 million wallets Strength in Japanese trading volume and Grayscale fund performance An increasingly active developer ecosystem With targets now set at $1.00 to $1.20 , Cardano is in a better technical position than it was throughout most of 2023. However, like Ethereum, its gains are seen as steady rather than explosive — especially compared to emerging altcoin contenders. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Emerging as a Premier High-Upside Opportunity While Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) continue to evolve on the back of solid network infrastructure and institutional interest, a growing segment of the market is focused on early-stage assets with stronger upside potential. In this context, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing significant attention. Designed to reward early participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE features a fixed token supply of 100 billion and is targeting a future listing price of $0.007 . Currently trading well below that mark, it has drawn interest from analysts projecting 25x to 36x returns, should momentum persist through the end of the year. In today’s fast-paced market cycle — where early positioning and trend momentum are as critical as technical fundamentals — MAGACOIN FINANCE is being evaluated as a credible, high-upside opportunity with real structural appeal. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST Closing Perspective: Speed vs. Stability Ethereum and Cardano remain long-term pillars in the market, with strong upgrade paths, growing ecosystems, and continued relevance among institutional players. However, for investors seeking near-term acceleration and higher returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a rare blend of early-stage access, exponential growth potential, and pricing that remains in the discovery phase — offering advantages that ETH and ADA currently do not.

Analyst Reveals Top Altcoin For 3x Gains,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-crypto-pump-or-dump-this-weekend-analyst-reveals-top-altcoin-for-3x-gains/,"The post Will Crypto Pump or Dump This Weekend? Analyst Reveals Top Altcoin For 3x Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the weekend approaches, traders are wondering whether the crypto market will see a pump, dump, or move sideways. On The Paul Barron Network , analyst Evan Aldo recently shared his thoughts on the market’s short-term direction. According to Aldo, the market could either move sideways or see a small pump over the weekend. If he had to pick, he leans towards a pump but admits sideways movement is also likely. If You’re New to Crypto — What Should You Buy? For those new to crypto, Aldo was asked what he would invest in if he were starting fresh today. His answer was clear: Ethereum (ETH). Why Ethereum? Aldo explained that Ethereum looks strong against Bitcoin and has likely hit a bottom. He gave it a 90% chance of having bottomed against Bitcoin. It also appears to have made a local low against the total altcoin market (known as Total 3, which includes all coins outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum). Aldo believes Ethereum will likely outperform smaller altcoins for the next few months. How High Could Ethereum Go? While some market watchers are predicting long-term price targets between $6,000 and $7,400 for Ethereum, a few even suggest it could climb as high as $10,000 to $11,000 if momentum builds. But for now, analysts like Aldo are focusing on the next major target — $3,200 — as the first key milestone. If Ethereum can break that, it may pave the way for bigger moves by the end of 2025. One particularly bullish signal Aldo pointed out is a rare trigger wave forming on the three-week chart. Similar patterns appeared before major rallies in the past, like in 2020. While a huge 10x move is unlikely this time, a 2x or 3x gain could still be on the cards. What’s Next for the Market? Once the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, Aldo expects a full-fledged altcoin season — where smaller coins could surge and outperform Ethereum. Until then, he considers Ethereum a must-have crypto during this transition phase.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-18 04:08:40

Their consistent price activity has held investor attention through the second quarter. Now, a new name is gaining quiet traction: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Analysts are beginning to highlight it as a compelling early-stage candidate, positioned to challenge the dominance of established players like Solana and XRP. With capital increasingly flowing into earlier-phase opportunities, this emerging project is drawing interest from those seeking strategic upside. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Solana Shows Stability — But Signs Point to Slowing Momentum Solana continues to attract developer interest due to its efficiency and transaction speed, making it a preferred network for NFT initiatives and decentralized applications. Its technical structure remains sound, and the ecosystem appears fundamentally robust. However, recent May price action has shown signs of consolidation, with buyers showing caution near resistance levels. While Solana remains well-positioned long term, some market participants suggest the strongest gains may already be priced in — leading them to explore new opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which currently offers a more favorable entry profile with significant upside potential. XRP Keeps Surging — But Is It Overheating? XRP’s recent rise to $2.65 has been one of the most impressive moves this quarter. Boosted by ETF rumors and continued legal clarity, the token reclaimed its place among the top altcoins. Analysts expect a potential push toward $3.40 , with some projecting $5.50 by year-end if current sentiment holds. That said, XRP’s technical indicators now show potential overbought conditions , and the risk of consolidation looms. While the long-term story remains compelling, traders are beginning to explore other options — including tokens that haven’t yet made their big move. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Now Entering the Spotlight Amid this rotation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping into view. Originally known for its political meme appeal, the project has transformed into a serious contender for short-term and mid-term upside . What’s driving the shift? A presale entry still below $0.001 , with a listing target of $0.007 Bold analyst forecasts of 25x–36x ROI A capped supply of 100 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to early-stage investors Increasing crossover interest from XRP and SOL communities The structure is designed to attract buyers who missed the early runs in Solana and XRP — and who are now searching for a project still in its asymmetrical growth phase . Why Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Outperform Unlike Solana and XRP — both of which are already mid-run — MAGACOIN FINANCE is early , which means it offers something rare: maximum upside with minimal historical resistance . This makes it particularly appealing to: Altcoin traders who rotate capital aggressively Early buyers looking for potential parabolic setups Those who favor tokenomics over hype More importantly, MAGACOIN FINANCE is moving without noise — building momentum steadily, not explosively, which some analysts see as a sign of real staying power . EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Final Thought: Rotation Season Has Begun Solana and XRP have already delivered — and may deliver more. But for traders looking ahead, the opportunity may not lie in what’s already risen… but in what’s just now breaking through . In that light, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining ground for a reason — and it may not be long before it leaves “quiet momentum” behind and becomes the main headline .

With more traders stepping away from overpriced tokens, attention is turning toward earlier-stage assets with clear direction, smart tokenomics, and well-timed entries. One project making a quiet but meaningful climb is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a DeFi protocol currently available under $0.10 and projected by analysts to 20x within its first growth cycle. Still in presale, MUTM has started gaining traction as one of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in this month, thanks to its planned product rollout, structural design, and potential to deliver strong returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t priced low by chance—it’s still in the early stages of its lifecycle, and the team is actively building the foundation for real ecosystem utility. With a confirmed launch price of $0.06 and long-term forecasts ranging from $1.20 to $1.50. Unlike many early-stage cryptocurrencies that delay their product until after listings, Mutuum plans to launch a functional beta of its protocol shortly after the token goes live. This means that real activity—borrowing, lending, yield generation, and protocol engagement—will be in motion early, feeding directly into token demand. Imagine someone participating in the presale at a price of $0.025 per token. When the token reaches $0.50—a full 20x increase—a $1,500 investment would grow to $30,000. That’s a $28,500 return, earned by getting in early, before exchange listings and broader market exposure. It’s this kind of upside that has more investors viewing MUTM as one of the top cryptocurrencies to buy pre-launch. Mutuum Finance is focused on developing the foundation needed for sustained, long-term growth—well beyond just its current price point. The team has confirmed plans for: A Layer 2 deployment to help reduce gas fees and improve scalability once volume increases. A native, overcollateralized stablecoin that will be minted from protocol-secured collateral, helping drive consistent internal demand and liquidity within the ecosystem. A transparent security process, including an in-progress CertiK audit, giving both early investors and larger entities more confidence in the smart contracts powering the platform. These additions aren’t just technical upgrades—they’re core to what makes MUTM stand out from other new crypto coins. The stablecoin, in particular, adds a level of economic predictability and helps cement the token’s role in real financial activity—not just speculative movement. With the presale still ongoing and the token priced below $0.10, MUTM’s entry point remains one of the most attractive on the market. However, with each completed phase, the price increases—bringing new buyers in at higher valuations. Those who enter now are getting access before the token hits centralized or decentralized exchanges—meaning before public visibility scales and before price discovery begins. That early access is crucial. It gives investors time to build a position, understand the protocol, and benefit from the long-term upside that typically follows real product delivery and community growth. To reward early supporters, the Mutuum team is currently running a $100,000 giveaway. Information can be found on the official site, and anyone taking part in the presale by purchasing MUTM tokens becomes eligible. It’s a final incentive that adds to an already strong entry case—and another reason why this month may be the best time to move before wider adoption drives the price higher. MUTM isn’t a speculative meme token or a flash-in-the-pan trend. It’s a utility-first project building for users, with a system designed to grow based on protocol usage—not just attention. At under $0.10, it offers one of the most balanced risk-reward entries available today. With a clear roadmap, product near launch, and growing investor confidence, Mutuum Finance stands out as a top cryptocurrency to buy this month—especially for those seeking a strategic entry with real upside potential.

Everything from the user’s full name, home address and tax identification number will need to be collected and reported for every transaction, including the cryptocurrency used and the amount moved, the UK Revenue and Customs department said in a May 14 statement. Details of companies, trusts and charities transacting on crypto platforms will also need to be reported. Failure to comply or inaccurate reporting may incur penalties of up to 300 British pounds ($398.4) per user. The UK Revenue and Customs department said it would inform companies on how to comply with the incoming measures in due course. However, UK authorities are encouraging crypto firms to start collecting data now to ensure compliance readiness. The new rule is part of the UK’s integration of the Organisation for Economic Development’s Cryptoasset Reporting Framework to improve transparency in crypto tax reporting. The changes reflect the UK government’s aim to establish a more robust regulatory framework that supports industry growth while ensuring consumer protection. Related: Bitwise lists four crypto ETPs on London Stock Exchange UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves also introduced a draft bill in late April to bring crypto exchanges, custodians and broker-dealers within its regulatory reach to combat scams and fraud. “Today’s announcement sends a clear signal: Britain is open for business — but closed to fraud, abuse, and instability,” Reeves said at the time. A study from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority last November found that 12% of UK adults owned crypto in 2024 — a significant increase from the 4% reported in 2021. UK’s approach contrasts with EU’s MiCA The UK’s move to integrate the crypto rules into its existing financial framework contrasts with the European Union’s approach, which introduced the new Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation framework last year. According to the MiCA Crypto Alliance, one key difference is that the UK will allow foreign stablecoin issuers to operate in the UK without needing to register. There will also be no cap on stablecoin volumes, unlike the EU’s approach, which may impose controls on stablecoin issuers to manage systemic risks.

While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to headline the meme coin space, early movers are beginning to redirect their focus toward MAGACOIN FINANCE —a rising altcoin steadily gaining attention as accumulation picks up. Still flying under the mainstream radar, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a preferred early-stage play for value-driven traders seeking growth and reduced volatility ahead of the broader bull cycle. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE DOGE and SHIBA: Rotation in Motion Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently priced around $0.00002 , with a market cap of approximately $12.9 billion . Despite an impressive 2024 performance, confidence has wavered following the January 2025 departure of lead developer Shytoshi Kusama. Though the SHIB ecosystem remains vibrant, investor outlook is now more closely tied to market sentiment and speculation. Dogecoin (DOGE) , trading near $0.20 , remains a prominent meme coin. While Elon Musk’s periodic mentions continue to drive sporadic momentum, DOGE’s growth prospects lean heavily on hype rather than development. As such, seasoned holders are beginning to seek alternatives with stronger structural appeal. MAGACOINFINANCE – Early Accumulation & Rising Sentiment Against this evolving backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is exhibiting early indicators of breakout potential. Unlike meme coins reliant on celebrity backing, it’s being fueled by solid infrastructure, growing community traction, and credible positioning within the market. Investor activity has increased consistently throughout 2025 , supported by lower volatility and greater media visibility. A noticeable trend has emerged—capital rotating from high-risk meme plays into fundamentally sound projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE . Strategic Appeal and Analyst Confidence Though still in its development phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting attention from institutional circles. Several core factors are behind the optimistic forecasts: A fixed 100 billion token supply with robust pre-sale engagement A rapidly expanding community tied to roadmap milestones Structural upgrades boosting long-term scalability With capital inflows shifting from legacy meme coins to stronger emerging contenders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a key player in the upcoming altcoin rally. CLICK HERE – SECURE YOUR SPOT BEFORE 25x DISAPPEARS Conclusion: Sentiment Realigns Toward MAGACOIN FINANCE Investor focus is evolving—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a central beneficiary. While DOGE and SHIB remain relevant, the visible shift toward MAGACOIN FINANCE signals strategic recalibration by long-term participants. With accumulation steadily building and volatility remaining minimal, confidence appears to be strengthening. If the trend continues, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the defining success stories of 2025 .

Bitcoin has stagnated below $105,000, while the market cap of all cryptocurrencies has dropped by over 3% in the last few days to $3 trillion. This article provides a forecast for top altcoins like Onyxcoin (XCN), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Litecoin (LTC). Onyxcoin price analysis XCN price chart | Source: TradingView The Onyxcoin token has moved from obscurity into one of the best-performing players in the crypto industry. Its price jumped from a low of $0.00069 in September last year to $0.020 today, a 2,888% increase. The XCN token rally has caught many investors by surprise. For example, in January, Justin Sun warned that its performance was likely due to price manipulation, allegations that Onyxcoin rejected. Onyxcoin price has moved above the important support level at $0.0075, the lowest swing on April 7. It has also moved above the 50-day moving average, and most recently, is forming a bullish pennant pattern. This pattern comprises of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the Onyxcoin price rebounds and hits the important resistance level at $0.04923, the highest swing in January this year. It needs to cross that level to invalidate the double-top pattern whose neckline is at $0.00754. A move above that level will point to more gains, potentially to $0.1.

It then staged a strong comeback, moving to a high of $1.3115 on May 12 as the crypto market bull run intensified. Recently, however, there are signs that the WIF price has lost momentum and is trading at $0.9500. It is hovering at its lowest level since last Sunday. Dogwifhat price has remained above the 50-day moving average, a sign that bulls remains in control and that the ongoing pullback is merely a technical retracement. WIF price has also formed what looks like a cup-and-handle pattern, a common continuation sign. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the Dogwifhat price will continue rising as bulls target the initial resistance at $1.3115. A move above that level will point to more gains to $1.50. Litecoin price forecast LTC price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the Litecoin price has been in a slow uptrend in the past few weeks, moving from a low of $63 to a high of $106.90. Litecoin price moved above the important resistance level at $96.30, the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern. The head of this pattern is at $63, while the shoulders are at around $83. An inverse H&S pattern is one of the most bullish signs in technical analysis. Litecoin price has formed a break-and-retest pattern by moving back to the neckline at $96.30. Therefore, Litecoin price will likely have a strong bullish breakout, with the next point to watch being at $106.90 followed by $110. This rebound will likely happen as the LTC ETF odds jump.

Analysts are keeping a close eye on Bitcoin and altcoins, with signs pointing to a major rally just around the corner. Right now, Bitcoin is holding strong, and the chances of it falling back to $75,000 look slim. The market seems much stronger than before, and most people aren’t overly excited yet — which is usually a good sign for more growth. Altcoins Could Drop Slightly, Then Boom Altcoins have already seen a small drop, about 14%, but history shows they sometimes dip a little more before flying high. According to an expert, a quick correction of 10–20% might happen soon, but after that, altcoins are expected to surge in a big way. The good news? This dip won’t be as harsh as the ones we’ve seen in the past. There’s a lot of money sitting on the sidelines, waiting to jump in. That extra cash could help push prices up faster once the market turns around. Using historical fractals and timing analysis, the analyst sad that altcoins typically experience one final dip before surging in a bull run’s major leg. Drawing comparisons to market behavior from September 2024, he said that the altcoin index had previously dropped 18% before staging a 43% rally. “This time, the altcoin index has already dipped about 14%, suggesting there’s likely another 10–20% downside for altcoins before we enter a sustained uptrend,” he explained. Get Ready for the Next Big Move If the market follows the same pattern as before, there could be one final big move that takes prices to new all-time highs. It’s the calm before the storm, and those who stay ready could see big opportunities ahead. Right now might be a good time to clean up your crypto bags — drop the weak coins, hold onto the strong ones, and get set for what could be a powerful altcoin season.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-18 05:21:37

Meanwhile, XRP sits near $2.22 , with subdued movement amid waning ETF speculation and light trading activity. While long-term projections stay bullish, short-term action has prompted investors to explore more dynamic opportunities— MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one such alternative. 50% Bonus Active – Early ROI Outlook Signals Strong Entry Point Investor interest isn’t just reactive—it’s a proactive allocation. Projections indicate more than 3,000% return potential from current levels to the $0.007 target listing price. Contributing to that momentum: A 50% token bonus is currently available 100 billion token supply, with nearly half allocated to pre-sale Dynamic token pricing adjusts hourly amid increased demand Unlike many slower-moving projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE operates with a disciplined roadmap and precise milestones, attracting calculated entries. Analysts Forecast 25x to 35x Growth Into Year-End Analyst projections remain optimistic, suggesting 25x–35x ROI as CEX listings near. That’s backed by: A global marketing strategy in full execution Agency partnerships and verified influencer deals Ongoing negotiations for centralized exchange onboarding It’s this structured path that’s drawing long-term ADA and XRP holders to reallocate into what’s being called one of 2025’s most promising early-phase altcoins .

According to the firm’s Q1 Earnings Report , its Bitcoin strategy contributed 88% to its revenue of 877 million Japanese yen ($6 million). Metaplanet’s consistent BTC accumulation has also earned it the spot of the 11th-largest public company by bitcoin holdings globally and number one in Asia. Metaplanet Posts Record Q1 Financials From January 1 to date, Metaplanet has added 5,034 BTC to its balance sheet, increasing its holdings by 3.9x to 6,796 BTC. These purchases were funded by a moving-strike warrant program, which enabled the company to issue equity without setting a fixed discount or strike. As of May 10, the hospitality entity had executed 87% of the program, raising 76.6 billion yen ($524.8 million) and becoming the largest public equity issuer in the country. With the funds raised, Metaplanet has achieved approximately 68% of its near-term 10,000 BTC goal at a cost basis of 13.27 million yen ($90,929) per BTC. Although the company recorded a 7.4 billion yen ($50.7 million) unrealized loss on its BTC position by the end of the quarter due to market prices, bitcoin’s recent rally has fully reversed the losses. The firm reported unrealized BTC gains of 13.5 billion yen ($92.5 million) as of May 12. Evaluating its treasury performance, Metaplanet reported a BTC yield of 170% and a BTC gain of 2,996 BTC. These metrics measure the growth in BTC per diluted share and the BTC per shareholder unit. Embracing a Bitcoin Treasury Metaplanet said last quarter’s report posted the strongest financial result in its 20-year corporate history. The company’s core operating metrics and Bitcoin treasury key performance indicators (KPIs) also broke its records for the first time. The entity recorded an operating profit of 593 million yen (over $4 million) after an 11% uptick quarter-on-quarter. Revenue rose 8%, while total assets surged 81% to 55 billion yen (more than $376.8 million) within the same time frame. Due to the success of its Bitcoin treasury strategy, Metaplanet is urging other companies to consider adopting Bitcoin, offering its capital strategy as a blueprint. “Our results speak for themselves: we don’t set targets to feel safe—we set them to exceed them, quarter after quarter.

In a social-media post on Saturday, François-Philippe Champagne stated that about 70 percent of the counter-tariffs imposed in March remain active. That share covers roughly C$42 billion (US$30.1 billion) in goods from the United States, not including automobiles. On all these goods, a 25% retaliatory tariff rate will still apply. Champagne added that only some items for “health and public safety reasons” have been temporarily spared. More of the same falsehoods. To retaliate against U.S. tariffs, Canada launched largest-ever response — including $60B of tariffs on end-use goods. 70% of those tariffs are still in place. We temporarily and publicly paused tariffs on goods for health & public safety reasons. pic.twitter.com/qsLlxnzYlr — François-Philippe Champagne (FPC) 🇨🇦 (@FP_Champagne) May 18, 2025 Champagne’s statement challenges an earlier research report His statement challenges a 13 May report by Oxford Economics analysts Tony Stillo and Michael Davenport. The research firm noted that the recent exemptions were so broad they left Canada with “nearly zero” extra duty on U.S. products. The earlier report gave fresh new reasons to opposition lawmakers, who accused Prime Minister Mark Carney of not being transparent about the true scale of his tariff strategy. During the recent election campaign, Carney cast himself as the candidate best able to manage the trade dispute and promised counter-measures that would “cause maximum pain” south of the border. His Liberal Party secured victory in the 28 April vote. Tensions have been high since U.S. President Donald Trump imposed duties on a range of Canadian and Mexican products, including cars and trucks, despite an existing North American trade deal. Canada hit back first with a 25 percent tariff on selected American consumer goods, steel, and aluminum, and later extended the charge to vehicles built in the United States. These tariffs were first unveiled in March after Washington escalated the tariff dispute. Ottawa published a list covering consumer staples, metals, and machinery despite protests from several small firms. On 15 April, however, Champagne rolled out a series of six-month exemptions. Canadian firms may import items for manufacturing, processing, and food-and-beverage packaging without paying the tariff for the short term. Goods required for public health, health care, public safety, and national security are also exempt during this brief window. Automakers with plants in Canada, such as General Motors and Honda, can import certain vehicles duty-free under a “performance-based remission” scheme. Ottawa hopes the incentive will keep assembly lines in the country even as U.S. tariffs linger. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

In a detailed breakdown, SMQKE explains how Ripple, a fintech company that does not qualify for direct access to these accounts, leverages its partnership with core banking provider Finastra to integrate into the FedNow Service. HOW RIPPLE GAINS INDIRECT ACCESS TO FED MASTER ACCOUNTS VIA FEDNOW AND FINASTRA A Federal Reserve Master Account provides direct access to settle payments in central bank money through Fed systems like Fedwire and FedNow. These accounts are extremely hard to obtain,… pic.twitter.com/6ZbwDc0v3F — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 15, 2025 Understanding the Federal Reserve Master Account Limitation Federal Reserve Master Accounts are central to the U.S. payment infrastructure, enabling institutions to settle transactions in central bank money through systems such as Fedwire and FedNow. These accounts are tightly regulated and reserved exclusively for licensed depository institutions. Fintech firms, including Ripple, are not eligible for direct access due to regulatory requirements, making indirect access the only viable route for participation in central bank settlement. Finastra’s Integration with FedNow and Role as a Bridge According to SMQKE, Ripple circumvents the Master Account restriction through its strategic partnership with Finastra, a leading provider of core banking technology. Finastra is integrated with the FedNow Service and serves as an intermediary between private payment services and the Federal Reserve’s settlement infrastructure. The diagram shared by SMQKE shows Finastra Total Messaging facilitating connections between Ripple, Mastercard, and Thunes, enabling routing of payment messages across compliant channels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Liquidity Management Tool as the Key Enabler A central element of this structure is the FedNow Liquidity Management Tool (LMT). This tool allows for the transfer of funds between Federal Reserve Master Accounts and joint accounts that support private sector payment services. As SMQKE points out, this feature allows Ripple’s payment flows to settle through banks that do have Master Accounts, even though Ripple itself does not. The LMT enables service providers authorized by FedNow participants to initiate liquidity transfers. This mechanism makes it possible for firms like Ripple to participate in real-time settlement via banks that maintain direct access, effectively embedding their services into the central bank system without violating regulatory boundaries. Interoperability through ISO 20022 Standards FedNow’s support for ISO 20022 messaging is another key factor emphasized by SMQKE. This global standard ensures that structured data can move seamlessly across compliant financial platforms. Because Ripple’s infrastructure is ISO 20022 compatible , its XRP-based payment systems are interoperable with FedNow’s real-time messaging requirements. This compatibility supports seamless integration of blockchain-based payments into the traditional banking system. SMQKE’s analysis underscores the significance of Ripple’s positioning within this ecosystem. By aligning with Finastra and utilizing the FedNow LMT, Ripple participates in settlement processes using central bank reserves, despite lacking direct Federal Reserve access This model enhances Ripple’s reach in the U.S. payments space and illustrates how private fintech firms can legally and technically integrate with sovereign financial infrastructures through strategic partnerships and regulatory-compliant frameworks.

Participation is surging, investor traction is rising, and what began as a niche political token is now emerging as a full-fledged contender in the evolving altcoin landscape. This pre-sale phase did not slip in quietly. Earlier rounds closed out faster than projections, and the current phase is already drawing significant interest from retail buyers and crypto market analysts alike—many of whom now see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a frontrunner in Q2’s bullish rotation. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW Why This Phase Matters for Analysts Every new price tier in MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-sale doesn’t just reflect a price bump—it signals a structural shift in token distribution and investor incentives. With rising prices and reduced bonus allocations, analysts say the pre-sale model is driving urgency based on intelligent design, not just market hype. This latest stage builds on clear momentum: Over $8 million raised to date 20,000+ holders now confirmed Surge in engagement across Telegram, X (Twitter), and YouTube While many meme-inspired tokens peak quickly and disappear, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to maintain growth through consistent traction, transparent mechanics, and market-relevant appeal. Analysts Forecast 25x–35x ROI With Listing in Sight Investor interest is also being fueled by promising return projections. With a final target listing price of $0.007 , forecasts now indicate a potential 25x to 35x ROI depending on presale entry timing and launch conditions. Some estimates stretch even further, projecting 5,000%+ returns should market conditions remain favorable and upcoming partnerships materialize. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE is that its upside narrative isn’t rooted in speculation—it’s built on tokenomics, market timing, and a rapidly expanding user base. Rather than relying on fleeting influencer hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is leveraging political culture, scarcity mechanisms, and consistent delivery to establish itself as a durable altcoin force—especially in the meme-sector where volatility often dominates. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion: The Clock Is Ticking on Early Entry This newly launched phase marks more than just progress—it’s a decisive pivot point. Pricing continues to rise, bonus opportunities are fading, and those watching altcoin market cycles recognize that this is often where high-ROI windows close. With investor interest accelerating and visibility climbing across all major channels, MAGACOIN FINANCE is on track to become one of 2025’s defining projects. Analysts aren’t just tracking it—they’re calling it a primary driver of Q2’s altcoin surge.

At that price, anyone holding at least 10,000 XRP would find a portfolio valued at $1 million. But according to crypto veteran Armando Pantoja, the real challenge is not achieving sudden wealth—it is preserving it. $XRP skyrockets, you become a millionaire. What are you next steps? Drop a comment below pic.twitter.com/kwnl4DB1V6 — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) May 7, 2025 Pantoja, who has been active in the cryptocurrency space since 2011, believes that without a clear, disciplined financial strategy, most people are at risk of making irreversible mistakes once they gain significant profits. He emphasizes the importance of structured planning ahead of any major price breakout, especially one as life-altering as XRP hitting the $100 mark. Setting a Target: Define Your Financial Baseline Before Selling One of the first steps Pantoja recommends is identifying what he calls a “freedom number.” This figure represents the amount of money an individual needs annually to comfortably support their ideal lifestyle, including all essential living costs, discretionary spending, and long-term goals. He advises investors to calculate this monthly, then multiply it by 12 to get the yearly total. That number should then be doubled for emergencies, inflation, and unforeseen disruptions. This approach is intended to help individuals avoid underestimating their future financial needs. According to Pantoja, planning based on this framework provides a practical buffer and ensures that sudden gains can lead to lasting financial independence. Long-Term Thinking: Keep Your Principal Intact After such gains, Pantoja warns against spending or reinvesting the initial capital. He explained that the goal is to generate sustainable income through dividends, staking rewards, interest, or even real estate. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Keeping the original investment intact while building a portfolio of assets that produce recurring income is, in his view, critical to maintaining long-term wealth and building generational financial stability. He says this is the difference between becoming briefly wealthy and establishing a durable financial legacy. The Role of Preparation: A Detailed Plan Beats Improvisation Pantoja cautions investors against waiting until they become wealthy to start planning. Instead, he advises putting together a detailed, written plan in advance. This plan should include specific profit-taking points, where the money will be allocated, and how that capital will be structured to support a desired lifestyle. Importantly, he says this plan should be tested and adjusted before market conditions change. Doing so reduces the chances of making emotionally driven decisions when prices rise sharply. Could XRP Reach $100? As of now, XRP is trading at approximately $2.20. To hit $100, it would require a price increase of about 4,425%. Analysts remain divided on whether such a rise is realistic in the near term. Some optimists see a $100 target achievable within the next market cycle, potentially as early as 2025. Others adopt a more cautious view. Market commentator BarriC suggests that XRP could reach $100 between 2034 and 2040, citing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption as key variables. Meanwhile, crypto analyst All Things XRP stated that XRP can hit $100 without market cap concerns, pointing out that the market cap at that price, assuming a circulating supply of 58 billion tokens, would be around $5.8 trillion. DAG Managing Director Claver also weighed in on the matter, underscoring the significance of psychological discipline. He stated that even if XRP reaches $100, it may not transform your financial situation if you make critical investment mistakes. XRP’s path to $100 remains speculative, but the financial implications for holders are undeniable. Pantoja’s advice highlights the importance of preparation, emotional control, and forward-thinking strategy. For those holding XRP, achieving millionaire status is only the beginning; the ability to preserve and manage that wealth is what ultimately defines financial success.

According to the company's statement, the 30-day cumulative Open Interest Delta level has reached levels that were seen when Bitcoin tested new all-time highs in 2024, approaching $73,000. Alphractal analysts note that a distinct cyclical pattern is emerging in the market: a two-phase structure (Phase 1 and Phase 2), in which the increase and decrease in Open Interest Delta alternate. Usually, a strong increase in positions with a positive Delta is followed by a negative correction of almost the same magnitude. This indicates a regularly recurring cycle in the market. Related News: Analysis Company CEO Publishes List of 19 Altcoins Showing Strong Accumulation Signal The 180-day Delta data included in the company's analysis provides more striking signals. According to Alphractal: Sudden declines in delta usually indicate mass liquidation of long positions opened with high leverage. When delta turns negative, it often indicates market bottoms or accumulation zones. According to the latest data, the 180-day Delta is on the verge of turning negative. This suggests that there may be more volatility in the coming days, but it also indicates that a new consolidation phase may begin. The report also noted that Open Interest volume did not increase as strongly as it did from October 2023 to early 2024 and then from October 2024 to early 2025. These annually recurring trends may indicate that investor risk appetite is moving in a fractal pattern. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is History Repeating Itself in Bitcoin?

The token's price action shows resilience amid international trade disputes, with higher lows forming since recent dips while resistance remains firm around the $643-$645 zone. Decreasing volume volatility suggests energy buildup for a potential breakout, though direction remains uncertain as traders closely monitor both technical patterns and macroeconomic developments affecting market sentiment. Technical Analysis Highlights BNB traded within a narrow $9.67 range (1.52%) between $636.25 and $645.92 over 24 hours. Price formed a series of higher lows since the 13:00 dip, establishing support around $638-$640. Resistance emerged near $643-$645 with notable volume spikes during recovery rallies. Closing price of $642.59 suggests a neutral-to-slightly-bullish bias as BNB maintains position above mid-range. Decreasing volume volatility indicates potential energy buildup for a more decisive move. In the last hour, BNB showed bullish momentum, climbing from $641.21 to $643.09 (0.29% gain). Significant volume spikes occurred during upward moves at 01:54-01:55 when BNB broke above $642.60. A brief pullback to $640.57 at 01:32 established a strong support zone with aggressive buying. Hourly close showed consolidation near the high, suggesting potential uptrend continuation. Immediate resistance sits at $643.25.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/2-3-billion-xrp-in-24-hours-heres-the-significance/,"XRP experienced notable volatility in the past 24 hours, prompting concerns among investors. According to CoinGlass , the asset’s open interest is approximately $4.78 billion. The number of XRP tokens tied up in futures contracts dropped by 6.67%, signaling a potential weakening of confidence. This decline reflects a roughly 2.03 billion XRP in active futures commitments. In derivatives markets, open interest tracks the total number of outstanding contracts not yet settled. A significant drop in this metric can suggest reduced investor conviction or an unwinding of positions amid market uncertainty. Trading Volume Plummets, Price Tests Key Support At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.35, representing a daily decline of 2.6%. The token has been testing its support level around $2.30, contributing to a broader atmosphere of caution. Meanwhile, trading volume has contracted sharply, down by 38.82% to $3.2 billion. Analysts believe this pullback in volume is likely caused by profit-taking by short-term holders following XRP’s recent rally. The decline in market activity is also likely caused by heightened price fluctuations, as traders temporarily exit positions while awaiting further direction. Price Rally Earlier in the Week Reversed The current downturn contrasts sharply with XRP’s performance earlier this week, when it surged over 140% in value. During that rally, the token outpaced many other major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, which remained largely stagnant. That upward momentum, however, has since faded. The reversal has raised questions about the sustainability of XRP’s gains and the underlying factors influencing investor sentiment. A sharp rise followed by an equally fast retreat often reflects short-lived enthusiasm rather than a shift in long-term positioning. Regulatory Developments May Be Influencing Sentiment Some observers have linked XRP’s recent volatility to developments in the ongoing legal situation between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A recent update in the case, viewed by some as a setback , may have added uncertainty to the asset’s outlook. Despite this, a senior executive at Ripple has downplayed the impact of the legal update, stating that it does not affect Ripple’s operations or the legal standing of XRP. According to the executive, the situation is under control, without new regulatory risks. While XRP maintains a high level of open interest and significant market activity, the recent dip in futures positions and sharp decline in volume could be early signs of investor hesitation.

However, the tokens that stand to gain the most in this situation are actually low-cap gems that haven’t even come remotely close to mooning yet. One new altcoin in the frame is PayFi presale blue chip Remittix , which is being tipped for a 100x and beyond if Bitcoin does in fact reach $1 million – and leave PEPE , Kaspa, and XRP price forecasts in the dust. Here’s why. Kaspa price prediction: Is $100 possible if Bitcoin goes to $1M? Based on the Kaspa Power Law trend , it forecasts $100 per KAS in 8 years. The same is being tipped for Bitcoin, with $1M the target in 8 years. For Bitcoin to do that and raise Kaspa prices to $100, Bitcoin would have to garner widespread institutional adoption similar to gold (which could contribute another $2-3 trillion in market capitalization, roughly, mass enterprise adoption (accounting for another $2 trillion max), and retail growth in emerging markets. In 15-25 years, the trend says up to $1000 per KAS if demand continues. That’s along the lines of laughing at $1M per BTC 15 years ago. Source: CoinGecko Remittix upgrades cross-border payments Remittix isn’t chasing buzzwords, and it’s solving a trillion-dollar problem. This next-gen PayFi protocol lets users convert 100+ cryptocurrencies into fiat and push funds directly to global bank accounts. No delays, no FX fees, and no backlog. That’s true mainstream utility. Remittix uses localized payment rails to settle fiat payouts across 30+ currencies, from dollars and euros to pesos and naira, all through a sleek backend experience. And it’s not just for individuals. With the Remittix Pay API, businesses can accept crypto from customers and receive clean fiat in their bank accounts automatically. The market’s taking notice: over $15M raised in presale, and a $250K Gleam campaign pushing Remittix into the spotlight . With an exchange debut on the horizon, RTX isn’t just another token, and it’s a bridge to the real economy. PEPE and XRP price prediction: How high can XRP price go if Bitcoin hits $1M? Historically, XRP prices have always had a strong correlation with Bitcoin. It’s almost a foregone conclusion that if Bitcoin hits $1 million, XRP prices will ultimately follow suit. If, in theory, XRP captures a proportionality of 10% of Bitcoin’s market cap, that would amount to XRP prices running all the way from its current levels of $2.41 to a decent, near 20x at $21, assuming Bitcoin does run to $1M in the next 8 years. If XRP captures a 20% proportion of Bitcoin’s market cap, we may very well see XRP prices hit $42. XRP-BTC correlation. Source: Macroaxis The same can be said for frog-themed meme coin PEPE , but like Kaspa and XRP, the window for parabolic growth for PEPE has already come and gone in past bull runs. For investors looking for better gains, there are much better options than PEPE in 2025. Source: Coingecko The final word Bitcoin hitting $1 million isn’t out of the realm of possibility, but everything has to go perfectly in order for it to achieve a $1M valuation in the next 8 years. While Kaspa, PEPE , and XRP prices could surge to meteoric highs, the possibility of parabolic growth is no longer on the table, considering they have already been pumped. However, low-cap gems like Remittix are the best poised to turn in eye-watering gains—if Bitcoin does hit $1M, a 100x for RTX is child’s play.

In a new interview on CNBC Television, Lee says heightened optimism for 2026 and US companies thriving during hard times are signs suggesting the stock market looks more favorable than it did before Donald Trump sparked a trade war with numerous nations. “When we go back to February when the market was at all-time highs, we have to keep in mind, we had a lot of uncertainties ahead of us and we weren’t necessarily looking at 2026. The tariff visibility is much better today than it was three months ago, and when we look at 2026, I think there are things to look forward to, such as deregulation, tax cuts, and a [Federal Reserve] that’s on hold now but probably doing more cuts in 2026. From a company perspective, companies survived, I think, a black swan event. That waterfall of decline in equities and the near heart attack of the economy was an environment where companies produced earnings that beat expectations. I mean, this is the fifth stress test for businesses [and] when I put all that together, I think PE (price-to-earnings ratio) is probably going to be higher in six months than lower, and when you think about 2026 earnings having upside, I think there’s upside for stocks.” Lee goes on to say that investor sentiment shifting to neutral or positive could help stocks during the second half of the year. He also notes that institutional players are underexposed on the stock market. “We know a lot of institutions didn’t add risk back as the market rallied. So I think the pullbacks are going to be pretty shallow because investors just are underinvested at the moment. And then when you look at sentiment, it’s barely turning neutral now, so if investors have been fighting this rally, as they become more optimistic or neutral, that’s upside for stocks.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

ChatGPT Answers,https://cryptopotato.com/can-ripple-xrp-hit-10-in-2025-chatgpt-answers/,"TL;DR The cryptocurrency space is full of bullish and sometimes relatively ridiculous price predictions for members’ favorite assets, so we decided to ask ChatGPT for its opinion on whether XRP has the legs to make a mind-blowing surge to double-digit territory. It believes such a whopping 320% pump from current levels will require some “substantial developments.” $10 Mission Possible? The XRP Army, one of the most vocal communities in crypto, has outlined some massive predictions for the underlying asset, ranging from describing it as a modern-day Manhattan real estate opportunity to putting a future price tag of $100 . While these might sound a bit far-fetched at the moment, given XRP’s price of $2.38, we asked ChatGPT for another popular target – $10. After all, it would require a more modest 320% surge by the end of the year, something that Ripple’s token has done in the past – the last time was in late 2024/early 2025, when it shot up by even bigger percentages. The AI solution noted that the lawsuit resolution against the SEC, which is not officially over yet , even though both parties agreed to a $50 million settlement, has opened the door for XRP to gain further traction as it has “removed a significant uncertainty, potentially boosting investor confidence and institutional interest.” In terms of that institutional adoption, ChatGPT said a potential approval of a spot Ripple ETF in the States could skyrocket the underlying token’s price. The odds are relatively high, with Polymarket predicting a 79% chance for such a product to hit the US markets by the end of the year. Lastly, the AI chatbot outlined the overall crypto market dynamics. The arrival of the much-anticipated altseason, which has been highly speculated in the past few weeks, could be among the biggest gain drivers for the second-largest non-stablecoin alt. But These Challenges… ChatGPT believes reaching a $10 price tag is not an easy task and comes with its own set of challenges. One of them is the actual size of XRP in terms of market cap, as it would require the metric to shoot up to $580 billion or even more, given the billion tokens released every month. This would put it at levels almost twice as high as ETH’s current one. XRP also faces a lot of competition not only in the cryptocurrency space where investors can choose from thousands of altcoins, but in the traditional payment system where it serves as a cross-border token. As such, ChatGPT concluded: “While reaching $10 is within the realm of possibility, it would require a confluence of favorable factors, including increased adoption, positive market sentiment, and supportive regulatory developments. Investors should consider these factors and conduct thorough research when evaluating XRP’s potential.” The post Can Ripple (XRP) Hit $10 in 2025?

The policy, unveiled on 14 May, is meant to close tax loopholes, align with international standards and protect consumers from fraud. Mandatory data collection Exchanges, brokers and custodians will be required to record the name, address and tax identification number of both sender and recipient for every trade or transfer. They must also note the token type, quantity, sterling value and execution timestamp. HMRC emphasised that errors or late filings could trigger penalties of up to £300 per affected user. Officials urged companies to start gathering the necessary information immediately, even though technical guidance will be issued “in due course.” Balancing compliance and innovation Treasury staff say the mandate brings crypto disclosure into line with the transparency expected of banks and stockbrokers. Industry lobbyists, however, warn that small start-ups may struggle with the added cost of sophisticated know-your-customer systems. Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged the concern while introducing a draft bill that extends regulatory oversight to crypto exchanges, custodians and broker-dealers. “Today’s announcement sends a clear signal: Britain is open for business — but closed to fraud, abuse, and instability,” she told Parliament. Divergence from Brussels London’s plan integrates the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework directly into the existing financial-services rulebook. By contrast, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation creates a parallel licensing regime and imposes volume caps on stablecoins. Observers say Britain’s decision to allow foreign stablecoin issuers to operate without a domestic subsidiary could attract firms from across the Channel. Yet the divergence raises operational headaches for platforms serving both jurisdictions. Rising retail participation A Financial Conduct Authority survey last November found that 12 percent of UK adults held crypto in 2024, tripling the rate recorded in 2021. Policymakers cite the jump as evidence that clearer rules are now essential. HMRC previously relied on court orders to obtain exchange data, a process criticised as slow and adversarial. The new system flips the default, obliging firms to send annual reports proactively. Data will feed into a global exchange mechanism modelled on the Common Reporting Standard that already covers bank accounts. Treasury insiders believe uniform rules will also burnish London’s credentials as a responsible fintech centre in the wake of several high-profile exchange collapses abroad. They point to last year’s failure of offshore platform Globex, which left thousands of British investors scrambling to retrieve funds that HMRC could not initially trace. Consumer advocates agree that stronger oversight is overdue but urge the government to pair enforcement with public-awareness campaigns on phishing and romance scams. Civil-liberties groups remain uneasy, warning that centralised troves of transaction data could become lucrative targets for hackers. They are calling for end-to-end encryption of all submissions and mandatory breach-notification rules. Officials say security standards will be addressed in forthcoming technical guidance. Industry preparations RegTech vendors are pitching software that maps blockchain transactions to verified customer identities and generates ready-to-file HMRC returns. Larger exchanges are expanding compliance teams and consulting Big Four auditors on control frameworks. Smaller operators are pressing for phased implementation or de-minimis thresholds to avoid being priced out of the market. Lawyers warn that abrupt account freezes aimed at collecting missing data could trigger lawsuits, urging a pragmatic approach. Institutional investors, meanwhile, welcome the clarity, arguing that tax certainty will encourage pensions and insurers to allocate to digital assets. Looking ahead Secondary legislation fleshing out the details is expected later this year, giving stakeholders a final chance to shape the rules. HMRC plans educational campaigns to alert taxpayers to their obligations once the regime takes effect. Officials will publish annual statistics outlining the amount of previously undeclared crypto income captured by the new system. Analysts estimate the treasury could collect hundreds of millions of pounds in additional revenue within the first few years. Critics, however, fear that heavy-handed surveillance will drive traders toward decentralised platforms beyond regulatory reach. Regulators counter that most such protocols still rely on fiat on-ramps squarely within scope. As the 2026 deadline looms, British crypto companies face a stark choice: invest now in robust compliance infrastructure or risk fines and reputational damage later. Consultants say early adopters could gain a competitive edge by courting institutional clients who insist on high governance standards. Either way, the era of lightly regulated crypto trading in Britain is drawing to a close.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-18 07:14:50

Here’s an Expert Opinion,https://timestabloid.com/why-use-xrp-if-rlusd-exists-heres-an-expert-opinion/,"Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, recently addressed a common question within the cryptocurrency community: “Why use XRP if RLUSD exists?” RLUSD has been making waves since its launch in December 2024 , and exploring the uses of both assets shows their complementary roles and different purposes within Ripple’s broader financial infrastructure. People ask, “Why use XRP if RLUSD exists?” #XRP is the train, RippleNet lays the tracks, and RLUSD carries the cargo. The XRP Ledger is the foundation, with RLUSD as one tool built on top. As former Treasury Secretary Rosie Rios said, “The train has already left the station.” pic.twitter.com/zXYcZxFZDO — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) May 16, 2025 XRP as the Foundation of Cross-Border Payments XRP is the native digital asset of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), the foundational technology supporting Ripple’s global payment network, RippleNet. XRP functions primarily as a bridge currency , facilitating fast and cost-efficient cross-border transactions. RippleNet leverages XRP to provide liquidity on demand, enabling financial institutions to transfer value across borders without needing pre-funded accounts. This foundational role of XRP is emphasized by Aljarrah’s analogy that “XRP is the train, RippleNet lays the tracks,” highlighting XRP’s integral position in the payment infrastructure. The XRPL’s decentralized and high-performance nature allows it to handle large volumes of transactions with low latency, making it suitable for real-time settlement and liquidity management. RLUSD’s Purpose in the Ecosystem RLUSD was introduced to address use cases where price stability is paramount. Experts have explained that RLUSD plays roles that XRP cannot , like collateralizing loans or remitting salaries. RLUSD is designed to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the U.S. dollar, which is crucial for merchants, consumers, and businesses that require predictable value without exposure to cryptocurrency volatility. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlike XRP, which experiences price fluctuations inherent to cryptocurrencies, RLUSD offers a reliable medium of exchange and store of value for everyday transactions. This makes RLUSD particularly useful in scenarios such as retail payments, payroll, and other applications where stability is necessary. Distinct but Complementary Roles An expert recently clarified that RLUSD is not intended to replace XRP but rather to complement it. XRP remains essential for liquidity provisioning and cross-border settlement, while RLUSD is a stable transactional currency within the Ripple ecosystem. This distinction is critical because it highlights Ripple’s strategy to cater to diverse market needs. XRP’s volatility and liquidity make it suitable for international transfers and financial institutions, whereas RLUSD’s price stability supports everyday transactional use cases. The Future of Ripple’s Payment Network Aljarrah drew attention to former Treasury Secretary Rosie Rios’s statement, “The train has already left the station,” which captures Ripple’s momentum in developing a multi-faceted digital asset ecosystem. XRP and RLUSD are both integral components, each fulfilling specific roles that enhance the ecosystem’s functionality and adoption.

Despite macroeconomic headwinds, DOGE has maintained support above key moving averages while forming a potential bull flag pattern that could target $0.35 if validated by continued buying pressure. Technical Analysis Highlights DOGE experienced significant volatility with a 4.3% range (0.211-0.220) over the past 24 hours, forming a key support zone around 0.212 validated by high volume rebounds at 13:00 and 22:00. The price action reveals a bullish recovery pattern from the 16:00 low, with resistance emerging at 0.217-0.220. The 20:00 candle's strong volume surge above the 24-hour average confirms renewed buying interest, suggesting potential upward momentum if DOGE can maintain its position above the established support level. In the past hour, DOGE has demonstrated significant bullish momentum, climbing from 0.215 to 0.216 with notable volume spikes at 01:17, 01:21, and 01:54-01:55. The price established a strong support zone around 0.215 during the early minutes, followed by a decisive breakout at 01:16-01:17 where volume surged over 8 million. The uptrend continued with higher lows forming a clear ascending pattern, culminating in a new resistance test at 0.216-0.217 range. The final minutes saw particularly heavy trading activity with volumes exceeding 7 million at 02:01-02:02, confirming strong buyer interest and suggesting potential for further upside movement.

One of those is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale-stage cryptocurrency with strong utility plans and a growing base of early believers. With analysts now forecasting a price between $2 and $4 during its first major cycle, the current presale valuation under $0.05 is starting to look like a calculated entry point for strategic investors. These aren’t just speculative figures thrown around in forums. The projections come from a deeper look at the platform’s planned ecosystem rollout, protocol revenue mechanics, and early-stage fundamentals that align with tokens that have previously outperformed. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM’s bullish forecasts are based on two core ideas: supply alignment and organic value generation. Unlike many presale tokens that overinflate supply or rely solely on marketing buzz, Mutuum Finance is working toward utility from the start. Its ecosystem is being built around a non-custodial finance protocol that rewards activity, encourages retention, and funnels real value back into the token. Key features like smart-contract-based earnings, future governance roles, and capital-efficient incentives are drawing attention not only from individual buyers but also from mid-size DeFi-focused capital groups. The projected listing price is set to be $0.06, but the conversation is already shifting toward how high it can climb once the platform and integrations go live. When evaluating what cryptocurrency to invest in, especially pre-launch, that kind of structural planning often signals long-term viability over short-term hype.. Traders who specialize in early-stage opportunities understand how critical entry positioning is. At a presale price of $0.025, even a move to $2 would deliver a 7,900% return. When the token reaches $4, that would translate to a 15,900% gain—all from getting in before the public listing. But the strategy here isn’t just about price targets. It’s about aligning entry with ecosystem readiness. Mutuum’s internal mechanics, treasury allocation model, and product timeline are all designed to support healthy growth—without rushing the process. That factor alone is setting the project apart from the growing number of new cryptocurrencies. One area that hasn’t been talked about enough is how mtTokens, the interest-bearing tokens in Mutuum’s system, could serve larger roles within the DeFi space. Beyond simply representing deposits, they may eventually be used in third-party protocols or DEXs for additional yield or liquidity pairing. As decentralized finance continues evolving, tokens that carry built-in utility and measurable performance will hold more value in ecosystems beyond their origin platform. Mutuum’s early alignment with this principle adds weight to long-term price predictions. For investors exploring the best cryptocurrency to invest in, assets with this kind of flexibility and future composability are gaining more attention than short-lived hype tokens. It’s not just Mutuum’s roadmap that makes this entry window attractive—it’s market psychology. Often, projects that hit public exchanges with a working product, strategic reserve plans, and transparent token allocation outperform those built entirely around marketing. With its presale progressing and awareness starting to build, there’s a narrowing window where early entry comes at a fraction of future valuations. That dynamic is familiar to traders who got in early on altcoins like ETH and SOL before their first big cycle. MUTM now appears to be forming that same setup—still accessible, still overlooked, but structurally ready for the kind of growth that fits the $2–$4 narrative. Mutuum Finance isn’t aiming for buzz—it’s steadily delivering on a roadmap centered around real product development. For those weighing their next move and asking which crypto to buy today for long-term positioning, this may be one of the few presale tokens still offering real fundamentals below $0.05. With the platform’s full launch approaching, including deeper integrations and ecosystem expansion, entry at this stage looks less like a gamble—and more like a strategic decision. The price is still low. The mechanics are in place. And the $2–$4 window may arrive sooner than expected.

Let me explain in this why May 19 could change everything pic.twitter.com/fS4GaWXENC — J4b1 (@XRPJ4b1) April 27, 2025 XRP Futures ETFs Set to Begin Trading At the heart of this expectation is the anticipated launch of XRP futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the CME Group. This milestone is a potential gateway to the eventual approval of spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. Bitcoin and Ethereum saw substantial market movement following the introduction of futures ETFs before their respective spot versions. If XRP follows a similar trajectory, introducing futures-based funds could accelerate mainstream financial adoption. Over 70 cryptocurrency-related ETF applications are pending approval in the U.S. , with more than ten specifically tied to XRP spot offerings. This development increases the likelihood that spot ETFs will follow. The New Regulatory Environment The recent appointment of Paul Atkins as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) represents another significant shift. Replacing former chair Gary Gensler, Atkins is widely recognized for supporting market-accessible policies and fostering innovation within the financial sector. His leadership is expected to create a more open and constructive atmosphere for crypto regulation. The regulatory shift is already being felt across federal agencies. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has approved guidelines enabling U.S. banks to engage with cryptocurrency-related services , encouraging deeper involvement from major financial entities that previously hesitated due to regulatory ambiguity.

The long-standing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC is near its end . A settlement would remove one of the most prominent legal overhangs on XRP and could restore confidence among investors and institutions alike. Outside the U.S., XRP is already seeing progress. Brazil has launched the first XRP ETF . This international initiative shows growing institutional demand for XRP and demonstrates the token’s increasing legitimacy on the global stage. As J4b1 noted , XRP is shifting from a retail playground to a full institutional arena. Political sentiment within the U.S. also appears to be warming to digital assets. These developments, combined with possible geopolitical stability and easing tensions in Eastern Europe, may open the door for more risk-on investment behavior in global markets. With futures ETFs preparing to launch on May 19, token holders may be on the verge of witnessing a critical transition that could redefine their role in retail and institutional financial systems.

They arrested 12 people, nine men and three women, aged between 20 and 40, across several districts in mainland China and Hong Kong for their involvement. Now, they’ve all been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. Hong Kong officers seized over $98,000 in cash in one of their operations Hong Kong officers found about HK$1.05 million in cash, roughly worth $134000, over 560 ATM cards, several mobile phones, and bank documents in their raids. They also discovered that the laundering team actively recruited mainland Chinese individuals to open shell bank accounts and receive proceeds from fraud cases. Additionally, Superintendent Shirley Kwok Ching-yee revealed that the recruits used different bank cards to take out cash. They subsequently moved it to virtual asset exchanges to be converted into cryptocurrency before it was laundered. The laundering team allegedly also leased an apartment in Hong Kong’s Mong Kok area to organize and execute its money laundering operations. Chief Inspector Lo Yuen-shan revealed the syndicate ran its operation from a Mong Kok flat since mid-2024, where mainland recruits were housed to process illicit funds through shell accounts. She added that they caught two of the network leaders after tailing them from their flat. They trailed one into a bank and the other withdrawing cash from an ATM before the pair left to go to a crypto exchange shop in Tsim Sha Tsui. They confiscated around HK$770,000 in cash during the operation, or about $98,000. Additional arrests came after raids in several districts in the city. Lo claimed that over $1.2 million, roughly HK$10 million of laundered funds, were tied to 58 reported fraud cases. Fraud-related crimes had risen by over 12% in 2024 in Hong Kong Lately, police officers have been demanding stricter sentences against all those involved in money laundering, including those who let criminals use their bank accounts. Senior Inspector Tse Ka-lun of Hong Kong’s Commercial Crime Bureau argued that criminals often use their friends’ and families’ bank accounts to launder stolen funds. Money laundering offenders are currently up for about 14 years in jail and a HK$5 million ($640K) fine. However, for nearly two years, at least 100 people convicted of money laundering were given longer sentences, mostly additions of three to 18 months. Nevertheless, fraud-related crimes have been surging. In 2024, fraud cases rose by over 12% since 2023, with over 10,000 people arrested. Out of the 10,000 apprehended, over 70% were shell account holders. Not to mention, all the fraud cases in 2024 represented almost half of the total 95,000 criminal cases. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced new guidelines for crypto exchanges providing staking services in April. One of the new rules requires exchanges to acquire written approval before providing any services. Exchanges must also reveal all risks and information on fees, unstaking processes, outage processes, and custodial arrangements to clients. Additionally, the platforms must detail their staking activities to the SFC. Earlier, the commission also outlined a framework to enhance market access, diversify crypto products, bolster crypto infrastructure, and build relationships with industry players.

After gaining over 68% since its April lows, ADA is showing strong signs of recovery, but it must defend current levels to confirm continuation. This phase is critical, as price action tests a key demand zone that previously triggered significant upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Below ATH – Buying Pressure Weakens As Equities Outperform Adding to the bullish sentiment, on-chain data from Santiment reveals that whales have accumulated over 80 million ADA in the past 48 hours. This surge in large-scale buying activity points to growing confidence among big players, potentially setting the stage for a breakout. Whales often lead major market moves, and their renewed interest in Cardano may be signaling a sustained rally ahead. However, the $0.90 level now acts as a near-term resistance, and reclaiming it will be essential to unlock higher targets. The coming days are likely to be pivotal for ADA’s price structure. If bulls manage to flip this level, the next leg up could bring Cardano back into the spotlight—possibly reigniting broader altcoin enthusiasm in the process. Whale Accumulation Signals Strength: Buyers Push For A Breakout Despite this impressive rebound, ADA remains 43% below its December 2024 highs around $1.32. This gap highlights the cautious optimism that dominates the altcoin landscape. While bulls are gradually regaining control, overall market fear and macroeconomic uncertainty continue to pressure altcoins, many of which are still struggling to push through key resistance levels. ADA is currently consolidating just above the $0.74 level, forming a base that could precede a breakout. Market structure is tightening, and the next move—upward or downward- will likely be sharp. A decisive push above $0.90 would confirm a breakout and likely trigger renewed interest from retail and institutional investors. Fueling this narrative is fresh data from top analyst Ali Martinez, who reported that whales have purchased over 80 million ADA in the last 48 hours. This large-scale accumulation points to increasing confidence among big players and could act as a catalyst for further upside. Whale activity often precedes strong price action, and this development supports the idea that ADA may be on the verge of a significant move. As ADA consolidates near critical support and whale interest grows, market watchers are closely monitoring for signs of continuation. If bulls maintain momentum and break past resistance, Cardano could quickly shift from a consolidation phase to a full-scale rally, potentially reigniting momentum across the altcoin sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces Resistance Against Bitcoin – ETH/BTC Bullish Structure In Question Cardano Holds Crucial Support As Bulls Aim For Recovery Cardano is currently trading around $0.74, testing a key support zone after failing to hold above the $0.80 mark. The chart shows a strong surge earlier in May that brought ADA to local highs near $0.90, but since then, the price has retraced and is now consolidating just above its 200-day EMA (around $0.71). This level is acting as dynamic support and could be critical for the next move. The price structure suggests ADA is in a decisive phase. A breakdown below the EMA and the horizontal support around $0.72 could expose the token to a deeper retracement toward previous consolidation zones. On the other hand, reclaiming $0.80 would invalidate the bearish scenario and signal a potential push toward $0.90 and eventually $1.00—an area that marks strong historical resistance. Volume has declined slightly during the recent pullback, suggesting the retracement may be driven more by profit-taking than panic selling. The 200 SMA above at $0.80 remains a key target to watch for bullish continuation.

Blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain suggested that the investor made such an impressive feat by betting on Launchcoin, which is built in the Solana ( SOL ) ecosystem. At the moment, investors are turning to Remittix (RTX) to replicate similar returns for its holders. With the on-chain data spotting inflows north of $15 million, experts are making bold predictions of Remittix returning 100x returns when it launches. Let’s delve deeper! Remittix: The PayFi crypto with 100x upside potential Source: Remittix While Solana meme coins are cherished for their highly volatile ride, Remittix is gaining traction for one simple reason: it solves a real problem. Sending money across borders is still clunky, costly, and time-consuming, but Remittix makes it seamless. It lets market participants convert over 40 digital assets into fiat and send funds directly to any global bank account with no delays. With Remittix, the edge over traditional banks and even fintech competitors like Stripe and Wise is clear. Its PayFi protocol allows users to pay a flat fee with no hidden FX or wire costs; what’s sent is what’s received. The process is also as straightforward as any global transfer can be. The person receiving funds just gets a normal bank transfer without even knowing it originated from crypto. This is intentional because users get full control and flexibility while avoiding confusion on the other end. Meanwhile, Remittix opens doors for businesses, NGOs, and corporations. Its Pay API lets merchants accept crypto and settle in fiat to any chosen bank account. With this innovation, companies can easily and quickly pay international employees and freelancers with minimal fees. Transparent, Fast, and inclusive, Remittix has already raised $15 million in its presale, with more than two-thirds of its 750 million ICO allocation nearly sold out. At just $0.0757 right now and with a $250k giveaway underway, Remittix’s momentum can land smart money traders 100x during its launch. Why cryptos pump on the Solana network: A fertile ground for meme coins? Solana meme coins are booming. Besides, Launchcoin tokens like BONK and WIF have surged in popularity, drawing attention from smart money traders. Behind these impressive achievements is the Solana ecosystem, which is thriving according to Ali Martinez. In his X post , Glassnode reported that the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million in May. This rapid increase in smallholder wallets points to a rising wave of adoption and network participation, particularly as interest in the network intensifies. Source: Ali Martinez on X On the institutional front, Brazil’s B3 exchange will open Solana futures contracts on June 16 following regulatory approval. The SEC is now looking over Grayscale’s application for a spot Solana ETF. Polymarket, the largest decentralized betting platform , reports that investors are predicting an 82% chance for a SOL ETF approval. Conclusion While the Solana ecosystem grows, industrial experts are looking at another project to replicate Launchcoin’s latest rally. With the presale price now at $0.0757 and over $15 million raised, Remittix has the potential to surge 100x when it launches. Remittix’s undeniable utility within a lucrative sector has impressed both PayFi enthusiasts and crypto investors. For any smart money trader looking to get ahead of the curve, this market disruptor is not a project to pass up on.

Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg. After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and 225 Ether ( ETH ) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings. He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access. After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman’s funds were stored in a hardware wallet. He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase’s interface. Nine days later, a second caller claiming to be from Coinbase repeated the process. By the end of that call, all of Suman’s crypto holdings were gone. Crypto scammers impersonate Coinbase support.

Despite recent fluctuations, the asset is trading near $2.37 , reflecting an increase of approximately 374% from its price in early November 2024. This dramatic price movement has led to renewed discussion among analysts and community figures about the appropriate investment strategy for XRP holders. Crypto commentator and XRP community figure Vale has reiterated that holding at least 50,000 XRP is essential for serious investors. According to him, this amount should be viewed as a minimum threshold, especially in light of the evolving requirements to be ranked among the wealthiest XRP holders. I told ya’ll 50k $XRP is the minimum . Now like at how much XRP you need to be at just the 1% EXACTLY what I said —> 50,000!!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/ekBaHnT7BQ — KINGVALEX (@VALELORDX) May 16, 2025 Entry into XRP’s Top 1% Wealth Bracket Becoming Less Accessible Vale’s position aligns closely with current data from the XRP Rich List , which shows that an investor needs just over 51,000 tokens to be counted among the top 1% of holders. This figure has decreased gradually in recent months, making it appear more attainable numerically. However, as the token’s price has risen significantly, the financial cost of acquiring this number of tokens has surged, effectively making top-tier entry more expensive despite the lower token requirement. For context, in January 2025, the minimum amount of tokens required to reach the 1% threshold stood at 56,304. By April 1, 2025, it had dropped to 52,030. Most recently, that figure has declined further to 51,070. Though fewer tokens are required, the current market value of 50,000 XRP is approximately $118,500, well beyond what it would have cost just months ago. Historical Perspective on Accumulation Strategy Vale has long encouraged early and aggressive accumulation of the token. In late 2023, he publicly responded to a user who shared that they held 9,000 XRP, asserting that such a figure was insufficient for serious long-term positioning. He emphasized 50,000 XRP as a reasonable target even when the token traded for around $0.62, placing the total cost near $31,000. This stance remained consistent in October 2024, when Vale reiterated his 50,000 token recommendation in response to another investor holding 38,000 XRP. The token’s price hovered around $0.51 at that time, making the target cost roughly $25,500. Those who followed his advice then are now in a considerably stronger position as prices have soared. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investment Barriers Grow with Price Appreciation As XRP trades above $2.30, the cost to purchase 50,000 tokens now exceeds $118,000, more than four times what it would have cost less than a year ago. For new investors or those who hesitated in the past, reaching this benchmark has become increasingly difficult. According to the latest data, anyone aiming to join the top 1% XRP holders would now need to invest over $121,000. This rising barrier has reignited debate over how much XRP an investor needs to be well-positioned for future gains. While Vale maintains that 50,000 is the ideal minimum, not all analysts agree. Alternate Views on Reasonable Holdings Some industry participants believe a small amount of XRP tokens could yield substantial returns if the asset hits higher targets. For example, Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has proposed 10,000 XRP as a realistic and sufficient benchmark for long-term investors. His view suggests that while high accumulation may be advantageous, smaller positions could benefit significantly if the token meets long-term projections. With the asset continuing to draw institutional and retail interest, the debate around accumulation strategies remains active. While top-tier entry thresholds have declined in token count, their rising monetary cost highlights the challenges of late-stage accumulation.

After experiencing a significant dip to $2.307 on high volume, XRP has established an upward trajectory with a series of higher lows, suggesting continued momentum as it approaches resistance levels. Technical indicators point to a potential bullish breakout, with multiple analysts highlighting critical support at $2.35-$2.40 that must hold for upward continuation. Technical Analysis Highlights Price experienced a 3.76% range ($2.307-$2.396) over 24 hours with a sharp sell-off at 16:00 dropping to $2.307 on high volume (77.9M). Strong support emerged at $2.32 level with buyers stepping in during high-volume periods, particularly during the 13:00-14:00 recovery. Asset established upward trajectory, forming higher lows from the bottom, with resistance around $2.39 tested during 07:00 session. In the last hour, XRP climbed from $2.358 to $2.368, representing a 0.42% gain with notable volume spikes at 01:52 and 01:55. Price surged past resistance at $2.36 to reach $2.366, later establishing new local highs at $2.369 during 02:03 session on substantial volume (539,987). Currently maintaining strength above $2.368 support level with decreasing volatility suggesting potential continuation of upward trajectory.

Together, these assets represent a blend of institutional strength, technological innovation, and viral early-stage potential. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! XRP: Legal Clarity and Whale Confidence Powering Momentum Fresh off its court victories, XRP is rallying around $2.21 , and whales are making moves—now holding 12% of the circulating supply , according to Santiment. Analysts are eyeing key targets at $3, $4.85, and even $6.22 , fueled by renewed institutional inflows and favorable momentum. If this trend continues, some even believe XRP could challenge Ethereum’s market cap over the next cycle. While short-term volatility remains, the long-term setup looks stronger than ever. Kaspa (KAS): The High-Speed Underdog With Real Utility Often overlooked, Kaspa is building quietly as a top-tier proof-of-work network. Trading near $0.055 , KAS shows strong support and is targeting $0.11 in the coming months. With a unique BlockDAG architecture , growing developer activity, and consistent volume, analysts view Kaspa as a dark horse ready to shine in late 2025. Solana (SOL): Back With Strong Technicals and Ecosystem Growth After rebounding from April lows, Solana (SOL) is trading around $169.43 , supported by a bullish RSI of 73.70 and MACD crossover. Prices are now well above both the 100- and 200-day EMAs , reinforcing bullish sentiment. Experts are forecasting near-term targets of $180–$200 , with long-term upside pointing to $350–$370 if the Solana ecosystem continues its current expansion. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Undervalued Altcoin With 36x Potential HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY — THIS ENTRY WON’T LAST While the majors lead headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly becoming one of the most explosive early-stage altcoins in the market. With over $8 million raised , a presale price below $0.001 , and a target listing at $0.007 , early traders are lining up for 25x–36x returns . What’s driving the buzz? Scarcity-based tokenomics built for long-term upside Fully audited by HASHEX , boosting investor confidence A politically charged, meme-fueled narrative with viral potential Bonus opportunity: MAGA50X promo code delivers an additional 50% token bonus This isn’t just hype—it’s a structured, well-timed launch that’s gaining serious momentum. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion: 4 Coins Leading the Next Altcoin Wave XRP, Kaspa, Solana , and MAGACOIN FINANCE are shaping up as four of the most strategic plays heading into the next market leg. With a mix of established dominance and emerging explosiveness, these assets represent a strong blend of confidence, innovation, and early ROI positioning . If you’re looking to stay ahead of the trend, these are the names to watch— especially MAGACOIN FINANCE , which may still be flying just under the radar.

According to a May 14 statement from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rules will mandate that platforms record full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction must also be logged with specifics such as the cryptocurrency used and the amount transferred. UK Crypto Reporting Rules to Cover Companies, Trusts, and Charities The reporting obligation extends beyond individual users to include companies, trusts, and charities engaged in crypto activity. Firms that fail to comply or submit inaccurate data may face penalties of up to £300 ($398) per user. Authorities say they will provide additional guidance in the coming months but are urging businesses to begin preparations now. These changes mark the UK’s adoption of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Cryptoasset Reporting Framework, which aims to standardize tax reporting obligations across jurisdictions. “The UK is open for business — but closed to fraud, abuse, and instability,” said Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves in April when unveiling a draft bill aimed at bringing crypto exchanges, custodians, and broker-dealers under stricter oversight. The proposed legislation is designed to combat scams and fraud while enhancing consumer protection and boosting confidence in the sector. The policy shift comes amid rising crypto adoption in the UK. A Financial Conduct Authority study from November 2024 found that 12% of UK adults held crypto assets, up from just 4% in 2021. The UK just proposed a major shift in #cryptoasset regulation. The draft rules from @HMTreasury bring trading, custody, #staking and #stablecoins under existing UK financial laws, embedding crypto into the #FSMA framework rather than building a separate regime. A few key… pic.twitter.com/rLAtrioeay — MiCA Crypto Alliance (@MiCA_Alliance) May 9, 2025 The UK’s approach stands in contrast to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. While MiCA imposes stricter rules on stablecoin issuers — including volume limits — the UK has opted for a more flexible framework. Foreign stablecoin issuers will be allowed to operate without registration, and no cap will be imposed on transaction volumes, offering greater leeway for innovation. UK Trade Associations Urge Special Crypto Envoy Appointment Earlier this year, a coalition of leading UK trade associations called on Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government to appoint a special envoy for crypto and develop a comprehensive action plan to support the digital assets and blockchain sector. In a letter addressed to Varun Chandra, Starmer’s special adviser on business and investment, six UK digital economy organizations stressed the need for stronger strategic alignment to unlock investment, growth, and job creation within the crypto industry. In September 2024, the UK government introduced a new bill aimed at clarifying the status of digital assets, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), cryptocurrencies, and carbon credits, as “things” and “personal property” under the nation’s property laws. The UK has been among the countries that have ramped up regulatory efforts following some high-profile bankruptcies last year. The FCA oversees crypto activities, focusing on anti-money laundering measures and consumer protection.

According to Hong Kong Commercial Daily , the criminal syndicate used over 500 so-called stooge accounts (bank accounts opened or provided by third parties) to receive proceeds from fraud cases. The money was then funneled through local crypto exchange shops, effectively masking its origins. Crypto Laundering Ring Operated from Mong Kok Apartment, Police Say The group is believed to have operated out of a rented apartment in Mong Kok, where they planned and coordinated laundering activities. Authorities say more than HK$9.4 million ($1.2 million) of the funds can be linked to at least 58 confirmed fraud cases. The operation came to a head on May 15 after police surveillance tracked two suspected syndicate recruits leaving the Mong Kok base—one visiting a bank, the other an ATM. Both individuals later attempted to convert cash into cryptocurrency at a shop in Tsim Sha Tsui. Officers intervened before the funds could be laundered, arresting both on the spot and seizing around HK$770,000 ($98,540) in cash. Ten additional suspects, aged between 20 and 41, were apprehended soon after. During the raids, authorities recovered approximately HK$1.05 million ($134,370) in cash, over 560 ATM cards, several mobile phones, and documents linked to bank and crypto transactions. Senior Inspector Tse Ka-lun of the Commercial Crime Bureau stated that many of the bank accounts used in the scheme were provided by friends and relatives of those involved, often without understanding the full extent of the criminal activity. The arrests come amid a surge in fraud-related crimes in the city. Reports of fraud rose by 12% in 2024, with over 10,000 related arrests.

Hong Kong Intensifies Crypto Crackdown The crackdown coincides with Hong Kong’s broader efforts to tighten oversight of its crypto sector. Last week, Hong Kong Cyber ​​Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) announced the launch of a virtual asset analysis tool to aid in crypto crime investigations. Dubbed ‘CryptoTrace’, the tool is developed in collaboration with the University of Hong Kong, offering “advanced intelligence and investigation support to crime investigation units.” The Bureau said that they conducted virtual asset investigations and CryptoTrace training sessions in March. The course was aimed at strengthening the capabilities of frontline officers in handling virtual asset cases. In addition to fighting crypto-related crimes, CSTCB has been actively engaging with stakeholders across sectors. Titus, a legal firm in Hong Kong, noted that the city-state lost a staggering $3.1 billion in the first 10 months of 2024 to crypto-related scams. Additionally, the government recently exposed a sophisticated scam related to the fake “National Hong Kong Coin.” The scam misled the public into believing the government would soon launch an official digital currency.

As XRP’s price movements come under speculation following a recent court ruling, Unilabs is attracting investors, gaining over $30m AUM. Table of Contents XRP price dips to $2.40 following settlement setback Unilabs: The AI-based asset platform looking to challenge XRP Can Unilabs challenge XRP gains? Unilabs (UNIL), a new AI-powered DeFi platform, has been gaining traction after a successful presale launch, garnering over $30m in AUM. Ripple, on the other hand, continues to demonstrate strong potential within the crypto market. However, a recent court ruling has seen XRP’s price dip to the $2.40 level. Unilabs, currently in stage two of its presale, has already seen a 27% price rally, owing to early-stage investments for its transformative approach to automated asset allocation. As the platform continues to gain traction, many believe it could challenge XRP in terms of growth and returns. XRP price dips to $2.40 following settlement setback XRP witnessed a market dip following a key court decision in its legal dispute with the US SEC. Judge Torres rejected Ripple’s joint motion with the US SEC, pointing to multiple procedural violations. If the settlement had materialized, it would have reversed an earlier ruling and reduced Ripple’s previous penalty of $125 million. The news led to a market reaction that saw the XRP price dip to the $2.40 level. Despite the dip, XRP still holds a monthly surge of over 15%. If the crypto sustains momentum above the $2.40 and $2.50 levels, a breakout toward the $3.00 level could be next. This will also open the door for a potential retest of the 2018 all-time high. However, a rejection of the XRP price at its current level might trigger a dipping trend toward the $2.25 level. For now, technical indicators point to increased whale accumulation and institutional players, which could also propel XRP price gains in the coming days.

Unilabs offers a different kind of opportunity to investors, one that’s diversified, AI-powered, and still in its early presale stages. This has seen some XRP investors diversify into UNIL, attracted by its low entry price of $0.0051 and its potential in the market.

According to La Tribune Dimanche , Lagarde told the paper on Saturday that instead of the dollar gaining ground during global uncertainty like it usually does, the euro is the one going up. “It’s impressive to note that in a period of uncertainty when we should normally have seen the dollar appreciate significantly, the opposite happened: the euro appreciated against the dollar,” she said. Her explanation: people in the markets no longer trust how Trump is running things. Lagarde called the moment “counterintuitive” but not surprising. She said the dollar is falling because of what she described as confusion and loss of confidence caused by the president’s actions. In her words, “uncertainty is permanent and renewed daily” in the United States, and that is pushing investors toward Europe. She also said this isn’t a problem for Europe — “more than a threat, it is an opportunity.” She told the paper that now is the time for European Union leaders to move faster and finish what she called the job of integration. Lagarde calls for deeper EU integration to capitalize on currency change Lagarde explained that Europe is being seen as more reliable right now. She said the region offers a “stable economic and political area,” with a strong currency and a central bank that isn’t under any political pressure. She warned that the US can no longer claim that same kind of independence. She didn’t mention any names in that part, but she was clearly pointing at Trump’s frequent outbursts at the Federal Reserve. Lagarde warned that a central bank being controlled by politicians never ends well. “The independence of the central bank is fundamental to monetary and financial hygiene within a country or group of countries,” she said. “In every case where a central bank has found itself under the thumb of a fiscal authority, it has never ended well.” Lagarde also pushed for more reforms within Europe. She mentioned the digital euro and the single capital market as areas where momentum is building fast. “There is a groundswell more powerful than anything I’ve seen in six years in office,” she said. Lagarde added that the same type of united oversight already in place in Europe’s banking system should be expanded across sectors. The numbers back up what she said. ECB officials stress caution on rates, warn of inflation uncertainty The dollar has dropped this year against every major currency tracked by Bloomberg, including the euro. That’s not a coincidence. Investors are leaving the greenback behind as Trump continues to throw out unpredictable trade moves and threatens the independence of the Fed. His actions have created what Lagarde sees as a clear opening for Europe to step up. Luis de Guindos, her vice president, also commented recently, saying that the euro could become a real alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency. But like Lagarde, he said that would only happen if the EU does more to unify. Isabel Schnabel, an executive board member, made similar remarks the same weekend. “We now have a historic opportunity to further strengthen the international role of the euro,” she said. She called for quick action while the global trust in the euro is at a high point. She also addressed the rising value of the euro directly, saying that it should be read as a show of faith in Europe’s economy. “We now have a historic opportunity,” she repeated, almost echoing her earlier remarks word for word. But she also added one big condition — Europe needs a stronger bond market. She said a massive capital pool is necessary if the euro is going to play a bigger role on the world stage. That also means opening up the conversation on joint debt again, she said. “I do think that it’s not fundamentally wrong to also think about joint debt to finance public goods in Europe,” Schnabel told the podcast. That debate has come and gone before, but with the euro rising and the dollar sliding, European officials now see the moment as too big to waste.

MUTM’s early entry is closing fast,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/18/new-crypto-coin-with-a-buyback-model-mutms-early-entry-is-closing-fast/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is starting to gain serious traction in the DeFi space—not through flash or viral hype, but because of how its system is built to actually function. For many investors who rode the early success of speculative plays like Shiba Inu, Mutuum offers something different: a product-driven protocol that rewards actual engagement and supports sustainable token value. What’s attracting attention isn’t just the current entry price, which remains under $0.03 during the presale, but the fact that the platform is designed around working mechanics—lending, borrowing, and an automatic buyback engine that benefits long-term holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum’s lending and borrowing process revolves around liquidity pools where users can supply assets like ETH or stablecoins. When assets are deposited, suppliers receive mtTokens, which are tokenized receipts that increase in redeemable value as interest accrues. This interest comes from borrowers who tap into the pools by providing overcollateralized positions—backed by accepted crypto assets with a defined Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. The LTV is set based on the volatility of each collateral asset, meaning borrowers can only unlock a portion of their asset’s value, maintaining platform safety and reducing the risk of defaults. Interest rates for borrowers vary depending on pool utilization, and those same dynamics shape the APY that lenders earn, which adjusts in real-time. The higher the pool usage, the more attractive the return for those supplying liquidity. What makes the model even more appealing to those holding mtTokens is how the protocol uses a portion of the borrower interest. Mutuum executes buybacks of MUTM tokens directly from the market. Those tokens are then redistributed to users participating in the system—especially those holding mtTokens in designated reward pools. This cycle means that as borrowing activity grows, so does buying pressure on the token, all while rewards are fed back into the community. For early-stage crypto investors, this kind of setup hits all the right notes. And that’s exactly why many of those who previously gained from Shiba Inu are now allocating toward MUTM. The reasoning is simple: SHIB brought explosive returns, but lacked underlying utility. It was momentum-driven. Mutuum, on the other hand, offers a chance to enter a token at a similarly low price, but with an actual financial mechanism backing its growth. This isn’t about chasing hype—it’s about backing a system that’s built to reward the people who support it early. For those who got in on SHIB before the peak, the lesson was clear: timing matters, but holding something with long-term structure matters even more. Mutuum Finance is now offering MUTM tokens at $0.025 during its ongoing presale, with over 83% of the current phase already filled. Once this round wraps up, the price will increase to $0.03, ahead of the confirmed listing at $0.06, giving early participants a clear pricing edge. So far, the project has raised over $8.4 million, showing strong demand rooted in product fundamentals—not hype. With the beta version of the platform expected post-launch, this presale isn’t just early access—it’s a chance to enter before wider market exposure begins. Holding this token isn’t just about waiting for price movement—it’s tied directly to participating in a system that pays. Lenders earn from protocol activity. Token holders benefit from buybacks. And the entire model is aligned around on-chain behavior, not social campaigns or speculative waves. With the presale closing in on its final stages and the listing price confirmed at $0.06, those looking for strategic entries are watching the last remaining stretch before the token price adjusts upward. For investors asking what crypto to invest in with real upside and built-in utility, MUTM is increasingly looking like a smart decision—not just because of where it’s priced, but because of how it works.

This move, expected to lower the deposit facility rate from the current 2.25% to 1.75%, comes after seven consecutive cuts over the past year. The decision reflects concerns over weak inflation, soft economic growth, and currency effects tied directly to President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. Speaking to the Financial Times , Pierre Wunsch, governor of Belgium’s central bank and one of the 26 members of the ECB Governing Council, said the current environment “might warrant to be mildly supportive” of growth. That translates to interest rates “slightly below 2 percent.” Wunsch made it clear he wasn’t shocked by what markets are expecting. “The way I read them is that, somewhere around the end of 2025, we could be mildly supportive,” he said. This is a full reversal from his tone earlier this year. In February, Wunsch told the same outlet that the central bank should not “sleepwalk to 2 percent [interest rates] without thinking about it.” Now, he’s publicly floating the idea of going even lower. “I’m not pleading to lower interest rates below 2 percent,” he said, “but I’m open to contemplate this possibility.” Wunsch links rate cuts to Trump tariffs Wunsch explained that his change in stance followed Trump’s announcement on April 2 of sweeping tariffs on nearly every major US trading partner. The president slapped 20 percent levies on almost all exports from the EU, though that figure was cut to 10 percent on April 9 for a temporary 90-day negotiation period. Wunsch pointed out that the fallout from these tariffs adds “clear downside risks to inflation” and to growth prospects across the Euro area. He also pointed out that the euro’s appreciation against the dollar—which came after what European officials are calling “liberation day”—has made imports cheaper. That, combined with falling energy prices and the expected arrival of cheaper Chinese goods, could reduce inflation even further. In April, Eurozone inflation stood at 2.2 percent, just above the ECB’s target, but economists say the full impact of lower oil prices hasn’t yet shown up in consumer prices. Wunsch dismissed the idea that Germany’s €1 trillion spending plan to rebuild its military and infrastructure could do anything to stop this short-term slide. “Fiscal policy takes time before it becomes supportive,” he said. He warned the region could be hit with a “negative [economic] shock in the short term” before seeing a “positive shock in 2026 and 2027.” Kazaks sees few cuts left after June Martins Kazaks, Latvia’s central bank governor and another ECB Council member, said Friday on CNBC that the ECB may be approaching the end of its rate-cutting cycle—if the inflation outlook stays stable. “We are relatively close to the terminal rate already,” Kazaks said. He still sees room for a “couple” more cuts this year but stressed that policymakers should not move too fast given the ongoing uncertainty in the global trade environment. Kazaks also said that he considers the market’s expectations “appropriate.” He reiterated that any future decision will depend entirely on incoming data. Investors have priced in another rate cut for June, and they’re betting on more by the end of the year. The primary driver behind those bets: weakening inflation trends and economic headwinds from Trump’s trade policies. New figures from Eurostat added to the urgency. The bloc’s economy only grew 0.3 percent in the first quarter—less than the previous estimate of 0.4 percent. “The risk of a shallow, short recession is in my view still very significant,” Kazaks said. “Maybe not for the euro area as such but for specific countries by all means.

Shiba Inu price movement amid market shift Shiba Inu has seen a 6.14% price decline over the past week. However, in the past month, it surged by 23.12%. Over the past six months, the memecoin’s value dropped by 40.51%. The current price ranges between $0.000014 and $0.0000175. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0000180, and the support level is at $0.0000101. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 51.16. This suggests that SHIB is neither overbought nor oversold. If it surpasses the resistance level, it could see an increase of around 12%. Conversely, dropping to the support level would mean a decrease of about 20%. PEPE surges nearly 84% in a month: What’s next? PEPE has experienced a remarkable price increase over the past month, rising by 83.66%. Over the last weeK, the price has gone up by 3.61%. Despite thE upward momentum, the coin’s price is still down by 35.33% over the past six months. The current price of PEPE is fluctuating between $0.000012 and $0.000015. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.91. This suggests that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving room for movement in either direction. The nearest resistance level is at $0.000018. If the price breaks above this point, it could signal further upward movement. On the other hand, the nearest support level is at $0.000005. If the price falls below this level, it might indicate a bearish trend. Based on the recent positive price changes, PEPE coin could continue its upward trajectory. However, the neutral RSI suggests that the market could go either way. Traders should watch the resistance and support levels closely, as breaking through these points could lead to significant price movements of nearly 20%. Conclusion While memecoins like SHIB and PEPE have experienced significant growth in the past, their short-term potential appears less promising in the current market. The ongoing bull run is shifting attention toward projects that offer tangible utility and unique features, rather than relying solely on hype.

The unidentified trader offloaded 10,543 ETH worth approximately $26.1 million at an average price of $2,476 per coin, resulting in a $2 million loss in a sale executed in two days, according to the latest on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from Lookonchain on May 17. Details of the transaction show that the ETH was sold through a series of large swaps, most of which occurred within an hour. The trader used 1inch, a decentralized exchange aggregator, and multiple contract interactions to convert wrapped ETH (WETH) into stablecoins like USDC and USDT. ETH whale transaction.

Right now, protocols are stuck: cycling between incentive-driven inflows and inevitable outflows of liquidity as providers chase higher and higher returns. Even with existing bridging and wrapping solutions, because of concerns around complexity and security, most retail investors are unable to or unwilling to distribute their assets effectively across protocols. This leaves over $400 billion worth of idle assets locked across siloed chains whilst protocols across DeFi compete for limited liquidity, their demand vastly outsizing the available supply. Without a global liquidity to unlock these idle assets and enable a shared source of liquidity, DeFi will struggle to supplant traditional finance and reach global adoption. You might also like: The end of payment friction: Why stablecoins and on-chain liquidity are winning | Opinion The liquidity problem Traditional finance thrives on deep, integrated capital markets. The centralized structure of global banks means that liquidity thresholds can be proactively regulated to maintain solvency, and the sheer number of participants in permeable global markets means that there is always capital circulating within any given system. DeFi, by contrast, remains fragmented. A lack of compatibility between competing chains fractures the liquidity of an already small user base, whilst nontechnical participants may struggle to move their assets with the interoperability solutions that currently exist. This limits the capabilities of DeFi as a financial system; simply put, people are able to do less with their capital. This problem is captured in the one-two punch of stagnation and underutilisation. Without access to sufficient liquidity, emerging products struggle to maintain trading volumes, lending capacity, and user activity. To attract liquidity, new projects issue native tokens and offer high APYs or governance rewards. However, whilst these strategies succeed in the short term, this capital remains trapped within individual ecosystems. These ecosystems suffer from sharp outflows when rewards taper off or are bettered elsewhere, slowing down the growth of new and potentially innovative projects. We even see this manifest in formerly dominant protocols, with Ethereum ( ETH ) struggling in the last year. This has come from a cultural shift in DeFi away from promises of long-term utility and instead towards quick returns on memecoins based on Solana ( SOL ), drawing capital from one silo to another in the process. Both the symptoms and causes of some of these liquidity issues are the vast amount of underutilised capital across DeFi. Unlocking this capital also provides a key solution. When we talk about $400 billion worth of idle assets in DeFi, we are talking about ‘premier’ tokens like XRP ( XRP ), Bitcoin ( BTC ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ); tokens with a high market cap, but a comparatively low TVL. These tokens either lack the opportunity to be utilized effectively in staking and trading, or many of their holders lack the technical ability or interest to stake and restake for optimised yield. This represents a substantial imbalance in overall asset valuation and the associated DeFi protocol activity. If we could rectify this imbalance, there would be a flood of liquidity into the market. This would jumpstart the process of investment and innovation that DeFi needs. Towards a global liquidity layer If DeFi is to break free from the cycle of fragmented liquidity and short-term incentives, it must follow TradFi’s lead. Most importantly, it needs to develop a shared liquidity infrastructure to enable the frictionless flow of assets that prospective users have come to expect. The industry is not blind to these problems, and early steps toward global liquidity are already underway. Protocols like Wormhole and LayerZero allow smart contracts to complete orders across chains. Elsewhere, intent-based protocols and advancements in zero-knowledge proofs are beginning to push the boundaries of DeFi’s UX, making capital movement as simple as in TradFi offerings. A unified liquidity layer could create, for instance, an XRP market on Solana, a DOGE market on Avalanche ( AVAX ), and a Cardano ( ADA ) market on Base. This would enable DeFi projects to function like large-scale TradFi institutions, benefiting from deep and stable capital pools, reducing the need for constant incentive programs. Over time, this would eliminate the short-termism of APY wars, encouraging lenders to deploy assets with greater confidence, with a unified liquidity framework mitigating exposure risks without compromising returns. Capital would be fully utilised, liquidity would flow freely to where it is needed, and DeFi’s growth would accelerate. For retail users, this would be a breakthrough. With accessible cross-chain markets, retail investors could easily diversify their assets without having to navigate complex bridges or take unnecessary risks. Furthermore, simplified UX would lower technical barriers, making staking, lending, and trading accessible to users from day one. With reduced exposure, retail users could confidently engage in DeFi, driving adoption, introducing billions of dollars to new markets, and allowing DeFi to reach its lucrative potential. However, if DeFi is truly serious about global liquidity, major ecosystems must move beyond isolated solutions and establish shared standards through interoperable liquidity hubs or decentralized coordination mechanisms. Founders and developers must collaborate for a healthy and prosperous ecosystem, not compete for limited resources. The shift towards unlocking the free-flowing markets of DeFi’s future needs more than one single market-busting product. It will come from a sustained industry-wide effort: a cultural shift towards ambitious and user-friendly product offerings that take into account the needs of both the markets and the customers of the future. Conclusion DeFi’s liquidity problem is more than a matter of inefficiency; it points to structural, cultural, and systemic issues within the industry. Only a coordinated response will allow DeFi to reach its potential. The industry is locked in a cycle of short-term incentives, with key assets siloed and protocols competing for fragmented capital; without a structural shift toward a global liquidity layer, DeFi will struggle to scale, innovate, or offer real alternatives to TradFi. The foundations for this shift exist; it is perhaps even underway, but a coordinated response remains missing. For those that believe in DeFi’s mission, though, a future where liquidity moves freely across chains is non-negotiable; it’s the only way forward.

It writes code, runs tests, and creates requests to incorporate code changes on behalf of users. This helps accelerate the work of programmers in the cloud. OpenAI has launched Codex, a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) agent for software engineers. It is already available for ChatGPT Pro, Team, and Enterprise users, and will soon be available for Plus users. According to the official OpenAI blog, ”Codex is a software engineering agent that can work on multiple tasks in parallel: writing functions, answering code questions, finding and fixing bugs, and creating requests to incorporate code changes.” Each task is performed in a separate environment in the cloud that is preloaded with the user's codebase. Codex can read and edit files, run tests, perform analyses, and conduct type checks-all without Internet access, which guarantees secure execution. Codex is powered by codex-1, a special version of the OpenAI o3 model optimized for software engineering tasks. It has been trained using reinforcement learning on real engineering tasks to match human coding style and team standards. Users can interact with the agent through a sidebar in ChatGPT, giving it tasks or asking questions about the code. Codex captures its actions through terminal logs and test results, allowing transparent verification of each stage of execution. Early partners such as Cisco, Temporal, Superhuman, and Kodiak are already implementing Codex into their daily workflows. ”Codex helps us realize ambitious ideas faster by acting as a smart assistant for engineers,” Cisco noted. Additionally, at Temporal, the agent runs complex tests in the background without distracting developers. At Superhuman, even product managers can make minor code changes without involving an engineer-just with validation. OpenAI also released the lightweight codex-mini-latest model for Codex CLI, an agent that runs in the terminal. It responds faster to requests and is better suited for interactive code work. Codex is available now at no additional cost during the exploratory preview phase. A flexible pricing model is planned for the future. For example, codex-mini-latest is available in the Responses API at $1.50 for 1 million input tokens and $6 for 1 million output tokens, with a 75% discount for repeat requests. ”We envision a future where developers focus on core tasks and delegate the rest to agents. Codex is the first step toward that future,” OpenAI stated.",News|Ai,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-18 09:25:00

Many altcoins have marked more substantial gains in the past day, but most of them are reps of the ever-volatile meme coin niche. BTC Consolidation Phase Endures Bitcoin began the business week with some enhanced volatility following the trade deal struck between the US and China. At first, the cryptocurrency shot up to a multi-month peak of almost $106,000 before the bears took brief control of the market and drove it south to under $101,000 hours later. Nevertheless, the predominantly bullish sentiment prevailed and bitcoin remained within six-digit price territory. Moreover, it bounced off and spiked to $105,000 a day later where it found another rejection. The price moves repeated in a smaller extent but BTC overall managed to remain above $103,000. It slipped below that lower boundary yesterday, but that was also short-lived and now sits around $104,000. This has pushed its market capitalization to over $2.060 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has retraced slightly since yesterday, but is still above 60%. Yet, this hasn’t stopped many analysts from speculating that the altseason has started. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Memes Rebound Most altcoins have bounced off after yesterday’s nosedive. Ethereum has reclaimed the $2,500 level after a 2% daily increase, while XRP has neared $2.4 following a similar jump. More impressive daily pumps come from SOL, TRX, AVAX, and LINK. However, the meme coins lead in terms of daily gains. The largest of the bunch has soared by 5% to $0.22 while SHIB is up by 5.5% and sits above $0.000015. Even bigger gains come from the likes of WIF (11%), Fartcoin (9%), BONK (8%), and FLOKI (8%). PI has found a place somewhere between them with a 9% daily increase. However, Pi Network’s token is down by 19% since this time last Sunday. The total crypto market cap has defended the $3.4 trillion line and is up by $30 billion since yesterday.

MUTM Is Topping That List Right Now,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/whats-the-best-crypto-coin-to-buy-with-sub-0-03-entry-mutm-is-topping-that-list-right-now/,"When market sentiment begins to shift and early momentum returns to altcoins, smart investors focus on one key factor: strategic entry pricing. At the top of conversations around undervalued assets right now is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a new cryptocurrency that’s gaining serious traction while still priced below $0.03. With rising inflows and an active presale nearing its final stages, MUTM isn’t being overlooked anymore. It’s now widely considered one of the best crypto coins to buy ahead of the next market move, and for good reason. This project isn’t just a token—it’s a functioning DeFi protocol in development, with features that directly link utility to token value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum’s presale is currently in Phase 4, and over 83% has already sold out. The current entry point sits at $0.025, but that’s not going to last. The next phase will increase the token price to $0.03, while the launch price has been officially set at $0.06. Investors aren’t waiting for listings to get in. They’re moving now—because the setup is clear: early buyers are securing pricing that analysts believe could jump over 2,100% shortly after launch, with a projected surge toward $0.56. That forecast isn’t just based on sentiment—it’s grounded in infrastructure. The core reason behind this aggressive forecast is simple: utility-backed demand. The Mutuum team has announced that a beta release of the platform will go live alongside the token’s official launch. That means users will be able to access live features—borrowing, lending, stablecoin interactions—right as the token hits the market. That alone changes the post-launch dynamic. Most new crypto coins debut without working products, relying on hype alone. Mutuum’s different. The foundation is being built in parallel with the token, and that’s one of the main reasons investors are viewing it as a top cryptocurrency to invest in—not later, but right now. The buzz doesn’t stop at product readiness either. With active platform mechanics and liquidity engagement in place, MUTM is expected to be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges shortly after launch. Higher-tier listings bring visibility, and with that comes demand—which could further accelerate the token’s rise in value. What’s Powering the Protocol? Lending & Borrowing: Users can lend assets like ETH or stablecoins and earn returns. Borrowers overcollateralize their loans, protecting liquidity while giving users access to short-term capital. P2C & P2P Models: Mutuum offers Peer-to-Contract lending for those seeking a hands-off way to earn passive income, while its Peer-to-Peer model allows users to create tailored loan agreements directly with other participants. Buyback Mechanism: A portion of borrower interest is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, redistributing them to active users. This ensures that token demand is always linked to actual platform use. Stablecoin Utility: The protocol is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, minted from excess collateral in lending markets, and algorithmically pegged to USD value. Layer 2 Compatibility: Mutuum is preparing for Layer 2 integration, reducing gas fees and ensuring smooth operation as the platform scales. Audit Underway: To reinforce user trust, the project is undergoing a security audit by CertiK, one of the most respected firms in blockchain smart contract verification. To further incentivize early participation, the Mutuum team has introduced a $100,000 giveaway exclusively for presale contributors. Anyone who purchases during the presale has the opportunity to qualify, with full details available on the official platform. It’s another reason why early positioning is drawing both retail investors and DeFi-focused capital. MUTM is topping more than just watchlists—it’s leading a shift in how investors define value in new cryptocurrency. With working features, a self-sustaining token model, and a clear roadmap, it offers one of the few chances to enter at a sub-$0.03 valuation before the broader market takes notice. For those looking to secure the best crypto coin to buy now, Mutuum Finance checks every box: price, timing, utility, and traction. This is more than a presale—it’s the setup for a breakout. And the opportunity to get in at this stage is closing quickly.

After hitting $74,652 earlier this year, BTC has made a V-shaped recovery and is now above $104,000 and heading towards $109,427. This technical pattern – sharp declines followed by sharp rebounds – is a sign of strong market conviction and often precedes big rallies. Since breaking above the 50-day EMA ($94,870), Bitcoin has been in a steep trend with higher lows and accumulation. Bitcoin's V-Shaped Recovery is Complete From $74K lows to $104K highs, BTC has staged a textbook V-shaped reversal—fast fall, faster rebound. Bulls now eye $109K… and beyond. #Bitcoin #BTC #Crypto #VShapeRecovery #CryptoTrading pic.twitter.com/idFi5AFsAq — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) May 18, 2025 Despite some caution in the momentum indicators, especially the MACD showing decreasing bullish volume, price structure is good. This rebound also comes with institutional flows and broader crypto market optimism. Bitcoin Price Chart (V-Shaped Recovery) – Source: Tradingview V-Recovery Highlights: Rebounded from $74,652 to $104,000+ Reclaimed 50-day EMA at $94,870 Targeting $109,427 Bitcoin Analysis – Symmetrical Triangle Breakout Bitcoin price prediction appear bullish in the long run, though short-term analysis indicates indecision. On the 1-hour chart, BTC is coiling in a symmetrical triangle – an indecision zone that often precedes big breakouts. At $104,007, the price is pressing against the triangle’s upper resistance and horizontal barrier at $104,550. Technically, Bitcoin is looking good beneath the surface. The MACD has turned green, the 50-period EMA ($103,421) is holding as support and recent candles are showing increasing buying pressure and higher lows. If bulls can confirm a breakout with a strong 1-hour candle above $104,550, BTC could quickly go to $105,668 and possibly $106,685. But if it doesn’t break out cleanly, it could go back to $103,000 or $102,700 before the next attempt. Bitcoin Price Chart (symmetrical triangle pattern) – Source: Tradingview $120K in Sight for Bitcoin? Macro Momentum Building With Bitcoin’s V-shaped recovery and technical pressure building, eyes are now on $120,000 – a psychological and Fibonacci extension target if BTC clears $109K cleanly. Short-term resistance needs to be respected but long-term sentiment is getting bullish. The broader setup is also bullish: Whale accumulation is increasing, according to on-chain data ETF inflows are strong Institutional sentiment is shifting from cautious to opportunistic Conclusion Bitcoin is looking good on both daily and 1-hour charts. Technicals are in place and sentiment is improving. $120K is not out of reach if bulls can get above $104,550. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.84M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As Bitcoin stabilizes above $102K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols.

With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily. According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin ( BTC )’s role as a monetary protocol. “No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote , arguing that the OP_RETURN limit increases were justified in the past under false assumptions. He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data. Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools. Source: Adam Back Related: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overview Ammous compares Bitcoin spam to email Ammous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system. “It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions. “So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added. The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy. Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems. Source: Saifedean Ammous The conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder. In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages. Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.

After making a strong run toward the $2,700 mark on Tuesday, May 13, the altcoin’s price has struggled to build on its momentum over the past few days. The price of ETH did manage to stay above the $2,500 mark over the past week, bouncing back from the psychological level on Thursday, May 15. However, the recent struggles seem to have compounded over the weekend, with the Ethereum price losing the $2,500 level to end the week. The Next Support Cushion For ETH Price Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to the social media platform X to share an interesting on-chain outlook on the price of Ethereum and its latest lack of bullish momentum. Following the dip of ETH beneath the $2,500 mark, the online pundit has identified the altcoin’s next significant support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Market Signals Further Upside Potential For BTC Price: New ATH Soon? This evaluation revolves around the average cost basis of several Ethereum investors. Cost-basis analysis basically measures the ability of a price level to act as support or resistance — based on the total amount of coins last purchased by investors at this level. As shown in the chart above, the size of the circles directly corresponds with the quantity of ETH tokens bought within each price zone and the region’s significance as support or resistance. In essence, the bigger the dot, the higher the number of tokens, and the stronger the support or resistance; the green dots are support (as they are usually below the current price), while the red dots represent resistance (as they are above the asset price). Data provided by Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shows that the Ethereum price has key support around the $2,354 – $2,430 zone, where 2.64 million addresses purchased 63.9 million tokens (worth $153.04 billion at an average price of $2,395). As Martinez highlighted, this price bracket would serve as an on-chain cushion for the ETH price, as investors with their cost bases around the level would likely defend their positions by buying more tokens if the price falls toward $2,400. The fresh buying pressure around this price region would help counter the downward pressure, thereby keeping the Ethereum price afloat. The highlighted chart shows that it is all clear blue skies for the price of Ethereum, with no significant resistance lying ahead. However, the altcoin will need to hold above the $2,400 level, or it risks falling to as low as $2,200. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,480, reflecting a 0.7% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin is down by nearly 4% on the weekly timeframe.

According to reports, authorities seized assets worth $4.5 million, including a beachfront mansion, luxury cars, and Bitcoin, from the convicted individual. According to reports, the individual, 32-year-old Shane Duffy, from Queensland, saw millions worth of those assets seized after a lengthy investigation into his illegal activities. He was apprehended on charges of stealing digital assets and cyber hacking. The authorities seized Duffy’s beachfront home back in April. In addition, the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) of the AFP also seized a 2019 black Mercedes-Benz sedan and about 25 Bitcoins. AFP seizes assets worth $4.5 million from hacker According to reports, Duffy was suspected of carrying out the theft of about 950 bitcoins from a French crypto exchange in 2013. The assets are now worth about $150 million. Before then, he had been convicted of hacking Riot Games, the US company behind the popular video game League of Legends. In 2018, the CACT initiated an investigation after AUSTRAC was alerted to the development by authorities in Luxembourg about his suspicious bitcoin transactions. However, the authorities have yet to bring up criminal charges in connection with the alleged theft. Meanwhile, they have been able to halt the suspected proceeds of the alleged crime under federal laws, even without a prosecution. Authorities were able to secure the restraining order for the assets obtained in 2019, and they were subsequently forfeited in April. According to the AFP, the assets include a waterfront mansion in Beachmere, Queensland’s Moreton Bay region, which was purchased at about $1.1 million, and is now estimated to be worth about $2 million. The authorities added that the property was held in the suspect’s mother’s name. CACT has seized criminal assets worth $1.2 billion After the sale of the seized properties, the proceeds are expected to be transferred into a special fund that assists crime prevention and law enforcement initiatives. The AFP says it is still committed to confiscating alleged proceeds to disrupt the activities of criminals and cybercrime. AFP Commander Jason Kennedy highlighted the law backing the seizure. “The Proceeds of Crime Act provides law enforcement agencies with unique powers to restrain and forfeit instruments and proceeds of crime,” he said. He added that criminals are driven by greed, and unfortunately it is law-abiding Australians and businesses who end up losing their hard-earned money to these cybercriminals. “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts, which is why the AFP works closely with our partners in the CACT to target the proceeds of crime and ensure they are reinvested in the community,” he said. According to reports, the CACT has seized criminal assets worth over $1.2 billion since 2019. These assets include houses, cars, fine art, luxury items, and digital assets. According to court documents obtained by the media, Duffy allegedly accumulated more than $32,000 in 2013 through the sale of access to inactive League of Legends accounts. The suspect was said to have hacked the X account of Riot Games president Marc Merrill to promote the illegal operation and allegedly partnered with another hacker to disrupt matches on the platform by disconnecting players. Riot Games mentioned the hack resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. In 2016, Duffy was sentenced to two-and-half years in prison, a term he served after pleading guilty in Brisbane District Court. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Table of Contents Is Codename:Pepe gunning for a leading memecoin spot? Bonk gains 70% in a month: Is the rally sustainable?

AGNT: The access pass to the inner circle AGNT is the token that fuels the Codename:Pepe ecosystem. Holding it unlocks: Entry into a private, DAO-powered investment hub. Voting rights on strategic missions. Access to elite AI-trading tools and market analysis. A launchpad to scout and support new memecoins before the masses. Codename:Pepe’s presale spans 28 stages.

You might also like: This tiny AI-powered coin just hit $2M in presale, can it repeat DOGE’s 30,000% run? Bonk gains 70% in a month: Is the rally sustainable? Bonk has seen significant growth recently. Its price jumped 28.37% over the past week and 70.52% in the past month. This surge is notable, especially after a 51.82% drop over the past six months. The current price ranges between $0.00001738 and $0.00002554. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 37.38, which suggests the coin is nearing oversold territory. This could indicate a potential rebound in price. Bonk’s nearest resistance level is $0.00002887. If the price breaks above this point, it might continue to rise. The nearest support is at $0.00001255. If the price falls below this level, it could lead to further declines. Based on recent trends, Bonk may continue its upward movement. Reaching the resistance level from the current high would be an increase of about 13%. However, dropping to the support level from the current low would mean a decline of around 28%. Conclusion While BONK presents interesting opportunities, its short-term potential seems limited compared to new contenders. Codename:Pepe aims to offer true intelligence for maximum profits. By harnessing advanced AI to navigate the chaotic memecoin market, it provides exclusive trading signals and automated trading capabilities. Some investors believe joining its mission could be the key to capitalizing on the current bull run’s gains. To find out more about Codename:Pepe, visit the website .

While its technology is optimized for speed and low fees, everyday users have few ways to participate meaningfully in network operations or generate yield from holding HBAR. The reward structure favors corporate stakeholders, leaving retail users without direct incentives or control. Bitcoin Solaris disrupts that model with a network designed around everyday participation. Through its Nova App, any smartphone becomes a mining node — allowing users to earn BTC-S tokens daily, with no specialized hardware, no validator applications, and no capital lock-ups. The system transforms casual users into protocol contributors and opens a direct pathway to get rich through real-time, on-chain income rather than speculative price movement. Mobile Mining: Income Without Barriers Bitcoin Solaris’s core innovation is its mobile mining model. Users download the Nova App, allocate a small portion of phone storage (1–5 GB) and background CPU, and begin earning passively. The app runs in the background, consuming minimal energy and integrating seamlessly into normal device usage. Unlike Hedera, which restricts consensus and rewards to a fixed set of enterprise validators, Bitcoin Solaris invites anyone with a smartphone to contribute and earn. Mining rewards are distributed based on device uptime and network support, meaning even those without deep technical knowledge or institutional backing can gain exposure to daily blockchain income — turning phones into financial tools for wealth accumulation. Built for Scale, Speed, and Accessibility Bitcoin Solaris operates on a dual-layer blockchain optimized for performance and decentralization: The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) to secure the ledger and handle consensus without high energy costs. The Solaris Layer, built on Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT), processes transactions and mining operations at over 10,000 TPS, with 2-second finality. This structure separates transaction throughput from validator consensus, allowing the network to scale independently of centralized control. Hedera may offer high speed, but participation is reserved for enterprise gatekeepers. Bitcoin Solaris ensures speed with inclusivity — enabling protocol-level rewards for global users regardless of geography or financial status. In a recent review, Crypto Legends broke down how Bitcoin Solaris gives power to users through mining, while Hedera remains tightly controlled by council members. The video highlights accessibility, income models, and how mobile mining opens doors for everyday investors. BTC-S at 3 USDT: Smart Entry Before Demand Surges Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Presale Phase 3, offering BTC-S tokens at 3 USDT. Of the 21 million fixed token supply, 4.2 million (20%) are allocated for presale participants. There is no inflation, no staking requirement, and no dilution from future minting. By securing tokens during presale, users position themselves for early access to Nova App mining, low initial difficulty rates, and first participation in validator and app-layer deployments. For those seeking to get rich through contribution rather than speculation, this stage presents a uniquely timed opportunity before public rollout and exchange listings. Get Up to 75% Extra BTC-S in Phase 3 Invest specific amounts to activate bonus rewards during this phase: Invest exactly $1,000 → Receive a 25% bonus Invest exactly $2,500 → Receive a 50% bonus Invest exactly $4,000 → Receive a 75% bonus Bonuses are valid only during Phase 3. Investing less than the required amount will not qualify. Offer ends when the phase closes. Audited for Security, Designed for the Masses Bitcoin Solaris has passed multiple independent audits confirming the reliability, fairness, and scalability of its infrastructure: Cyberscope Audit : Assessed smart contracts, mobile mining structure, and token emission Freshcoins Audit : Reviewed consensus logic and cross-layer interaction integrity KYC Verification : Verified development team identity and governance oversight These verifications ensure that participation is secure, transparent, and immune to the opaque control models used by legacy projects. Hedera may serve institutions — but Bitcoin Solaris serves everyone. Through daily mobile mining, decentralized reward distribution, and presale access at just 3 USDT, it empowers users to get rich by participating in the network itself. As more retail investors leave passive ecosystems behind, Bitcoin Solaris is becoming the foundation for a new kind of crypto elite — one built from the ground up, phone by phone.

From meme coins evolving into utility assets to blockchains pushing performance limits, the next big opportunity may already be live. Dawgz AI could be one of those early-stage gems. It blends meme culture with Ethereum-backed AI trading tools—built to give you an edge in a fast-moving market. With its presale still active, it’s attracting attention for good reason. Let’s break down the top cryptocurrencies showing momentum right now and why Dawgz AI might be the one to watch in 2025. Dawgz AI – A Meme Coin Built for More Than Hype Dawgz AI is gaining traction as a meme coin with real-world utility. It’s powered by Ethereum and features AI-driven bots that analyze the market and execute trades automatically—something most meme coins can’t claim. Why Dawgz AI Could Stand Out AI trading tools: Bots scan and act on crypto trends 24/7 for better decision-making. Ethereum foundation: Built on a stable, widely-used blockchain. Early presale access: Lets users buy in before broader exchange listings. Staking utility: Investors can earn rewards for long-term holding. With over $3.5 million raised so far, investors suggest Dawgz AI may be one of the few meme coins with lasting impact. If adoption continues, it could gain serious momentum in the upcoming bull run. Pepe (PEPE) – Still Riding the Meme Wave Pepe exploded in popularity in 2023 and hasn’t slowed down. It remains one of the most active meme coins by trading volume, thanks to a loyal community and wide exchange listings. Why PEPE Has Potential: Community power: Massive online support keeps it relevant in meme culture. Ethereum efficiency: Uses smart contracts for fast, scalable transactions. It’s not utility-heavy, but as meme demand spikes, PEPE continues to ride the trend. Floki Inu (FLOKI) – More Than a Meme Coin Floki Inu has evolved from a meme token into a growing ecosystem. Its platforms include DeFi tools, NFTs, and even a metaverse game—making it one of the more well-rounded meme projects. Key Strengths Ecosystem growth: Includes FlokiFi, FlokiSwap, and Valhalla. Decentralized finance focus: Expands use beyond speculation. It’s a meme coin, yes—but one that's building lasting infrastructure in the crypto market. Bonk (BONK) – The Solana-Based Challenger Bonk launched on the Solana blockchain and made headlines with its lightning-fast transaction speed and minimal gas fees. It’s meme-driven, but with real performance benefits. Why BONK Is Gaining Steam Solana synergy: Low costs make it ideal for quick trades. High accessibility: Listed on multiple exchanges, boosting liquidity. For those seeking a high-energy community coin with low friction, BONK could fit. Dogwifhat (WIF) – Wildcard With Momentum Dogwifhat (WIF) has become a favorite in meme circles. It’s unpredictable, but that’s part of its charm—backed by fast community growth and rising interest from trading platforms. Why WIF Might Be Worth Watching Engaged fanbase: Surging social media engagement and memes. Low supply model: Could increase demand over time. It’s a wildcard—high-risk, but with signs of sustained momentum. Solana (SOL) – Speed Meets Scalability Solana is a smart contract platform built for developers who want performance. Despite some price drops, it remains one of the top cryptocurrencies by speed and cost-efficiency. Why SOL Still Holds Value Fast blockchain: Ideal for NFTs, gaming, and dApps. Institutional interest: Keeps SOL relevant in the long-term ecosystem. It may not be “cheap,” but it’s still one of the best blockchains to hold for the long term. Cardano (ADA) – Slow and Steady Growth Cardano is known for its academic foundation and gradual rollout of features. Its long-term roadmap and secure, peer-reviewed architecture keep it in investor conversations. Why ADA Could Climb Smart contracts are live: Increasing dApp development. Strong roadmap: Updates planned through 2025 and beyond. ADA may not spike overnight, but it continues to offer solid fundamentals. How to Buy Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) Buying early gives you access to the lowest price and staking rewards. Here’s how to get started with Dawgz AI’s presale: Step-by-Step 1. Connect a wallet Use MetaMask or Trust Wallet, funded with ETH or USDT. 2. Set to Ethereum network Since $DAGZ is an ERC-20 token, this is required. 3. Buy with ETH or USDT Enter the amount to swap via the official presale widget. 4. Stake for rewards After purchase, stake tokens to earn more. Unstake after the presale ends. 5. Claim tokens Use the same wallet to claim your $DAGZ post-sale. Tip: Early buyers get the best entry price—before wider exchange exposure. Why Dawgz AI Could Be the One to Watch Among early-stage cryptocurrencies, Dawgz AI shows signs of being something different. It’s not just riding meme trends—it’s introducing real tools. AI-backed trading: Bots act on market data, helping optimize entry and exit. Ethereum-based: Strong security and compatibility with dApps. Verified and trusted: Audited by SolidProof , adding transparency. +135% presale gains: Early momentum is already evident. If meme coins continue evolving into utility assets, Dawgz AI may lead that shift. The Market’s Moving. Are You? The $3.1 trillion crypto market is consolidating.

With the BTC price at a critical price threshold, Martinez first questioned whether a new all-time high or a correction would come first. According to the analyst, the BTC price has hit a key resistance area at $107,000 following a 42% rally last month. Martinez added that this level is historically a turning point. However, the analyst argued that the current momentum has become overstretched, with the RSI data on the daily chart showing BTC in overbought territory, which is a common occurrence in short-term pullbacks. Warning about the pullback, the analyst also said that BTC whales sold around 30,000 coins, which means profit taking from current levels has occurred.

According to the analyst, the area between $95,850 and $98,730 will be a must-hold support area for BTC if selling pressure increases. Martinez noted that a breakout from these levels could result in a deeper correction for BTC. On the bullish side, the analyst claimed that if the Bitcoin price manages to stay above the mentioned level, it could enter a period of consolidation and gather strength for a breakout towards $116,900 as the next major target. *This is not investment advice.

BTFD Could Give You $45K From $500—A Comparison to Brett and Floki,https://timestabloid.com/best-meme-coin-presales-to-buy-this-week-btfd-could-give-you/,"Fellow risk-takers, degen dreamers, and moon-chasers—welcome to the arena where meme coins aren’t just tokens; they’re a lifestyle. If your wallet has ever wept for not buying DOGE in 2013 or cried through the Brett and Floki rallies, there’s still a second chance. Three words: BTFD Coin. And if you’re feeling a little reckless (as you should), you’ll want to hop on one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week. Here’s the alpha drop: BTFD Coin’s presale ends May 26th, and right now, you can use code LAUNCH200 for a 200% token bonus. It’s in Stage 15 out of 16, folks. This isn’t a drill; this is a countdown. Over $7 million raised, 12,200+ holders, 74 billion BTFD Coins sold , and that juicy 90% APY staking reward sitting pretty. The window is closing, and this article is here to break down why this is the meme coin presale to jump on, plus how Floki and Brett are still keeping it spicy. BTFD Coin: The Badge of the Bold Staking isn’t just for the whales anymore. With BTFD Coin, even the smallest fish can swim in shark-infested waters. Thanks to its 90% APY, degens can multiply their stack just by holding and staking. Say you drop $500 at the current price of $0.0002. That lands you 2.5 million BTFD coins. Stake it, leave it, and let that APY cook. Add in the LAUNCH200 bonus, and you’re instantly tripled to 7.5 million coins. Now here’s where it gets saucy: Analysts believe $BTFD could debut at $0.0006 on launch and potentially moonshot to $0.006 during its breakout phase. That original $500 bag? If it hits $0.0006, you’re sitting on $4,500 (with the bonus applied). But if that moon target of $0.006 gets smacked? Welcome to $45,000. Degens, that’s an 8900% ROI, and it’s only available for a limited time. BTFD Coin is also powered by a four-level Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, backed by Ethereum, and protected by long-term token locks and a community-first tokenomics plan. And then there’s the Bulls Squad—a quirky cast of characters adding personality and purpose to the project. With only one stage left, BTFD Coin is charging full speed toward launch on May 27th. This is your final boarding call. Don’t miss what might be one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week . Floki: The Viking-Inspired OG With Utility Firepower Floki isn’t just a meme; it’s a brand. Inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu pup and raised by the community, Floki has matured into a utility-backed beast. It powers a full-blown ecosystem featuring DeFi tools, educational platforms like Floki University, and NFT metaverse spaces. While many meme coins live and die by hype, Floki’s strength is in the blend of utility and storytelling. The coin’s Norse branding gives it an edge in the narrative-driven world of crypto. Whether it’s launching partnerships with real-world companies or appearing on global billboards, Floki knows how to stay relevant. That strong community (a.k.a. the “Floki Vikings”) is active, vocal, and loyal. For degens looking to diversify, it’s a worthy add alongside the best meme coin presales to buy this week. Brett: The Internet’s Most Chaotic Icon Got Crypto-fied If you’ve ever been terminally online, you know Brett. This chaotic blue frog crossed over from cringe culture into icon status, and the Brett token leans fully into that internet-native weirdness. With no need for fluff or fake utility, Brett’s strength lies in its raw, viral energy. Brett stands as the embodiment of internet absurdity turned financial instrument. It’s community-driven, memetastic, and funny. Think of it as the spiritual sibling to PEPE, but with a little more Gen Z nihilism and weirdcore vibes. It’s the type of token that explodes overnight because TikTok decided to have a moment. Final Words: Don’t Just Watch the Stampede, Lead the Best Meme Coin Presales to Buy This Week It’s the last stretch of a golden opportunity. BTFD Coin is closing its presale doors on May 26th, and with code LAUNCH200, you still have time to triple your bag. The 90% staking APY, future CEX listings, and P2E ecosystem all scream long-term win, and at $0.0002, this might be the lowest price you’ll ever get. Floki and Brett hold their weight in culture, community, and chaos, but only BTFD Coin gives you this kind of early-stage entry, elite degen bragging rights, and more. Ready to wear the Bull badge? Go to: BTFD Buy Page . Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Enter LAUNCH200 in the bonus code field and click “Apply.” Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy.

As the cloud mining market grows and diversifies, users are faced with many choices — from Hashing24 and NiceHash to StormGain and BitFuFu. But how does HashFly truly compare, and why should it be your platform of choice? 1. Proven Track Record and Longevity HashFly ’s foundation in 2013 places it among the pioneers of cloud mining. Unlike newer platforms still building their reputation, HashFly has a decade of experience supporting over a million satisfied miners worldwide. This longevity reflects its stability, reliability, and commitment to delivering consistent results. 2. Superior Return on Investment (ROI) While many platforms offer cloud mining contracts, few can match HashFly’s high daily returns—up to 7.2%—and clear, short-term contract structures. For example, smaller contracts starting at $200 provide quick, daily profits, enabling users to reinvest or withdraw with confidence. Other platforms often feature longer contract durations with less attractive yields, making HashFly an ideal choice for investors seeking fast, tangible returns. 3. User-Friendly Experience and Instant Bonuses HashFly simplifies cloud mining with an intuitive platform and mobile app, making it accessible to both beginners and seasoned investors. Upon registration, users receive a $10 instant bonus, giving them a risk-free start to mining. By contrast, platforms like NiceHash operate as hash power marketplaces, which can be more complex for new users, while others like Hashing24 require higher minimum investments and offer fewer immediate incentives. 4. Transparent and Daily Payout System Transparency is critical in crypto mining. HashFly delivers daily payouts directly to user accounts—no delays, no hidden fees. In comparison, some platforms may have weekly or monthly payout schedules or complex fee structures, potentially limiting user cash flow. HashFly’s daily payout system empowers users with liquidity and control. 5. Responsive Customer Support Mining investments demand trust. HashFly’s 24/7 customer support ensures users receive prompt assistance whenever needed. This level of support surpasses many competitors, whose customer service can be inconsistent or limited to business hours, leaving miners uncertain during critical issues. How to Start Mining on HashFly： Step 1: Sign Up & Claim Your Bonus Visit HashFly.com, register with your email, and receive a $10 sign-up bonus instantly . Step 2: Choose a Mining Contract Select from a variety of flexible plans based on your investment goals.

Apple’s Market Signal Pushes Crypto Momentum,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-meme-coin-to-buy-now-apples-market-signal-pushes-crypto-momentum,"If you're trying to find the best meme coin to buy as 2025 unfolds, you're not alone. Apple just made waves in the traditional market by announcing a $0.26 per-share dividend on May 15, 2025, and while that may seem unrelated to crypto, it’s actually a signal worth watching. When a $2.9 trillion company boosts market sentiment, it can ripple through institutional strategies—including crypto investments. Stocks climbed, and within hours, Bitcoin and Ethereum surged in tandem. In the world of meme coins, that type of risk-on momentum can be a green light. In this piece, we’ll break down how traditional market events like Apple’s dividend can push meme coin sentiment forward, and spotlight one project— Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) —that could become the best meme coin to buy right now. Market Signals: Why Apple’s Dividend Matters to Crypto Investors On May 15, Apple confirmed a $0.26 per-share dividend, and while the payout is standard, the implications are bigger. Apple’s stock rose by 1.2%, Nasdaq jumped 0.8%, and suddenly risk appetite was back on the table. At the same time: Bitcoin (BTC) rose 2.1%, hitting $63,600. Ethereum (ETH) gained 1.8%, reaching $2,980. BTC trading volume spiked by 15% to $28B in 24 hours. ETH trading volume hit $12.5B—a 10% increase. Why does this matter? It shows a strong correlation between tech stock stability and crypto confidence. For investors, especially those seeking short-term trades or tokens with high upside, this kind of momentum can push smaller assets, including meme coins, into breakout territory. Key Signals in the Best Meme Coins When the market is quiet, identifying the best meme coin requires spotting early signs of movement. Here's what to look for: Unique Narrative or Utility Does the coin just ride on memes, or is there more to the story? The most promising meme coins in 2025 combine humor with utility—like access to DeFi tools or integration with real AI. A strong narrative not only grabs attention, but also helps the coin sustain interest during market dips. Coins with no clear message often fade fast. Strong Community Engagement A meme coin lives and dies by its community. Watch for active Telegrams, Twitter spaces, and organic content—it’s often the first signal of a brewing breakout. Real engagement includes user-made memes, community voting, and consistent dialogue—not just hype from the devs. The louder and more authentic the buzz, the more likely it is to translate into upward price pressure. Tokenomics That Drive Scarcity The best meme coins usually implement a capped supply, staking rewards, or burn mechanisms that help increase value over time. Scarcity works when it's paired with demand—especially during presales or exchange listings. Catalysts and Momentum Look for upcoming exchange listings, influencer interest, or new partnerships. These events often drive price jumps when interest is already brewing. Coins that consistently push updates and remain visible have a much better chance of staying relevant. When these pieces come together, meme coins can flip from quiet to explosive in hours. That’s why timing matters—and why smart investors track more than just price. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ): A Meme Coin With Breakout Potential In a crowded space of coins trying to go viral, Dawgz AI is aiming higher. Built on the Ethereum network, it combines meme culture with AI-powered trading utility—a hybrid that some investors believe could position it among the top meme coins of the year. Here’s why DAGZ is showing early signs of strength: AI + Meme Culture Instead of riding trends, Dawgz AI creates its own. It integrates Blackbox AI algorithms designed to provide automated trading strategies—giving holders more than just a token to speculate on. Early Presale Success With over $3.4M raised, the project has already built a strong base of supporters. That’s a key advantage for community-driven growth. Audited for Security The smart contract was audited by SolidProof , a recognized firm, adding trust for early backers. Tokenomics With Staking Built-In 8.888B total supply 20% allocated for staking Rewards available even during presale This model rewards long-term holders and reduces sell pressure—a smart move for maintaining value. Ethereum Foundation Being an ERC-20 token means it’s easy to store, trade, and integrate across existing DeFi apps. Active Visibility Push The team is executing targeted marketing to ensure the project stays top of mind—a key move when attention spans are short. Dawgz AI could be one of those rare projects that makes its move before the rest of the meme market catches up. The Best Meme Coin to Buy Today? The Apple dividend signal might seem distant from meme coin trading—but when institutional money shifts, it creates waves across all assets. Bitcoin moved. Ethereum followed. Meme coins are next in line. For those looking for the best meme coin to buy now, Dawgz AI offers a compelling mix of narrative, community, utility, and timing. While nothing is guaranteed, early signals point to DAGZ as one of the few new meme coins preparing to lead, not follow. FAQs Section Which meme coin is best to buy now? Dawgz AI is gaining traction for its mix of AI utility and meme appeal, making it one to watch closely. Which meme coin will reach $1 in 2025? It's hard to predict, but Dawgz AI's strong tokenomics and roadmap could position it for big moves if demand continues. Which meme coin will 100x? New tokens with utility and momentum, like Dawgz AI, may offer that kind of upside—though risk is always part of the equation. Which memecoin has the most potential? Dawgz AI stands out right now for combining AI trading tools with a viral-friendly community narrative. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

44768296,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=730256,1747565843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44768296.jpeg,"China hits US, EU, Japan, Taiwan with new anti-dumping tariffs on plastics",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-us-eu-japan-taiwan-anti-dumping-tariff/,"China hit back at four major economies—the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Taiwan—on Sunday by imposing steep anti-dumping tariffs on POM copolymers, a type of engineering plastic used in everything from electronics and auto parts to medical equipment. This update came directly from China’s Ministry of Commerce, which concluded a year-long investigation that started May 2024, following fresh US tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, chips, and more. According to Reuters, this new round of trade penalties will charge importers from the US up to 74.9%, the highest among the four affected regions. The European Union will face a 34.5% tariff, while Japan will be hit with 35.5%, except for Asahi Kasei Corp, which got a slightly better deal at 24.5%. Taiwanese firms will see 32.6% tariffs, with Formosa Plastics getting 4% and Polyplastics Taiwan receiving 3.8%. This decision followed a temporary penalty in January, when China’s ministry said there was enough proof to suggest dumping was hurting domestic markets and began collecting deposits from importers. Trump’s tariff truce with China fails to ease burden Despite President Trump negotiating a 90-day truce to reduce some tariffs between Washington and Beijing, American importers aren’t seeing relief. The cumulative weight of past tariffs remains. Josh Teitelbaum, senior counsel at Akin, explained the reality: “While companies are relieved to see a temporary pause from the incredibly high tariffs on goods from China, retailers are still facing very high tariffs that will have an impact on prices and supply.” Teitelbaum pointed out that footwear is getting wrecked. A children’s or women’s leather sneaker now carries a 40% tax, combining the WTO’s most favored nation rate of 10%, 25% from Section 301 rules, and an added 30% from fentanyl and reciprocal-related tariffs. It doesn’t stop there. Tariffs stacked across categories like clothing are draining the entire supply chain. Cotton sweaters from China now attract 46.5%, women’s bathing suits are tagged with 54.9%, and baby dresses come in at 41.5%. These numbers aren’t projections—they’re being paid now. Retailers brace for higher prices as stacking continues This tariff layering is choking US retailers. Dan Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide, said on Saturday that basic items like kids’ backpacks—which mostly come from China—are seeing combined tariffs “over 70%.” Anthony explained that this includes the 17.6% standard tariff, Section 301’s 25%, and the new 20% fentanyl-related charge plus a 10% reciprocal tariff. Even companies the size of Walmart are exposed. John David Rainey, the company’s CFO, said on CNBC that shoppers should expect price bumps across toys, food, and electronics. “We’re trying to navigate this the best that we can,” Rainey said. “But this is a little bit unprecedented in terms of the speed and magnitude in which the price increases are coming.” Walmart’s own shipment records support the warning. Data from Panjiva tracking January 2025 to May 12 shows that 34.1% of the company’s imports originated from China , followed by India at 26.3% and Hong Kong at 10.6%. With a third of their supply pipeline tied to Chinese exports, Walmart and others like them are directly impacted by the Chinese response to US tariffs.

BTC fell to an intraday low of $102,722 on Saturday but rebounded to briefly cross $104,000 before moving to its current level. The cryptocurrency has registered a marginal increase during the ongoing session, trading around $103,950. Bitcoin May Skyrocket As US Loses Top Tier Credit Rating The US has lost its AAA credit rating over rising national debt and deficits. Moody’s Rating downgraded the US credit rating, downgrading it from its perfect AAA status to AA1 due to increasing debt and interest significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns. The downgrade is being viewed as a warning to investors and could increase borrowing costs for Americans already grappling with inflation and tariffs. Moody’s had held a perfect credit score for the US since 1917. Moody’s explained the downgrade in its official statement, adding, “The downgrade reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns.” However, despite the downgrade, Moody’s assigned a stable outlook for the country, highlighting the Federal Reserve’s historically strong and independent monetary policy. However, this outlook could be at risk, with President Trump threatening to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell. However, an adverse market reaction forced Trump to backtrack. Journalist Michelle Makori believes that Bitcoin and gold are worth watching following the downgrade, adding she expected their prices to skyrocket. According to Makori, the downgrade creates the perfect environment for Bitcoin and gold prices to surge. “Watch Bitcoin and gold. America now shares a credit rating with Austria and Finland. Hard assets don’t lie. Watch Gold and Bitcoin.” Bitcoin Whales Accumulating Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales are continuing to accumulate the asset, according to OKC Partner and Binance KOL Ted Pillows. According to analysts, Bitcoin Whales acquired 2,180 BTC valued at around $226,750,000 on May 15, indicating strong market confidence. Large accumulations by Bitcoin whales generally suggest bullish sentiment among investors and a strong potential for further price appreciation. BTC is trading around the $103,900 mark at the time of writing. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) maintained its position above $100,000 despite selling pressure and buyer exhaustion. Market watchers are watching for signs of an uptrend and whether it will carry BTC past its all-time high of $109,000. Despite waning momentum, market experts believe BTC’s uptrend is far from over. Blockstream CEO Adam Beck stated earlier in the week that Bitcoin’s price was strangely low and could surge to $500,000 or even $1M over the next four years. Meanwhile, another analyst predicted that BTC’s next market top could be $120,000, but only if the $90,000 support holds. However, some bearish signals are emerging despite overall bullish sentiment. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a sharp increase of 2.19% on Tuesday, settling at $96,845. A marginal increase the following day saw the price reach $97,000. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as markets rallied. As a result, BTC soared over 6%, crossing $100,000 and settling at $103,093. The rally lost momentum on Friday as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $102,851. However, it recovered on Saturday, rising nearly 2% to $104,617. Despite a positive Saturday, the price was back in the red on Sunday, falling almost 1% and settling at $103,802.

However, it lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 0.53% and settling at $103,568. The price plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816.

44768300,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67437,1747566047,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"While Most Cryptos Cool Off, MUTM Is One of the Best Cryptos to Buy Now With Real Forward Momentum",https://timestabloid.com/while-most-cryptos-cool-off-mutm-is-one-of-the-best-cryptos/,"As most of the market slows down and many cryptocurrencies trade sideways or decline, a select few tokens are quietly building strength in the background. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of those few names gaining real traction while others lose momentum. With a rising presale, confirmed development milestones, and a product rollout strategy already in motion, MUTM is quickly being recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy now—and Not only for its long-term prospects, but also for its strong short-term growth potential. Investors aren’t sitting on the sidelines—they’re getting in early and securing their positions ahead of the breakout. And with strong buy pressure already building during presale, it’s clear that interest is shifting toward new crypto coins that offer more than hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM is currently progressing through Phase 4 of its presale, where the token remains priced at $0.025. Over 87% of this round is already completed, with more than $8.6 million raised and 9,900+ wallets participating. In the upcoming phase, the token price will increase to $0.03, with its launch rate already locked in at $0.06. That gap between entry and launch has made this one of the top cryptocurrencies on watchlists this month. But what’s really driving urgency is the pace—this phase is filling quickly, and once the next round begins, early investors lose that discounted advantage. The current price point isn’t just a good entry—it’s a short-term opportunity that could soon be gone. With momentum growing and investor attention increasing, MUTM is trending toward breakout conditions before it ever reaches the open market. One of the most important reasons behind this momentum is that Mutuum isn’t launching a token and building later—it’s building now. The team has confirmed that a beta version of the lending and borrowing platform will go live shortly after the token launches. This is key. Instead of launching on speculation alone, users will have access to real DeFi functionality—right away. Borrowing, lending, interest accrual, and capital movement will begin on-chain almost immediately. That product rollout is what analysts say could help drive MUTM to $0.37 in a short time after launch. With a token designed to benefit from protocol activity—and real activity happening right after listing—that price target is no longer seen as a stretch. In addition to its DeFi engine, the Mutuum team is building out more utilities to support token demand and internal ecosystem growth. A native overcollateralized stablecoin is in development, backed by excess collateral provided by users in the lending system. This stablecoin won’t rely on external assets—it will be fully on-chain and pegged to the U.S. dollar through algorithmic mechanisms. As users mint and repay stablecoin loans, demand flows back into the protocol, boosting treasury revenue and platform volume. All of this ties back to MUTM’s value loop: users engage with the protocol, value is created, and token demand increases in parallel. Mutuum is also preparing for the next phase of growth by working toward Layer 2 integration. This will help reduce transaction fees, speed up user interactions, and ensure the protocol remains accessible as it scales. For any new crypto coin aiming to onboard thousands of users post-launch, Layer 2 isn’t optional—it’s essential. This move positions MUTM to compete with larger DeFi platforms while offering the advantages of a smaller-cap token with room to grow. While the rest of the crypto market slows down, MUTM is showing real forward motion. From a nearly sold-out presale to a functional product on the verge of launch, everything points to a project that’s not just promising upside—but actively delivering on it. If you’re still trying to decide what crypto to buy before the market picks back up, MUTM offers more than an early price—it offers a system designed to reward usage, backed by real development, and structured for demand. It’s not waiting for the market to move. It’s actively being built—and that steady progress is driving its rapid growth.

At the moment, ETH is trading around $2,508, below both the triangle’s upper trendline and the 50-period EMA ($2,519) on the 2-hour chart. Some expected an early breakout, but price is still coiled, no confirmed break above resistance. This triangle formation, created by converging trendlines, means consolidation and decreasing volatility—a classic sign of a big move coming. ETH has held a series of higher lows, keeping the bullish case alive, but buyers haven’t produced a strong breakout candle yet. Volume is low and recent candles are showing hesitation with mixed body sizes and small wicks. Ethereum Momentum Building as MACD Turns Bullish Momentum indicators are hinting at a change in sentiment. MACD is showing a fresh bullish crossover and the histogram is green—often a sign of upward momentum. Ethereum Price Setup ETH is coiling inside a symmetrical triangle, trading near $2,509 and pressing against key resistance. Watch for a breakout above $2,527 to confirm momentum. No breakout yet—just pressure building. #Ethereum #ETH #Crypto #Trading #ETHUSD #Altcoins pic.twitter.com/kNYkrIUM9R — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) May 18, 2025 This, combined with higher lows in price, means buyers are gaining strength, but confirmation is missing. If ETH can break above $2,527—triangle’s upper boundary and horizontal resistance—it will trigger bullish targets at $2,649 and $2,720. Below $2,500 or a break below $2,420 will invalidate the setup and test lower support. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Ethereum Key Levels to Watch Ethereum price prediction remains neutral as ETH hasn’t broken out yet, but the setup is getting close to resolution. Watch for breakout volume or rejection. Patience is key in triangle setups—entering too early can be choppy. Trade Setup: Entry (bullish): Above $2,527 on strong bullish close Targets: $2,649 and $2,720 Stop-loss: Below $2,420 (triangle support) Summary: Think of this triangle like a pressure cooker—it’s building steam, but unless the lid pops off (above $2,527), price will stay contained. Wait for breakout confirmation before entering. Ethereum is consolidating at resistance, a big move is coming. Whether bulls can take advantage remains to be seen—but all eyes are on $2,527. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.84M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As Bitcoin stabilizes above $102K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $5,919,969.28/ $6,844,387 Token Price: $0.002515 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

While Ethereum (ETH) , Dogecoin (DOGE) , and TRUMPCOIN capture headlines, a lesser-known contender— MAGACOIN FINANCE —is rising rapidly on watchlists with unmatched early-stage momentum. Here’s a look at six cryptocurrencies showing real breakout potential this quarter. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! 1. Ethereum (ETH) – Institutional Anchor with Web3 Momentum Trading near $2,435 , ETH is up 3.8% in 24 hours and continues to dominate as the infrastructure layer for Web3. Its $293B market cap , strong L2 activity, and ETF speculation position it for a range between $2,400–$2,600 through Q3. Institutions remain heavily involved, securing ETH’s leadership status. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) – Meme Titan Holding the Line DOGE has surged past $0.24 , eyeing a breakout to $0.41–$0.50 if market optimism holds. With Elon Musk’s endorsements and unmatched brand identity in meme culture, DOGE remains the sector’s blue-chip altcoin in 2025 . 3. TRUMPCOIN – High-Impact Volatility Tied to Politics Currently trading around $10.12 , TRUMPCOIN is spiking amid election-year hype. Analysts forecast a possible move to $100+ driven by media cycles, community engagement, and headline-driven momentum. High risk—but even higher potential for traders betting on timing. 4. Kaspa (KAS) – Scalable Infrastructure Token on the Move KAS sits at $0.13 , up 16% on the week , holding support at $0.10 . Its DAG-based architecture offers high scalability, and analysts project moves to $0.28–$0.35 in Q3. As Layer-1 infrastructure gains favor, Kaspa is becoming a core altcoin allocation for informed traders. 5. PEPE – Pure Meme Volatility Still hovering near $0.0000092 , PEPE is the ultimate short-term swing coin. If volume returns, 25%–30% spikes are possible. While speculative, its name-brand status keeps it a contender in meme coin cycles. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT 6. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The Breakout Meme Altcoin With 35x Potential With over $8 million raised , MAGACOIN FINANCE is surging in presale traction. Priced below $0.001 , with a $0.007 listing target , early participants are lining up for 25x–35x returns . A 50% bonus via the MAGA50X code increases exposure, attracting whales and smart money alike. Recent highlights: $132K+ whale transaction recorded on-chain Over 50,000 holders and rising rapidly Listings and media coverage expanding Scarcity-based supply, audited by HASHEX , and 2025’s most viral political branding Analysts now compare its structure to the early days of DOGE and SHIBA —except with more organization and strategy behind the scenes. Conclusion: May’s Crypto Rotation Is Underway—And MAGACOIN FINANCE Is in Play With ETH , DOGE , TRUMPCOIN , and KASPA each commanding attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the dark horse altcoin of 2025 . Its unique blend of meme appeal, smart tokenomics, and organic demand is putting it on track to be the most talked-about launch of the cycle.

While tokens like SHIB and PEPE have surged off social media buzz and unpredictable trends, MUTM is charting a different path—one that doesn’t rely on hype but is built around actual protocol activity, structured tokenomics, and on-chain revenue mechanics. Still in its presale phase and priced well below $0.03, MUTM has become a growing point of interest for investors looking beyond the next meme trend. And according to analysts tracking early-stage DeFi projects, this isn’t just another new crypto coin—it’s one that could outperform even the most viral tokens in the months ahead. Meme-based cryptocurrencies have shown they can rally fast—but they’ve also shown how fragile that momentum can be. Often driven by influencers or sudden community surges, these coins rarely have systems in place to maintain long-term demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM isn’t trying to ride the same wave. Its value doesn’t depend on how many times it trends online. Instead, it’s being developed as a DeFi crypto protocol with real mechanics behind its growth—where usage drives demand and returns are based on how the platform functions, not how loud it gets on social media. Mutuum is building a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol where value flows through activity. Users can deposit assets into the platform and earn passive income, while others can borrow funds by locking in collateral. When borrowers pay interest, the protocol directs a portion of those funds toward repurchasing MUTM tokens on the open market. Those tokens are then distributed to active participants—specifically those who provide liquidity and hold mtTokens, the platform’s deposit receipts. This model creates a self-sustaining reward system. The more people borrow and use the protocol, the more buying pressure is placed on the token. It’s a setup that naturally benefits holders, without relying on token inflation or artificial incentives. Mutuum isn’t merely in its presale phase—it’s actively preparing for launch. A beta release of the platform is planned to follow the token listing, allowing users to engage with its lending and borrowing functions right from the start. This approach stands in contrast to many other presale tokens, which go live with no product and spend months trying to deliver on basic promises. MUTM is skipping that waiting game, and that has caught the attention of traders who are watching closely for the best cryptocurrency to invest in before wider adoption begins. MUTM’s price action won’t rely on virality to take off. What makes it stand out is the structure—specifically how the buyback model, combined with protocol revenue, aligns incentives between users and token holders. This design has led to growing forecasts that MUTM could outperform more well-known meme coins once it hits the market. And with the current presale price locked at $0.025, investors are entering at one of the lowest points in its pricing curve. Once the next phase begins, the price will increase to $0.03, ahead of the confirmed listing at $0.06. As the market shifts focus from speculation to sustainability, tokens like MUTM are getting a closer look. Its fixed total supply, redistribution logic, and early beta deployment all contribute to a model that supports both early momentum and long-term holding. This is why some investors who once took bets on meme coins are now looking at MUTM with more serious intent. It may not trend overnight—but it’s built to run longer. MUTM doesn’t need to go viral to move. It’s designed to grow from within, rewarding usage and holding through a closed-loop model tied to real activity. For those evaluating what crypto to buy now or seeking a project that blends early access with clear functionality, MUTM is one of the few that checks all the boxes. It’s not another meme—but it might just outperform them all.

While the macro trend remains bullish, the recent Bitcoin price action shows tightening within a symmetrical triangle formation on lower time frames, suggesting that a breakout—or breakdown—may be imminent heading into May 19. What’s Happening with Bitcoin’s Price? Looking at the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin continues to respect a rising support trendline that connects the early May lows to the current structure. After surging from sub-$100,000 levels earlier this month, the Bitcoin price has faced repeated rejections just under $105,000.

It’s academic, secure, and designed for the future. But what if you could stop waiting for the future—and start building real wealth today? That’s exactly what average investors are doing with Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). While Cardano holders rely on slow staking and price movement, BTC-S users are already seeing explosive gains from a blockchain designed not for institutions, but for everyday people with a smartphone and a dream. And the numbers? They’re not just better—they’re life-changing. Cardano: Brilliant Design, Slower Rewards Cardano’s layered architecture and peer-reviewed foundation have earned it respect across the crypto space. But when it comes to helping users generate real wealth fast, it’s often too slow. Staking returns are modest, and like many Proof-of-Stake networks, they require time, patience, and locked funds. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Solaris has skipped the academic papers and delivered something more powerful—daily income and real-world utility. Bitcoin Solaris: Built to Make People Rich This isn’t a clone of Bitcoin. This is a reimagining of what it should’ve been for the masses. A dual-consensus model gives BTC-S an edge: PoW (Proof-of-Work) for foundational security DPoS (Delegated Proof-of-Stake) for speed and scale 10,000 transactions per second, 2-second finality, and 99.95% less energy usage than Bitcoin mining. It doesn’t just protect wealth. It builds it fast. BTC-S is a blockchain that generates value every day, directly into your hands, using only your phone. The project is also audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and fully KYC-verified , giving new investors confidence that this isn’t just hype. It’s substance. From Zero to Wealth: How BTC-S Is Changing Lives We’re not talking theory. We’re talking early BTC-S investors already reporting 300–400% gains thanks to presale access and daily mobile mining rewards. The upcoming Solaris Nova App will allow users to mine BTC-S from any smartphone, with one tap. There are no setups, no rigs, and no confusing software. Just a smart algorithm that runs quietly in your pocket—earning real money every day. And thanks to the double rewards referral program, the growth doesn’t stop there. Users who refer friends receive 5% commission in BTC-S every time someone buys through their link. Even better? The person they invite gets 5% extra tokens on their purchase. It’s a win-win model built to multiply community wealth—fast. To access it, all you need is an account on BitcoinSolaris.com, your personal referral code, and the motivation to share it with your network. From social media to direct invites, the earning potential grows every time you connect someone new. What If You Caught the Next Big Bitcoin Fork Early? Bitcoin Solaris vs Cardano: Why BTC-S Wins for Wealth Builders Feature Cardano Bitcoin Solaris Daily Earnings Slow staking rewards Mobile mining pays daily Hardware Needed None None Energy Efficiency High 99.95% less than Bitcoin Earning Boost System None 5% referral commission + 5% bonus Average Investor Wealth Rate Gradual 3x–4x faster returns (reported) Presale Firepower The BTC-S presale is where the real money’s already flowing: Current Price: $3 Next Phase: $4 Launch Price: $20 Over 8,900 users have joined so far, and the project has raised more than $750,000, making it one of the fastest-growing token sales in 2025. The presale runs for just 90 days and ends July 31, 2025. With a projected 1,900% return, early buyers are locking in gains most Cardano holders haven’t seen in years. Community members also get beta access to the Solaris Nova App, offering them a front-row seat to the mining revolution before the full app goes live. Limited-Time Bonus: Earn Up to 75% More BTC-S in Phase 3 For a short time during Phase 3, Bitcoin Solaris investors can unlock exclusive bonus tokens by contributing set amounts: Invest $1,000 → Get 25% Bonus ($1,250 in BTC-S) Invest $2,500 → Get 50% Bonus ($3,750 in BTC-S) Invest $4,000 → Get 75% Bonus ($7,000 in BTC-S) This offer is only valid during Phase 3 and for new purchases. Once this phase ends or bonus tokens run out—whichever comes first—the event will close. The Crypto Community Is Paying Attention Influencers across the space are already catching on. A recent deep dive from Crypto Legends explains why Bitcoin Solaris is grabbing headlines: its mobile mining model, explosive growth, and tokenomics that reward the little guy, not just whales. Stay connected with the team and receive real-time updates on Telegram and X . Conclusion: Stop Hoping. Start Earning. The people building wealth aren’t crypto elites. They’re teachers, students, creators, and casual investors who got in early—and tapped into a mobile mining ecosystem that’s actually paying them. The app is live in beta. The rewards are flowing. The presale window is closing. And the future? It’s already in the hands of those who tapped first.

The latest one was the attempted kidnapping of relatives of Paymium co-founder Pierre Noizat on Tuesday. The kidnapping situation, which was worsened by the attempt on Tuesday, has seen the French interior minister Bruno Rataileau announce a meeting with crypto professionals to discuss a way forward. According to reports, most of these kidnappings happen because the criminals are looking forward to receiving ransom for those captured. However, the Director of Strategy at French crypto exchange Paymium, Alexandre Stachtenko, has taken a dig at how information related to crypto transfers under EU rules must be collected, calling it a “ticking time bomb.” Paris kidnaps calls for crypto data security According to Stachtenko, the current method is risky and one leak could put people in harm’s way. “If there is a leak of one of these databases from which I can find out who has money and where they live, then the next day it is on the dark web, and the day after there is someone outside your home,” he said. The executive implied that crypto users are not safe because it only takes a platform breach for their details to be in the hands of bad actors. Data theft is something that has been happening in the crypto market over the years, with the latest one related to popular crypto exchange Coinbase. The exchange mentioned that the criminals had bribed and duped their way into stealing digital assets from its users. The exchange then added that the criminals asked for a bribe to keep the crime from coming out. However, instead of paying, Coinbase informed regulators about the crime and has made plans to spend between $180 million and $400 million to reimburse affected users. After the attempted kidnapping, Paymium also released its statement urging authorities to ensure the protection of companies inside the sector. It also highlighted the disturbing trend of activities like these happening across different locations since the beginning of the year. The platform, which was founded in 2011, also cited “the highly dangerous aspects of certain financial regulations, either recently adopted or in the making”. “With the unprecedented organisation of massive and sometimes disproportionate collection of personal data, public authorities contribute to putting the physical safety of millions of cryptocurrency holders in France, and more widely in Europe, at risk,” the platform added. The comment was talking about rules that came into effect at the end of 2024, which extended the Travel Rule that was already in place for traditional finance transfers to include digital assets. European AML regulations to restrict privacy coins and wallets According to Stachtenko, one aspect of the Travel Rule he finds disturbing is the disclosure of the address of a user’s crypto wallet, which contains details of their accounts and transactions. He added that sensitive data like that is sometimes stored or exchanged insecurely, putting the holder in harm’s way. However, Sarah Compani, a lawyer specializing in digital assets, has mentioned that these regulatory changes are adopted to curb illicit acts in the crypto industry. Meanwhile, the new anti-money laundering law in Europe, which will come into effect in 2027, will restrict the use of wallets and digital assets that allow its holder to be anonymous. The development is coming after France announced the same law, which it aims to use to fight narcotrafficking, targeting anonymous devices like crypto mixers used to obscure the origin of funds. However, cybersecurity analyst Renaud Lifchitz has mentioned that there are many “legitimate interests” in having such tools. He added that these tools are sometimes beneficial to many interested legitimate parties, such as journalists or activists opposed to an authoritarian regime that controls the traditional banking system. Meanwhile, the recent kidnappings can be explained by a “somewhat nouveau riche” and “ill-prepared” cryptocurrency sector. Since 2014, software developer Jameson Lopp said, he has recorded at least 219 physical attacks targeting crypto users.

MUTM Stands Alone Below $0.05,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-cheapest-cryptocurrency-with-actual-utility-mutm-stands-alone-below-0-05/,"In a space flooded with low-cost tokens that rarely offer anything beyond speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is breaking that pattern. At a presale price of just $0.025, it’s among the cheapest cryptocurrencies on the market—but it’s also one of the few that comes backed by real, functional utility. With so many tokens under $0.05 offering little more than hype, MUTM is positioning itself differently. It’s not chasing virality or empty engagement. It’s building a DeFi protocol with actual use cases, a revenue engine, and smart economic design that supports long-term demand. And as capital continues to flow in, it’s becoming clear that investors aren’t just noticing MUTM—they’re acting on it. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM is now in Phase 4 of its presale, offering tokens at the current price of $0.025. Over 83% of this round has already been sold, and once it concludes, the price will increase to $0.03 in the next phase. The confirmed launch price is $0.06, providing early buyers with a strong entry advantage ahead of the token’s exchange debut. So far, the project has raised more than $8.4 million and attracted thousands of early supporters. Unlike typical new cryptocurrency launches, this demand isn’t based on promotional gimmicks—it’s grounded in infrastructure. The team is building, and the presale serves as both a funding round and an early access point for those seeking high-potential entries ahead of broader exchange visibility. Most sub-$0.05 tokens are cheap for one reason: they offer little to no working product. MUTM is the opposite. The protocol is being developed to provide decentralized lending and borrowing solutions through both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. This dual approach allows users to either earn passive income by contributing to shared liquidity pools (P2C) or negotiate loan terms directly with others (P2P), offering more flexibility and broader accessibility than standard DeFi products. It’s utility like this—not hype—that has analysts naming MUTM among the top cryptocurrencies to watch this year. Mutuum isn’t stopping at basic lending features. The team is currently preparing for Layer 2 integration, ensuring the protocol can operate efficiently at scale without falling victim to high gas fees or transaction delays. This forward-looking approach makes the platform more accessible to everyday users while supporting larger, high-volume activity over time. In addition, the project is undergoing a smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the leading blockchain security firms in the space. This signals a strong commitment to safety and transparency—two qualities often missing from other new crypto coins in this price range. What also sets MUTM apart is its buyback model. A share of the interest paid by borrowers is allocated to buying MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then redistributed to engaged users across the ecosystem. The result is a system that rewards long-term holders and reinforces value through actual usage—not artificial pumping. This alignment between activity and reward is rare, especially at this price level. It’s one of the key reasons MUTM is considered one of the best crypto coins to buy now, especially for those looking for upside without sacrificing fundamentals. With prices still under $0.03, and a functional platform approaching launch, MUTM offers something that’s hard to find: a low-cost cryptocurrency that’s building toward real product delivery. It isn’t the cheapest token on the market—but it’s arguably the cheapest cryptocurrency with actual utility worth paying attention to. For anyone asking what crypto to invest in while prices remain favorable, MUTM is one of the few options that offers early access without compromising on structure, roadmap, or demand logic.

Cardano (ADA) , SUI , and Ethereum (ETH) are attracting capital thanks to technical resilience and institutional attention. But quietly gaining ground alongside them is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a pre-listing altcoin offering one of the sharpest asymmetric return setups in the current cycle. Cardano (ADA): Accumulating Quietly, Ready to Break ADA is showing steady upward movement, now trading around $0.68 , supported firmly in the $0.63–$0.66 zone. A clean move above $0.74 could trigger a breakout, especially as upgrades like Hydra and expanding smart contract use cases improve sentiment. Cardano’s engaged community is also contributing to continued accumulation. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X SUI: The Post-Unlock Performer to Watch After its May 1 token unlock , SUI has doubled in value, currently holding at $3.95 . Analysts forecast a near-term move to $4.47 , while longer-term projections eye $13.66 by year-end. Strong market structure and active liquidity make it a standout among newer Layer-1s. Ethereum (ETH): Institutional Strength Fuels Rally Ethereum (ETH) continues its dominant run, now trading near $3,762 —a 29% increase in the past week . Driven by demand from institutions and tokenization trends, ETH is expected to oscillate between $2,190–$2,900 through the year. Its role in NFTs, L2 networks, and global infrastructure remains unmatched. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The Early Entry Altcoin With 36x Potential While the market focuses on established names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building its own breakout path. With a current price under $0.001 and a projected listing target of $0.007 , it presents a 25x–36x ROI opportunity for early-stage buyers. Over $8 million has already been raised in presale, and using promo code MAGA50X grants buyers a 50% token bonus —increasing position size and potential upside. Key strengths behind MAGACOIN FINANCE include: Scarcity-based tokenomics designed for long-term sustainability An independent audit by HASHEX ensuring security and transparency Bold political branding aligned with 2025’s most dominant narratives Consistent traction across Telegram, YouTube, and X during multi-phase presale This is a structured rollout with a strategic community-building engine already in motion. SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP – ACT NOW Conclusion: MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Rising With the Leaders ADA , SUI , and ETH are clearly leading the Q2 charge. But for those seeking sharper upside before the next wave hits, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the early-stage play to watch. Its smart design, high-return window, and cultural relevance are quickly making it a standout for 2025 cycle traders.

Last time this happened in 2021, a bevy of popular altcoins returned cryptocurrency buyers 28,000% by the end of the market cycle. Bitcoin Dominance Takes 4% Spill Bitcoin’s market share fell from 65% to 61% between May 7 and May 13, according to TradingView. Markets haven’t seen that 65% level of BTC dominance over altcoins since 2021. That year was the altseason, as crypto veterans like to call it, that launched Dogecoin’s price tens of thousands of percent upward in under 12 months. Meanwhile, in 2021, a $100 Shiba Inu investment went from Jan. 1, 2021, to over $14 million by Mar. 2023. Two unemployed Millennial brothers from Westchester, NY, invested $8,000 in Shiba Inu that year after a family friend told them about it. There are hundreds of trillions of dollars out there. There are only 21 million #Bitcoin . Do the math. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) May 8, 2025 As Bitcoin boosters like to say: Do the math. While a 4% dip in Bitcoin dominance may seem like a small fraction, the numerator here is a global Internet currency with a two trillion dollar market cap on May 7. That’s something like an $80 billion dip in market share against altcoins over six days in May. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s price and market cap grew by 7% during those six days, even as its wedge on the pie chart shrank. Altcoins Form Bullish Golden Cross Meanwhile, an index of altcoin prices formed a golden cross in May, potentially signaling bullish momentum into a prolonged bull run. As one popular crypto YouTube analyst reported on May 13, the total altcoin market cap for major currencies has formed a golden cross. That’s when a shorter-term moving average crosses from below to above a longer-term moving average. Altseason incoming. golden cross hit.

These cryptos might not dominate headlines daily, but their recent developments, especially Remittix’s presale, indicate they are potentially undervalued. Read on to discover whether these projects merit the attention of savvy DeFi investors. Is Remittix Deserving of The Title of PayFi’s Best Crypto? Considering the current state of the market, generating over $15 million in a presale isn’t merely impressive; it’s a clear indication that Remittix has captured attention in all the right ways. It marks the project’s strong entry into the fast growing PayFi space, where innovation and trust are hard to come by. For investors to commit such a substantial amount of money to a new project, there must be something truly remarkable about it. In this case, it is Remittix’s bold mission to overhaul the way international remittances work. While legacy systems remain tangled in fees, delays, and third-party hold-ups, Remittix offers something refreshingly different. It cuts through the noise with fast, low-cost transfers and supports over 40 cryptocurrencies alongside 30 fiat currencies. This kind of range gives users more control and choice, regardless of whether they’re sending money across the world or just next door. One of the most appealing features is the platform’s Pay API, which is designed specifically for enterprises and merchants. It enables seamless global payments without the need for intermediaries. Every transaction comes with a flat 1% fee and zero foreign exchange charges. This means there are no hidden costs, no hoops to jump through, just clean, efficient movement of money. ADA Might Be On Its Way To Hitting The Coveted $1 Mark On May 9, ADA finally broke through a persistent resistance level at $0.75, a barrier it hadn’t surpassed since March 9 earlier this year. That day, Cardano closed at $0.7774 as it slipped past the 23.60% Fibonacci mark at $0.7593. During those months of sideways movement, ADA carved out an inverted head and shoulders pattern. Usually, this pattern is a classic signal that hints at a possible shift in a token’s momentum. ADA’s breakout of this setup points to a target around $1.08, which aligns neatly with the 50% Fibonacci retracement. This is a huge sign that a potential 30% climb from ADA’s current levels is very likely. ADA’s price action has also edged above the 200-day EMA, which suggests growing long-term strength. All three key EMAs like the 50, 100, and 200 are now tilting upward meaning there just might be an impending bullish crossover. Some analysts, like Ali Charts on X , say that if ADA clears the $0.81 resistance next, the $1 mark might just be within reach. This price prediction, alongside ADA’s recent integration into the Brave browser could be the reasons for the token’s latest surge. Source: Coinmarketcap Conclusion Cardano and Remittix represent compelling investment opportunities in the altcoin space. Remittix, in particular, is demonstrating its potential with a over $15 million presale, where its native RTX token is priced at $0.0757.

Still in its presale phase and priced at just $0.025, many now consider it one of the best crypto assets to invest in before it sees major upside. Several crypto analysts are projecting that MUTM could reach $2 in the coming cycle—a massive jump from its current value. And unlike hype-based coins that ride short-term waves, Mutuum is backed by a working financial model that’s already attracting long-term investors and protocol participants. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol for lending and borrowing, designed to give users full control over their digital assets. When users deposit supported tokens like ETH or USDC into the platform, those assets become available to borrowers who provide overcollateralized loans. The interest paid by borrowers is where the token economics get interesting: a portion of those fees is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. Those purchased tokens are then redistributed to users who supplied liquidity—creating an internal loop of real usage generating demand. This buy-and-redistribute model makes MUTM increasingly valuable as the platform gains more users. Analysts believe that as borrowing volume increases, the constant market demand for the token will create long-term upward pressure—making the $2 prediction more than just optimistic speculation. Users who contribute assets to Mutuum’s liquidity pools are issued mtTokens, which serve as interest-accruing representations of their deposits. These mtTokens accumulate value over time as borrowers pay interest. Unlike other systems that rely on staking or manual rewards, Mutuum’s mtTokens grow automatically based on platform activity. This structure means users don’t need to actively manage their holdings to earn—they simply hold their mtTokens and watch their redeemable value rise. It’s a model built for passive income, which continues to attract serious long-term investors. MUTM is currently in Phase 4 of its presale, trading at $0.025. Over 87% of this round has been sold, and once complete, the price moves up to $0.03, with a confirmed launch price of $0.06. An investor entering at today’s price of $0.025 with $2,000 would receive 80,000 MUTM tokens. When MUTM reaches the projected target of $2, that position would grow to $160,000—a 6,300% increase from the original investment. Even hitting a fraction of that would still represent massive ROI. It’s numbers like these, paired with a working product, that are leading analysts to suggest MUTM could be the best cryptocurrency to invest in before listings go live. This bullish sentiment isn’t based on hope—it’s backed by deliverables. The team behind Mutuum has already confirmed the launch of a beta version of the platform shortly after the token goes live. That means real borrowing, lending, and earning will start almost immediately. In addition, the protocol is working toward Layer 2 integration to lower transaction costs and enhance scalability as user activity grows. And to ensure security, all smart contracts are currently undergoing a CertiK audit—a step that signals long-term seriousness and exchange-readiness. With these milestones already in motion, MUTM isn’t just preparing to enter the market—it’s preparing to perform in it. While many coins trade on speculation alone, MUTM has given analysts solid reasons to expect meaningful growth. From a strong buyback system to long-term staking through mtTokens, every part of the protocol reinforces value over time. At a current entry price of $0.025, the math speaks for itself. For investors searching for the top cryptocurrencies to invest in before the next wave, MUTM is proving to be more than just promising—it’s priced to move.

A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of social media behemoths Instagram and Facebook, tells the Wall Street Journal that the corporate giant is dealing with “an epidemic of scams” that has been growing exponentially in recent years, both in scale and sophistication. “As this scam activity has become more persistent and sophisticated, so have our efforts.” The spokesperson reveals that Meta is experimenting with facial-recognition technology while also forming partnerships with banks and tech firms since the scams are affecting so many industries and “different parts of society.” Citing people familiar with the matter, WSJ also reports that JPMorgan Chase has raised concerns with Meta about its policing – or lack thereof – of scams. Meta accounted for nearly half of all reported scams on Zelle for JPMorgan Chase customers between the summers of 2023 and 2024, according to a WSJ source. JPMorgan also recently began blocking certain Zelle payments and warning users about transactions originating from social media platforms like Meta. The person said that the number of scams linked to Meta has shown improvement in recent months. However, documents seen by WSJ reportedly show that Meta has recently deprioritized enforcing scams, avoiding takedowns of erroneous advertisements because of supposed safety concerns, while also cutting costs and moving resources to other departments. WSJ interviewed Edgar Guzman, the owner of a home improvement supplies and garden equipment company in Atlanta, who said scams are relentlessly targeting his customers, prompting them to make payments for products that never arrive. Says Guzman, “What sucks is we have to break it to people that they’ve been scammed – we don’t even do online sales… We keep reporting pages to Meta, but nothing ever happens.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $3.29. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $10.31 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.7585 Market Cap $26.79 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $774.59M Circulating Supply 35.32 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.7683 24-hour Low $0.7295 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.18% 50-day SMA $ 0.688835 14-Day RSI 50.67 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADA/USD 1-Day Chart Based on the 1-day chart for Cardano (ADA) on May 18, the token is currently trading near $0.757, and shows a modest upward movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 53.84, meaning that the coin is in a neutral momentum with potential room for further gains before reaching overbought territory. On the other hand, Bollinger Bands are moderately wide, and the price is trending above the middle band, which often indicates bullish continuation. The upper band resistance around $0.854 may act as a short-term ceiling. If ADA manages to break this barrier, it could target the $0.90 zone. Support lies near $0.741. Momentum appears cautiously bullish pending a decisive breakout or rejection. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADA/USD 4-hour Chart Based on the 4-hour chart of Cardano (ADA) on May 18, the price is currently trading at approximately $0.759, nestled between the middle and upper Bollinger Bands. This suggests a neutral-to-bullish posture but lacks strong directional momentum. The MACD indicator shows a bearish crossover, with the MACD line and signal line dipping below the zero axis, hinting at potential short-term weakness. The Balance of Power (BoP) reads negative, pointing to a slight bearish pressure in recent sessions. If the price breaks below $0.737, a correction toward $0.70 may follow. However, maintaining above $0.764 could preserve the bullish structure. Traders should watch for volume confirmation.

On the daily chart, ADA is trading near $0.757, slightly above the middle Bollinger Band, indicating an effort to recover upward momentum. The RSI hovers around 59, suggesting moderate bullish sentiment without overbought pressure. However, price action shows resistance near $0.80. On the 4-hour chart, ADA has slipped slightly, with MACD showing a weakening bullish signal and the Balance of Power turning negative. This reflects fading bullish strength in the short term. A sustained hold above $0.737 may preserve upside potential, while a drop below risks a correction. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $1.00, with an average trading price of about $0.88 and a minimum price of $0.85. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $7.10. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.92 and $7.10, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano is likely to surpass $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $7.10. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $10 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $10.31. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.68, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $7.10. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges. Recent news/opinion on Cardano The Cardano Builder Fest #2 is scheduled for April 2025 in Vietnam. Developer Andrew Westberg has proposed reducing the treasury tax from 20% to 10%, which has been the subject of much discussion. Some argue that this would boost staking incentives and short-term price growth, while others worry about its impact on Cardano’s long-term sustainability.

By 2026, Cardano’s price could trade at a maximum of $1.264 Cardano’s historic price sentiment Cardano price history Cardano was founded in 2015 and went live in 2017. It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. In January 2025, Cardano traded around $1.02 and $1.09. However, the closing price for Cardano in January was $0.9. In February 2025, ADA surged toward $0.81 but it declined toward $0.64 by the end of the month. ADA value dropped further in March as it dipped to the $0.60 range. In April, ADA price dropped below $0.55 but it later surged toward $0.7. ADA ended April at $0.7030. At the start of May, ADA price skyrocketed to $0.8.",Crypto Price Predictions|ADA,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-18 11:47:26

From January 1, 2024, to the peak of the November rally, BONK provided a net 345% return, and BDAG was 2024’s most successful presale, raising over $250 million. Now, experts are backing the latest AI-driven project, Unilabs (UNIL), speculating it can replicate BlockDAG’s success and provide higher returns than BONK by the end of 2025. In its first week, Unilabs has surpassed $30 million in assets under management, and the UNIL presale has already amassed $425,000, setting new records for token demand in presale. BlockDAG: Redefining Scalability With EVM and DAG Architecture BlockDAG is an adaptive blockchain protocol with robust EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) capabilities. The project follows Bitcoin’s core principles but introduces the scalability of EVM chains to push the performance boundaries. The platform merges fast DAG technology with proof-of-work architecture to facilitate the processing power needed to execute thousands of transactions each second. BlockDAG’s large mining community, Tap-to-Earn rewards, and beta testnet launch add to investor appeal. The BDAG presale is near its end, and the early investors who have made a significant profit are now transferring capital to the Unilabs (UNIL) presale to make similar returns again and multiply their profits. BONK Rallies After Deep Correction: How High Will It Reach? After its massive rally last year, the Solana meme coin BONK entered an extended correction and dropped with considerable momentum in a declining wedge pattern, reaching a new multi-year low at $0.000009 on March 11. Image courtesy: TradingView The wider market recovery allowed BONK to break out from the upper trendline of the falling wedge. The price retested the upper trendline on April 7, and in the 39 days since, it has surged over 130%, giving rise to a new uptrend. A few days ago, BONK attempted a breakout from the bullish pattern but failed and has pulled back to the previous swing high. At press time, it trades at $0.00002131, with strong immediate support near $0.00002. Despite the pullback, the MACD and RSI indicate increasing bullish sentiment, and a move past the $0.000024 resistance could fuel the BONK price rally to a target of $0.000036. Regardless, investors prefer Unilabs as its presale offers steady returns that can outperform in the long run. Unilabs (UNIL): Unlocking AI-Automated Fund Investing Investors are moving funds from BlockDAG and BONK to the Unilabs presale in search of better and sturdy returns. This massive inflow has made UNIL the fastest rising presale this season, raising nearly $400K within a week. Unilabs attracts investors not only with its lucrative returns but also with the impressive technological innovation of its next-generation AI-fund manager. The platform offers four main DeFi fund baskets: BTC, RWA, AI, and Mining, each holding a range of emerging and high-potential altcoins. The AI has been trained to find trends and patterns using historical market data. It carefully assesses tokenomics, sustainability, risks, and background checks, and adds the assets with the best expected returns to the respective baskets. The profits are completely transparent and are distributed periodically as dividends and yields. Users can also earn passive income with Unilabs’ referral scheme, which offers exciting rewards to those who help expand the community. The referral rewards are distributed from a share of the platform’s revenue in the form of UNIL tokens, which are also available to purchase in the live presale. In presale stage two, UNIL is priced at $0.0051, reflecting a 21.5% surge from the stage one price of $0.004. As the presale reaches further stages, the price will continue to rise, providing the most compounding returns to the earliest investors. Conclusion While BlockDAG and BONK gave remarkable results in 2024, Unilabs’ growing momentum highlights its potential to flip these two giants in this year’s bull market. Timing is the most important thing in crypto, which is why this is the right moment to acquire UNIL , which sells for a discounted price in presale.

Analysts in this Ethereum price prediction say that if ETH can clearly push beyond the $2,800 resistance level, a psychological and technical barrier, it might quickly climb toward $3,300. Rising institutional interest, a deflationary supply trend following recent network upgrades, and a strengthening macroeconomic environment for crypto assets all support this projection. Bullish Signals for Ethereum: Can ETH Smash the $2,800 Barrier Ethereum is currently testing the pivotal $2,800 resistance level, a key focus in recent Ethereum price prediction analyses. Following the successful Pectra upgrade and the Ethereum Foundation’s launch of the Trillion Dollar Security initiative, ETH has shown resilience, trading above $2,450 and aiming for higher targets. Source: CoinMarketCap With ETH holding above the 200-day moving average, technical indications point to a bullish momentum. A clear break above $2,800 is expected by analysts to drive Ethereum into the $3,000 level. Notable investments, notably a UK company’s $655 million purchase, emphasize strong institutional interest and hence help the hopeful Ethereum price prediction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows overbought conditions, which could imply possible short-term corrections. Hence, care is recommended. Still, the general trend is hopeful since Ethereum’s strong foundations and increasing use help to sustain a good prognosis. Depending on overcoming the $2,800 barrier, the Ethereum price predictions stay good. Success in this project could pave the way for more increases, hence strengthening Ethereum’s standing in the crypto market. ETH Sets Sights on $3,300 Ethereum is gaining real traction, with strong charts and growing interest from big investors. Experts now believe ETH could climb 20% and reach $3,300 by May 2025, thanks to positive trends and solid institutional support. Analysts have drawn attention to Ethereum’s approaching key resistance mark around $2,800. Source: TradingView A successful breach of this barrier could open the road for ETH to rise towards $3,300 and maybe higher. Investor trust in Ethereum’s long-term worth has also been strengthened by the recent Pectra upgrade, which has helped to create a deflationary trend. Some, nevertheless, warn that technical signs point to a possible retreat to $2,800 if selling pressure rises and that Ethereum’s price is now consolidating around $3,300. Notwithstanding this, the general mood stays positive since Ethereum’s strong foundations and increasing use help to promote a good view. Remittix Presale Frenzy: $15 Million Raised as RTX Gains Momentum The crypto market is rebounding swiftly, and optimistic Ethereum price predictions are fueling momentum across the sector, especially for rising projects like Remittix and its innovative PayFi solution.

Broadcasting live data from the exchange it was opened on – Hyperliquid, CoinGlass’s live feed shows that the liquidation price is set at $95,576. A WHALE JUST OPENED $276 MILLION 40X LONG POSITION ON BITCOIN THE LIQUIDATION PRICE IS $95,000 WHALE OR INSIDER ? pic.twitter.com/79Aopmbl1m — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) May 17, 2025 Numerous crypto content creators and influencers picked up the massive position on Saturday evening, which at first was worth a more modest $276 million. The initial entry price was $103,129. However, live data from CoinGlass shows that the mysterious whale capitalized on a brief opportunity they had when bitcoin’s price slipped below $103,000 to double down on their position, which is now worth over $393 million (3,790 BTC). The entry price has been lowered to $103,083, but the liquidation still stands at just shy of $95,600. Given BTC’s current price tag of almost $104,000, the whale stands on a “modest” unrealized profit of $3.3 million as of now. There have been quite a few cases in the past couple of months in which mysterious whales opened large positions on Hyperliquid that caught the community’s attention. Recall another example from March this year when someone opened a massive multi-million-dollar short position. Later, popular crypto sleuth ZachXBT claimed that this was William Parker, a UK individual linked to a $1 million casino theft among other scandals. According to the reports, Parker profited around $20 million by using extremely high leverage to open positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars, which allowed him to manipulate the market.

Price Predictions Point to a 15x Surge,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/is-mutm-quietly-becoming-next-big-crypto-price-predictions-point-to-surge/,"The post Is MUTM Quietly Becoming the Next Big Crypto? Price Predictions Point to a 15x Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a market full of noise, the tokens that make the biggest moves often do so quietly—backed not by hype, but by real growth, utility, and early investor positioning. That’s exactly what’s happening with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale-stage project that’s rapidly gaining attention for all the right reasons. With a confirmed launch price of $0.06 and a current presale price of just $0.025, analysts are now forecasting a potential 15x surge, putting a short-term price target in the $0.375 range. And with its unique DeFi architecture already in place, many believe MUTM could be the next big crypto to take off as listings approach. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol designed to create value for participants through real usage. The platform doesn’t rely on promotional stunts or inflated rewards. Instead, it generates token demand through a buy-and-redistribute system. When users borrow from the platform, they pay interest. A portion of that interest is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then redistributed to liquidity providers. This creates a sustainable reward mechanism based on usage, not hype. Mutuum stands out by offering two lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to deposit assets into a shared pool. The protocol handles the rest—allocating funds to borrowers and distributing passive returns to suppliers based on pool utilization. It’s a low-maintenance, yield-generating model for users looking for hands-off income. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) gives users more control, enabling direct negotiation between lender and borrower. This model is ideal for users who want to set custom terms, choose specific counterparties, or work with assets that aren’t typically included in standard DeFi lending pools. This dual-model structure not only broadens Mutuum’s user base but also makes it more dynamic than many of its DeFi competitors—an important factor when considering what crypto to buy now for long-term value. Every time a user supplies liquidity to the platform, they receive mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that reflect their contribution to the pool. Over time, these mtTokens increase in value as interest accumulates, giving users passive income without needing to stake or manage complex strategies. mtTokens also serve as a core element of the protocol’s design, enabling broader functionality, including composability with other DeFi systems in the future. MUTM is now in Phase 4 of its presale, priced at $0.025, with over 87% of the round completed. So far, the project has raised more than $8.6 million and attracted nearly 10,000 holders—signs of both institutional and individual confidence in the project’s roadmap. The next pricing tier will raise the token price to $0.03, offering smaller margins before the confirmed listing at $0.06. For those searching for the top cryptocurrency to enter before exchange exposure, this is one of the few remaining entry points backed by actual development. Multiple crypto predictions are converging on one point: MUTM’s early price doesn’t reflect its full potential. Between its self-sustaining tokenomics, live product development, and real passive yield system, the value logic is already clear. When MUTM hits just $0.375 post-launch, early presale investors at $0.025 would see a 15x return. That would turn a $1,000 investment into $15,000. Mutuum Finance is gaining ground without making a scene. While other coins chase trends, MUTM is building real infrastructure, offering real returns, and earning real trust. The whales have already started positioning. Long-term investors are locking in low-cost entries. If you’re wondering which crypto to buy for exponential potential, don’t wait for the headlines. By the time everyone’s talking about it, the best entry might already be gone. MUTM may not be loud right now—but it’s moving fast. And this quiet phase? That’s when smart money makes its move.

Several Doge-style meme coins launched overnight. Twitter spaces lit up. Volume on DEXs surged. But while the headlines follow Elon’s memes, the smarter capital is watching something else entirely: What blockchain infrastructure will support the next generation of viral, meme-driven crypto activity?

After months of chop and doubt, $BTC has flipped the narrative with a powerful V-shaped recovery that has it trading above $103K. Market sentiment has turned sharply bullish, and it’s not just crypto-native voices shouting ‘to the moon.’ Big money is flowing in. Analysts are calling for a $120K breakout. Meanwhile, U.S. credit risks and macro concerns are adding even more fuel to the Bitcoin fire. This kind of environment is exactly what seasoned crypto investors wait for. And while everyone’s eyes are locked on $BTC, a lesser-known altcoin is quietly gaining steam – one that’s designed to mirror Bitcoin’s momentum and possibly deliver explosive returns as the rally picks up speed. Meet BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – the bull market’s sleeper hit in the making. Moody’s, ETFs, and a Wall of Money The bullish Bitcoin momentum isn’t just about technicals – it’s about trust. This week, Moody’s downgraded the U.S. credit outlook from ‘stable’ to ‘negative.’ That might sound like financial jargon, but here’s what it really means: growing fears over U.S. debt and political instability are making investors nervous. And when people lose trust in traditional markets, Bitcoin shines. We’re seeing that play out in real time. Over $5B has poured into Bitcoin ETFs in just days, with investors betting big on $BTC’s next leg up. These aren’t just degen bets – this is serious institutional capital returning to crypto. It’s the kind of inflow that signals the beginning of a real bull market. At the same time, Bitcoin has surged past $103K thanks to a clean V-shaped rebound. Analysts are eyeing $120K as the next major resistance level. Confidence is rising, retail is waking up, and crypto conversations on X are heating up. The market’s moving – and projects built for bullish cycles are about to thrive. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Bitcoin’s Meme-Fueled Amplifier BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) isn’t your average meme coin. It’s a turbocharged, meme-powered project with one mission: ride Bitcoin’s charge to $1M and reward early believers along the way. While most meme coins chase hype with zero utility, $BTCBULL goes further – it pays out actual Bitcoin to its holders. That’s right. It’s the first Bitcoin-themed meme coin that directly rewards its community with real $BTC. Every time Bitcoin hits a milestone – like $150K, or $200K – $BTCBULL holders who bought through Best Wallet and still hold their tokens there receive automatic $BTC airdrops. It’s not just vibes. It’s value, delivered. Just don’t forget to buy and hold your $BTCBULL in Best Wallet . No Best Wallet – no airdrops. On top of that, other Bitcoin milestones like $125K, $175K, and $225K trigger token burns, permanently shrinking the supply of $BTCBULL and boosting scarcity. This isn’t just clever – it’s engineered for momentum. With a tight link to $BTC price action and meme energy baked in, $BTCBULL turns the typical passive HODL into an active ride full of upside. And forget dealing with clunky BRC-20s or cold storage keys. Thanks to a partnership with Best Wallet, you can buy $BTCBULL on Ethereum and receive $BTC rewards directly through your wallet. It’s frictionless, fast, and built for the bull cycle. Why It Works in This Market BTC Bull Token is gaining serious traction – nearly $6M raised in its presale already, with tokens still priced at just $0.00252. And while that might look tiny, the upside is anything but. Analysts forecast a 2025 high of $0.06467. If that hits, that’s a 2,465% gain from today’s price. Let’s put that into perspective. If you bought $1K worth of $BTCBULL today, you’d get around 396K tokens. Now imagine staking those tokens at a modest APY of 15% for a year. That adds 59K more tokens, giving you a total of 455K. At the current price, that’s worth just over $1,150. At the 2025 forecast high of $0.06467, that same bag could be worth over $29,5K. That’s how you turn a meme coin into a moonshot. The timing couldn’t be better. Bitcoin is pushing $103K. ETF inflows are exploding. Retail is coming back. And tokens like $BTCBULL – tailor-made to ride this exact wave – could be the biggest winners. The Sleeper Pick Built for the Bull Run Bitcoin is stealing the spotlight, but BTC Bull Token is quietly setting the stage for something bigger. It’s early, it’s explosive, and it’s engineered to thrive in this exact market. If you’re looking for a high-upside play that rewards you in real $BTC as Bitcoin climbs, this might be your moment to get in before the crowd.
