According to the May 16 announcement from the rating agency, US lawmakers have failed to stem annual deficits or reduce spending over the years, leading to a growing national debt . The rating agency wrote: ""We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from the current fiscal proposals under consideration. Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat."" The credit downgrade is only one degree out of the 21-notch rating scale used by the company to assess the credit health of an entity. An overview of the US national debt. Source: US National Debt Clock Despite the negative short to medium-term credit outlook, Moody's maintained a positive outlook on the long-term health of the United States, citing its robust economy and the status of the US dollar as the global reserve currency as strengths, reflecting ""balanced"" lending risks. Related: Asia’s wealthy shifting from US dollar to crypto, gold, China: UBS Investors react to Moody's US credit revision Moody's announcement drew mixed reactions from investors and market participants, leaving many unconvinced by the agency's revised outlook. Gabor Gurbacs, CEO and founder of crypto loyalty rewards company Pointsville, cited the rating agency's previous credit assessments during times of financial stress as unreliable, signaling that the outlook was too optimistic. ""This is the same Moody’s that gave Aaa ratings to sub-prime mortgage-backed securities that led to the 2007-2008 financial crisis,"" the executive wrote in a May 17 X post . However, macroeconomic investor Jim Bianco argued that the recent Moody's credit outlook does not reflect a real downgrade in the perception of US government creditworthiness and characterized the announcement as a ""nothing burger."" Interest rates on the 30-year US Treasury Bond spiked to nearly 5% in May 2025, signaling reduced long-term investor confidence in US debt. Source: TradingView US government debt surpassed $36 trillion in January 2025 and shows no signs of slowing, despite recent efforts by Elon Musk and others to reduce federal spending and curtail the national debt. As the debt climbs and investors lose faith in US government securities, bond yields will spike, causing the debt service payments to go up, further inflating the national debt. This creates a vicious cycle as the government will have to entice investors with ever-greater yields to incentivize them to purchase government debt.

As the market braces for what could be a historic 2025 bull run, newer and more dynamic tokens are emerging as serious contenders. Leading the charge are PEPE, a viral sensation with an ever-growing cult following, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi powerhouse with real-world utility and explosive upside potential. The MUTM presale has attracted over 10,000 participants, and many anticipate that the token price will rise to $0.03 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 140% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. Investors have limited window since phase 4 is almost closing as over 80% has been sold. While Shiba Inu still holds nostalgic value, seasoned investors are shifting focus to what could be the next big cryptocurrency breakouts. If you’re scanning the horizon for the best crypto to buy now, these two might just be the spark that ignites the next massive rally. PEPE’s Viral Surge Positions It as a Meme Coin Powerhouse in 2025 Trading at $0.000014 with a market capitalization of nearly $6 billion, PEPE has rapidly ascended the ranks of meme coins, surpassing veteran favorites like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in recent weeks. Its 77% weekly gain is propelled by an incredibly passionate community and strategic exchange listings, which are signs of overwhelming investor confidence. While the crypto world awaits the 2025 bull run, the movement of PEPE suggests that it could be a force to be reckoned with among the top performers. For those investors searching for the next big thing in crypto, PEPE’s performance is notable, with future projects like Mutuum Finance holding promising potential within the crypto universe. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $8.5 million and accumulated 10,000 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.025 before their value will grow to $0.03 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 140% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Social media channels will release the results of an ongoing Certik smart contract audit after the completion of this audit by the team. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. Users who join early gain complete access to premium platform updates which encourages them to stay involved. Mutuum Finance leverages modern lending innovations and secure operational platforms to execute permanent changes within Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Mutuum Finance is more than a trending token, it’s shaping up to be one of 2025’s breakout stars. Over 80% of Phase 4 is already sold out, and once the price jumps to $0.03 in Phase 5, today’s $0.025 entry point will be gone forever. With a 140% return potential by launch and price targets as high as $5 by 2026, the upside is enormous, but only for those who act early. If you missed SHIB or PEPE at the bottom, this is your second shot, don’t miss it again. Lock in your MUTM tokens now before the presale window slams shut. Join the presale now.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing interest for solid reasons—well beyond just its affordable price point. With the presale heating up and the platform nearing launch, MUTM is quickly being recognized as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in right now. The numbers say it all. More than $8.5 million has already been raised, and the presale is over 83% through its fourth phase. With the price still at $0.025, it’s an accessible entry—but that opportunity is quickly slipping away. Once this phase closes, the price will rise to $0.03, and with a confirmed listing target of $0.06, early adopters could lock in a significant upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is structured to serve both passive investors and active users. The platform offers two ways to lend crypto: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users deposit digital assets—such as ETH, AVAX, or stablecoins—into liquidity pools managed by the protocol. In return, they receive mtTokens, which represent their deposit and automatically increase in value over time. These mtTokens reflect the growing interest paid by borrowers who access the pool’s funds. Users don’t need to negotiate or manage anything manually; once they deposit, they begin earning yield based on the pool’s usage rate. This setup allows anyone to earn passive income with minimal effort. The more the pool is utilized by borrowers, the higher the returns for depositors. It’s one of the simplest and most efficient ways to earn from crypto without trading or micromanaging positions. Mutuum also offers a P2P lending option, which gives users more control. Instead of contributing to a shared pool, lenders can choose to fund specific loan requests from individual borrowers. Terms like interest rate, duration, and collateral are all customizable. Here’s how it might look: A borrower offers AVAX as collateral and requests a loan in USDC. As a lender, you evaluate the request, propose an interest rate, and once both sides agree, the smart contract handles the rest. The borrower gets the funds, and you receive full repayment plus interest once the loan is repaid. This model is ideal for those who want to target higher returns or lend less common tokens. It opens up more strategic lending opportunities, while still being managed on-chain with full transparency. Mutuum enables borrowers to access liquidity while keeping full ownership of their existing assets. This is especially useful for investors who want to maintain exposure to their crypto but need short-term funds. Let’s say you’re holding LINK and expect its price to go up. Instead of selling, you can lock it as collateral and borrow USDC through Mutuum. You keep your LINK position while accessing the funds you need. There’s no fixed repayment schedule either—as long as your collateral-to-loan ratio stays above the required threshold, your position remains open. This feature gives borrowers a flexible way to participate in the market, cover expenses, or even take advantage of other opportunities without triggering taxable events or losing potential gains. One of the standout features of Mutuum is how it generates and redistributes revenue. Interest paid by borrowers is used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market, and these tokens are then distributed to mtToken holders who engage with the protocol’s reward system. Mutuum ties its reward model directly to platform usage. The more activity on the platform, the greater the buying pressure for MUTM—and the more rewards for engaged users. This design helps maintain value while encouraging long-term participation. As the protocol approaches its beta release, excitement around MUTM is rising. With utilities like lending, borrowing, and passive income already built into the design—and a stablecoin also in development—the foundation is clearly in place. For those wondering what crypto to invest in now, this project checks all the boxes: low entry price, working model, and early-stage demand. The presale is still open, but with more than 83% of this phase completed, time is running out to grab tokens at $0.025. Once the next round kicks in, that price increases by 20%, and momentum will likely continue to grow as the launch approaches. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy before the market’s next breakout, MUTM offers both opportunity and timing. While the rest of the market stalls, this one is moving—and it’s still early enough to enter before the curve steepens.

These DOGE Rivals Will Get Everyone Talking Soon,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-crypto-to-buy-today-these-doge-rivals-will-get-everyone-talking-soon/,"The crypto market pulses with opportunity, and three DOGE rivals—Cardano (ADA), XRP, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—are stealing the spotlight. Cardano’s integration with Brave’s 85 million users sparks chatter about its climb to $3. XRP’s failed bearish pattern signals a potential surge to $3.40. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing crowds with its presale, raising $8,500,000 and selling over 476 million tokens to 10,000 holders. These coins aren’t just riding trends; they’re carving paths in decentralized finance and cross-border payments. Investors are buzzing about which crypto to buy now, and these three top cryptocurrencies demand attention. Cardano’s Brave Leap Forward Cardano (ADA) is gaining traction with a bold move. The blockchain’s integration into Brave’s multi-chain wallet exposes it to 85 million users, a massive pool of crypto enthusiasts. Priced at $0.83, ADA has already climbed 60% from April’s $0.51 low. If an altcoin season ignites, analysts see it hitting $1.30 soon, with $3 in sight by late 2025. Yet, Cardano lags behind Ethereum and Solana in total value locked, limiting its immediate adoption. Still, projects like BitcoinOS and Midnight bolster its DeFi and privacy credentials. For investors eyeing the best cheap crypto to buy now, ADA offers long-term promise but requires patience. XRP’s Bullish Breakout XRP is charging forward after dodging a bearish trap. A head-and-shoulders pattern collapsed in April, but prices rebounded from $1.60 to above $2.50. Analysts now project $2.85 by June, with $3.40 possible in 2025. High trading volumes and a position above the 200-day moving average fuel this optimism. Ripple’s court wins and a crypto-friendly U.S. administration add tailwinds. However, XRP’s reliance on Ripple’s cross-border payment narrative narrows its appeal compared to broader DeFi platforms. For those asking what crypto to buy for short-term gains, XRP’s momentum makes it a top crypto to buy, though its ceiling may be limited. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor fervor in phase 4 of its presale, now 80% filled at $0.025 per token. Since the opening phase at $0.01, prices have jumped, and phase 5 will bring a 20% hike to $0.03, yielding a 20% gain for current buyers. The project’s lending and borrowing platform offers real utility, letting users earn passive income via mtTokens, like mtETH, which accrue interest. A buy-and-distribute system boosts demand by redistributing tokens to stakers. Recently, the team launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens. For those seeking the next big crypto, MUTM’s structured growth is hard to ignore. Security and Scalability in Focus The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is prioritizing trust, actively pursuing a Certik audit for its smart contract. An announcement will hit socials once finalized, boosting confidence. The presale’s tokenomics promise a 140% return at the $0.06 listing price, with analysts eyeing $2 post-launch for a 7,900% ROI. Phase 4’s rapid sell-out fuels FOMO, as investors rush to secure tokens before the price climbs. Unlike speculative coins, MUTM’s overcollateralized lending model ensures stability. This focus on security and scalability positions it as the best cryptocurrency to invest in for those chasing the next crypto to hit $1. Why These Coins Shine Cardano, XRP, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) each bring unique strengths to the crypto market. ADA’s Brave integration opens new doors, but its adoption trails competitors. XRP’s bullish breakout excites traders, yet its niche focus limits versatility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, blends DeFi utility with presale momentum, outshining its rivals. Its $8,500,000 raise and 10,000 holders signal fierce demand. Investors wondering what’s the best crypto to buy should act fast, especially with MUTM’s phase 4 nearing its end.

According to the data, in today's transactions, the crypto whale with the short address 0x6ea withdrew 1.79 trillion PEPE tokens worth $22.35 million via Binance. With the decrease in the price of PEPE after the whale purchased the wallet, at the time of writing this article, this whale has $21.9 million worth of PEPE in its crypto wallet. PEPE price has lost 8% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.00001222. The decline came during a general decline on the altcoin side, but PEPE was one of the biggest cryptocurrencies that was most affected by these losses. Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, Pi Coin lost the most value with 11%. The sharp declines were concentrated in memecoins.

Federal prosecutors confirm that Storm conspired to launder money, circumvent U.S. sanctions, and conduct an unlicensed money transfer business through Tornado Cash. The trial is set to begin in less than two months. Recent court documents show that prosecutors have agreed to drop the portion of the charge related to operating a money-transfer business without a license, acknowledging inconsistencies with federal regulations. In 2019, FinCEN clarified that ”non-custodial entities” such as Tornado Cash are not classified as money transfer operators. ”The provider of anonymizing software is not a money remitter. The rules exclude from the definition those persons who provide only delivery, communication, or network access services used to transmit funds,” the agency's guidance states. The proceedings against Storm continue despite an internal service memo circulated last month about the DOJ changing its approach to handling cases involving cryptocurrency mixing services. It indicated that the agency would focus on prosecuting individuals who use crypto tools for criminal purposes, rather than prosecuting the platforms themselves. Tornado Cash co-founder Alexey Pertsev was sentenced to more than five years in prison in May 2022 for laundering $1.2 billion through a mixer, but was released to electronic monitoring in February 2025 pending appeal. Tornado Cash found itself under OFAC sanctions in August 2022 due to its role in money laundering. According to the U.S. authorities, since the creation of the service, attackers have spent more than $7 billion through it. Tornado Cash was used in particular by the North Korean group Lazarus. Recall that on January 21, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit revoked the sanctions due to ”abuse of authority” by OFAC and sent the case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas for further proceedings.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-17 20:48:45

Why? Because the fundamentals go beyond hype. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just another trending presale — it’s a structured, politically resonant project with long-term strategy, real traction, and serious upside. XRP and ETH Gains Are Slowing — Investors Seek Next-Phase Growth XRP has seen major rallies this year, surging as high as $3.93 , but recent pullbacks to $2.45 have triggered warnings of a 50% correction. While Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin rollout and ETF chatter still support bullish long-term sentiment, short-term volatility is pushing XRP holders to rebalance. Ethereum , trading around $1,826 , is projected to climb above $1,895 this quarter, but growth is expected to be moderate compared to earlier cycles. Institutions remain committed, but retail investors are hunting higher-multiple opportunities. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture. MAGACOIN FINANCE Stage 8 Is Live — And the Clock Is Ticking MAGACOIN FINANCE recently passed $8 million raised , but this isn’t about milestones — it’s about what comes next. Stage 8 is live , and each phase is becoming more exclusive. With Stage 9 approaching , investors are securing allocations ahead of a series of major announcements , including integrations, media expansions, and roadmap updates. The project remains under $0.001 , and promo code MAGA50X offers a 50% token bonus — a key reason why whales are buying in now, not waiting for listings. Built for Longevity — Not Just Hype With no centralized exchange dilution yet, a scalable model, and politically driven branding, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as a top altcoin to watch — not just in presale charts, but across analyst dashboards. XRP and ETH holders see the writing on the wall: this is still early , and the upside is asymmetric. In a market full of recycled narratives and overextended tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out — not for what it’s promised, but for how it’s built. Stage 8 is open. Stage 9 is next. And XRP and ETH whales aren’t waiting.

This incident is part of a trend of violent cases targeting individuals connected to the crypto industry in France. Crypto Exec’s Family Targeted in Attack According to a BBC report , the attack happened around 8:20 a.m. in the city’s 11th district and was captured on video by an onlooker. Local media revealed that the woman and her husband were getting out of their car with their child when three men jumped out of a white van and tried to pull them away. The couple fought back, which resulted in the husband being hit several times on the head while trying to protect his family. Meanwhile, the wife managed to grab a gun from one of the culprits and threw it into the street. Police later confirmed the weapon was a replica air gun. Despite the busy street and children on their way to school nearby, passers-by hesitated to intervene at first. However, as more people began to react, the attackers abandoned the attempt and ran back to the van, where a fourth person was waiting inside. As the culprits drove away, one witness threw a fire extinguisher at the vehicle. Following the incident, the family was taken to a hospital and treated for minor injuries. Police sources confirmed that the woman is the daughter of a crypto company boss. AFP said the victims are relatives of the co-founder of French Bitcoin exchange Paymium. The Paris police unit that handles armed robbery is now investigating the incident. A Series of Crypto-Related Kidnappings This development follows a similar case just over a week earlier, where the father of a crypto millionaire was kidnapped in another part of Paris while walking his dog. In this instance, the abductee was held for ransom. After being in captivity for three days, he was released with one of his fingers cut off. Several people have been arrested in connection with the case. Another high-profile incident happened in January when David Balland, co-founder of crypto wallet firm Ledger, and his wife were taken at their home in central France, with the culprits demanding a 10 million euro ransom for their release. While they were later rescued, Balland was also found missing a finger. Around the same time, rumors spread about another abduction involving Ledger’s other co-founder, Eric Larchevêque. However, these claims were later denied by French media. Authorities have not confirmed whether the incidents are connected, but all victims involved had some link to crypto.

The last week, however, saw a slight drop of 4.49%, highlighting intermittent volatility. This suggests a pattern of quick surges interspersed with periods of consolidation, characterized by small pullbacks in weekly trading. Current values are fluctuating between $2.19 and $4.35, with immediate resistance at $5.19 and secondary resistance around $7.34. Support is positioned near $0.88. The market shows neither strong bullish momentum nor dominant bearish pressure, offering opportunities for traders to either aim for breakouts above resistance levels or look to accumulate near support. Avalanche Price Trends: Short-Term Rebounds Amid Long-Term Dips Avalanche posted a 21% gain in the past month while dipping about 34% over six months. A one-week decline of around 2.5% hints at recent downward pressure amid earlier rallies. The mixed movements indicate that, despite bursts of strength, the coin still struggles to recover from an extended slippage period. Current prices hover between $16 and $24 with resistance seen at roughly $28 and support near $11. Technical indicators like an RSI around 52 and a slightly bearish moving average suggest a cautious market. Traders might watch for a breakout above resistance or consider positions near support within this defined range. Conclusion SUI appears to have strong support near its neckline, suggesting a potential for upward movement. AVAX has shown significant strength with a strong breakout, indicating further gains may be possible. Both coins are worth watching closely for their next price moves in the market.

While meme coins like Shiba Inu had their moment, smart money is shifting toward real utility, and that’s where Mutuum Finance comes in. Positioned as a potential millionaire-maker crypto of 2025, this innovative DeFi project is gaining serious traction among altcoin enthusiasts and early adopters alike. The presale has raised more than $8.5 million and attracted over 10,000 participants, ahead of a token price rise to $0.03 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 140% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. Investors have limited window since phase 4 is almost closing as over 80% has been sold. If you’re searching for the best cryptocurrency to invest in today, don’t overlook this rising star in the world of decentralized finance. Why Shiba Inu’s Hype May Not Translate Into Long-Term Wealth Shiba Inu swept the world in the last bull run, turning early buyers into overnight millionaires and solidifying its position as one of the most hyped meme coins in crypto history. However, the coin’s astronomical growth was fueled less by inherent utility and more by social media hype and speculative mania. As the market matures and investor focus shifts towards long-term value and real-world use cases, Shiba Inu’s lack of innovation becomes more and more apparent. While it remains a cultural phenomenon in the market, investors looking to invest in the best cryptocurrency for the 2025 cycle will want to look at projects with stronger fundamentals, like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market.

According to the investigation, this notorious group moved over HK$118 million, worth about $15 million, through local banks and crypto exchange shops. Authorities say this operation is part of Hong Kong’s broader crackdown on digital asset crime. How The Criminal Syndicate Operates The Commercial Crime Bureau led the investigation. Officers arrested two Hong Kong residents who were key members of the group. They also arrested ten people from mainland China. In total, nine men and three women, ages 20 to 42, were reportedly taken into custody, The local members helped the mainland suspects open fake bank accounts in Hong Kong. These accounts were created in both regular and digital banks, and the goal was to hide the source of the money. Crypto Shops Used to Hide Funds Source According to Police Superintendent Shirley Kwok Ching-yee, the group also used other people’s bank cards to withdraw large amounts of cash. The cash was then taken to crypto exchange shops in Hong Kong, converted into cryptocurrency. This method made it harder to track where the money came from. The syndicate created around 500 fake accounts to carry out its activities. Police reported that 58 scams earned at least HKD 10 million, valued at around $1.3 million. These bad actors tricked victims and funneled the stolen money through the group’s accounts. Notably, authorities worldwide are increasingly cracking down on crypto exchange shops that engage in illegal activities . Rising Fraud Cases in Hong Kong The Hong Kong enforcement team also shared that fraud cases in the city are growing. Compared to last year, fraud reports are up by nearly 12%. So far, more than 10,000 suspects have been arrested for fraud-related crimes in Hong Kong. Similarly, in the U.S., crypto scams and illegal activities are on the rise. In April, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) shared in its 2024 report that digital asset scams have hit record levels. The IC3 received over 140,000 crypto-related complaints last year, with total losses reaching $9.3 billion. This is a sharp 66% increase from the $5.6 billion reported in 2023. While Hong Kong is working hard to promote the growth of digital assets, the government is also increasing its efforts to fight financial crimes. Officials say stopping money laundering is key to keeping the city’s economic system safe and trusted. Notably, many countries are doing the same by tightening crypto rules and increasing enforcement to prevent financial crimes and protect investors.

In a post on X, one of the popular members of the Pi Community, Dr Picoin, claimed that insiders have dumped millions of tokens. According to Dr Picoin , the sell-offs by insiders followed recent announcements about upgrades and improvements to the Pi Network at Consensus 2025. He claimed that the hype around these announcements pumped PI value, and insiders used that opportunity to sell. He said: “The Core Team sold tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of Pi at the peak — all while the community was distracted by announcements and the illusion of progress.” Interestingly, the users alleging rug pull and sell-offs point to blockchain data showing that a wallet allegedly controlled by the Pi Core Team transferred 12 million PI in the last 24 hours. Screenshot of transaction data shared by Dr Picoin as proof of sell-off (Source: Dr Picoin) However, some other users have pushed back against the claims, noting no rug pull. Pinewszone on X explained that the wallet that many claim is selling is a distribution wallet that the Pi Core Team uses to migrate user balances to the mainnet. They posted: “Don’t be misled by fake information circulating on X. Coreteam is not selling pi. You are just being influenced to panic sell so that they can buy at a lower price.” While community members are arguing about what is happening, the Pi Core Team has been quiet, further allowing the fear of uncertainty and doubt (FUD) to spread among users. PI token loses more than 50% within a week as users wait for mainnet Meanwhile, most of the concerns from users alleging rug pull appear to be tied to the sharp drop in PI price this week. The token reached $1.60 on May 12 but started dumping since then and is now at 0.679, representing around a 58% decline. Dr Picoin posted : “Don’t question me—demand an explanation from the Co-founders: why did the price suddenly drop from $1.60 to $0.70 when, in reality, the update from PCT should have been seen as a positive development?” However, the decline is mostly due to the disappointing wait for most users looking forward to the network transitioning to mainnet. A post from the official Pi Core Team account sparked excitement last week when it teased a huge announcement. Most people expected that the announcement would have something to do with the long-awaited mainnet launch, but it was about to be the launch of the Pi Network Venture fund. The news of a $100 million fund for a Pi Network-based project was underwhelming for most users. PI token daily trading volume for the past seven days peaked on May 13 (Source: CoinMarketCap) Interestingly, trading volume for PI declined 34% to $328.54 million in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Trading volume has also declined since peaking at $2.03 billion on May 13. This shows holders sold the rumor, i.e., they dumped the token when it was still pumping before the team announced the launch of the Venture Fund. Since the announcement on May 14, trading volume has fallen well below $1 billion. Pi Network announces new upgrades at Consensus 2025 Meanwhile, Pi Network has continued to evolve even as users wait for the mainnet launch, which has no scheduled date yet. The network founder, Dr Nicholas Kokkalis, disclosed at Consensus that Pi Network has now shut down its central node to enable full decentralization of the network. He added that its node operating software now has a new version called Horizon, which is available for node operators to upgrade. Horizon reportedly offers security, performance, and protocol. Interestingly, Kokkalis said in his talk titled “Unleashing Mainstream Adoption with Al + Blockchain Infrastructure” that Pi Network will integrate artificial intelligence. He called on AI companies to build AI apps on the network, adding that there is a plan to improve Pi Network’s technical infrastructure.

In line with the bullish rhythm of the crypto market, the prominent altcoin has recorded significant price leaps in the past month, resulting in a total gain of 61.92% in this period. However, price patterns indicate that Ethereum is headed for a major encounter at $4,000, a price level with potential to neutralize or validate the current price uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Multi-Year Consolidation Could Spark A Parabolic Move – Details ETH Must Surpass Long-Standing Resistance To Ignite Mega Rally In an X post on May 16, OKC partner and crypto analyst Ted Pillows highlighted an important price level for Ethereum amidst the ongoing bull trend. Notably, ETH has moved by over 60% in the past few weeks from $1400 to trade above $2,600. Based on the growing chart pattern and underlying market fundamentals, the altcoin is likely to maintain this uptrend in the short term. According to Ted Pillows, $4,000 can be described as a crucial price region for ETH bulls based on historical price data. Notably, Ethereum has been trading within a massive symmetrical triangle that began in Q3 2020 and has lasted over 1,500 days. The $4,000 price level currently sits just below the upper boundary of this triangle, representing a significant opposition to further price gains. In 2024, Ethereum popularly faced rejection thrice at the $4,000 price level, even amidst general market upswings, raising speculations over the altcoin’s long-term profitability. If the ETH bulls can sustain the current market demand, another encounter with this major resistance level is likely on the cards. To confirm the altcoin’s participation in a brewing crypto bull run and altseason, Ethereum must push past $4,000, flipping this price zone into an effective support level that could strengthen the current market structure with bullish targets set as high as $12,000. However, if ETH faces another rejection at this resistance zone, a price correction could occur with potential for price lows around $1,700 in line with the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle.

Institutional investments are strong bullish signals of long-term profitability for the ETH market as they indicate a strong demand from these traditional financial institutions with relatively high amounts of liquidity.

With altcoin narratives back in play and sentiment shifting, these three are back on the radar — but in a cycle increasingly driven by breakout timing and asymmetric entries, traders are asking: can these legacy tokens still deliver the explosive moves they once did? While SOL, ADA, and TRX build momentum, some investors are pivoting toward breakout-stage opportunities — tokens with more upside, stronger timing, and no legacy baggage. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE is now making a serious entrance. Solana and Cardano Reclaim Strength — But Capped by Expectations Solana has pushed back into its $170+ range, and Cardano is once again holding above $0.77 — both signs of resilience in a choppy Q2 market. TRON, meanwhile, has benefited from stablecoin inflows and network stability. Yet despite these gains, all three now face the same challenge: they’re expected to perform. With so many traders already positioned, and price caps well-known, the potential for fresh breakout energy is limited . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why Capital Is Rotating Into High-Potential Breakout Plays The prevailing trend in 2025 is unmistakable: traders are targeting tokens with clean technical setups, early-stage entry points, and compelling narratives. Rather than favoring stability, the market is flowing toward assets on the verge of breakout — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a clear beneficiary of this shift. Unlike Solana or Cardano, which have matured into infrastructure giants, MAGACOIN FINANCE is pursuing a different trajectory — one that combines grassroots momentum, scarcity-driven mechanics, and narrative strength. This unique positioning is allowing it to stand out amid a saturated market. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Entering at the Optimal Phase of the Cycle What gives MAGACOIN FINANCE its edge isn’t just pricing — it’s the lifecycle stage. While most top-tier tokens are well into their multi-year paths, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in its pre-listing phase — historically the window where asymmetric upside is most accessible. Traders are paying attention for several key reasons: The entry price is still under $0.001 , with a projected listing target of $0.007 45% of the supply is allocated to early backers, reinforcing exclusivity and scarcity It presents a second-chance setup for those who missed Solana’s early surge or Cardano’s 2021 rally The project is gaining recognition across altcoin communities and scanning platforms — signaling growing sentiment ahead of broader market exposure With these dynamics in play, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a favored early-stage entry for traders seeking breakout positioning ahead of the curve. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thought: Legacy or Lift-Off? Solana, Cardano, and TRON still have strong fundamentals — but fundamentals are not always what drives breakout cycles . In the current environment, fresh narratives and early entries are pulling the biggest moves. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t replacing these giants — it’s offering what they can’t right now: a clean chart, open upside, and cycle-perfect timing .

The executive explained: ""We have validators all around the world. Rotating leader schedules all the time. And then they switch from having to be massive consumers of data to extremely massive broadcasters of data. So that means that they need huge amounts of resources both on ingress and egress."" The executive added that the constraint posed by public internet infrastructure is now the limiting factor in blockchain performance and not compute power or software development.

The goal of the project is to reduce latency, the time it takes for data to travel in a network, and bandwidth — the maximum data traffic a network can handle at once. In April 2025, DoubleZero conducted a validator token sale to sell token purchase agreements to interested node operators seeking to become validators for the network. The token sale was only available to accredited investors and already active validators on high-throughput blockchain networks including, Solana, Celestia, Sui, Aptos, and Avalanche.

Moody's rating agency degrades US credit rating Moody's, one of the major credit ratings agencies, downgraded the US government's creditworthiness from Aaa to Aa1 on May 16, citing increased deficits and a mounting national debt. According to the announcement , the agency forecasts higher US government debt, fueled by increasing interest expense on the debt, and a lack of cost-cutting measures curtailing government spending. The report noted: ""Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat. In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher."" ""The US' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly-rated sovereigns,"" the newly revised credit outlook predicted.

Speaking in a recent interview , Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up. “250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years. “It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market. The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” Melker explained. World Liberty Financial brushes off oversight concerns from Congress Zach Witkoff, one of the co-founders of the Donald Trump family-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), has rebuffed efforts by US lawmakers to investigate the president’s potential conflicts of interest. In a May 15 letter to Senator Richard Blumenthal, lawyers for World Liberty Financial claimed a call to investigate the crypto platform was based on “fundamentally flawed premises and inaccuracies.” Witkoff did not specifically address any allegations, claiming that WLFI was “too busy building” for oversight. “The Company rejects the false choice between innovation and oversight,” said the letter. “What it opposes is the misuses of regulatory authority and uncertainty to suppress lawful innovation.” May 15 letter to Sen.

As the 2025 bull run approaches, attention is turning to high-potential XRP substitutes that offer stronger ecosystems, faster scalability, and more robust DeFi integrations. Whether you’re hunting for the next big cryptocurrency or simply want exposure beyond Ripple, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and the emerging Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are quickly becoming the top altcoins to invest in today, each offering unique value in a rapidly advancing crypto market. Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Phase 4 which is over 80% sold out, already raking in over $8.5 million with over 10,000 investors participating. With a public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 4 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 140% by the time the token hits exchanges. Why Solana and Cardano Are Outshining XRP in 2025 As XRP keeps venturing regulatory seas and making it on the world stage in terms of international remittances, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are gaining attention from investors but for distinctly different reasons. Solana’s fire-throughput capabilities and negligible fee costs have endeared itself to NFT websites and DeFi developers both, while Cardano’s academically-oriented bent and priority placed on peer-reviewed upgrades endears itself to those looking for sustained blockchain sustainability. Relative to XRP, centralised both in governance and use case, the two ecosystems are thriving in innovation and expanding bases. As altcoin buyers remain to consider their alternatives and make investments in this year’s hottest altcoins, SOL and ADA each offer robust alternatives, along with newcomer Mutuum Finance (MUTM) adding further added fuel to XRP alternative investors will need to keep an eye on. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance is being third-party audited, and their open-source smart contracts are secure in design while creating trust among users. The platform is also set to be compatible with non-EVM and EVM blockchains, and the gates swing wider with more liquidity in other ecosystems. Presale Momentum At today’s $0.025, the MUTM token is of huge interest to early investors. A Phase 5 20% price jump will give the token a boost to $0.03. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there’s plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance one of the most-watched low-market-price DeFi plays. XRP’s future remains clouded by regulatory hurdles and stagnating innovation, prompting savvy investors to pivot toward high-utility altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and the rapidly rising Mutuum Finance. Over $8.5 million has already been raised by more than 10,000 adopters, all anticipating serious upside as the presale races toward completion. Phase 4 is over 80% sold out, and the current entry price of $0.025 won’t last long. Phase 5 will jump to $0.03 and the public launch is set at $0.06, locking in up to 140% in potential gains. Analyst chatter points to post-launch prices as high as $3, making this one of the most talked-about DeFi tokens of the year. Act now or risk missing out, Mutuum Finance could be the altcoin breakout of the 2025 bull run.

Their mid-term price predictions spark curiosity, and their positions in the upcoming surge become a topic of debate. This article delves into which of these coins might be primed for a significant rise. Bitcoin Cash Price Trends: Monthly Surge Amid Semi-Annual Dip Bitcoin Cash showed a 23.06% gain over the past month with a notable jump in price, while the six-month performance slipped by 8.38%. The short-term rally indicates renewed market interest, contrasting with a broader decline over a longer period. Price movement has been volatile, reflecting bursts of optimism alongside persistent pressure evident over the last six months. Trading now falls within a range of $282 to $417, with immediate resistance at $469 and a secondary resistance at $605. Strong support appears at $197 and lower at $62. Bulls and bears are in a tug-of-war with no clear trend, making it worthwhile to trade cautiously within these levels while monitoring for significant moves. Litecoin Rally and Support Zones A monthly gain of 33.40% contrasts with a slower 6-month increase of 13.79%, suggesting a recent burst of activity amid overall steady progress. Weekly performance dipped slightly by 1.34%, reflecting some short-term hesitance in price movement. Price levels have oscillated within a moderate range over these periods, showing renewed energy compared to the past half-year. Current trading shows Litecoin positioned between a range of $68.29 and $93.67. The nearest resistance at $103.77 and support near $53.01 form key decision levels. Indicators hint at balanced energy, with neither bulls nor bears decisively controlling the market. Traders might explore opportunities on short-term moves towards resistance or cautious entries near support. Conclusion In 2025, BCH and LTC are expected to play key roles in the crypto market. BCH, with its strong transaction capability, and LTC, known for its fast processing times, could see significant growth. Both coins have established their positions and maintain active communities. They will likely be important players in the mid-term crypto rally. These two cryptocurrencies might attract more investors looking for reliable alternatives to other well-known options.

However, while established players continue leading, early buyers focus on something more promising. Web3 ai, the platform set to launch with a fully operational AI product suite has taken the spotlight where every feature relies on the $WAI coin. It has raised $500K within 24 hours and over $4 million in its presale. It prioritizes real utility instead of speculation. At its current price of $0.000365 in stage 5, with a locked listing price of $0.005242, the Web3 ai ($WAI) offers a 1747% ROI before launch. This is a rare opportunity for those looking to enter a promising crypto. Uniswap Trading Volume Hits $3 Trillion Uniswap has reached a major milestone by surpassing $3 trillion in trading volume, cementing its position as the top decentralized exchange. In response, the UNI coin surged to $6.89, marking a 41% increase over the past week, although some pullback may occur short-term. Uniswap also introduced a rewards tracking feature in its Web App, allowing liquidity providers (LPs) to monitor real-time earnings. Additionally, ERC-7683, a cross-chain liquidity standard, aims to unify markets. A court ruling that protects Uniswap Labs from third-party fraud strengthens its position, reinforcing Uniswap’s solid fundamentals. Dogecoin Price Target Reaches $2 Dogecoin’s price target has been set as high as $2 due to whale buys and ETF speculation. Currently priced between $0.23 and $0.26, analysts are keeping a close eye on the situation after Bitwise registered a “BITWISE DOGECOIN ETF” entity in Delaware, indicating growing institutional interest. Additionally, large holders acquired 590 million DOGE in one day, now controlling about 30% of the supply. Technical indicators, such as MACD crossover and rounded bottom patterns, suggest a bullish trend. Conservative predictions forecast a range of $0.24, while some models predict a rise to $0.57 to $2. Web3 ai’s Real-World Utility Drives Buyers Interest Web3 ai attracts significant attention because it’s geared to delivering results. The project has raised over $4 million, with $500K coming in just 24 hours, reflecting the growing interest from both retail and institutional buyers. The platform offers a range of AI-powered tools, including automated trading signals, portfolio tracking, DeFi yield recommendations, fraud detection, and risk monitoring. Every tool requires the $WAI coin to operate, creating a direct link between platform usage and increased coin demand. Currently, the presale is in Stage 5, priced at $0.000365, with a locked listing price of $0.005242. This offers a potential 1747% return on assets before the official launch. The presale consists of 50 stages, and as the supply becomes more limited, the opportunity to get in at these early stages is shrinking. What sets Web3 ai apart is its execution. The platform’s tools will go live once WAI lists on exchanges, with AI integrated as the core function. Fund managers recognize that the next major opportunity in the market isn’t about following trends but buying solid infrastructure. Web3 ai’s blend of utility and growth potential positions it as a strong candidate for long-term success, making it an appealing asset choice for those looking for real-world value in the crypto space. Final Thoughts Web3 ai stands out not due to speculative potential but because it is already providing real-world utility. The project has raised over $4 million, with $500K coming in just one day, attracting both retail and institutional attention. Its AI-powered tools cover automated trading, portfolio tracking, DeFi yield recommendations, fraud detection, and risk monitoring. Every tool relies on the $WAI coin, ensuring increasing demand as the platform grows. With the presale priced at $0.000365, Web3 ai offers a 1747% ROI at listing.

Daily RSI Shows Only Mild Bullish Momentum,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bull-run-on-daily-rsi-signals-bullish-weakness/,"The price of Bitcoin has been on quite the run since mid-April, finding its way from beneath the $85,000 mark to as high as $104,700 over the past month. The largest cryptocurrency market enjoyed a positive shift in investor sentiment and a fresh influx of capital, especially through the BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Interestingly, the premier cryptocurrency seems to be showing some signs of fatigue, especially after failing to break out of the $102,000 – $105,000 consolidation range over the past week. This sluggish round of price action has called into question the authenticity of the recent bullish impulse. BTC Still Missing Its Bullish Aggression: Crypto Expert Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Tony Severino took to the X platform to share an interesting insight into the price action of Bitcoin over the last few weeks. According to the crypto expert, the price of BTC might be missing a classic technical behavior, often correlated with aggressive bullish impulses. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones—What It Means for ETH The rationale behind this observation is the recent movement of the daily relative strength index (RSI) indicator on the Bitcoin price chart. The relative strength index is a momentum indicator used in technical price analysis to estimate the speed and magnitude of an asset’s price changes. The RSI oscillator is typically used to analyze whether a crypto asset is being overbought or oversold, signaling a potential trend/price reversal. An RSI reading of above 70 usually indicates an overbought market condition, while a relative strength index value below 30 signals an oversold condition. According to Severino, Bitcoin bull runs historically coincide with a rapid surge of the RSI oscillator above the 70 threshold, reflecting overwhelming buying pressure in the market. This pattern is noticeable in the chart below, as highlighted during the October 2023 rally and the November 2024 post-election breakout. However, Bitcoin’s current price action appears more cautious and less convincing. While the market leader has been recovering from its early-year blues, the relative strength index has yet to exhibit the clean upward break (above 70) typical of significant bullish expansions. Severino did note that the Bitcoin bullish impulse—signaled by the RSI break above 70—could emerge at any moment. If the bullish strength does come, investors could see the price of BTC break out of the current consolidation range and toward its all-time high. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, BTC is valued at around $103,676, reflecting no significant price movements in the past 24 hours. The past day’s sluggishness underscores the premier cryptocurrency’s performance in the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the Bitcoin price has increased by merely 0.8% in the last seven days.

From trader forums to presale trackers, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing up as one of the most-watched early-stage entries of the cycle . Key reasons why early buyers are moving fast: A still-undervalued entry price below $0.001 A projected listing at $0.007 , offering built-in upside A hard supply cap of 100 billion tokens , with strong demand from politically driven and speculative traders alike This is not just about tokenomics — it’s about timing, narrative, and community alignment , all colliding at the right moment.

MAGACOIN FINANCE has managed to do all three. Unlike meme tokens that rely purely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as a serious early-stage altcoin setup with structure behind it. Buyers aren’t aping in blindly — they’re making timed entries based on breakout-stage signals . The project has now become a favorite among traders migrating from: XRP , looking for higher ROI SOL and AVAX , seeking new volatility plays DOGE and PEPE , chasing the next political meme breakout — but with stronger mechanics Analysts Are Already Flagging It as the Cycle’s Smartest Early Entry With listings expected to follow soon, analysts are starting to compare MAGACOIN FINANCE’s structure to early Shiba Inu or Trump Coin momentum phases — but with more control, better entry ratios, and tighter token distribution. Some forecasts now point to 40x–50x potential , depending on post-listing liquidity and community retention. What’s clear is this: the early window is closing fast . CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Word: The Standout Pre-Sale of 2025 In a crowded market filled with fleeting hype, only a select few tokens truly shape the early-stage narrative each year.

SUI — Scalable Ecosystem, Surging Sentiment SUI has been one of 2025’s quiet giants, with a 302.57% gain over the past year and an 81.99% jump just this month . A minor token unlock this week hasn’t shaken investor confidence, as the project continues to attract strong volume and developer attention. With key support at $3.76 and bullish price targets as high as $5.21 in May alone, many traders see SUI as a breakout Layer 1 leader. With over $1.74 billion in daily volume and ecosystem momentum building, SUI has the scalability and market interest to push toward the top-10 market cap rankings in the next bull run. 2. Litecoin — Classic Asset With New Technical Strength Often overlooked in favor of flashier tokens, Litecoin is staging a strong comeback. Analysts forecast a potential pullback to $81.06 , but longer-term projections range from $199 to $255 if bullish momentum builds. The formation of a W-reversal pattern signals a potential breakout ahead — especially if LTC can surpass the critical $132.23 resistance level. Litecoin has held up better than many altcoins during market turbulence, and its simplicity, liquidity, and wide acceptance make it a reliable mid-cap bet for the next cycle. 3. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Early-Stage ROI Play With Breakout Potential With over $8 million raised and momentum accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025. Unlike many presales that fade after launch, this project is built on long-term scalability, politically resonant branding, and a viral narrative that continues to attract both whales and retail buyers. Stage 8 is live, and Stage 9 is approaching fast — making access increasingly exclusive. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE from the rest is its strategic timing: the token is aligned with a political cycle that could fuel mainstream media attention and cultural virality just as exchange listings go live. Analysts say the upside isn’t just in price — it’s in positioning. Promo code MAGA50X offers a 50% token bonus, giving early participants more allocation strength ahead of what insiders call a wave of key announcements. These include major integrations, updated roadmap milestones, and wider media exposure already in motion. There are no centralized exchange dilution risks at this stage. Instead, MAGACOIN FINANCE is growing organically through word-of-mouth, verified on-chain whale activity, and an increasingly active global community. It’s the kind of project seasoned investors recognise early — not just for what it is now, but for what it’s setting up to become.

The project’s unique combination of fixed supply, narrative appeal, and a tiered pricing model has helped create one of the most consistent presale performances of 2025. With the presale now advancing into later stages, urgency among buyers is climbing. Current prices remain below the public exchange target of $0.007 , offering projected returns of 25x to 40x for early participants. As each round fills, new buyers are entering at higher price points, reinforcing the growth trend. THE CLOCK IS TICKING FAST – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE Offers More Than Hype Backed by a HASHEX audit , MAGACOIN FINANCE maintains a clear structure and transparent rollout process. The token supply is deliberately limited, and the presale is designed to reward those who take early action. Community channels now exceed 20,000 members , with high levels of activity and ongoing discussion about future use cases. The project also continues to reward proactive investors through its MAGA50X bonus code, which provides a 50% token bonus for qualifying purchases. This has helped enhance investor confidence while fueling continued allocation ahead of the token’s official launch. Why Analysts Are Watching Closely Analysts are tracking MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top early-stage contender this quarter, citing its strong presale consistency and alignment with growing demand for political meme projects that offer real structure. While many meme tokens rely on short-term trends, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing signs of being built for sustainable growth through its phased rollout and steady engagement metrics. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Final Thought: The Window Is Narrowing As momentum builds and price stages rise, investors are locking in positions before the next jump.

Eyes are turning to specific coins, hinting at significant opportunities. Kaspa , Raydium , and AAVE are emerging as strong contenders, possibly poised for impressive growth. This article delves into why these cryptos could lead the way, sparking keen interest for May 2025. Kaspa Breakout: Short-Term Gains Amid Longer-Term Corrections Kaspa experienced rapid gains with a 54% rise in one month and an 11% increase in one week. A six-month decline of nearly 23% reflects earlier bearish trends before the recent surge. Price movements show volatility with periods of strong recovery following earlier drops, highlighting the coin's quick rebound even after broader corrections. At present, Kaspa trades between $0.0585 and $0.1150 with key resistance at $0.1403 and a secondary barrier near $0.1967, while support holds at $0.0274. Bulls push the price in the short term, but a clear trend is yet to emerge. Traders might explore long positions on a sustained break above $0.1403 while staying alert to potential pullbacks toward support levels. Raydium RAY: Recent Surge Amid Long-Term Decline and Key Levels Last month RAY shows a notable rebound with an increase of nearly 40%, while the six-month trend reflects a sharper decline of almost 46%. Price movement illustrates a period of volatility where a short-term rally contrasts with a longer-term downward drift. Historical data reveals a mix of recovery dynamics driven by sudden upward momentum alongside a broader bearish sentiment. Current trading lies between a range of about $1.73 and $3.50, with a nearby resistance at $4.21 and support near $0.68. Bulls appear active, hinting at attempts to breach $4.21, yet the clear trend remains unformed. A cautious approach is advised, considering trades at key levels while respecting the existing range. Aave Surge: Rising Momentum with Key Price Zones in Focus Aave has experienced strong upward movements over the past month, with prices jumping by nearly 68% while recording a solid 40% rise over the last six months. A modest weekly increase of around 7% hints at renewed trading interest and dynamic market activity, reflecting a period of significant recovery and speed in price action. At present, the coin trades between approximately $125 and $191s. Immediate resistance appears near $218 with support around $87, and a further swing to resistance may target the $283 mark while deeper support lies near $22. The interplay of bullish pressure with occasional bearish signals creates a mixed trend environment, prompting strategies that favor cautious breakdowns above resistance or buying near established support levels. Conclusion Kaspa (KAS) , Raydium (RAY) , and AAVE show potential for strong performance by May 2025. Kaspa continues to gain traction with its novel technology. Raydium is making significant strides in decentralized finance. AAVE remains a powerful player with its lending and borrowing platform. These coins have promising futures.

With blue chips already rallying, savvy investors are scanning the market for cryptocurrencies that could explode in the next bull cycle. Projects like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) continue to prove their staying power with solid ecosystems, while Dogecoin (DOGE) rides renewed momentum in meme-driven investing. But beneath the surface, a newer altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is emerging as a potential XRP-level breakout candidate, offering both utility and growth potential. The project is already at Phase 4 of its presale and has already raised more than $8.5 million and more than 10,000 investors. With over 80% sold out during this stage, the price will go up by 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5 and with an expected launch price of $0.06. These four tokens are quickly becoming the top crypto to watch as the next wave of gains builds. Cardano, Solana, and Dogecoin: The Top Altcoins Shaping 2025 While the crypto market readies itself for a massive 2025 surge, Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are emerging as players for investors seeking high returns. Cardano’s research-driven approach continues to attract those in search of a reliable blockchain solution focused on security and scalability. On the other hand, Solana’s speed network and low costs have made it the go-to for developers and DeFi projects to scale quickly. Meanwhile, although Dogecoin did begin as a meme coin, its durability with a devoted following and increasing use cases beyond simple entertainment is nothing short of phenomenal. While these altcoins are causing a stir as among the most high-potential cryptos to invest in today, newer altcoins like Mutuum Finance are making a strong case to stay relevant in the DeFi market, setting the stage for the next cryptocurrency explosion. Mutuum Finance: A New Era in DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance is not just another DeFi wave-rider project. It provides a twin lending mechanism incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) capabilities. The hybrid system offers stability as well as control to users. P2C Lending enables investors to receive yield by providing stablecoins such as USDT to lending pools that are governed by smart contracts, providing a safe and automated means of earning passive income. In contrast, P2P Lending allows direct borrowing and lending relations between users with no middlemen. This aspect enhances privacy and allows for more personalized lending, giving users more control over the transaction. Through this novel setup Mutuum Finance is now a viable and scalable product within the DeFi ecosystem. It is also currently undergoing a third-party audit by Certik to further enhance transparency and investor trust. Fueling Growth Through Community and Rewards The platform is also developing a thriving community with reward-based mechanics. There is an active leaderboard that shows the top 50 token holders and rewarding them with additional MUTM tokens. In addition, there is a token giveaway with a $100,000 prize ongoing, in which ten winners will receive $10,000 each in MUTM. A referral program also incentivizes user growth by rewarding participants who refer new users to the platform. The combination of well-established altcoins like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) with the emerging potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) makes May 2025 an exciting time for crypto investors. With Mutuum already raising over $8.5 million from 10,000+ investors and over 80% of its Phase 4 presale sold out, the momentum is undeniable. As the price of MUTM is set to increase by 20% in the upcoming Phase 5, those who act now can capitalize on its early-stage growth.

Far from being a fleeting trend, it has carved out a leadership position within the political meme space, demonstrating real traction and breakout-level potential. While many imitators rely solely on virality, MAGACOIN FINANCE has taken a more strategic approach — building a community-driven ecosystem underpinned by strong growth metrics, early-access incentives, and clear market appeal. The result is a token that continues to attract capital from across the altcoin spectrum. From Meme Token to Market Contender — MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Rapid Ascent Unlike most meme coins that burn out after a brief wave of social hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing sustained acceleration — propelled by data-backed momentum rather than flash-in-the-pan attention. Key drivers behind its continued rise: A pricing model that rewards early participants with structured upside mechanics A unique blend of cultural relevance and growth-focused positioning Increasing visibility in real-time trading tools and scanner platforms, not just social media mentions This evolution from meme coin to market contender underscores MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growing stature — and positions it as a standout asset with staying power in an otherwise volatile sector. SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE vs. the Rest of the Political Meme Field TRUMP Coin and other political tokens have gained headlines, but many lack consistent volume, stable growth, or trusted mechanics. MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning a different reputation — as a strategic altcoin entry , not a flash-in-the-pan meme. Here’s what makes it stand out: Organic demand that continues to build, with engaged holders and real transaction activity A scarcity-focused supply model, creating urgency among buyers entering before listings Surging relevance in altcoin communities migrating from XRP, SHIBA, and SOL , where traders seek the next fast-moving opportunity CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just benefiting from political hype — it’s outpacing its peers by maintaining consistent upward pressure and capturing attention where it matters . Breakout-Stage Behavior Suggests Next Phase Is Close Technical traders are now spotting accumulation patterns and buy-side volume growth that mirror early breakouts seen in top 2021–2023 tokens. This is no longer a project with just “potential” — it’s becoming one of the most speculatively optimized setups of the year. As listing anticipation builds and market participation increases, many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering its most aggressive phase yet — fueled not by promises, but by real market structure and capital flow . Final Take: MAGACOIN FINANCE Is No Longer Just a Meme — It’s a Momentum Asset This cycle will see many coins pump. But very few will combine timing, traction, and early-stage appeal like MAGACOIN FINANCE is doing right now. It’s gone from being “the next political meme” to being the political meme that’s already delivering traction .

The syndicate was dismantled on May 15, resulting in the arrest of nine men and three women in mainland China and Hong Kong. The suspects allegedly recruited others to open bank accounts to receive proceeds from fraud cases, which were then converted into crypto at crypto exchange shops to launder the illicit funds, Hong Kong Commercial Daily reported on May 17. The criminal organization rented a residential unit in the Hong Kong neighborhood of Mong Kok to plan and carry out its money laundering activities. Of the $15 million laundered, more than $1.2 million was linked to 58 reported fraud cases. Caught in action The bust followed police surveillance on May 15, when two recruits left the syndicate’s Mong Kok base — one visiting a bank, the other an ATM — before both went to convert the cash into crypto at a crypto exchange shop in the neighborhood of Tsim Sha Tsui. Police arrested both individuals on the spot, seizing around HK$770,000 ($98,540) in cash before the funds could be laundered. The other 10 individuals, aged between 20 and 41, were arrested soon after. Police seized approximately HK$1.05 million ($134,370) in cash, over 560 ATM cards, multiple mobile phones, bank documents and records related to crypto transactions. Senior Inspector Tse Ka-lun of Hong Kong’s Commercial Crime Bureau claimed that the individuals often used bank accounts from their friends and family to launder the stolen funds. Hong Kong reported a 12% year-on-year increase in fraud reports in 2024, with authorities making more than 10,000 fraud-related arrests. Of those arrests, around 73% involved individuals who held stooge bank accounts. Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbers The crackdown comes as Hong Kong continues to roll out its crypto regulatory framework to support local innovation, protect consumers and establish itself as a crypto hub. Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission introduced new rules for crypto exchanges offering staking services in April. Two months earlier, the securities regulator rolled out a roadmap to improve market access, optimize compliance, expand product offerings, strengthen crypto infrastructure and foster relationships with industry players.

Powered by advanced algorithms and AI-driven analytics, experts are projecting Mutuum’s price to hit $2.5 shortly after launch, followed by a potential surge to $5 by the end of 2025. Looking even further ahead, many are optimistic that MUTM could reach a massive $25 by 2030, reflecting its utility and growing adoption in the crypto market. At $0.025 per token in Presale Phase 4, Mutuum Finance already has more than 10,000 investors and collected a total of $8.5 million. There are fast moving adopters in this phase with more than 80% of Phase 4 already sold. If you invest in phase 4, your investment will grow by 20% by phase 5 and up to 140% at launch. This is the time to enter. Investors are increasingly eyeing Mutuum Finance as one of the top cryptos to buy now, positioning themselves for the next big wave in decentralized finance. Mutuum Finance Gathers Steam Investor interest in Mutuum Finance is rising fast as its presale gains serious traction. At the current price of $0.025, buyers are positioning themselves for a 20% gain when Phase 5 launches and pushes the token to $0.03. With a planned market launch at $0.06, Phase 4 investors are eyeing a potential 140% ROI. Over $8.5 million has already poured into the project from more than 10,000 backers, and that number continues to grow. The platform diverges a lot from traditional methods since it embraces its buy and distribute strategy. Using this strategy, Mutuum Finance receives the market tokens allocated to stakers, which slowly helps to increase participation as well as improving overall project economics. Besides, a constant flow of incentives is provided in order to encourage ongoing engagement. Leaderboard Rewards System Boosts Engagement The Mutuum Finance platform now has a real-time leaderboard used to showcase the top 50 MUTM holders and community engagement. Keeping their position, gives users additional motivations, thus fuelling the atmosphere of rivalry as well as loyalty which increases the overall community involvement. Security continues to be a vital objective among the team behind Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance has tapped in blockchain security pioneer CertiK to carry out a comprehensive audit of the smart contracts. After the audit is complete, it will be possible to see on Mutuum’s social networks all results, providing the users to see for themselves the safety and credibility of their investments. MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance is also gamifying the user interface with a leaderboard of the top 50 holders of tokens, who are to be rewarded with additional MUTM tokens. On top of that, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on, with ten winners selected to each receive $10,000 in tokens. There is also a referral program running, which rewards users for helping to grow the platform through organic, grassroots outreach. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining attention as one of the most promising DeFi projects, and predictions for its price trajectory are creating serious buzz. AI-driven analytics forecast that Mutuum Finance could hit $2.5 shortly after launch, reach $5 by the end of 2025, and potentially surge to $25 by 2030. As Phase 4 is 80% sold out, the opportunity to buy in at $0.025 is slipping away. Investors who secure tokens now will enjoy a 20% price increase in Phase 5 and a potential 140% ROI at launch. Act fast, Phase 4 is almost gone, and this opportunity may not come again. Secure your position today before the price climbs.

Experts Predict Ruvi AI (RUVI) Will Turn a $2,000 Investment into $960,000 in 2025",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-cardano-ada-reach-1-00-experts-predict-ruvi-ai-ruvi-will-turn-a-2000-investment-into-960000-in-2025/,"Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.76 and is on the rise to $1 , a level many believe will make it a major player in the market. This optimism is fueled by bullish patterns like the inverse head-and-shoulders setup and an imminent Cardano ETF approval . While ADA is getting all the attention, another cryptocurrency is rising to the top – Ruvi . With its groundbreaking AI integration and high returns, Ruvi is carving out its own path to change the blockchain space. Cardano’s Journey to $1 Cardano has always been a pioneer, staying ahead of the curve as a trusted blockchain platform through innovation and market movements. Recent highlights of Cardano’s developments include: $0.75 Support Analysts say Cardano is defending a key support zone. A successful consolidation could take ADA to $1 and beyond . Bullish Patterns Breakouts from falling wedge patterns and the inverse head-and-shoulders setup mean ADA is ready to move up. Cardano ETF The upcoming Cardano ETF filed by Grayscale has increased the chances of ADA getting institutional exposure. Bloomberg analysts predict a 75% chance of approval, which will boost demand. With all these happening, it’s clear why Cardano is getting all the hype, but Ruvi is emerging alongside and that’s a whole different level of innovation in crypto. What Makes Ruvi a Game-Changer? Unlike Cardano’s focus on blockchain and smart contracts, Ruvi uses artificial intelligence to solve real world problems across industries. From predictive analytics to cutting edge applications in logistics and finance, Ruvi has more utility and a stronger narrative for future adoption. Why Ruvi Stands Out AI Powered Ruvi integrates advanced AI to provide actionable insights and optimized solutions, it’s more than just a digital currency. Limited Token Supply With only 5 billion tokens in supply, Ruvi’s deflationary model will create scarcity and drive price up over time.3. Real-World Use Ruvi’s application goes beyond traditional crypto trading, for businesses and individuals alike for wider adoption. Where Cardano is improving its technology to stay competitive, Ruvi is changing the way we think about AI cryptocurrency . Ruvi’s Record-Breaking Presale Getting in early on game-changing projects is where the big profits are and Ruvi is proving this true. The project has already completed a successful phase 1 presale, selling over 100 million tokens and raising $1 million . With over 1,000 investors on board, phase 2 is now open, offering tokens at just $0.015 – an entry point for massive returns. How Much Can You Earn with Ruvi? Ruvi’s presale is packed with bonus incentives . Here’s how your money can turn into life-changing returns: Entry-Level ($600) Tokens at $0.015 = 40,000 Bonus Tokens (20%) = 8,000 Total Tokens = 48,000 Value at $1 = $48,000 Mid-Level ($2,000) Tokens at $0.015 = 133,333 Bonus Tokens (60%) = 80,000 Total Tokens = 213,333 Value at $2 = $426,666 High-Level ($12,000) Tokens at $0.015 = 800,000 Bonus Tokens (100%) = 800,000 Total Tokens = 1.6 million Value at $3 = $4.8 million These numbers show how Ruvi’s model can generate huge returns, especially for those who act now. Ruvi AI vs Cardano Cardano’s strength is in its existing market presence and ecosystem upgrades like Ouroboros Leios to improve blockchain. While ADA is getting to $1, Ruvi is focused on AI and multiple use cases for long term growth. Where Cardano consolidates gains through tech innovation, Ruvi is disrupting the norm by adding artificial intelligence to the equation. Don’t Miss Out on Ruvi The cryptocurrency market doesn’t often give us a chance to be an early adopter of a future winner, and Ruvi is one of them. While Cardano’s ETF and $1 are milestones to watch, Ruvi is changing the conversation with its AI applications and deflationary tokenomics.

While Stellar eyes a potential 126% breakout and Ethereum wrestles with inflation and slowing activity, Unstaked ($UNSD) is focused on performance over promises. Currently in Presale Stage 12, $UNSD is priced at $0.008997 with a projected launch price of $0.1819. That positions early participants for a potential 28x upside, grounded in an ecosystem that rewards measurable engagement, not speculation. Unstaked allows users to deploy AI agents that grow communities across X and Telegram, with every action recorded on-chain. Its $1 million campaign is also live, awarding 20 winners with $50,000 each for task completion, referrals, and a $100 purchase. With $2 million raised in 48 hours and no VC involvement, Unstaked is proving that real utility can still lead the conversation. Stellar Eyes $0.68 Breakout, But Volume Will Decide the Move Stellar (XLM) is gaining attention as it forms a promising bull flag alongside an inverse head and shoulders pattern. If confirmed, this structure targets a move to $0.681, a potential 126% increase from current levels. Analysts are watching for a breakout above $0.3021 with strong support zones between $0.25 and $0.26 offering a solid base. Momentum indicators add weight to the setup. The RSI is rising at 64 without signaling overbought territory, and MACD shows early signs of a bullish crossover. Still, Stellar has faced similar patterns in the past, and without consistent volume, timing becomes everything. Unlike Unstaked, the window here may not stay open long. Ethereum Faces Growth Pressure Despite 33% Rebound Ethereum (ETH) may have rebounded 33% this week, but its long-term strength is under scrutiny. The total ETH supply has reached a record 120.07 million, reversing the network’s deflationary trend. The Dencun upgrade reduced gas fees but also slashed the burn rate, raising new concerns about inflation. At the same time, on-chain activity is slowing as users shift to Layer 2 networks. Staked ETH has dropped from 35 million to 34.04 million, while ETF holdings have fallen by 400,000 ETH since February. As Unstaked introduces a reward-based AI utility, Ethereum’s broad narrative feels less aligned with high-growth potential. Unstaked Raised Over $6M in Presale Without VC or Hype Unstaked is not fueled by hype, it is built on verifiable action. At the heart of its system is the $UNSD token, which earns rewards only when deployed AI agents deliver real engagement across platforms like X and Telegram. These agents are not bots running on scripts. They interact, post, respond, and evolve. Every action is recorded on-chain, tying value to transparent output rather than passive holding. In just 48 hours, Unstaked raised more than $2 million, and total presale funding has now exceeded $6 million. That growth came without private allocations, seed deals, or VC padding. Every participant entered on equal terms. At a current Stage 12 price of $0.008997 and a fixed launch price of $0.1819, the potential upside sits at over 2,000% for early buyers. Adding to its momentum is the $1 million competition. This campaign will reward 20 participants with $50,000 in $UNSD each, but access is earned, not gifted. Users must refer others, complete engagement tasks, and purchase at least $100 worth of tokens to qualify. The structure promotes meaningful growth rather than empty exposure. With $20 million committed to launch liquidity, Unstaked is not offering vague promises. It is delivering a fully operational framework that aligns community action with measurable results. This is not a future vision. It is already working. Quick Recap Stellar has a strong technical setup and Ethereum continues to anchor the ecosystem, but both lack the early-stage advantage and performance-linked mechanics that Unstaked brings to the table. Their roles are established, while Unstaked is still expanding, giving it room to grow where others have already matured. With a $0.008997 entry price, over $6 million raised, up to a 28x upside window, and a $1 million giveaway in motion, Unstaked is more than a promising presale. It is proving to be one of the top crypto coins to buy in 2025 and possibly the most strategic early entry available right now.

Notably, the flagship cryptocurrency has seen a market cool-off in the past two weeks following a 10.7% price leap in early May. Interesting, a crypto analyst with X handle TATrader_Alan, popularly known as Trader Alan, has highlighted a bullish pattern that points to a price target around $115,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Strengthens Vs. Gold, Analyst Sees ‘Higher Than Expected’ Returns Bitcoin Climbs With Precision: $115,000 May Be The Next Stop Amidst an extended crypto market correction in 2025, Bitcoin prices crashed from $109,000 in January to less than $75,000 in mid-April. Since hitting the local bottom at $74,600, the premier cryptocurrency has recorded an impressive market rebound, rising by over 39.1% in the past month to hit a local peak of $105,800. In an X post on May 16, Trader Alan provided an interesting technical insight into this uptrend, highlighting that Bitcoin has repeatedly produced the same leap in dollar value, separated by a period of consolidation. The trading chart from the analyst explains that when Bitcoin surges approximately $10,000, it enters a 7-10 period of sideways consolidation before resuming its ascent. This bullish behaviour has been repeatedly seen with Bitcoin’s leap from $75,000 to $85,000, then to $95,000, and $105,000. Going by this pattern, the crypto market leader is tipped to hit the $115,000 target following a potential breakout from its current price consolidation. If this projection realizes, Bitcoin would achieve a 10.57% gain from current prices, breaking into a new price discovery. This kind of price movement is characteristic of a strong uptrend marked by healthy pauses. The consolidations typically allow the market to cool off after sharp runs, allowing traders to accumulate in preparation for the next leg higher. Importantly, these consolidation zones often act as new support levels, strengthening the bull market structure.

On May 15, the largest Bitcoin holders acquired an additional 2,180 BTC valued at $226,750,000, signaling a strong market confidence. Generally, large accumulations by Bitcoin whales are a typical bullish signal, especially amidst the current uptrend, signalling a strong potential for future price appreciation in line with Trader Alan’s prediction. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $103,281 following a 0.90% decline in the last day. In tandem, the asset’s trading volume is down by 15.76%, suggesting a decline in market interest.

In a sea of hype and speculation, CertiK-audited projects with actual products and traction stand out. As the calendar counts down to June 13, BlockDAG is stealing the spotlight with a massive reveal that could reshape its trajectory and investor portfolios. Here’s a curated list of the top 5 CertiK-audited crypto projects to keep on your radar right now, ranked based on momentum, utility, audit strength, and real-world activity. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) BlockDAG is hands-down the most talked-about crypto with real utility in 2025 right now. The hype is real and backed by numbers. With $253 million raised in presale funding, over 20.6 billion coins sold, and a staggering 2,520% ROI since batch 1, BlockDAG is charging into the market with unmatched momentum. It’s currently in batch 28, and the presale price is frozen at $0.0020 until June 13. But what makes BlockDAG more than just another coin is the delivery of real hardware. Miner shipments have begun, with delivery proof videos to be released soon. This isn’t a concept on a roadmap, it’s a functioning network that is putting hardware into users’ hands today. June 13 is when the big picture comes into full view. The GO LIVE reveal will unveil all 20 exchange listings, an upgrade from the original 10 promised in Keynote 1. Five exchanges, MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart, have already been confirmed. The remaining 15 top-tier listings will be announced during the event. Until then, the limited-time $0.0020 entry point is creating serious FOMO among early investors. Community engagement is spiking thanks to a growing referral program and heated Buyer Battles. BlockDAG is not just building hype, it’s rewarding participation and delivering results. For anyone searching for crypto with real utility in 2025, BlockDAG is the one to watch before the June 13 reveal. 2. Injective (INJ) Injective has consistently delivered strong DeFi infrastructure and maintains a clean track record with its CertiK audit. Its permissionless smart contract environment is tailored for decentralized finance applications, giving developers flexibility without sacrificing security. The native INJ token plays a central role in protocol governance and value capture, adding to its long-term appeal. Unlike many DeFi projects that are still in experimental phases, Injective has real adoption and product depth. It’s not just about the token price, this is a project with user-facing value. For investors looking at crypto with real utility in 2025, Injective sits comfortably on the shortlist. 3. Sui (SUI) Sui is built for speed. Backed by Mysten Labs and boasting one of the fastest transaction finality rates among Layer 1 chains, Sui is tailored for developers needing real-time responsiveness and low fees. Its infrastructure is CertiK-audited, and the ecosystem has steadily expanded to support tools, gaming, and smart contracts. While its price has seen fluctuations, the core technology is solid and increasingly attracting developer attention. With the narrative of scalable infrastructure gaining traction, Sui has carved a niche for itself as a crypto with real utility 2025 worth monitoring. 4. Kava (KAVA) Kava has been building steadily, integrating both Cosmos and Ethereum co-chains into its Layer-1 design. This dual support makes it compatible with a wide range of applications and tokens. Kava’s CertiK audit validates its security posture, and it’s already seeing traction in DeFi circles thanks to lending and yield farming products. Kava may not be the flashiest token on the market, but its slow and steady growth, coupled with a firm audit record, makes it a smart entry in the crypto with real utility 2025 category. 5. Aptos (APT) Aptos came in strong with backing from big names and a strong development team, and it passed CertiK’s rigorous auditing process. The network is known for its parallel execution model, offering high throughput potential. However, Aptos is still wrestling with adoption issues. Despite the technical horsepower, the ecosystem hasn’t grown at the pace investors expected. Still, with its secure foundation and development potential, Aptos remains a watch-worthy project. For those looking at early-stage upside within the crypto with real utility 2025 theme, Aptos could pay off if its user base grows. Final Take As the market sharpens its focus on tokens that offer more than promises, crypto with real utility in 2025 is the defining filter investors are applying. Projects with working products, security audits, and user growth are outperforming the rest. BlockDAG isn’t just checking the boxes, it’s rewriting the playbook with its June 13 GO LIVE event, real hardware deployments, and massive presale traction. If you’re not watching it now, you’re already behind.

While these assets still dominate headlines, investor behavior is shifting beneath the surface. The new beneficiary of that shift? MAGACOIN FINANCE — a smaller altcoin project that’s gaining serious momentum thanks to its community-first approach and powerful early-stage performance. Though not yet on major exchanges, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already attracting attention for one clear reason: ROI potential far above the market average . CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT XRP and Solana Remain Prominent — But Momentum Appears to Be Fading XRP entered 2025 buoyed by renewed optimism tied to regulatory developments, yet its growth trajectory has since moderated. Similarly, Solana (SOL), despite its robust ecosystem and consistent development pace, is beginning to show signs of liquidity fatigue — with much of the earlier upside already realized. In response, investors are recalibrating their strategies, seeking out early-stage assets that offer stronger entry points and more room to run. MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as one such opportunity — still in its early phase, attractively priced, and yet to reach broader market exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Lean Altcoin With Outsized Return Potential In contrast to major projects deploying extensive marketing budgets, MAGACOIN FINANCE has delivered notable performance with limited resources. On key campaign days when all elements align, its return per dollar spent has exceeded that of high-profile pre-sales — a rare achievement in a market often characterized by high funding and underwhelming delivery.

One standout altcoin, Mutuum Finance is drawing serious attention as a Solana alternative with DeFi functionality and long-term growth baked into its roadmap. Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Phase 4 which is over 80% sold out, already raking in over $8.5 million with over 10,000 investors participating. Investors have less time before this phase concludes. With a public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 4 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 140% by the time the token hits exchanges. This project is emerging as one of the best cryptos to invest in today, with market sentiment turning bullish and blockchain innovation accelerating. Analysts and early adopters alike are eyeing a potential surge to $5 by 2026, a move that could rival some of the top crypto gains of previous cycles. That altcoin is Mutuum Finance, a rising star that’s quickly becoming a top contender in the decentralized finance arena. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself through its innovative dual-lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, users can freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools where interest rates adjust dynamically. The P2P model, by contrast, removes intermediaries, giving users full control over their lending agreements. This combination creates a flexible and efficient lending system, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a strong coin for those considering what crypto to invest in or looking for the best crypto to invest in within the changing DeFi market. Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being third-party audited, and their open-source smart contracts are secure in design while creating trust among users. The platform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also set to be compatible with non-EVM and EVM blockchains, and the gates swing wider with more liquidity in other ecosystems. Presale Momentum At today’s $0.025, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token is of huge interest to early investors. A Phase 20% price jump in phase 5 will give the token a boost to $0.03. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there’s plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the most-watched low-market-price DeFi plays. Gamified Ecosystem and Community Incentives Mutuum Finance is also gamifying the user interface with a leaderboard of the top 50 holders of tokens, who are to be rewarded with additional MUTM tokens. On top of that, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on, with ten winners selected to each receive $10,000 in tokens. There is also a referral program running, which rewards users for helping to grow the platform through organic, grassroots outreach. As the market looks toward the next big altcoin, Mutuum Finance stands poised to be a top Solana alternative with its innovative DeFi lending model and explosive presale momentum. $8.5 million raised, 10,000+ investors, and Phase 4 nearly sold out, this token is attracting attention for good reason. At just $0.025 now, investors can expect a 140% return when the price hits $0.06 at launch, with some analysts predicting $3 to $5 in the coming years. Don’t miss your chance to get in early on this rapidly growing DeFi project, as the presale nears its end. Mutuum Finance could be the best crypto to buy now for 2025 and beyond.

UNI token dropped below $6 on Sunday, down from this month’s high of $7.5500. It has also tumbled by over 70% from its highest point in December despite some notable tailwinds. This article explores whether the UNI price has more upside to go. Uniswap has numerous tailwinds Uniswap, the biggest player in the decentralized exchange industry, faces some notable tailwinds that may benefit the UNI token in the future. First, despite strong competition from other decentralized exchanges, it still maintains its robust market share. A good example of this is what happened in the last 30 days when it processed transactions worth over $64 billion , a bigger number compared to its top peers. PancakeSwap handled transactions worth $51.1 billion, while Raydium and Meteora processed $26 billion and $17.8 billion, respectively. This growth is likely because Uniswap exists in more chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, and Avalanche. Second, Uniswap launched Unichain earlier this year, a process that has become highly successful. Unichain is a layer-2 network that aims to be a market leader in the industry. A few months after launch, it has already attracted over 20 developers, and more are on the way. DEX networks in the Unichain project have continued to attract users and volume. For example, Unichain handled over $318 million in the last 24 hours, making it the seventh-biggest player in the industry. It has handled $3.5 billion in the last seven days, a 18% increase from the previous week. Also, Unichain has cumulatively handled over $10 billion since inception. These numbers mean that Unichain has already overtaken some of the oldest and most popular chains in the crypto industry. For example, it has handled more transactions than Cardano, whose cumulative volume is $4.93 billion. It is also beating some popular chains like Tron, Avalanche, and Polygon. The other top Uniswap tailwind is that the network is making a lot of money as volume in the network jump. Data shows that Uniswap has become the second most profitable player in decentralized finance this year. It has made $357 million so far this year, beating other top players in DeFi like Lido, AAVE, and PancakeSwap. Uniswap price analysis UNI price chart | Source: TradingView The 3-day chart shows that the UNI price peaked at $19.42 in November and then retreated to the current $5.7. Its recent attempt to rebound found substantial resistance at the 50-day moving average at $7.54. The coin remains above the important support at $4.6763, the lowest swing on August 1 last year. It is also higher than the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since June last year. Therefore, UNI price will likely remain under pressure for a while and then bounce back once the crypto bull run resumes. Such a move will push it to the next resistance level at $15. A drop below the ascending trendline will invalidate the bullish outlook.

While ADA cools off after a 3% drop, trader sentiment is still looking up, with on-chain signals hinting at a rebound. Meanwhile, the latest Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis shows bullish pressure building fast, with top analysts calling for a $20 breakout as trading volume surges and resistance thins. But there’s another crypto quietly building momentum, one that analysts say could become the best long term crypto pick of 2025. Web3 ai is not just another AI token. Its tools are already live, offering real-time trading signals, portfolio optimization, and price predictions. The $WAI token isn’t hype, it’s utility in action. With more than $3 million raised and predictions soaring past $1, analysts believe Web3 ai is on track to become a blue-chip AI asset in the top 50 cryptos. Web3 ai Targets $1: Analysts Say It’s Just Getting Started Web3 ai is building an AI-powered ecosystem focused on real-time tools for crypto traders. From trade signals to portfolio optimization and price predictions, it’s all designed to run through one interface backed by powerful machine learning. While some platforms are still working on what to build, Web3 ai already has its blueprint, and analysts say that’s why $WAI is catching serious attention. Currently in its presale phase, Web3 ai has 50 total stages, with the token priced at just $0.000365 right now. By the final stage, that price climbs to $0.003267, and then hits $0.005242 when it lists. That’s a projected ROI of 1747%, a number that’s making traders reconsider their picks for the best long term crypto to hold in 2025. What makes this run-up more compelling is that Web3 ai’s value doesn’t just come from hype. The tools it’s building are rooted in real use cases: smarter trading, better portfolio moves, and cleaner exits and entries. This isn’t a general-purpose AI coin, it’s targeted, and it’s built for people who want an edge. With crypto narratives shifting toward utility and AI-driven innovation, $WAI is being called a future blue-chip. Analysts predict it could break $1 after listing and secure a spot among the top 50 tokens. For those hunting the best long term crypto, Web3 ai is turning into the one to watch. Bullish Momentum Builds: Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Points to $20 Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis shows the token pushing toward a breakout, with analysts like Michaël van de Poppe eyeing $20 as the next big target. LINK is already trading above $14.70, and the momentum is picking up fast. Daily RSI is near 62, trading volume is up 15%, and on-chain activity has jumped 12% in a week, these are the kind of signals that often trigger fast upward moves. LINK is also benefiting from positive sentiment in traditional markets. As the Nasdaq posts gains, crypto assets like LINK are seeing renewed interest. A key level to watch is $16.50, breaking it could trigger a run straight to $20. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis is now closely tied to rising institutional interest in DeFi infrastructure, and that’s where LINK continues to play a central role. Trader Sentiment Rises Despite Cardano (ADA) Decline The Cardano (ADA) decline of 3% over the last 24 hours reflects a short-term pullback, but trader confidence hasn’t disappeared. On-chain metrics show that most holders are sitting at a loss, and that usually reduces sell pressure. Sentiment data from Santiment puts ADA’s weighted score at 1.33, still on an upward trend, suggesting optimism is quietly building. Technical charts show ADA stuck between $0.76 and $0.84, with resistance holding strong for now. But if sentiment keeps climbing and selling stays low, ADA could break past $0.84 and test $0.92. The Cardano (ADA) decline might just be a setup for a reversal, especially with buyers showing interest again around support levels. Traders watching for medium-term moves are keeping ADA on the radar. Why Web3 ai Could Be the Best Long Term Crypto Pick The Cardano (ADA) decline hasn’t shaken trader confidence, with positive sentiment and reduced sell pressure hinting at a bounce from the $0.76 support. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis points to a run toward $20, as volume rises and momentum builds above key resistance levels. But the real story may be unfolding in Web3 ai’s presale. With $WAI currently priced at $0.000365 and projected to hit $0.005242 at listing, the potential 1747% ROI is turning heads. Its AI-driven tools will have the power to shape smarter trades, forecasts, and portfolio optimization. Analysts say Web3 ai could soon be viewed as a best long term crypto and expect $WAI to break $1 and land in the top 50 market cap rankings. In a cycle filled with noise, this looks like one of the few tokens with real utility and breakout potential.

As ETH and XRP face mounting resistance and regulatory delays, attention is rapidly shifting toward a rising opportunity that is already dominating the altcoin conversation: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Ethereum Faces ETF Drag Despite Upgrade Momentum Ethereum recently surged over 43% in early May , powered by the Pectra upgrade and renewed on-chain activity. However, that momentum has begun to stall. Despite institutional optimism, ETF outflows and regulatory hesitation are holding back a sustained move past the $2,600–$2,740 resistance zone. Even with support from the “Trillion Dollar Security Initiative” and AI network integrations, many analysts believe Ethereum needs in-kind ETF creation and staking approval before it can retest the $4,000–$5,000 range. Until then, Ethereum holders may face diminishing returns amid increased volatility and slower growth. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW XRP’s Legal Victory Fuels Hype — But Is It Priced In? XRP soared to $2.65 this month after Ripple finalized a long-awaited SEC settlement, unlocking funds and clearing legal hurdles. The approval of XRP futures-based ETFs and a likely spot ETF decision in June have made headlines — and rightly so. Yet analysts warn that much of the bullish news may already be priced in. With short-term targets around $2.85–$3.40 , many investors believe XRP’s biggest gains may be behind it for now, especially given overbought indicators and slowing network activity. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Talk Among Smart Money While ETH and XRP consolidate, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as the breakout altcoin attracting serious capital. Within minutes of launching, MAGACOIN FINANCE saw instant traction — with early buyers jumping in amid growing excitement over its decentralized, no-middlemen structure . Its momentum has only intensified since, with MAGACOIN FINANCE being described by insiders as a pure financial freedom asset — no banks, no institutions, just ownership and opportunity. Why Investors Are Positioning in MAGACOIN FINANCE Ahead of Exchange Listings As Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) navigate technical hurdles and ETF-related stagnation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a compelling alternative — offering the kind of early-stage growth potential no longer available in these established assets. Analysts monitoring on-chain activity have noted an uptick in large wallet accumulation, signaling growing confidence in the project’s ROI prospects before it debuts on major exchanges. With no institutional overhead and a community-driven framework, MAGACOIN FINANCE is resonating with experienced altcoin investors who are targeting the market’s next breakout performer. The project’s early traction was unmistakable — with significant capital inflows from its inception, it has quickly solidified itself as a strategic entry for growth-focused traders. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST What’s Fueling the Market Rotation Ethereum and XRP continue to encounter resistance and overbought technical signals Institutional participation in ETH ETFs remains underwhelming, limiting near-term upside XRP’s ETF-driven momentum appears increasingly priced in MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a clean slate — early, agile, and powered by a rapidly growing community High-volume wallet activity is accelerating, pointing to coordinated accumulation As market participants scan for stronger ROI setups, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping in to meet that demand — offering a timely, high-upside entry while legacy coins fight for incremental movement.

In particular, GateToken is gaining traction as part of its growing exchange ecosystem, and Bitget Token continues to expand globally with notable liquidity milestones. But amid these developments, one name is increasingly surfacing in serious crypto conversations— Qubetics ($TICS). More than just another token, Qubetics offers infrastructure-level innovation that solves a real bottleneck in today’s digital asset environment: cross-border transactions across multiple blockchains. Paired with a structured presale nearing $18 million raised, Qubetics is now making a case for itself as the best crypto to get rich—not just by hype, but by utility, traction, and math. Qubetics Bridges Chains and Economies with Real-World Applications Most token projects position themselves as “solutions,” but few offer tangible pathways to actually replace or improve broken legacy systems. Qubetics does exactly that through its robust cross-border transaction architecture. It’s designed as a Web3 aggregator—the first of its kind—that allows assets, contracts, and users to move across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, and beyond, in real time and without centralized bottlenecks. Imagine a logistics company in Mexico paying suppliers in India and freelancers in Germany—all with digital assets. Using Qubetics, they can streamline multi-chain payments, reduce costs, and eliminate the need for third-party conversions or bridge risks. Likewise, a decentralized payroll startup in Canada can manage on-chain salaries across Solana and Avalanche in one unified dashboard—courtesy of the Qubetics backend. This multi-chain orchestration is where Qubetics separates itself. It doesn’t just theorize interoperability—it builds it. For users searching for the best crypto to get rich, the practical value of being positioned early in a project that solves a core Web3 hurdle is difficult to ignore. Qubetics Presale Nears $18M—Is It the Best Crypto to Get Rich at Entry Level? The Qubetics presale is currently in Stage 34, priced at $0.2532 per $TICS token. Over 512 million tokens have already been sold, with more than 26,500 participants onboarded. What’s turning heads is the precision in timing—each stage lasts only 7 days, and every Sunday at midnight, the token price increases by 10%. This isn’t randomness—it’s a formula designed to reward early entries and reflect real-time demand. At the current stage, a $100 allocation yields approximately 394.82 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits $1 after the presale, that turns into a 294.84% return. If it reaches $5, the ROI becomes 1,874.21%. At $10, the value climbs to 3,848.42%, and a future price of $15 after the Q2 2025 mainnet launch could result in a 5,822.63% ROI, or $5,922.30 from a $100 entry. Such math explains why the Qubetics presale is being viewed not just as a strong early-stage project, but as one of the best crypto pre sale opportunities on the market. The utility, structure, and velocity of funding all reinforce its status as a serious contender for those seeking the best crypto to get rich —especially with the mainnet just months away. Bitget Token Expands Global Footprint Amid Growing Futures Volume Bitget Token (BGB), the native utility token of the Bitget exchange, has made significant strides this year. According to recent announcements and platform updates, Bitget has expanded its user base to over 25 million globally, with its derivatives trading volume consistently ranking in the top five across all exchanges. BGB plays a central role in Bitget’s growing ecosystem. It offers fee discounts, staking opportunities, and priority access to new token listings and launchpad events. More recently, the exchange has also expanded its Launchpool offerings, which has driven higher demand for BGB tokens in liquidity farming activities. However, BGB remains closely tied to the growth and performance of the Bitget exchange itself. While that’s not inherently negative, it means token upside is dependent on exchange volume and product rollouts. For those seeking exposure to high-volume platforms, BGB offers solid short-term positioning. But for those scanning the horizon for the best crypto to get rich, its reliance on centralized infrastructure could cap its ceiling compared to infrastructure-level plays like Qubetics. GateToken Gains Utility as Ecosystem Activity Ramps Up GateToken (GT), the native asset of Gate.io, has also gained renewed attention as the platform accelerates product launches and ecosystem initiatives. Over the past six months, Gate.io has introduced several high-yield structured products and upgraded its smart contract insurance layer—each one reinforcing GT’s functional relevance. Users holding GT now gain access to lower trading fees, early participation in startup projects, and yield enhancements on staking programs within the Gate ecosystem. Notably, the Gate Grants Program has channeled over $10 million into early-stage blockchain development, driving GT adoption among new builders. Despite this growing utility, GT still trades below its 2021 highs and faces heavy competition from other exchange-based tokens. Its upside is respectable but limited to exchange growth and ecosystem retention. While it may appeal to short-term market participants, it lacks the explosive ROI structure that Qubetics offers through its presale and real-world application. For community members hunting for the best crypto to get rich, GT appears more of a supporting role than a breakout lead. Conclusion: What’s the Best Crypto to Get Rich in This Cycle? Bitget Token is expanding reach, and GateToken is layering in new utility at the exchange level. Both play important roles within their ecosystems and could see consistent upward movement tied to platform adoption. But when it comes to structured opportunity, real-world utility, and long-term scalability, Qubetics is delivering at every level. Its cross-border transaction application, Web3 aggregator status, and precise 10% weekly price model in the presale—backed by $17M+ already raised—create a compelling financial and technological case. With the Qubetics presale still active, and its Q2 2025 mainnet launch on the horizon, early participants are positioning themselves at what could be the ground floor of the best crypto presale this year. For those asking what’s the best crypto to get rich without relying on hype or market noise, Qubetics is standing tall—fully built, fully funded, and just getting started. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the best crypto to get rich in 2025? Qubetics is emerging as the best crypto to get rich due to its cross-chain application, structured ROI model, and presale growth momentum. How does the Qubetics presale work? Each stage lasts 7 days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday. The current price is $0.2532, with over 512M tokens sold and $17M+ raised. Are exchange tokens like Bitget and GateToken still worth holding? Yes, they offer steady growth tied to platform success. But they may lack the explosive potential of infrastructure-based projects like Qubetics.

Mutuum Finance Phase 4 presale which is over 80% sold, is currently offering tokens at $0.025, with strong investor support driving the acquisition by over 10,000 buyers, raising a total of $8.5 million. Investors participating in this phase stand to earn a 140% profit when the token reaches $0.06 at its exchange launch. As the market heats up again, traders are wondering which crypto to buy today for short-term gains, and more importantly, which could be the next to hit $1. Dogecoin, with its loyal fanbase, still dominates headlines, but Mutuum’s utility-driven model could give it the edge in the 2025 bull run. Mutuum Finance may get there first. Dogecoin’s Road to $1: Hype or Real Possibility? Dogecoin began as a joke, but its journey has been anything but funny. With the backing of an enthusiastic internet community, Dogecoin has surprised everyone and stayed one of the top cryptocurrencies even without a clear use case. Its price surges are usually fueled more by social sentiment than utility, so it’s a volatile but fascinating short-term trading vehicle. Even though meme culture continues to fuel crypto investment, others remain convinced that Dogecoin has a shot at the elusive $1 price target. But in an ecosystem that is increasingly obsessed with utility and DeFi advancements, newer players like Mutuum Finance offer a more pragmatic path to long-term appreciation. Mutuum Finance Presale The investor support for Mutuum Finance Phase 4 presale continues to grow steadily throughout its development cycle. Buyers are investing in the platform due to its sustainable DeFi solution, which is built on a more robust development scale than typical meme coin volatility. So far, the presale has collected more than $8.5 million from investors while gathering over 10,000 token holders, an early sign that it could be one of the best crypto projects to watch as momentum builds. Early participants find Phase 4 tokens highly appealing because they are available at $0.025 during the ongoing phase. The platform launch will raise token prices to $0.06 at launch thereby delivering a 140% profit to Phase 4 investors. Analysts anticipate MUTM will achieve a post-listing price of $2.50 which would significantly enhance its market value. Investors can anticipate a price enhancement to $0.03 in phase 5 which indicates future price growth for MUTM. A recently unveiled dashboard of Mutuum Finance presents a leaderboard ranking of token holders where top 50 holders who stay in their position earn bonus tokens to boost long-term investor interest. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Dual-Model System Mutuum has a special dual-lending system. It combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) methods. This offers maximum flexibility. P2C System: Smart contracts through P2C System regulate lending pools by modifying interest rates according to market trends which provides lenders with financial stability while securing loans for borrowers. P2P System: This decentralized system removes middlemen. It creates direct links between lenders and borrowers. This gives both borrowers and lenders full control over the process. Dogecoin may still win headlines through hype and celebrity endorsements, but smart capital is flowing into platforms delivering real innovation. Mutuum Finance has already attracted over 10,000 investors and secured $8.5 million during its presale, which is now over 80% sold out. The current price of $0.025 won’t last long, Phase 5 will bump it to $0.03, and launch is set at $0.06, offering a 140% return as it hits the open market. Secure your MUTM tokens now or risk watching from the sidelines as others ride this DeFi rocket toward $1 and beyond.

Solana (SOL) continues to scale. Yet amid these large-cap movements, one emerging project is capturing sustained attention from seasoned market participants: MAGACOINFINANCE . As traders increasingly pursue early-stage entries with higher return potential, MAGACOINFINANCE remains at the forefront of the 2025 altcoin landscape . While ETH and SOL remain fundamentally sound, the data signals a clear trend — strategic capital is flowing toward MAGACOINFINANCE for its asymmetric reward profile and high-growth positioning. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Ethereum’s Recovery Is Not Without Limits Following a challenging start to the year, Ethereum is beginning to show signs of renewed strength. Growth in Layer 2 ecosystems and renewed focus on scalability, particularly from Vitalik Buterin’s latest proposals, have bolstered investor confidence. However, despite these developments, ETH’s price trajectory remains relatively constrained — influenced by its large market capitalization and mature valuation. In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE delivers what Ethereum currently cannot: meaningful upside potential. With a defined listing target and significant spread between current levels and projected highs, it is being positioned by traders as a rare-cycle opportunity that offers outsized return potential in a market that rewards timing and bold entry decisions. Solana Pushes Forward — But the Big Speculative Bets Are Still on MAGACOIN FINANCE Solana’s user base continues to climb, and DEX volume shows impressive strength. It is arguably the most efficient L1 on the market today. Still, the breakout potential is viewed as steady rather than exponential. That is where MAGACOIN FINANCE draws its strength — not from slow-and-steady adoption, but from being a high-momentum coin built for this exact kind of cycle . In a year where precision timing matters more than ever, it is no surprise that buyers are prioritizing entries that offer the clearest path to a 25x or 35x outcome — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is at the top of that list. MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Lead the 2025 Altcoin Rally Analysts reviewing altcoin trends across Q2 are already flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the few tokens that continues to build traction despite fierce competition. The reason? Its structure is intentionally designed to reward early positioning — and the market is responding. With limited supply access, clear ROI targets, and widespread visibility across trading circles, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to deliver the kind of setup that seasoned market watchers seek when the altcoin window opens . Its presence isn’t just about hype. It’s about precision timing, calculated entries, and a clear narrative heading toward listings — the same combination that has defined previous altcoin leaders. Final Take: Confidence Remains High While Ethereum and Solana deserve their recent gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in its own lane — and that’s exactly where many traders want to be. The confidence is not accidental. It is a reflection of the metrics, the mechanics, and the message behind MAGACOIN FINANCE. This is not a coin hoping to catch a wave. This is a project built to lead one . To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, please visit: Website: https://magacoinfinance.com Twitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance.

Although a short-term volatility is currently playing out, the long-term outlook is undoubtedly bullish. Related Reading: Analysis: Crypto Heats Up As $35 Billion Enters Market In Under A Month Some analysts are looking to long-term cycle indicators for direction. One such tool, the Golden Ratio Multiplier, which called the Bitcoin top in 2021, has resurfaced with another interesting top for the current Bitcoin cycle. Golden Ratio Multiplier Identified 2021 Top, Now Points To New Peak Taking to a post on social media platform X, popular crypto analyst CryptoCon highlighted the reliability of the Golden Ratio Multiplier in predicting Bitcoin’s price top in each cycle. The Golden Ratio Multiplier is a logarithmic model that incorporates Fibonacci-derived multipliers to anticipate Bitcoin’s macro trends. Notably, this metric was among the few to accurately call the April 2021 cycle top in real time, the same as the 2017 and 2013 price tops. This cycle, the model has already flagged a significant peak in March 2024, although the crypto analyst interpreted this not as the final high but as a mid-top. CryptoCon explained that Bitcoin’s price action has already hit Level 4 of the multiplier chart this cycle, but this isn’t the final peak. “We’ve already hit our cycle top level this cycle once, but this was for the cycle mid-top in March 2024, which means we’re bound to do it again,” he wrote. The Level 5 band now sits around $160,000 and continues to trend upward. Drawing a parallel to past cycles, CryptoCon noted that the structure of the current cycle shows strong similarities to the 2015 to 2017 period, when Bitcoin saw a gradual build-up followed by an explosive breakout. Based on this comparison, the current market phase is seen as equivalent to April 2017, right before Bitcoin went on a rally in the months that followed. Golden Multiplier Ratio Suggests $160k Is Next Major Target The chart accompanying CryptoCon’s post paints a familiar picture with the Golden Multiplier Ratio. Each band, ranging from Level 1 to Level 10, is based on a multiplier level derived from the 350-day moving average. Bitcoin has topped at various levels: Level 10 in 2011, Level 9 and 8 in 2013, Level 7 in 2017, and Level 6 in 2021. The current cycle’s peak should most likely be Level 5, but the Bitcoin price is yet to get there. Related Reading: ‘Judgment Day Is Coming’—XRP Set To Explode, Analyst Warns Should the market continue to respect this structure, Bitcoin could be preparing for a rally toward the Level 5 mark of $160,000 sometime later in the year, which could mark the final high of this cycle. The current range around $103,000 may well be the calm before the final breakout. “Slower buildup, then all at once,” the analyst said. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $102,971.

At its current price point, many are wondering whether this rising DeFi crypto has the potential to hit $5. With its innovative approach to decentralized finance and increasing adoption in the altcoin market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be on the brink of explosive growth. The project has reached Phase 4 of its presale surpassing $8.5 million in funding, backed by more than 10,000 investors. Currently priced at $0.025, MUTM will enjoy a 20% increase in the next Phase 5, reaching $0.03. Investors have already bought over 80% of Phase 4, meaning you have less time before it concludes. As MUTM continues to build momentum, it might not be long before it joins the ranks of the most talked-about projects, as investors eye it as a long-term investment in the crypto ecosystem. Mutuum Finance: Rising Star of DeFi Innovation Mutuum Finance is soon going to become a trendsetter in the field of decentralized finance (DeFi) with its path-breaking double-lending platform. By bringing Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models in an innovative manner uniquely, the platform has already caught a lot of attention. Already, over 10,000 investors have put in presale more than $8.5 million, depicting the very high confidence and appeal of the project. With the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token price of $0.025 during Phase 4, there should be a 20% appreciation in price when the platform enters Phase 5, with an early opportunity for meaningful profit prior to reaching the projected market listing price of $0.06. For those searching for the next crypto to explode, MUTM presents a strong case as a project with high upside potential. Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Lending Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) technological edge is its hybrid lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model permits users to make passive income by loaning the USDT to liquidity pools operated through the use of smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model on the other hand removes the middleman. It allows users to lend and borrow directly. This gives them more control and privacy. By combining these two systems, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as one of the best cryptos to invest in today. It offers decentralization, security, and efficiency. Gamified Ecosystem and Community Incentives Mutuum Finance is also gamifying the user interface with a leaderboard of the top 50 holders of tokens, who are to be rewarded with additional MUTM tokens. On top of that, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on, with ten winners selected to each receive $10,000 in tokens. There is also a referral program running, which rewards users for helping to grow the platform through organic, grassroots outreach. Mutuum Finance isn’t just another presale token, it’s shaping up to be a DeFi powerhouse as investors rush to secure positions before Phase 4 fully sells out. Over $8.5 million raised and 10,000+ backers signal growing market trust in MUTM’s vision. Early adopters buying at $0.025 could see a 140% return by launch and potentially a 20,000% surge if the $5 target by 2025 is reached, as some analysts predict. Momentum is accelerating fast, and presale slots are disappearing by the hour. Once Phase 4 ends, this price is gone for good, don’t wait until headlines announce the $1 breakout. Lock in your position now or risk watching others 10x while you’re stuck on the sidelines.

Dogecoin and Cardano are both making strides, one through price structure, the other via ecosystem investment, but it’s BlockDAG that’s capturing wider attention in early-stage strategies. With nearly $255 million secured in its presale and a fixed $0.0020 coin price until June 13, BlockDAG presents more than a bet, it offers a system backed by milestones. Its upcoming Go Live Reveal will confirm listings on 20 exchanges, five of which are already disclosed. Alongside this, miner shipments are already being fulfilled and the Buyer Battles campaign keeps driving participation by distributing 150 million BDAG daily. Unlike many passive presales, BlockDAG has built a campaign around transparency and ongoing delivery. While ADA and SHIB move forward with network progress, BlockDAG is presenting a compelling case as a next-generation Layer-1 network to watch. Dogecoin Aims for $0.27 as Technical Setup Strengthens Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to hold interest among short-term traders focused on technical signals. A familiar ascending triangle pattern is now taking shape, which often hints at a potential breakout to the upside. If DOGE manages to maintain its current support at $0.20, analysts suggest a move toward $0.27 could follow. Additional on-chain data adds weight to this outlook. Wallet activity has grown, and a rise in large transactions suggests whales are showing renewed interest. Historically, this kind of behavior has preceded wider retail entry, especially when chart patterns align. However, DOGE remains largely tied to market sentiment. For a breakout to sustain, the coin will likely need consistent optimism and possibly external triggers. Still, its renewed attention from traders makes it a key token to monitor in the short term. Cardano’s $225M Funding Push Highlights Long-Term Vision Cardano (ADA) is gaining traction following the reveal of a $225 million ecosystem development proposal. This funding is intended to drive forward protocol enhancements, decentralized apps, and governance improvements, further reinforcing Cardano’s efforts to stay relevant in the evolving blockchain space. Though some buyers are asking how the funds will be allocated and whether it may affect token supply, the market has responded with stability. ADA is currently holding around $0.78, with analysts identifying $0.80 as a key breakout point. If resistance at that level is surpassed, ADA may reach $0.85 in the short term. More importantly, the size of this funding round shows that Cardano is serious about competing with newer, faster-moving platforms by committing to its long-term development roadmap. BlockDAG’s Presale Framework & June Reveal Attract Serious Buyers While DOGE and ADA show signs of growth in their respective sectors, BlockDAG is emerging with a different kind of appeal, structure and clarity. With nearly $255 million already raised in its presale, BlockDAG is becoming one of the most heavily funded Layer-1 chains before launch. The upcoming Go Live reveal on June 13 is a critical moment, when all 20 exchanges supporting BDAG will be announced. So far, five exchanges have been confirmed: MEXC, LBank, Coinstore, XT.com, and BitMart. These names offer wide access and liquidity, which adds legitimacy to the listing roadmap. Unlike many early-stage coins that delay launches or hide exchange plans, BlockDAG is openly proving its progress before going live. It’s important to note that trading won’t start on June 13. The actual listing will occur once the $600 million presale target is reached. But with the coin price locked at $0.0020 until that reveal date, there’s a clear window for buyers to enter before market volatility begins. Beyond announcements, BlockDAG is actively engaging its community through a unique Buyer Battles system. Each day, 150 million BDAG are distributed among contributors, and if any coins remain unsold, the largest buyer receives them. This gamified structure keeps energy high and rewards those who commit early. Why BlockDAG Is Gaining an Edge in the 2025 Market Dogecoin and Cardano both present solid mid-year cases. DOGE’s bullish triangle pattern suggests an approaching move, while Cardano’s massive development budget underlines its growth ambitions. Yet BlockDAG offers something they currently do not, a confirmed, structured presale process backed by listings and real utility. With its price fixed at $0.0020 until June 13, five major exchanges already secured, and momentum building through both infrastructure and incentives, BlockDAG is fast becoming the most strategically positioned Layer-1 launch of 2025. For those seeking strong upside backed by measurable progress, the time to act may be right now, before this presale window closes.

While Ethereum (ETH) , Avalanche (AVAX) , and Cardano (ADA) maintain strong fundamentals, a wave of traders is now turning toward MAGACOIN FINANCE —the meme-powered altcoin drawing serious attention with real upside potential. Ethereum (ETH): Solid but Seeking Momentum Ethereum remains the dominant force in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 infrastructure, with a market cap nearing $291 billion . But with ETH consolidating in the mid-$2,400s and lacking short-term catalysts, traders are eyeing younger projects with sharper ROI prospects.

While its fundamentals remain intact, the growth pace has slowed—leading many investors to seek higher-beta altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE for better exposure to explosive moves. Cardano (ADA): Technically Sound, But Sluggish ADA is trading near $0.68 , supported between $0.63–$0.66 , yet lacks clear momentum. Long-term holders remain loyal, but fast-moving traders are chasing opportunities with immediate potential—and that’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the scene.

While the session lacked a clear directional push, he noted that this kind of pause often precedes a sharper move. CRYPTOWZRD plans to monitor the intraday chart tomorrow for a potential reversal setup above the $15.85 mark, which he views as the first sign of bullish intent. However, a sustained move above $16.80 would offer a more confirmed breakout and a stronger long opportunity, indicating buyers are beginning to take control. Can Chainlink Break Free From Current Stagnation? In his latest analysis, CRYPTOWZRD pointed out that LINK and LINKBTC closed today’s session indecisively, with daily candles reflecting weakness in the price action. While the lack of a clear direction is notable, both assets will need to see a surge in buying pressure from these levels in order to establish a new bullish trend. Related Reading: Chainlink Flashes Daily Buy Signal – Breakout Next? Particularly for LINKBTC, CRYPTOWZRD suggested that a potential push higher could materialize as Bitcoin dominance nears its resistance target. This rise in Bitcoin dominance could provide the necessary tailwind for LINK to gain momentum and transition into a bullish phase in tandem with broader market movement. For LINK, the $16 level has become an important support zone as a bullish reversal from this area would add impulsive price action, potentially driving Chainlink toward the $19.50 resistance target in the near term. If Chainlink breaks decisively above $19.50, CRYPTOWZRD anticipates a more substantial rally that could propel the asset towards the $30 resistance level. However, these bullish outcomes hinge on a consistent upside pressure and a healthy price structure to support the move. At this juncture, the market is waiting for the formation of the next trade setup, whether it be a strong reversal off support or a clean breakout above resistance, to provide momentum for the next significant move. Watch For Breakout Or Consolidation In conclusion, the analyst observed that today’s intraday chart was characterized by choppy and slow price action, with no clear direction established. Given the lack of momentum, the expectation is heightened volatility as the market works through these levels. However, the price needs to break decisively above the $16.80 intraday resistance level to trigger a solid long entry. Related Reading: Chainlink Just Retested Key Support – Here’s Where Price Could Be Headed Next That said, there is also the possibility that price may move sideways in the near term, consolidating within a range. If that occurs, $15.85 will act as the key intraday support target, where the market could find temporary stability before deciding its next move. With the current indecisiveness in the market, the best course of action is to wait for a well-formed chart pattern or a clear setup that provides a high-probability trade entry.

Let’s take a closer look at the latest price analysis and what could happen next. XRP Price Analysis: Key Levels to Watch On the daily chart, XRP recently fell below an importan t support line around $2.44, which is a short-term bearish sign. Right now, the price is finding some support near $2.30. If XRP breaks below $2.30, the next support level to watch would be between $2.10 and $2.15. On the other hand, resistance is now sitting between $2.43 and $2.44. If the price manages to move up, another major resistance lies at $2.60. Fibonacci Levels Show Strong Resistance Ahead Looking at the Fibonacci retracement tool, a key resistance zone known as the golden pocket sits between $2.55 and $2.62. If XRP breaks above $2.62 with strong confirmation (meaning daily candle closes above this level), it could trigger a bullish rally towards $2.90. Is There a Bullish Pattern Forming? There’s a chance XRP might form a large inverse head and shoulders pattern, a bullish chart formation. However, this isn’t confirmed yet. For this pattern to complete: XRP would need to drop further towards $2.10-$2.15 Then bounce back up towards $2.60 And finally break above $2.60 with confirmation If this happens, it could set XRP up for a strong rally, possibly pushing the price above $3 and towards new all-time highs.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-18 03:53:53

The chances of an ETF centered on Cardano are rising, now at 55%. Amid these shifts, could emerging player XYZVerse be poised to outdo the market with expected growth of 1.5 times? This article explores these developments and what they could mean for investors. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $13 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333 . At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Cardano’s ADA: A Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain designed for flexibility, sustainability, and scalability. It supports smart contracts, facilitating the development of decentralized finance applications, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and participate in staking on the network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more energy-efficient compared to traditional proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This structure enhances its ability to process a high number of transactions, potentially up to a million per second. Introduced in March 2021, Cardano’s native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. The platform’s focus on scalability and energy efficiency sets a new benchmark for blockchain technology. In the current market cycle, ADA’s features may appeal to users and developers interested in sustainable and scalable blockchain solutions. The technology underlying Cardano positions it as a significant option for those looking to engage with decentralized applications and smart contracts. Conclusion While ADA targets a 15% rise, XYZVerse’s innovative sports memecoin aims for 20,000% growth, offering early investors a unique, community-driven opportunity.

Unstaked has emerged with strong momentum, securing over $6 million in funding and drawing widespread attention. Its expanding community, upcoming AI-driven tools, and a five-month $1 million Gleam contest with thousands participating are placing it firmly in discussions about standout 2025 crypto stories. The key question is whether Unstaked can outperform established top crypto coins like Aave (AAVE) and Hedera (HBAR) in the upcoming rally. While Aave continues on a steady path and Hedera struggles with investor confidence, Unstaked is gaining recognition as a unique contender. This article outlines how Unstaked measures up against these well-known coins, and whether its budget-friendly stage price and expanding visibility could drive it toward the $1 milestone by 2027. Aave (AAVE): Steady Lending Protocol with Slower Upside Aave is still a leader in decentralized lending protocols. As of May 2025, the platform holds over $40 billion in deposits, mainly in its v3 protocol. Most of its activity comes from Ethereum and related assets, highlighting strong borrowing and lending demand. Despite these numbers, Aave’s price outlook points to modest gains. With Ethereum recovering to $2,500 and AAVE up 25% in the past week, analysts see slow and consistent growth. However, for those looking for steeper price movement, newer names like Unstaked offer a more compelling outlook. This gap between Aave’s solid tech and limited price action has created space for other top crypto coins with stronger appeal to users and more accessible entry points. Hedera (HBAR): Strong Infrastructure, Limited Price Lift Hedera has long been promoted for its enterprise-ready design. Its fast confirmations, low fees, and secure Hashgraph base give it strong appeal to sectors like supply chain, identity, and payments. Still, the Hedera (HBAR) price prediction remains unimpressive. Even with a 30% gain in the past month, HBAR has not sustained prices above $0.5, and the $1 target remains uncertain. Years of low price movement have cast doubt over its growth expectations. Compared to other top crypto coins, Hedera has had difficulty gaining attention from everyday users. The price and adoption disconnect continues to be a major barrier. Unstaked: Real-Use Features, Rapid Growth, and a Clear $1 Target Unstaked is quickly picking up speed, moving from an early-stage project to a standout with $6 million raised by Stage 12. The current price of $0.008997 remains within reach for everyday users, with its launch price set at $0.1819. This offers nearly a 27x growth chance based on current numbers. What makes Unstaked different is its plan to deliver simple, useful crypto tools. It aims to launch AI-powered agents that assist users in managing returns and navigating DeFi without confusion. This approach appeals to those looking for easier ways to engage with crypto tools. Its biggest draw is the ongoing $1 million Gleam campaign, a five-month giveaway offering 20 prizes of $50,000 each. To qualify, users must take part in social actions, refer new participants, and hold $100 or more in UNSD. Thousands have already joined, making it one of the largest promotions in the 2025 crypto cycle. This isn’t just exposure, it’s fueling growth through community involvement and awareness. Projections suggest Unstaked could reach the $1 mark by 2027, representing a potential 100x increase from its current price. Compared to Aave’s more conservative forecast and Hedera’s unclear outlook, Unstaked shows a faster growth route. Aave focuses on financial protocols, Hedera caters to institutions, but Unstaked is designed for individuals. As attention shifts toward ease of use and community support in 2025, Unstaked may emerge as a frontrunner. Final Words! With $6 million secured and its headline Gleam campaign gaining traction, Unstaked is standing out. Priced at $0.008997 and aiming for a $1 target by 2027, the growth possibility is significant. Against Aave’s gradual path and Hedera’s uncertain prediction, Unstaked holds a more exciting potential. Among the top crypto coins of 2025 , few combine strong interest and low cost like Unstaked does. For those entering early and aiming for large returns, this project could be one of the top names to track.

After a volatile start to Q2, both assets are showing early technical strength , raising the question: can they revisit their 2023 highs in time — or will broader market forces keep them range-bound? With inflation data cooling and traders beginning to rotate back into altcoins, Cardano and Ethereum are benefiting from renewed interest , but another project is quietly entering the conversation — and potentially offering something both lack at this stage: early-stage upside and faster momentum . Ethereum Rebuilds as Scaling and Sentiment Improve Ethereum currently trades above $2,500, a level that has been heavily defended in May. While down from its 2023 peak, the asset is showing resilience. Several bullish factors are aligning, including: A sharp uptick in Layer 2 network usage Renewed community support behind Vitalik Buterin’s new scalability proposals Rising transaction volume across DeFi protocols Analysts see Ethereum reclaiming its 2023 highs near $3,700 if the broader market breaks higher. However, many agree that while the long-term outlook remains strong, short-term gains may be more limited due to its size and current valuation. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW Cardano Eyes $1.20 With Momentum From Airdrop and Technicals Cardano, meanwhile, has been one of the most active large-cap performers this quarter. After successfully defending the $0.75 support level , ADA has surged on the back of: A massive multi-chain airdrop targeting over 37 million wallets Strength in Japanese trading volume and Grayscale fund performance An increasingly active developer ecosystem With targets now set at $1.00 to $1.20 , Cardano is in a better technical position than it was throughout most of 2023. However, like Ethereum, its gains are seen as steady rather than explosive — especially compared to emerging altcoin contenders. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Emerging as a Premier High-Upside Opportunity While Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) continue to evolve on the back of solid network infrastructure and institutional interest, a growing segment of the market is focused on early-stage assets with stronger upside potential. In this context, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing significant attention. Designed to reward early participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE features a fixed token supply of 100 billion and is targeting a future listing price of $0.007 . Currently trading well below that mark, it has drawn interest from analysts projecting 25x to 36x returns, should momentum persist through the end of the year. In today’s fast-paced market cycle — where early positioning and trend momentum are as critical as technical fundamentals — MAGACOIN FINANCE is being evaluated as a credible, high-upside opportunity with real structural appeal. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST Closing Perspective: Speed vs. Stability Ethereum and Cardano remain long-term pillars in the market, with strong upgrade paths, growing ecosystems, and continued relevance among institutional players. However, for investors seeking near-term acceleration and higher returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a rare blend of early-stage access, exponential growth potential, and pricing that remains in the discovery phase — offering advantages that ETH and ADA currently do not.

Analyst Reveals Top Altcoin For 3x Gains,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-crypto-pump-or-dump-this-weekend-analyst-reveals-top-altcoin-for-3x-gains/,"The post Will Crypto Pump or Dump This Weekend? Analyst Reveals Top Altcoin For 3x Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the weekend approaches, traders are wondering whether the crypto market will see a pump, dump, or move sideways. On The Paul Barron Network , analyst Evan Aldo recently shared his thoughts on the market’s short-term direction. According to Aldo, the market could either move sideways or see a small pump over the weekend. If he had to pick, he leans towards a pump but admits sideways movement is also likely. If You’re New to Crypto — What Should You Buy? For those new to crypto, Aldo was asked what he would invest in if he were starting fresh today. His answer was clear: Ethereum (ETH). Why Ethereum? Aldo explained that Ethereum looks strong against Bitcoin and has likely hit a bottom. He gave it a 90% chance of having bottomed against Bitcoin. It also appears to have made a local low against the total altcoin market (known as Total 3, which includes all coins outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum). Aldo believes Ethereum will likely outperform smaller altcoins for the next few months. How High Could Ethereum Go? While some market watchers are predicting long-term price targets between $6,000 and $7,400 for Ethereum, a few even suggest it could climb as high as $10,000 to $11,000 if momentum builds. But for now, analysts like Aldo are focusing on the next major target — $3,200 — as the first key milestone. If Ethereum can break that, it may pave the way for bigger moves by the end of 2025. One particularly bullish signal Aldo pointed out is a rare trigger wave forming on the three-week chart. Similar patterns appeared before major rallies in the past, like in 2020. While a huge 10x move is unlikely this time, a 2x or 3x gain could still be on the cards. What’s Next for the Market? Once the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, Aldo expects a full-fledged altcoin season — where smaller coins could surge and outperform Ethereum. Until then, he considers Ethereum a must-have crypto during this transition phase.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-18 04:08:40

Their consistent price activity has held investor attention through the second quarter. Now, a new name is gaining quiet traction: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Analysts are beginning to highlight it as a compelling early-stage candidate, positioned to challenge the dominance of established players like Solana and XRP. With capital increasingly flowing into earlier-phase opportunities, this emerging project is drawing interest from those seeking strategic upside. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Solana Shows Stability — But Signs Point to Slowing Momentum Solana continues to attract developer interest due to its efficiency and transaction speed, making it a preferred network for NFT initiatives and decentralized applications. Its technical structure remains sound, and the ecosystem appears fundamentally robust. However, recent May price action has shown signs of consolidation, with buyers showing caution near resistance levels. While Solana remains well-positioned long term, some market participants suggest the strongest gains may already be priced in — leading them to explore new opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which currently offers a more favorable entry profile with significant upside potential. XRP Keeps Surging — But Is It Overheating? XRP’s recent rise to $2.65 has been one of the most impressive moves this quarter. Boosted by ETF rumors and continued legal clarity, the token reclaimed its place among the top altcoins. Analysts expect a potential push toward $3.40 , with some projecting $5.50 by year-end if current sentiment holds. That said, XRP’s technical indicators now show potential overbought conditions , and the risk of consolidation looms. While the long-term story remains compelling, traders are beginning to explore other options — including tokens that haven’t yet made their big move. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Now Entering the Spotlight Amid this rotation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping into view. Originally known for its political meme appeal, the project has transformed into a serious contender for short-term and mid-term upside . What’s driving the shift? A presale entry still below $0.001 , with a listing target of $0.007 Bold analyst forecasts of 25x–36x ROI A capped supply of 100 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to early-stage investors Increasing crossover interest from XRP and SOL communities The structure is designed to attract buyers who missed the early runs in Solana and XRP — and who are now searching for a project still in its asymmetrical growth phase . Why Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Outperform Unlike Solana and XRP — both of which are already mid-run — MAGACOIN FINANCE is early , which means it offers something rare: maximum upside with minimal historical resistance . This makes it particularly appealing to: Altcoin traders who rotate capital aggressively Early buyers looking for potential parabolic setups Those who favor tokenomics over hype More importantly, MAGACOIN FINANCE is moving without noise — building momentum steadily, not explosively, which some analysts see as a sign of real staying power . EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Final Thought: Rotation Season Has Begun Solana and XRP have already delivered — and may deliver more. But for traders looking ahead, the opportunity may not lie in what’s already risen… but in what’s just now breaking through . In that light, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining ground for a reason — and it may not be long before it leaves “quiet momentum” behind and becomes the main headline .

With more traders stepping away from overpriced tokens, attention is turning toward earlier-stage assets with clear direction, smart tokenomics, and well-timed entries. One project making a quiet but meaningful climb is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a DeFi protocol currently available under $0.10 and projected by analysts to 20x within its first growth cycle. Still in presale, MUTM has started gaining traction as one of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in this month, thanks to its planned product rollout, structural design, and potential to deliver strong returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t priced low by chance—it’s still in the early stages of its lifecycle, and the team is actively building the foundation for real ecosystem utility. With a confirmed launch price of $0.06 and long-term forecasts ranging from $1.20 to $1.50. Unlike many early-stage cryptocurrencies that delay their product until after listings, Mutuum plans to launch a functional beta of its protocol shortly after the token goes live. This means that real activity—borrowing, lending, yield generation, and protocol engagement—will be in motion early, feeding directly into token demand. Imagine someone participating in the presale at a price of $0.025 per token. When the token reaches $0.50—a full 20x increase—a $1,500 investment would grow to $30,000. That’s a $28,500 return, earned by getting in early, before exchange listings and broader market exposure. It’s this kind of upside that has more investors viewing MUTM as one of the top cryptocurrencies to buy pre-launch. Mutuum Finance is focused on developing the foundation needed for sustained, long-term growth—well beyond just its current price point. The team has confirmed plans for: A Layer 2 deployment to help reduce gas fees and improve scalability once volume increases. A native, overcollateralized stablecoin that will be minted from protocol-secured collateral, helping drive consistent internal demand and liquidity within the ecosystem. A transparent security process, including an in-progress CertiK audit, giving both early investors and larger entities more confidence in the smart contracts powering the platform. These additions aren’t just technical upgrades—they’re core to what makes MUTM stand out from other new crypto coins. The stablecoin, in particular, adds a level of economic predictability and helps cement the token’s role in real financial activity—not just speculative movement. With the presale still ongoing and the token priced below $0.10, MUTM’s entry point remains one of the most attractive on the market. However, with each completed phase, the price increases—bringing new buyers in at higher valuations. Those who enter now are getting access before the token hits centralized or decentralized exchanges—meaning before public visibility scales and before price discovery begins. That early access is crucial. It gives investors time to build a position, understand the protocol, and benefit from the long-term upside that typically follows real product delivery and community growth. To reward early supporters, the Mutuum team is currently running a $100,000 giveaway. Information can be found on the official site, and anyone taking part in the presale by purchasing MUTM tokens becomes eligible. It’s a final incentive that adds to an already strong entry case—and another reason why this month may be the best time to move before wider adoption drives the price higher. MUTM isn’t a speculative meme token or a flash-in-the-pan trend. It’s a utility-first project building for users, with a system designed to grow based on protocol usage—not just attention. At under $0.10, it offers one of the most balanced risk-reward entries available today. With a clear roadmap, product near launch, and growing investor confidence, Mutuum Finance stands out as a top cryptocurrency to buy this month—especially for those seeking a strategic entry with real upside potential.

Everything from the user’s full name, home address and tax identification number will need to be collected and reported for every transaction, including the cryptocurrency used and the amount moved, the UK Revenue and Customs department said in a May 14 statement. Details of companies, trusts and charities transacting on crypto platforms will also need to be reported. Failure to comply or inaccurate reporting may incur penalties of up to 300 British pounds ($398.4) per user. The UK Revenue and Customs department said it would inform companies on how to comply with the incoming measures in due course. However, UK authorities are encouraging crypto firms to start collecting data now to ensure compliance readiness. The new rule is part of the UK’s integration of the Organisation for Economic Development’s Cryptoasset Reporting Framework to improve transparency in crypto tax reporting. The changes reflect the UK government’s aim to establish a more robust regulatory framework that supports industry growth while ensuring consumer protection. Related: Bitwise lists four crypto ETPs on London Stock Exchange UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves also introduced a draft bill in late April to bring crypto exchanges, custodians and broker-dealers within its regulatory reach to combat scams and fraud. “Today’s announcement sends a clear signal: Britain is open for business — but closed to fraud, abuse, and instability,” Reeves said at the time. A study from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority last November found that 12% of UK adults owned crypto in 2024 — a significant increase from the 4% reported in 2021. UK’s approach contrasts with EU’s MiCA The UK’s move to integrate the crypto rules into its existing financial framework contrasts with the European Union’s approach, which introduced the new Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation framework last year. According to the MiCA Crypto Alliance, one key difference is that the UK will allow foreign stablecoin issuers to operate in the UK without needing to register. There will also be no cap on stablecoin volumes, unlike the EU’s approach, which may impose controls on stablecoin issuers to manage systemic risks.

While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to headline the meme coin space, early movers are beginning to redirect their focus toward MAGACOIN FINANCE —a rising altcoin steadily gaining attention as accumulation picks up. Still flying under the mainstream radar, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a preferred early-stage play for value-driven traders seeking growth and reduced volatility ahead of the broader bull cycle. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE DOGE and SHIBA: Rotation in Motion Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently priced around $0.00002 , with a market cap of approximately $12.9 billion . Despite an impressive 2024 performance, confidence has wavered following the January 2025 departure of lead developer Shytoshi Kusama. Though the SHIB ecosystem remains vibrant, investor outlook is now more closely tied to market sentiment and speculation. Dogecoin (DOGE) , trading near $0.20 , remains a prominent meme coin. While Elon Musk’s periodic mentions continue to drive sporadic momentum, DOGE’s growth prospects lean heavily on hype rather than development. As such, seasoned holders are beginning to seek alternatives with stronger structural appeal. MAGACOINFINANCE – Early Accumulation & Rising Sentiment Against this evolving backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is exhibiting early indicators of breakout potential. Unlike meme coins reliant on celebrity backing, it’s being fueled by solid infrastructure, growing community traction, and credible positioning within the market. Investor activity has increased consistently throughout 2025 , supported by lower volatility and greater media visibility. A noticeable trend has emerged—capital rotating from high-risk meme plays into fundamentally sound projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE . Strategic Appeal and Analyst Confidence Though still in its development phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting attention from institutional circles. Several core factors are behind the optimistic forecasts: A fixed 100 billion token supply with robust pre-sale engagement A rapidly expanding community tied to roadmap milestones Structural upgrades boosting long-term scalability With capital inflows shifting from legacy meme coins to stronger emerging contenders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a key player in the upcoming altcoin rally. CLICK HERE – SECURE YOUR SPOT BEFORE 25x DISAPPEARS Conclusion: Sentiment Realigns Toward MAGACOIN FINANCE Investor focus is evolving—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a central beneficiary. While DOGE and SHIB remain relevant, the visible shift toward MAGACOIN FINANCE signals strategic recalibration by long-term participants. With accumulation steadily building and volatility remaining minimal, confidence appears to be strengthening. If the trend continues, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the defining success stories of 2025 .

Bitcoin has stagnated below $105,000, while the market cap of all cryptocurrencies has dropped by over 3% in the last few days to $3 trillion. This article provides a forecast for top altcoins like Onyxcoin (XCN), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Litecoin (LTC). Onyxcoin price analysis XCN price chart | Source: TradingView The Onyxcoin token has moved from obscurity into one of the best-performing players in the crypto industry. Its price jumped from a low of $0.00069 in September last year to $0.020 today, a 2,888% increase. The XCN token rally has caught many investors by surprise. For example, in January, Justin Sun warned that its performance was likely due to price manipulation, allegations that Onyxcoin rejected. Onyxcoin price has moved above the important support level at $0.0075, the lowest swing on April 7. It has also moved above the 50-day moving average, and most recently, is forming a bullish pennant pattern. This pattern comprises of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the Onyxcoin price rebounds and hits the important resistance level at $0.04923, the highest swing in January this year. It needs to cross that level to invalidate the double-top pattern whose neckline is at $0.00754. A move above that level will point to more gains, potentially to $0.1.

It then staged a strong comeback, moving to a high of $1.3115 on May 12 as the crypto market bull run intensified. Recently, however, there are signs that the WIF price has lost momentum and is trading at $0.9500. It is hovering at its lowest level since last Sunday. Dogwifhat price has remained above the 50-day moving average, a sign that bulls remains in control and that the ongoing pullback is merely a technical retracement. WIF price has also formed what looks like a cup-and-handle pattern, a common continuation sign. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the Dogwifhat price will continue rising as bulls target the initial resistance at $1.3115. A move above that level will point to more gains to $1.50. Litecoin price forecast LTC price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the Litecoin price has been in a slow uptrend in the past few weeks, moving from a low of $63 to a high of $106.90. Litecoin price moved above the important resistance level at $96.30, the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern. The head of this pattern is at $63, while the shoulders are at around $83. An inverse H&S pattern is one of the most bullish signs in technical analysis. Litecoin price has formed a break-and-retest pattern by moving back to the neckline at $96.30. Therefore, Litecoin price will likely have a strong bullish breakout, with the next point to watch being at $106.90 followed by $110. This rebound will likely happen as the LTC ETF odds jump.

Analysts are keeping a close eye on Bitcoin and altcoins, with signs pointing to a major rally just around the corner. Right now, Bitcoin is holding strong, and the chances of it falling back to $75,000 look slim. The market seems much stronger than before, and most people aren’t overly excited yet — which is usually a good sign for more growth. Altcoins Could Drop Slightly, Then Boom Altcoins have already seen a small drop, about 14%, but history shows they sometimes dip a little more before flying high. According to an expert, a quick correction of 10–20% might happen soon, but after that, altcoins are expected to surge in a big way. The good news? This dip won’t be as harsh as the ones we’ve seen in the past. There’s a lot of money sitting on the sidelines, waiting to jump in. That extra cash could help push prices up faster once the market turns around. Using historical fractals and timing analysis, the analyst sad that altcoins typically experience one final dip before surging in a bull run’s major leg. Drawing comparisons to market behavior from September 2024, he said that the altcoin index had previously dropped 18% before staging a 43% rally. “This time, the altcoin index has already dipped about 14%, suggesting there’s likely another 10–20% downside for altcoins before we enter a sustained uptrend,” he explained. Get Ready for the Next Big Move If the market follows the same pattern as before, there could be one final big move that takes prices to new all-time highs. It’s the calm before the storm, and those who stay ready could see big opportunities ahead.

Meanwhile, XRP sits near $2.22 , with subdued movement amid waning ETF speculation and light trading activity. While long-term projections stay bullish, short-term action has prompted investors to explore more dynamic opportunities— MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one such alternative. 50% Bonus Active – Early ROI Outlook Signals Strong Entry Point Investor interest isn’t just reactive—it’s a proactive allocation. Projections indicate more than 3,000% return potential from current levels to the $0.007 target listing price. Contributing to that momentum: A 50% token bonus is currently available 100 billion token supply, with nearly half allocated to pre-sale Dynamic token pricing adjusts hourly amid increased demand Unlike many slower-moving projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE operates with a disciplined roadmap and precise milestones, attracting calculated entries. Analysts Forecast 25x to 35x Growth Into Year-End Analyst projections remain optimistic, suggesting 25x–35x ROI as CEX listings near. That’s backed by: A global marketing strategy in full execution Agency partnerships and verified influencer deals Ongoing negotiations for centralized exchange onboarding It’s this structured path that’s drawing long-term ADA and XRP holders to reallocate into what’s being called one of 2025’s most promising early-phase altcoins .

33767162,[object Object],1747546256,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin’s Setup Deepens — This Formation Could Shake Out The Crowd,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-setup-deepens/,"Bitcoin’s recent price action may be more strategic than it appears. As the broader market watches with uncertainty, a classic inverse head and shoulders pattern seems to be forming, with BTC potentially building out the right shoulder. This formation, if completed, could act as a launchpad for the next major leg up. However, before that happens, a dip into the $90,000–$95,000 support zone might occur, offering a necessary shakeout and RSI reset before a more explosive breakout can take hold. Bitcoin’s Inverse Head And Shoulders: Right One In The Making Crypto analyst Chad shared an insightful technical perspective in a recent post on X, proposing that the daily Bitcoin chart may be in the early stages of forming the right shoulder of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a bullish formation that often signals an uptrend after a period of consolidation . As part of this pattern, Chad outlined the possibility of a pullback into the $90,000s, with the $95,000 level identified as a major support zone. A move into that range could help “cool off” the market by easing the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which recently showed signs of overheating. Such a dip could also shake out weak hands, ultimately positioning Bitcoin for a more sustainable rally in the sessions or weeks ahead. Furthermore, Chad made it clear that this deeper retracement is not a certainty as BTC is currently finding support around the $101,000 zone. With a sustained position above this level, the right shoulder could form at higher levels, offering a more shallow and structurally stronger base before any breakout attempt. In either scenario, the analyst sees the potential pullback as healthy, provided that support zones remain intact. The market appears to be in a constructive phase, and whether Bitcoin dips lower or stabilizes here, the broader setup still favors continued upside once the pattern completes. Critical Test For The Pattern In another post on X, the analyst pointed out that the inverse head & shoulders pattern is also visible on the weekly Bitcoin chart, reinforcing the potential for a larger bullish structure. This pattern is beginning to take clearer shape across multiple timeframes, adding weight to the broader bullish case. However, a key factor in validating this setup lies in how Bitcoin interacts with the 1.272 logarithmic Fibonacci extension level, which is currently acting as a major resistance zone on the weekly timeframe. The analyst emphasized the importance of observing whether Bitcoin can close the week above this level, as that would suggest strong momentum and a possible breakout confirmation. If Bitcoin fails to close above the 1.272 Fib level this week, it wouldn’t necessarily negate the bullish pattern . In fact, the analyst suggested it could make the setup even more favorable. A temporary rejection at this resistance would allow Bitcoin to pull back modestly, consolidate, and build strength, all while preserving the inverse head & shoulders structure. This price action would set the stage for BTC to finally break the 1.272 fib level.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Chad|Fibonacci Level|Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern|relative strength index|RSI,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-18 05:30:56

According to the firm’s Q1 Earnings Report , its Bitcoin strategy contributed 88% to its revenue of 877 million Japanese yen ($6 million). Metaplanet’s consistent BTC accumulation has also earned it the spot of the 11th-largest public company by bitcoin holdings globally and number one in Asia. Metaplanet Posts Record Q1 Financials From January 1 to date, Metaplanet has added 5,034 BTC to its balance sheet, increasing its holdings by 3.9x to 6,796 BTC. These purchases were funded by a moving-strike warrant program, which enabled the company to issue equity without setting a fixed discount or strike. As of May 10, the hospitality entity had executed 87% of the program, raising 76.6 billion yen ($524.8 million) and becoming the largest public equity issuer in the country. With the funds raised, Metaplanet has achieved approximately 68% of its near-term 10,000 BTC goal at a cost basis of 13.27 million yen ($90,929) per BTC. Although the company recorded a 7.4 billion yen ($50.7 million) unrealized loss on its BTC position by the end of the quarter due to market prices, bitcoin’s recent rally has fully reversed the losses. The firm reported unrealized BTC gains of 13.5 billion yen ($92.5 million) as of May 12. Evaluating its treasury performance, Metaplanet reported a BTC yield of 170% and a BTC gain of 2,996 BTC. These metrics measure the growth in BTC per diluted share and the BTC per shareholder unit. Embracing a Bitcoin Treasury Metaplanet said last quarter’s report posted the strongest financial result in its 20-year corporate history. The company’s core operating metrics and Bitcoin treasury key performance indicators (KPIs) also broke its records for the first time. The entity recorded an operating profit of 593 million yen (over $4 million) after an 11% uptick quarter-on-quarter. Revenue rose 8%, while total assets surged 81% to 55 billion yen (more than $376.8 million) within the same time frame. Due to the success of its Bitcoin treasury strategy, Metaplanet is urging other companies to consider adopting Bitcoin, offering its capital strategy as a blueprint. “Our results speak for themselves: we don’t set targets to feel safe—we set them to exceed them, quarter after quarter. The global feedback loop between capital markets and Bitcoin is just beginning. Metaplanet intends to be its premier conduit,” the company said.

In a social-media post on Saturday, François-Philippe Champagne stated that about 70 percent of the counter-tariffs imposed in March remain active. That share covers roughly C$42 billion (US$30.1 billion) in goods from the United States, not including automobiles. On all these goods, a 25% retaliatory tariff rate will still apply. Champagne added that only some items for “health and public safety reasons” have been temporarily spared. More of the same falsehoods. To retaliate against U.S. tariffs, Canada launched largest-ever response — including $60B of tariffs on end-use goods. 70% of those tariffs are still in place. We temporarily and publicly paused tariffs on goods for health & public safety reasons. pic.twitter.com/qsLlxnzYlr — François-Philippe Champagne (FPC) 🇨🇦 (@FP_Champagne) May 18, 2025 Champagne’s statement challenges an earlier research report His statement challenges a 13 May report by Oxford Economics analysts Tony Stillo and Michael Davenport. The research firm noted that the recent exemptions were so broad they left Canada with “nearly zero” extra duty on U.S. products. The earlier report gave fresh new reasons to opposition lawmakers, who accused Prime Minister Mark Carney of not being transparent about the true scale of his tariff strategy. During the recent election campaign, Carney cast himself as the candidate best able to manage the trade dispute and promised counter-measures that would “cause maximum pain” south of the border. His Liberal Party secured victory in the 28 April vote. Tensions have been high since U.S. President Donald Trump imposed duties on a range of Canadian and Mexican products, including cars and trucks, despite an existing North American trade deal. Canada hit back first with a 25 percent tariff on selected American consumer goods, steel, and aluminum, and later extended the charge to vehicles built in the United States. These tariffs were first unveiled in March after Washington escalated the tariff dispute. Ottawa published a list covering consumer staples, metals, and machinery despite protests from several small firms. On 15 April, however, Champagne rolled out a series of six-month exemptions. Canadian firms may import items for manufacturing, processing, and food-and-beverage packaging without paying the tariff for the short term. Goods required for public health, health care, public safety, and national security are also exempt during this brief window. Automakers with plants in Canada, such as General Motors and Honda, can import certain vehicles duty-free under a “performance-based remission” scheme. Ottawa hopes the incentive will keep assembly lines in the country even as U.S. tariffs linger. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

In a detailed breakdown, SMQKE explains how Ripple, a fintech company that does not qualify for direct access to these accounts, leverages its partnership with core banking provider Finastra to integrate into the FedNow Service. HOW RIPPLE GAINS INDIRECT ACCESS TO FED MASTER ACCOUNTS VIA FEDNOW AND FINASTRA A Federal Reserve Master Account provides direct access to settle payments in central bank money through Fed systems like Fedwire and FedNow. These accounts are extremely hard to obtain,… pic.twitter.com/6ZbwDc0v3F — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 15, 2025 Understanding the Federal Reserve Master Account Limitation Federal Reserve Master Accounts are central to the U.S. payment infrastructure, enabling institutions to settle transactions in central bank money through systems such as Fedwire and FedNow. These accounts are tightly regulated and reserved exclusively for licensed depository institutions. Fintech firms, including Ripple, are not eligible for direct access due to regulatory requirements, making indirect access the only viable route for participation in central bank settlement. Finastra’s Integration with FedNow and Role as a Bridge According to SMQKE, Ripple circumvents the Master Account restriction through its strategic partnership with Finastra, a leading provider of core banking technology. Finastra is integrated with the FedNow Service and serves as an intermediary between private payment services and the Federal Reserve’s settlement infrastructure. The diagram shared by SMQKE shows Finastra Total Messaging facilitating connections between Ripple, Mastercard, and Thunes, enabling routing of payment messages across compliant channels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Liquidity Management Tool as the Key Enabler A central element of this structure is the FedNow Liquidity Management Tool (LMT). This tool allows for the transfer of funds between Federal Reserve Master Accounts and joint accounts that support private sector payment services. As SMQKE points out, this feature allows Ripple’s payment flows to settle through banks that do have Master Accounts, even though Ripple itself does not. The LMT enables service providers authorized by FedNow participants to initiate liquidity transfers. This mechanism makes it possible for firms like Ripple to participate in real-time settlement via banks that maintain direct access, effectively embedding their services into the central bank system without violating regulatory boundaries. Interoperability through ISO 20022 Standards FedNow’s support for ISO 20022 messaging is another key factor emphasized by SMQKE. This global standard ensures that structured data can move seamlessly across compliant financial platforms. Because Ripple’s infrastructure is ISO 20022 compatible , its XRP-based payment systems are interoperable with FedNow’s real-time messaging requirements. This compatibility supports seamless integration of blockchain-based payments into the traditional banking system. SMQKE’s analysis underscores the significance of Ripple’s positioning within this ecosystem. By aligning with Finastra and utilizing the FedNow LMT, Ripple participates in settlement processes using central bank reserves, despite lacking direct Federal Reserve access This model enhances Ripple’s reach in the U.S. payments space and illustrates how private fintech firms can legally and technically integrate with sovereign financial infrastructures through strategic partnerships and regulatory-compliant frameworks.
