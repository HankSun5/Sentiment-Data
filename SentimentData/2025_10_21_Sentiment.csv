Its upswing is being compared by market observers to that of Ethereum in 2017, which experienced a legendary period in terms of life-altering returns. As new capital comes into new blockchain projects, analysts say that MAGACOIN FINANCE is a reflection of initial Ethereum momentum, where community engagement has grown to spark one of the largest aspects of crypto growth. Should history repeat itself, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the next project to mark a new age of blockchain use and a new investment opportunity. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Hits $17 Million MAGACOIN FINANCE has already passed the mark of $17 million total presale funds, which is among the fastest-growing token sales of 2025. The milestone marks rising investor confidence in an anxious recovery in digital asset markets. Early adopters attribute the verified audits of the project and growing social presence as significant drivers of the explosion. Most retail investors and strategic participants have participated in the presale according to on-chain data because they want to gain early exposure before it is listed on the exchange. Analysts observe that the multi-stage presale of MAGACOIN FINANCE with tiered pricing and allocation is similar to the disciplined fundraise model of early blue-chip protocols such as Ethereum and Avalanche. The roadmap of the project has a comprehensive ecosystem that combines the interoperability of metaverses and decentralized finance (DeFi). This long-term plan will make MAGACOIN FINANCE a pillar in the new generation of financial products run by blockchain. With the rising belief that MAGACOIN FINANCE might dominate the next altseason, the $17 million mark suggests a resurgence in market optimism to buy into the investment. MAGACOIN FINANCE Compares to Ethereum’s Bull Cycle Investment critics are making comparisons between the presale performance of MAGACOIN FINANCE and the 2017 breakout of Ethereum. The initial world of Ethereum was founded on programmable money and decentralized programs that transformed the use of blockchain. More so, MAGACOIN FINANCE embraces a utility-based design and concept that is scalable and integrates into the real world, as well as user involvement. In 2017, the demand for Ethereum tokens was mostly speculative. Nowadays, projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are constructed using institutional-grade compliance, are audited, and have sustainable economics. This progress marks the development of presales since the ICO hype, and more investors are now looking at long-term fundamentals instead of short-term hype. Analysts indicate that MAGACOIN FINANCE is on the verge of an upsurge as it presents a combination of decentralization and transparent economics with verifiable integrity. With a presale that has already exceeded expectations, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the best cryptos to buy now as market liquidity shifts back to the emerging assets. Its initial popularity reflects the basis that helped Ethereum enter the mainstream. Ethereum Price Prediction: Elliott Wave Setup Targets $7,000–$8,000 Ethereum stays in the bullish predictions, as analysts signal an end to an Elliott Wave correction. Technical analysts said that ETH is in its fifth impulsive wave, which is usually the last and strongest rally wave, with end cost targets of between $7,000 and $8,000. Similarly, analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that the top altcoin is making a very important move towards the $4,100 mark. He said that breaking through this level would signal the end of the recent downtrend of Ethereum. ETHUSD Chart | Source: X Institutional involvement confirms this attitude. The amount of ETH held by BitMine Immersion Technologies exceeds 3 million, worth more than $12 billion, demonstrating that Ethereum is trusted by numerous people in the long-term prospects of the cryptocurrency. Tom Lee expects it to reach $10,000-$12,000 in late 2025, whereas Arthur Hayes believes it will go all the way up to $20,000 in a general rally. Provided that Fusaka upgrade by Ethereum is completed as scheduled in December, analysts think that market sentiment, especially throughput and scalability, will be further improved. This could establish an upward trend that will help propel the entire sector of altcoins, including new tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion With Ethereum preparing for a rally, the focus of investors has shifted to credible early-stage initiatives that can replicate that momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE $17 million presale, strong community development, and proven transparency make it one of the best altcoins to buy in this market cycle. When Ethereum’s fifth wave happens as expected, the effect of this wave throughout the altcoin space could make MAGACOIN FINANCE the most successful coin in 2025.

Despite last week’s market volatility and the subsequent devastating losses, long-term holders are relaxed and profitable. The same cannot be said for short-term traders who are eyeing Bitcoin’s rebound above $113K to breathe again. Bitcoin’s Profit Divide Widens According to Alphractal founder Joao Wedson, Bitcoin’s current market mood is split between two distinct tribes. The calm veterans and the nervous newcomers. Long-Term Holders (LTHs) remain unfazed, their unrealized profits still comfortably in the green. They have seen it all before, and for them, the real concern does not even begin unless BTC slips below $37,000. That threshold remains comfortably distant from current levels. Short-Term Holders (STHs), on the other hand, are nursing losses and praying for a revival above the $113,200 mark. Ironically, that same level could become a battleground as a breakout would return many STHs to profit, but it could also trigger waves of profit-taking, thereby muting further upside momentum. Structurally, Bitcoin’s NUPL metric validates the idea of this divide. This is because long-term conviction remains intact, while the LTH/STH SOPR Ratio paints a picture of changing behavior. LTHs appear to be easing off their selling pressure and are letting the market breathe, while STHs are still clawing for short-term gains. This setup is reminiscent of late 2021, when fresh all-time highs were forged. The latest market condition suggests that while the old guard is coasting on earlier wins, the restless crowd still has something to prove. “LTHs have already locked in a good share of their profits – in March 2024, December 2024, and more recently, near the last ATH. Now, they’re relaxed, probably enjoying some time on a yacht with their families. Meanwhile, STHs are anxiously watching the charts, hoping for Bitcoin to break above $113K so they can finally smile again.” Impact of Easing US-China Tensions Now that Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the key $109,000-$110,000 support zone, a level that had previously acted as a crucial pivot in recent market structure, crypto analyst Ted Pillows believes that the next major hurdle lies at $112,000, a breakout above which could open the path for renewed bullish momentum. Pillows believes that the current macro backdrop adds further tailwinds to BTC’s potential upside, especially as US–China trade tensions appear to be easing. The reduction in geopolitical strain could boost investor confidence across risk assets, including crypto, by softening the global risk-off sentiment that had previously dampened speculative appetite.

53429955,609817,1760999410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53429955.jpeg,Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Capitulate: Realized Loss Ratio Hits 6-Month Low,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-term-holders-capitulate-realized-loss/,"Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery after several days marked by selling pressure, volatility, and fear across the crypto market. Following the sharp flash crash on October 10, when BTC briefly plunged to around $103,000, the price has since rebounded and is now testing supply near the $111,000 level. This move has brought a temporary sense of relief to traders, but on-chain data suggests that the market is still under stress. According to CryptoQuant, Short-Term Holders (STHs) — investors who typically hold Bitcoin for less than 155 days — are now selling below their cost basis, a clear sign of capitulation. Historically, such capitulation events have often marked late stages of a correction, as weak hands exit the market while stronger players accumulate. While this could signal that Bitcoin is nearing a local bottom, uncertainty remains high. The coming days will determine whether this rebound has the strength to sustain — or if the market will face renewed downside pressure as global risk sentiment remains fragile. Short-Term Holders Signal Capitulation According to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, the Short-Term Holder (STH) Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has dropped to 0.98, marking its lowest level since April 2025. This reading supports the trend that STHs are now selling at a loss, a sign of capitulation within the most reactive segment of the market. Historically, such declines in STH SOPR have aligned with late-stage corrections or market bottoms, as weaker hands are flushed out and coins transfer to stronger holders. During similar phases in 2023, 2024, and early 2025, this metric has acted as a contrarian signal, often preceding major rebounds. However, Maartunn cautions that while capitulation is unfolding, confirmation of a recovery still depends on whether Bitcoin can hold above its realized price levels and key moving averages. The market now finds itself at a critical juncture. Bitcoin has rebounded from the $103,000 flash crash low to hover around $111,000, but momentum remains fragile. A sustained close above the $111,500–$113,000 zone could reinforce short-term bullish structure, while failure to hold current support may open the door to deeper corrections toward $100,000 or below. If the SOPR stabilizes and begins to rise again, it could confirm a shift from capitulation to re-accumulation — the early stage of a new upward trend. But if selling pressure persists and sentiment weakens further, the market risks entering a prolonged consolidation phase before the next bullish leg begins. For now, Bitcoin remains on edge, caught between recovery hopes and macro-driven uncertainty. Bitcoin Attempts Short-Term Recovery, But Resistance Looms Ahead Bitcoin is showing early signs of a short-term rebound, recovering from the October 10 crash that sent prices below $104,000. On the 4-hour chart, BTC is currently trading near $111,200, attempting to reclaim short-term moving averages (50 and 100 SMA) after several days of bearish momentum. This bounce reflects a shift in intraday sentiment, but the market remains cautious. The next key resistance lies around $113,000–$114,000, where the 200 SMA aligns with previous support turned resistance. A breakout above this zone could open the door to a test of $117,500, a major liquidity area that capped rallies earlier this month. However, if Bitcoin fails to clear this level, it risks falling back toward $107,000–$106,000, where strong demand previously emerged. Momentum indicators are improving but not yet convincing. Volume remains subdued, and funding rates continue to hover in negative territory — suggesting traders still lean bearish. This setup often precedes larger short squeezes, but confirmation is still lacking. Bitcoin’s short-term structure favors cautious optimism. Holding above $110,000 would support the recovery narrative, while rejection at higher levels could quickly trigger another retest of the recent lows. The next few sessions will be decisive for confirming trend direction.

Legendary Analyst Says It’s Time To Pay Attention,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-and-solana-price/,"A rare signal from a legendary market analyst has caught traders’ attention as the Ethereum and Solana price begins to show potential reversal signs. With the broader crypto market still in a slump, a subtle alert from the inventor of one of the most respected technical indicators has analysts wondering whether a major shift is about to unfold in ETH and SOL. Bollinger Inventor Signals Ethereum And Solana Price Explosion John Bollinger, technical analyst and inventor of the world-famous Bollinger Bands indicator, has shocked the broader crypto community after identifying potential “W” bottoms forming on the Ethereum and Solana charts. In his market commentary on X social media, Bollinger noted that while Bitcoin has yet to exhibit similar signals, the ETHUSD and SOLUSD pairs are shaping up in a way that demands attention. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Surge To $6,400 With New Bullish Wave, But There’s A Problem Notably, Bollinger’s cautious but bullish statement immediately drew attention from fellow market analysts. Satoshi Flipper, a well-known crypto expert, revealed that Bollinger typically makes only one such market call each year and has not issued one for Ethereum in three years. He disclosed that the last time the Bollinger Bands inventor made a similar statement was in September 2022, just before the ETH price surged from around $1,290 to nearly $4,000. Due to Bollinger’s selective and historically accurate calls, analysts see it as an early sign of a potential reversal of a downtrend or consolidation into an explosive breakout. If the inventors’ analysis proves accurate once again, both Ethereum and Solana could be sitting at the foundation of one of their strongest bull rallies Analysts Predict Bullish Targets For ETH And SOL Two separate technical analyses also highlight an optimistic outlook for the Ethereum and Solana prices. Crypto analyst Lark Davis highlighted that Solana’s chart structure appears “very constructive,” with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) approaching a momentum breakout and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) gearing up for a bullish cross. Related Reading: Solana Price At Risk Of 50% Crash To $104 After Forming This Larger Bearish Trend Davis noted that Solana’s price action is forming a clear Double Bottom, a classic reversal pattern. Should the neckline break, he projects a potential price target near $250, provided bulls can defend the 200-day EMA. With Solana trading around $192, a rally to that target would mark roughly a 30% gain. Ethereum’s technical outlook is even more dramatic. Analyst Merlijn the Trader stated on X that ETH has been developing the most explosive setup since the 2017 bull cycle, pointing to a textbook Bullish Pennant pattern on the monthly chart. Historically, such formations precede massive continuation once the price breaks above the upper boundary of the pattern. Merlijn’s chart analysis projects an eventual breakout target around $8,500, suggesting that Ethereum could set a new all-time high soon. Considering that the ETH price is sitting above $4,000, a surge to this bullish target would more than double its value, marking an impressive 110% increase.

Recent dips have been received with high-level purchases, especially in the blue-chip assets like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Chainlink. Presale projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are on a strong trend as investors seek high-potential projects. As Ethereum consolidates close to the $4,100 mark, analysts believe that the next bullish run is about to start, which may take pre-established and new altcoins to unprecedented heights, led by MAGACOIN FINANCE. Institutional Interest Builds Amid XRP ETF Anticipation After speculation once again scraped the surface last month about institutional entry into XRP through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the asset has been one of the most followed this month. Additionally, after breaking down to $2.19 earlier in the session, XRP bounced back up to $2.37, a sign of strong buying interest on the part of traders who are anticipating a near-term reversal. Analysts point out that this recovery amid uncertainty in the markets marks the fact of deep liquidity and long-term belief in the cross-border usefulness of XRP. Whale wallets have recorded consistent accumulation since early October, which means that there is a possibility of a potential breakout above the resistance level of $2.50. The market data points to the fact that after XRP breaks out above this level, the next leg of the rally could carry on towards the $2.80 – $3.00 level. Similarly, the continued relationships of Ripple with financial institutions in Africa and Asia are reinforcing the use case of the Ripple project as a global bridge. Provided that the ETF approval is realized in the upcoming quarters, XRP might witness an increase in institutional demand. Such a move would not only establish its regulatory position but also make XRP one of the best-performing assets going into 2026. Smart Money Returns to the Solana Blockchain Solana continues to see inflows, as major investors get exposed to the high-performing blockchain. Institutional participants have been drawn to the network due to its speed of transaction, scalability, and growing DeFi ecosystem. After a short correction to $170, Solana bounced back to trade near the $190-$200 level, indicating buyers are defending key liquidity zones. After asset managers like VanEck and 21Shares applied for Solana ETFs, the market has once again become bullish. The activity of developers is also increasing steadily, as indicated by network data, especially in NFT marketplaces and GameFi projects. When Solana breaks above the $200 level, technical models will suggest an upside target of $260 – $280. SOLUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: X Solana will also play a crucial role in the next market cycle as capital rotation becomes even more intense. It is a reference point to scalable blockchain ecosystems, and analysts observe that investors are diversifying into the presales, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, which replicates early Solana momentum. Accumulation Rises as LINK On-Chain Data Demand Surges Chainlink’s price action has strengthened amid a resurgence in oracle network demand. The project’s integrations across DeFi, gaming, and real-world asset (RWA) protocols continue to expand, positioning LINK as a foundational piece of blockchain infrastructure. Recently, 30 new wallets withdrew over 6.2 million LINK, valued at $116.7 million, from Binance—signaling large-scale accumulation by high-net-worth entities. LINK’s short-term outlook shows bullish momentum as the asset reclaims critical resistance near $17.50. Analysts expect a sustained move above this zone could trigger an advance toward $19.80 and $22.00. With more institutional players using Chainlink’s data feeds for tokenization and settlement systems, its long-term fundamentals remain robust. The growing integration of Chainlink in real-world applications strengthens confidence that the oracle sector could drive the next phase of blockchain adoption. Among traders diversifying portfolios, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a favored new entrant due to its transparent audits and early market traction. Avalanche Strengthening Fundamentals Support Momentum Avalanche (AVAX) is regaining market attention following renewed ecosystem growth and a surge in developer participation. The token has recovered from recent lows near $29, with strong buying pressure driving it back above $34. Analysts observe that Avalanche’s subnets are attracting enterprise-level interest, with partnerships expanding across Web3 gaming and decentralized identity sectors. Technical indicators reveal bullish divergence on the daily chart, suggesting potential continuation toward $40–$45 if momentum persists. AVAX’s scalability and interoperability continue to be defining features, making it a preferred choice for institutions seeking efficient blockchain solutions. As liquidity flows return to the altcoin market, Avalanche’s recovery aligns with the broader sentiment shift. However, analysts emphasize that new presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer high upside potential during early-stage accumulation phases. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Star of the 2025 Presale Market MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the fastest-growing presales of 2025, having raised over $17 million within weeks. The project’s structure includes verified audits from Hashex and Certik, a multi-stage presale with transparent pricing, and a roadmap that integrates DeFi and metaverse interoperability. These fundamentals have drawn both retail and institutional participants looking for credibility and long-term growth. Analysts are comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trajectory to Ethereum’s 2017 cycle, citing the combination of strong fundamentals and an expanding global community. The project’s focus on security, transparency, and real-world integration makes it stand out in a market saturated with speculative offerings. With sustained investor interest and growing social traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is viewed as one of the best altcoins to buy before the next major rally . Conclusion As Ethereum whales keep accumulating and market sentiment is turning positive, investors are gearing up for the next altseason. The existing assets, such as XRP, Solana, Chainlink, and Avalanche, are among the strongest competitors, however, the eruptive emergence of MAGACOIN FINANCE is the beginning of the era of credible presales. If current upward trends continue, MAGACOIN FINANCE could define the next successful 2025 breakout.

DOGE is currently worth over $29 billion in market cap, while BTC sits atop the pyramid with over $2.2 trillion. Both DOGE and BTC are fundamentally set up differently, but they also happen to share some history. The first takeaway that comes to mind on Dogecoin vs Bitcoin is that one is a memecoin while the other is a better store of value. But do you also know that Dogecoin is a derivative of Litecoin, which itself was created from Bitcoin’s codebase? Starting with a quick overview of Bitcoin and Dogecoin, in this article, you’ll see how both coins differ in speed, fees, supply, etc., and why DOGE may never flip BTC. Overview of Bitcoin vs Dogecoin Satoshi Nakamoto started it all when he/they created Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. Then came Litecoin, XRP, Dogecoin, and other cryptos years later. Bitcoin Satoshi introduced Bitcoin’s white paper in 2008, and it officially launched in 2009. The original idea in the white paper was for Bitcoin to serve as a decentralized digital currency for peer-to-peer online payments that works without relying on banks or governments. That narrative has somewhat shifted, with many now considering BTC as a store of value. Some even call it “digital gold” due to its fixed, finite supply. However, Bitcoin’s protocol remains true to its original trustless roots, no matter how investors choose to use it. Dogecoin Dogecoin was created from Litecoin’s codebase, and so they closely share some similarities. DOGE was launched by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in 2013 as a parody. But it turned out to become the first and largest “memecoin,” with a whole community of investors. The coin’s logo was inspired by Kabosu, a Shiba Inu dog from Japan, which died in May 2024. Since DOGE was only made as a joke, the founders stepped away from the project a few years after its inception, selling their coins and leaving its maintenance to the community and other developers. DOGE later went on to gain traction following the 2017-2018 bull run and Elon Musk’s influence. Shared History Dogecoin’s history can be traced back to Bitcoin. Its network structure is not original. For instance, DOGE shares the same decentralized model and Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism as BTC. That’s because of Litecoin. Charlie Lee forked Bitcoin’s codebase in October 2011, creating Litecoin to address perceived flaws. As a result, LTC inherited BTC’s PoW, although it uses a different algorithm than BTC. Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer then forked Litecoin’s codebase two years later to birth Dogecoin, creating a lineage with Litecoin and Bitcoin. Consensus Mechanism and Mining Dogecoin and Bitcoin both use the same Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, which requires mining. But their hashing algorithms are quite different. Bitcoin – Proof-of-Work Bitcoin uses the Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit or SHA-256 algorithm, which is more computationally demanding. SHA-256 requires specialized hardware to solve hash problems, which is why most miners today use advanced machines, especially ASIC miners, to mine new Bitcoin. The upside is that SHA-256 is much difficult to reverse-engineer or manipulate. But it’s very expensive to practice, which raises the entry barrier for small miners. Dogecoin – Proof-of-Work Dogecoin uses the Scrypt algorithm, which it inherited from Litecoin. Scrypt is a more lightweight algorithm that originally accommodated GPU/CPU users, but some Scrypt ASIC exists today. It is memory-hard, meaning it requires a large amount of fast RAM to compute hashes, allowing for faster processing and lower energy use. Dogecoin’s use of Scrypt made it possible for miners to mine DOGE and LTC coins at the same time, i.e., merge-mine. Energy Consumption and Mining Efficiency DOGE and BTC consume a considerable amount of energy, owing to their PoW mechanism. But the total energy used by Dogecoin is much lesser compared to Bitcoin. Reports put it that Dogecoin uses 1.4TWh to 4TWh of energy per year amid the merge-mining with Litecoin. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining consumes anywhere from 114 TWh to 220 TWh per year, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) estimate . Historical annualized electricity consumption of Bitcoin. Source: CBECI Block Time and Transaction Speed DOGE transactions are 10x faster than BTC transactions due to the block time. Bitcoin – 10-Minute Block Time Satoshi programmed the Bitcoin network to maintain an average block time of 10 minutes. The reason was to give new blocks enough time to propagate across the globe and also reduce the chance of orphan blocks, and stop spam/attacks. The 10-minute rule is enforced by the network’s “difficulty adjustment,” which happens every 2 weeks. It can take about 10 to 60 minutes for BTC payments to get confirmed, depending on the network’s traffic. Dogecoin – 1-Minute Block Time Dogecoin has a 1-minute block time, and because of that, DOGE transactions are usually faster. The shorter block time was deliberately chosen for near-instant micropayments, which suits the memecoin’s ethos for casual tipping. However, the quicker block time gives more chances for orphan blocks and front-running/spam transactions. Transaction Throughput and Confirmation Times Dogecoin accommodates more transactions than the Bitcoin network because of its shorter block time. It can process approximately 30 to 40 transactions per second. However, Bitcoin can only handle 3 to 7 transactions per second, which is one scalability issue that led to the launch of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which can handle 1 million transactions per second. Supply and Inflation Model Dogecoin and Bitcoin differ in their supply. DOGE has an inflationary model, while BTC is fixed. Bitcoin – Fixed Supply of 21 Million Coins BTC’s supply is fixed at 21 million, meaning only that much coin will ever be minted. The supply is hardcoded into the network and cannot be changed without forking the network, just like Litecoin, which changed its hard cap to 84 million. At the time of writing, there were a total of 19.93 million BTC in circulation. The issuance of new BTC is controlled by the process of mining and halving. New coins are minted to miners as a block reward, currently 3.125 BTC/block. The reward is halved every four years to control the issuance rate. The last halving event happened in April 2024, which reduced the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. It is projected that all 21 million BTC would have been mined around the year 2140. Dogecoin – No Supply Cap DOGE has an inflationary supply, meaning there will always be a continuous supply of new DOGE coins. There is simply no hard cap. Each year, a fixed number of 5 billion DOGE is issued and added to the circulating supply. At the time of writing, there were over 151 billion DOGE in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap data. Economic Implications: Scarcity vs Continuous Issuance Bitcoin’s fixed supply creates a sense of scarcity, which is why it’s generally considered a store of value and digital gold in today’s market. It’s also safe to say that the economics of scarcity, coupled with demand, are why many are predicting higher prices for Bitcoin in the years to come. But this is bad in a way, because it encourages people to hodl BTC rather than use it as a digital form of payment, just as Satoshi had intended. Dogecoin’s inflationary supply, on the other hand, dampens its scarcity, which dilutes the expectation of value growth or store of value from hodling. The model encourages quick spending, and so, the price of DOGE mostly rides on its utility, network adoption, and community engagement. Transaction Fees and Accessibility As you would have guessed, Dogecoin also beats Bitcoin in terms of transaction fees. It’s much cheaper to use DOGE than BTC. Bitcoin Fees – Network Congestion and Cost Volatility Data shows Bitcoin currently has an average transaction fee of 0.0000062 BTC ($0.679). Average Bitcoin transaction fee chart The fees are usually not fixed. But they can be influenced by the transaction size, or most likely, network congestion. The network can become unusable for small transactions when busy. In April 2024, the Bitcoin transaction fee spiked to as high as $128 due to congestion of the network. In 2023, the largest exchange, Binance, had to pause BTC withdrawals due to network congestion and exorbitant fees. Dogecoin Fees – Lower Fees for Microtransactions The average Dogecoin transaction fee is 0.402 DOGE ($0.079), according to BitInfoCharts. That’s almost 10x cheaper than Bitcoin. Due to the lower fees, Dogecoin is preferred for smaller payments and microtransactions. In a practical scenario, many would most likely spend DOGE as payment for $5 cup of coffee or tipping, rather than spending BTC, because it is cheaper. Ideal Use Cases The use cases for both Bitcoin and Dogecoin write themselves. People mostly use DOGE for tipping content creators, buying small digital goods, and everyday, small-scale transactions, simply because the transactions incur fewer fees, irrespective of the amount. Also, you don’t have to wait too long for an instant digital payment. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is scarce. Most people treat it as an investment, a store of value, and a hedge against inflation. It appeals to both institutional and retail investors around the world. Security and Network Strength Since Bitcoin and Dogecoin both use the PoW consensus mechanism, the strength of their networks is tied to their hash rates. Bitcoin’s Massive Hash Rate and Global Miner Network Bitcoin has a massive number of hash rates distributed around the world. Currently, the network sees an average hashrate of 1.13 Zhash per day, slightly below the 1.2667Zhash all-time high. Bitcoin hashrate historical chart The hash rate is just a measure of the combined computational power miners are contributing to the network. So, more hash rate means more strength and resilience in Bitcoin against attacks, particularly the 51% attack, where a single entity controls over half the network’s hashing power to manipulate the ledger. Another important thing to note is that the hashrate is not concentrated in one region. It’s spread around the world, which keeps the network decentralized. Dogecoin’s Reliance on Litecoin Merge Mining for Security Dogecoin currently has a hash rate of 3.41 PH/s, according to CoinWarz. Dogecoin hashrate historical chart On a normal ground, Dogecoin’s inflationary supply is not a great financial incentive for independent miners to continue securing the network in the long run. But it makes up for this with Litecoin. Since Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, it somewhat piggybacks off the Litecoin network’s substantial hash rate. That tie ensures that as long as Litecoin is secured, Dogecoin receives strong security too, against a 51% attack, than it would on its own. Long-Term Security Considerations For Bitcoin, the block reward is the key thing to watch. As the network is programmed to halve rewards every four years, it would get to a point where miners earn fewer BTC, which could affect profitability. Many could be forced to turn off their machine when the cost of mining exceeds the reward, which translates to lower hash rates and security for Bitcoin. For Dogecoin, the Litecoin network hash rate is the health factor to watch. Provided that the hash rate continues to increase, Dogecoin remains secure. Community and Use Cases The Bitcoin and Dogecoin communities contrast sharply, and they invest for different reasons. Bitcoin’s Role as Digital Gold As mentioned before, Bitcoin is perceived as the digital gold. So, the community around Bitcoin is all about investing for the long term as a store of value or hedge against inflation and devaluing local currencies. They believe that the engineered scarcity of Bitcoin will eventually lead to higher price appreciation. On-chain data shows that roughly 61% of the Bitcoin supply has not been moved for over a year. Up to 17% have not moved over the last 10 years. Dogecoin’s Community-Driven Adoption The Dogecoin community is all about memecoin. DOGE has inspired several other meme tokens that now form a $56 billion market. Other than its uses for micropayment, tipping, and regular day-to-day payment, DOGE continues to thrive on virality and largely the community’s effort. The power of the so-called “Doge Army,” social media hype, and cultural relevance have been the big drivers of DOGE price over the years. Not just DOGE. Most memecoins are driven by community efforts. Institutional Acceptance and Market Positioning Due to the economic models, Bitcoin appeals more to large corporations and institutional investors than Dogecoin, which is evident in the number of firms that hold BTC in their treasury today. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is the largest publicly traded Bitcoin firm in the world, with a total of 640,250 BTC, worth $71 billion. The company began investing in Bitcoin in 2020 primarily as a hedge against inflation. More than 145 publicly traded companies now hold BTC for similar reasons. In the same vein, Bitcoin also sees increased demand with ETFs. Institutional interest in Dogecoin is limited and mostly speculative. However, in September 2025, DOGE gained its first U.S. spot ETF , which opens the door for institutional investors to trade DOGE. Price Volatility and Market Perception Bitcoin is increasingly being perceived as a maturing asset, with the swings now influenced by macro factors. But as a memecoin, Dogecoin largely trades as a speculative bet. Bitcoin as a Macro Asset Some years back, Bitcoin was treated as an extremely volatile and speculative asset, which saw many regulators issue warnings against it. In recent times, however, Bitcoin’s price has been reflecting a maturing asset status, with institutional investors on board. The price is now largely influenced by global economics, behaving like a risk-on hedge, like tech stocks or gold during uncertainty. Dogecoin as a Speculative or Social Token The market perception of Dogecoin is mostly as a speculative social token or memecoin rather than a macro asset. In that category, it would be the go-to for many investors considering its dominance. However, Dogecoin’s price remains highly volatile. It’s often driven by market sentiment, social media trends, and community enthusiasm, rather than technical developments or macroeconomic factors. Influence of Public Figures The former CEO of Strategy, Michael Saylor, has been a big influencer, so to speak, for Bitcoin. Ever since he led the company into investing in Bitcoin, Saylor has been vocal about Bitcoin as a superior asset against inflation. He participated in several crypto conferences and continues to tweet about the largest crypto almost every day. For Dogecoin, it was Elon Musk who played a similar role. The price of DOGE soared on several occasions after the world’s richest man tweeted or praised the memecoin. DOGE also went on a massive rally after Musk acquired Twitter, in the hope that the social media app would incorporate DOGE as a tipping and payment coin. Technical Comparison Summary Table The table below summarizes the fundamental differences between Dogecoin and Bitcoin. Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Dogecoin (DOGE) Launch Year 2009 2013 Consensus Proof-of-Work (SHA-256) Proof-of-Work (Scrypt) Block Time 10 minutes 1 minute Supply Limit 21 million Infinite (5B/year inflation) Fees Higher Lower Mining Independent Merge-mined with Litecoin Use Case Store of value Peer-to-peer payments The Future of Bitcoin and Dogecoin As the crypto market continues to gain broader acceptance from institutions, with many firms declaring their digital asset treasuries, Bitcoin will become a more pronounced player in global finance, and we could see Dogecoin explore more utility-driven developments. Bitcoin’s Role in Institutional Finance The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs drew massive institutional flow to Bitcoin. The U.S. President is now pushing to allow 401(k)s to invest in Bitcoin. Major banks like JPMorgan are looking to allow clients to trade Bitcoin by next year. All these indicate that institutions are opening up to Bitcoin, and in the years ahead, the largest crypto will become more and more involved in Wall Street and global markets. Dogecoin’s Evolution Through Community and Developers Dogecoin could begin to see institutional inflows from the many ETFs in the pipeline and companies announcing their digital asset treasuries. We could also see the Dogecoin community and developers explore more utility projects, just like they did with the launch of Dogechain, a layer 2 network aimed at bringing smart contracts into the Dogecoin ecosystem. Potential Integration into Payments (e.g., X/Twitter) There is also a big possibility that Elon Musk will eventually add support for DOGE as a payment option on X (formerly Twitter). There have been rumors about this. Musk occasionally replied to comments referencing Dogecoin in a payment context on X, but there have not been any official statements to confirm that it will happen.",Learn Crypto: Beginner Guides,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|DOGE|LTC|MINING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-20 23:15:29

However, after several considerations, several of them have lowered their earlier predictions following new trade deals, which are lessening their exposure to these tariffs. Trump ignited a trade war which resulted in a significant increase in US tariffs to their highest rates ever recorded since the 1930s. Additionally, he has frequently threatened to impose even more taxes on US trading partners. Still, this uncertainty that previously held back many businesses is beginning to fade. This has enabled executives to better estimate expenses and establish effective business strategies such as some price hikes. Trump’s trade deals sparks hope for the stabilization of global firms Earlier, an analysis from a reliable source that analyzed various statements from companies, regulatory filings, and earnings calls from July 16 to September 30 revealed that firms had anticipated a total financial impact ranging from $21 billion to $22.9 billion for 2025. For 2026, they had estimated a total financial effect of around $15 billion. When global companies reported the overall amount exceeding $35 billion, reports highlighted that this figure was slightly above the $34 billion recorded in May after Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs in April which interfered with the international supply chain. However, it is worth noting that this increment primarily reflects Toyota’s estimate of $9.5 billion. Many other companies, on the other hand, have drastically reduced their previous pessimistic forecasts after Trump struck lower-rate trade deals with Japan and the EU. These prediction figures consist of both annual and partial-year estimates from a group of about 60 companies that had shared some of their data. Examples of companies that reduced their predictions include: French spirit producers Remy Cointreau and Pernod Ricard. Both arrived at the decision to lower their expectations for the effects of US tariffs after the EU agreement. Meanwhile, Sony reduced its forecast in August. Apart from striking trade deals with US trading partners, Trump also made some exceptions like only around a third of Brazil’s exports would encounter a 50% tariff. With this positive outlook, the Chief Executive Officer of Stellantis, Antonio Filosa acknowledged that tariffs are becoming clearer. He further highlighted that they believe these tariffs will just be another factor they need to run their business, asserting that they will be prepared for that during a mid-October interview. Afterwards, Filosa shared new details regarding a $13 billion investment over four years in US manufacturing. Interestingly, Stellantis had cautioned about a loss of 1.5 billion euros in July this year. Andrew Wilson raises concerns surrounding Trump’s tariff policies Andrew Wilson, Deputy Secretary General of the International Chamber of Commerce expressed his belief that there is a feeling that they have attained some sort of stable point with the existence of certain trade deals. However, Wilson raised concerns that there will still be a lot more complexity and substantial uncertainties. He gave an example of Trump’s recent shift in stance when he suggested the imposition of an additional 100% tariff on China, but later stated that these tariffs would not be sustainable and blamed Beijing for recent trade conflicts between the two nations. In the meantime, S&P 500 firms are predicted to encounter an earnings growth rate of about 9.3% from July through September. This percentage is lower than the 13.8% growth in the second quarter, according to LSEG data. This slowdown is primarily due to the US tech sector, which is being driven by major investments in AI. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index is expected to rise by a mere 0.5%, down from 4% last quarter. The biggest challenges are hitting companies that rely on trade with countries that lack trade agreements.

The estimate comes as discussions around Ripple’s rumored plan to raise $1 billion for an XRP treasury gain traction, reigniting debate about the potential for a supply squeeze in the market. Ripple’s Proposed $1B Buyback Sparks Renewed Interest According to a recent Bloomberg report, Ripple is said to be working on securing $1 billion in funding to establish an XRP-focused treasury initiative. The company reportedly intends to use a portion of the XRP held in its escrow to support this effort. The news has generated considerable attention within the XRP community, particularly among investors who believe a large-scale buyback could tighten supply and influence prices. The conversation was further amplified when a well-known community commentator, Baba Cugs, revisited his earlier theory suggesting that a major price breakout could only occur once retail investors have been largely bought out. Several other XRP advocates have echoed this idea, arguing that institutional participation has been steadily increasing while retail involvement continues to decline. 500M to 1.9B Retail XRP Remaining Gonna need more than Ripple's 1B At $5 XRP, $1B buys 200M XRP At $7.5….. 133.33M XRP $10…….100M $15…….66.6M $20….. 50M XRP Sample above $5B buys 550M XRP. If it's closer to 1.9B Retail will need $17.7B. And that's if all sell. https://t.co/V2pn279oSe — XRP_Liquidity (Larsen/Britto/Escrow/ODL/RLUSD) (@XRPwallets) October 19, 2025 Edoardo Farina, the founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has also remarked that small investors are being phased out of the market as larger financial entities acquire greater control over circulating supply. This sentiment reflects a growing belief that institutional demand could eventually dominate the XRP landscape. Estimating the Retail Supply and Buyout Cost Another community analyst, known by the pseudonym XRP Liquidity, regularly tracks wallet data to monitor holdings across different investor classes. His findings suggest that retail investors currently control between 500 million and 1.9 billion XRP. Based on this range, he argues that Ripple’s proposed $1 billion buyback would not be sufficient to absorb all remaining retail supply. At the current trading price of approximately $2.45, purchasing 500 million XRP would require around $1.2 billion, while acquiring 1.9 billion XRP would cost nearly $4.6 billion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, the analyst emphasized that this calculation assumes all tokens would be sold at the current market price, an unlikely scenario given that many holders would seek to sell only at higher valuations. Projected Selling Levels Among Retail Investors To account for differing selling preferences, the analyst modeled a tiered scenario. If some investors begin taking profits around the $5 mark, a $1 billion investment would acquire roughly 200 million XRP. At $7.50, the same capital would buy about 133 million XRP, and at $10, it would purchase 100 million. As prices climb, the available quantity continues to decrease. A $1 billion buy order at $15 would secure only about 66 million XRP, and at $20, it would capture around 50 million. Cumulatively, buying 550 million XRP across these tiers would require about $5 billion. Should retail investors collectively hold closer to 1.9 billion XRP, clearing them out completely would take an estimated $17.7 billion, assuming all tokens were sold at these higher levels. Community commentators such as Baba Cugsy have suggested that once institutional buyers absorb most of the remaining retail supply, XRP could experience an accelerated price movement due to reduced availability. XRP Liquidity has also speculated that institutions might intentionally drive the price toward $20 to encourage remaining retail investors to exit. These projections illustrate how supply concentration and institutional accumulation are shaping discussions within the XRP community.

This drop put the market in “extreme fear” for the first time since April, leading many observers to speculate on how long the bull cycle will last, with one warning that more losses are coming. A Critical Line in the Sand In his “Big Sunday Report,” crypto trader Dr. Profit told his over 439,000 followers on X that they should have used the 115–125k zone to build short positions, warning that the market is now “extremely bearish.” He wrote that he had been “flagging” that area “to add shorts and sell” since the end of August, noting that BTC reached “126k, 1k more than my max top scenario of 125k” before dropping on October 10, when it went as low as $101,000 on some trading platforms. The analyst singled out market psychology as central, writing plainly that: “Markets are driven by greed, currently I have rarely seen so much greed in the market as now, and I am speaking about both the bear and bullish side.” His setup hinges on a specific technical threshold: a decisive break below $101,700. “By breaking below $101,700 Bitcoin will break below its magic bull market line which would finally confirm a bear market and silence those bulls once for all!” wrote Dr. Profit. The post also talks about liquidity mechanics as a cause, saying that recent late-entering shorts, liquidations near $116,500, and the packed positioning of short-term holders have made the price structure weak. Furthermore, the analyst used the $112,500 short-term holder realized price to show that a lot of recent buyers had lost money and could put more pressure on the market if BTC drops another 5–10%. Sentiment, Macro Events and Market Structure This weekend’s price action echoed that caution. At the time of writing, CoinGecko data showed that the main cryptocurrency was trading around $110,700, which is up 3.5% in the last 24 hours but down the same amount over the past seven days. The 14-day drop is close to 10.6%, and the 30-day dip is smaller, at 4.1%. Doctor Profit’s warnings arrive as broader sentiment has turned sour. On October 17, reports indicated that the Fear & Greed Index was at its lowest point since April and that about $900 billion in market value had been lost in the past few days. Some analysts say that the medium-term uptrend is still going strong if key supports hold, while others say that liquidity operations linked to ETFs and leveraged positions make the market open to big directional moves.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.2779 Market Cap $449.07M Trading Volume $6.017M Circulating Supply 1.615B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.2823 24-hour Low $0.2725 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.64% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.3663 14-Day RSI 35.83 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 29 (Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $0.3878 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown FLOW’s 1-day chart shows tightening Bollinger Band. The 4-hour chart confirms sideways consolidation. FLOW’s support is present at $0.27. Flow coin 1-day price analysis On the 1-day chart for Oct 20, 2025, FLOW is sitting at $0.278, barely moving but showing a clear slowdown in selling. The Bollinger Bands are tightening between $0.226 (lower band) and $0.321 (upper band), with price hovering between the mid-band and the lower band. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains in negative territory, but the bars are shrinking, showing that bearish momentum is losing force. Volume remains light, around 586K, suggesting most participants are waiting for confirmation before acting. As long as the price holds above $0.27, FLOW looks to be in accumulation. A daily close above $0.285 would likely trigger a retest of $0.30, followed by $0.32 if buying interest strengthens. If $0.27 gives way, the $0.24 price level becomes the next likely support. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour chart paints a calmer, more neutral picture. FLOW trades around $0.277, with the Alligator lines (jaw $0.277, teeth $0.277, lips $0.276) now overlapping, meaning the market is directionless in the short term. This crossover phase often precedes a stronger move once new volume enters. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI at 47.8 is perfectly neutral, confirming the lack of momentum. The recent uptick stalled right below $0.28, showing mild resistance there. If FLOW can break through $0.28, it may push for a short-term climb toward $0.285–$0.29. If it slips under $0.275, traders can expect a quick drop back to $0.27 support. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3227 SELL SMA 5 $0.3019 SELL SMA 10 $0.2953 SELL SMA 21 $0.3313 SELL SMA 50 $0.3663 SELL SMA 100 $0.3796 SELL SMA 200 $0.3878 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3333 SELL EMA 5 $0.3528 SELL EMA 10 $0.3724 SELL EMA 21 $0.3819 SELL EMA 50 $0.3829 SELL EMA 100 $0.3870 SELL EMA 200 $0.4253 SELL What to expect from Flow? FLOW is clearly basing around $0.27 after a sharp decline, with sellers losing control and volatility drying up. Both timeframes suggest consolidation before the next impulse. If buyers reclaim $0.285, expect a short-term lift toward $0.30–$0.32; otherwise, the coin will likely keep ranging quietly between $0.27–$0.28 until momentum returns. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

The initiative rewards the early community members while generating new focus on the growing ecosystem of the project. The bonus comes as demand for new presale tokens has surged throughout the crypto market. By providing more rewards to first-phase participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE hopes to create momentum and investor confidence as it prepares its next phase of funding. MAGACOIN FINANCE Introduces Patriot50X Bonus for Early Supporters The Patriot50X bonus gives early buyers an instant 50% token boost for every purchase made before the end of each round. This limited-time reward is part of the project’s strategy to attract strong holders who believe in its long-term roadmap. Each presale phase runs with a tiered pricing structure, which means that prices increase as rounds close. This approach encourages early participation and offers transparency. The Patriot50X event maximizes this system by providing additional value at the earliest entry point, allowing investors to lock up more tokens before the next price increase. Project developers confirmed that the bonus will only be active for the initial stages to avoid oversupply and retain the scarcity of tokens. This design guarantees that value increases naturally as the demand increases. Growing Investor Interest in the Presale Investor activities around MAGACOIN FINANCE are still accelerating. The project’s presale rounds have been closing faster than expected as more participants have joined through its verified platform. Early traction is fueled by clear communication, secure smart contracts, and a strong commitment to transparency. Market watchers say that the structured rollout and open reporting of MAGACOIN FINANCE have built trust in a time when many presales struggle with credibility. Each stage has fixed token prices, allocation limits, and timeframes, which help buyers track their progress and verify results. This openness has brought in a mix of retail traders and long-term holders. Many view the project’s transparent model as a sign of maturity that is rarely seen with early-stage crypto launches. Why the 50% Bonus Matters for Long-Term Holders The Patriot50X bonus gives early investors a head start when it comes to potential returns. Those who purchase before future rounds pay a lower effective price per token, magnified by the 50% reward. Analysts say such incentives help to reduce short-term speculation and to encourage investors to hold through multiple phases. For long-term holders, initial accumulation can have a compounding effect once the token is listed on exchanges. The rising price model means that the tokens obtained under the Patriot50X bonus can already appreciate before trading starts. Moreover, the design is also advantageous to community development. To early adopters, a reward is visible, which builds loyalty, as the project seeks a listing and inclusion in the broader ecosystem. Community Response and Market Outlook The response of the community to the announcement has been overwhelmingly positive. There is a notable upsurge in social channels where new investors learn about the presale. Several users call the 50-percent bonus fair in contrast to other campaigns that water down the worth or have vague wording. According to analysts, the bonus shows that the MAGACOIN FINANCE team trusts its roadmap. The project indicates its long-term orientation with its community by giving more tokens to dedicated supporters, which is an essential quality of sustainability. Since the market is regaining its confidence after the recent volatility, presales with transparent mechanisms are taking a revitalized focus. MAGACOIN FINANCE seems to be in a good position in this trend, with verifiable smart-contract data and appealing rewards to investors. Final Outlook The Patriot50X bonus is another milestone in the history of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which supports its growth-first approach and model that is based on investors. The project will help build strength in community participation and market presence by giving early buyers additional tokens. Having transparent pricing, rapid rounding, and increasing investor reach, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains one of the most watched crypto projects to follow in 2025. To early participants, the 50% Patriot50X offer is not only a bonus, but also a good opportunity to settle on a stronger position before the next stage commences.

Federal and state traffic laws require all vehicles to stop and remain stationary when they see a school bus with red lights flashing, stop arm extended, and crossing control arm deployed while unloading students. However, video footage shows one of Waymo’s autonomous vehicles maneuvering around one such school bus. NHTSA scrutinizes Waymo’s robotaxis The probe is the latest scrutiny of self-driving systems by regulators reviewing how driverless technologies affect other road users. This episode comes after a video of an incident in Georgia involving a Waymo car and a stationary school bus that had its red lights flashing and stop arm deployed. According to a report , the Waymo vehicle initially paused, but then it maneuvered around the bus, passing the extended stop arm even though students were still disembarking. Waymo’s automated driving system is currently logging 2 million miles per week, according to the agency, and it has confirmed that the “likelihood of other prior similar incidents is high.” While the statement is concerning, some reassurance has come from the company as it claimed to be working hard to make improvements that will roll out with the next update. How Waymo has responded to the probe Given the novelty of what Waymo is trying to accomplish in the self-driving car sector, probes and occasions that encourage them are to be expected. However, the company is not relenting and a Waymo spokesperson has claimed it has “already developed and implemented improvements related to stopping for school buses and will land additional software updates in our next software release.” The company has also reiterated a commitment to creating products that prioritize child safety, explaining that it had “approached the school bus from an angle where the flashing lights and stop sign were not visible and drove slowly around the front of the bus before driving past it, keeping a safe distance from children.” It is crucial to note that the vehicle involved had been equipped with Waymo’s fifth-generation Automated Driving System and was operating without a human safety driver at the time of the incident. There were also no injuries reported in the incident, but it has highlighted the issues AV perception systems face in edge cases like those involving obscured signals. The company currently operates over 1,500 robotaxis in cities like Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin, and has plans to expand to Nashville in 2026 via a partnership with Lyft. Waymo has already logged over 100 million rider-only miles in 2025, but rare errors like this can amplify safety concerns for public trust and policy.

In a recent post, he remarked that maintaining a position in XRP through repeated market downturns takes either extraordinary conviction or, as he joked, “a touch of mental illness.” His comments shed light on how emotional endurance plays a major role in long-term crypto investing. The Psychological Test of Long-Term Holding According to Van Code, many investors like to believe they would remain patient through market turbulence to achieve massive gains. However, he noted that this belief rarely holds when faced with real volatility. Most traders tend to sell once profits appear substantial enough, even if larger gains may lie ahead. Every talks about ""oh if I bought BTC for $1 id because billionaire today"". What you fail to realize is 99% of people would sell even at $100. Or what about when it dumped from $10k down to $1k then back up again. You really have to almost be mentally unstable to hold from $1… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 19, 2025 He illustrated his point with Bitcoin’s historical trajectory. When Bitcoin was worth less than $1 in its early days, few could have imagined its rise above $110,000. Yet, Van Code argued that most people who claim they would have held it until now would likely have exited early, perhaps around $100, once they felt they had made enough profit. Evidence supports his claim. Several early Bitcoin holders who once owned large sums have sold after years of inactivity, cashing out millions or billions of dollars. Meanwhile, others famously exited too soon, such as the early user who spent 10,000 BTC on two pizzas. Van Code emphasized that maintaining a long-term position through dramatic market reversals, such as Bitcoin’s past crashes of over 80%, requires more than confidence. It demands psychological resilience that few investors possess. Could Investors Realistically Hold XRP to $1,000 or Beyond? Van Code applied the same reasoning to XRP holders who publicly claim they will not sell until the token reaches $1,000 or even $10,000 . He believes that, in reality, most would take profits much earlier if life-changing sums were on the line. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Predictions of XRP reaching $1,000 are not new. Some analysts, including projections from Changelly, suggest the token could potentially achieve that price by 2040 under ideal conditions. However, with XRP currently below $3, maintaining a position for over a decade would be mentally demanding, especially given crypto’s unpredictable price patterns. Van Code pointed to XRP’s 2018 collapse, when it lost over 95% of its value after reaching $3, as a reminder of how quickly optimism can turn into panic. The Challenge of Emotional Discipline Another long-term XRP investor, known as TheXFactor33, agreed with Van Code’s assessment. He stated that staying invested through multiple downturns requires “an unhealthy amount of stubbornness.” Having held XRP for more than eight years, he admitted that conviction is often tested during extended bear markets but insisted that emotional control is what separates long-term holders from short-term traders. In a follow-up discussion, Van Code revealed that he had already mentally detached from his XRP holdings. “The money no longer exists on my balance sheet,” he said, adding that he has no plans to sell even if XRP were to hit $10,000. Instead, his focus is on preserving the asset for long-term financial goals, such as securing property for his children. This perspective shows that achieving exceptional returns is not solely about market timing but also about emotional discipline. Van Code’s comments highlight how enduring extreme volatility over many years is a rare trait that only a small percentage of investors can sustain.

Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bull Run Over? Analyst Sees Echoes Of 2021 Price reclaimed the $190–$193 area after a sharp bounce from trendline support, with traders now eyeing a clean break over $200 to flip momentum. On the charts, Solana remains inside a descending channel of lower highs and lows, but a sustained move above $202–$211 (a confluence of the 20/50-day EMAs and key Fibonacci levels) would mark a structure shift and open upside targets at $221–$222, then $235 and $250. SOL's price records small gains on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Volume Pops, Open Interest Climbs, Institutions Accumulate Bullish undercurrents are building beneath the price. On-chain and market data show trading volumes surging to multi-month highs, while futures open interest has pushed above $8billion, signaling stronger participation and the potential for a larger directional move when volatility expands. Spot flows turned positive, with close to $31.7million in net inflows recently pointing to accumulation at mid-range levels. Institutional and corporate interest remains a durable pillar for Solana. A recent Grayscale analysis highlights the network’s high throughput, low fees, and expanding developer base. Meanwhile, ARK Invest reported $223 million in Q3 network revenue, ranking among the highest in the blockchain industry. Additionally, corporate treasuries across digital-asset firms collectively hold over 20 million SOL, underscoring long-term institutional commitment. Staking yields of around 7% annually continue to attract holders, while scaling initiatives like Firedancer aim to improve throughput and network resilience. Catalyst Watch: $200 Reclaim, Solana ETF Headlines, and Network Growth Near term, the market wants confirmation. A daily close above $202–$211 would validate a trend reversal and strengthen the case for a measured grind toward $235–$250. Analysts also flag ETF progress and regulatory headlines as potential catalysts, alongside macro risk appetite driven by rates and liquidity. Fundamentally, Solana’s momentum is buoyed by DeFi/NFT activity, rising DEX volumes, and enterprise experiments in payments and DePIN.

53432481,610077,1761004850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53432481.jpeg,"Bitcoin Bounces Back Over $110K After Massive ETF Outflows, Is the Next Bull Run Starting?",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bounces-back-over-110k-massive-etf-outflows/,"Bitcoin (BTC) jumped back above $110,000 on Monday, erasing part of last week’s slide even as U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs posted their second-largest weekly net outflows on record ($1.2 billion). The swift rebound, from lows near $103,700, has traders asking whether the market just completed a “controlled deleveraging” and is now basing for the next advance. Ether reclaimed $4,000 alongside broader crypto green shoots, aided by cooling trade-war headlines and growing odds of additional Fed rate cuts. Short term, BTC is attempting to hold the $107,000–$110,000 support band. A clean break and hold above $112,000–$115,500 would strengthen the bullish case and set sights on $120,000–$123,000. Institutions Still Bullish; Rare BTC–Gold Signals Flash “Bottom” Despite the outflows, institutional conviction looks resilient. A new Coinbase survey found 67% of institutions are bullish on Bitcoin over the next three to six months, citing improving liquidity, robust ETF infrastructure, and stablecoin usage near record highs. Macro tailwinds are supportive, with markets now pricing in further Fed easing, a trend that has historically redirected capital from cash and money-market funds toward risk assets. On-chain and cross-asset signals add weight. CryptoQuant’s Joao Wedson flagged rare bottom readings in the BTC-to-gold ratio oscillator, levels that previously preceded strong recoveries. Separately, JP Morgan’s framework values BTC materially higher versus gold, mapping to a potential $165,000 by 2025 if the relationship normalizes. Short-term holder MVRV Bollinger signals are also in “oversold” territory, seen earlier at $49,000 and $74,000 before subsequent rallies, supporting the notion that recent weakness was an accumulation phase, not a top. Bitcoin (BTC) Levels, Risks, and the Road to a New Leg Higher Technically, Bitcoin bulls want to defend $107,000–$110,000 and flip $112,000–$115,500 into support. Above there, momentum traders eye $120,000–$123,000 and the prior ATH zone near $126K. Funding and open interest have cooled, reducing the risk of another forced-liquidation cascade. Regardless, skeptics point to rising-wedge overhangs and headline risk (trade tensions, data shocks), while gold’s record run fuels the “digital-gold vs. gold” debate. The bounce above $110,000, despite heavy ETF redemptions, suggests strong dip-buying and improving liquidity. If macro conditions cooperate and BTC can reclaim the mid-$110,000s with volume, the market may be transitioning from “reset” to re-accumulation, laying groundwork for a fresh bull leg into late 2025.

The energy in Q4 2025 feels electric as altcoins keep outperforming predictions, and MoonBull ($MOBU) now joins the spotlight as the best crypto to buy this week . MoonBull ($MOBU) has entered the market with unmatched buzz. With Ripple and Hyperliquid pushing confidence back into altcoins, this project’s tokenomics, staking power, and community-driven design are shaping the crypto conversation this week and beyond. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Best Crypto to Buy This Week With Bold Potential MoonBull ($MOBU) is turning heads across Q4 2025 as the best crypto to buy this week . Its architecture, called “Mobunomics,” is built to reward both small and large holders. The tokenomics split drives value by allocating 50% to its stage-based launch, 20% to staking, and 11% to referral programs, maximizing scarcity and rewards simultaneously. Every trade enhances stability through 2% liquidity addition, 2% reflections to holders, and 1% token burn, ensuring long-term price appreciation. Built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, MoonBull ($MOBU) provides a secure and liquid ecosystem ready for DeFi integration. The governance system (launching at Stage 12) gives every holder equal voting rights, with 1 token = 1 vote. This community-first transparency, paired with its structured 23-stage rollout, is exactly why experts are calling it the best crypto to buy this week. MoonBull Presale Gains: Why the Best Crypto to Buy This Week Is Surging MoonBull’s presale performance has stunned the market. Currently in its 5th stage at $0.00006584, it has already raised over $450K with more than 1,400 holders. Early participants have seen an ROI of 163.36%, and the listing price of $0.00616 suggests a potential ROI of over 9,256% from Stage 5. With a 27.40% price increase per stage, momentum is undeniable. An example says it all: a $10,000 entry at Stage 5 equals 151,883,353.58 tokens, valued at $935,601.46 at listing. Combine this with 15% referral rewards and 95% APY staking (Stage 10 onwards), and MoonBull ($MOBU) stands as the best crypto to buy this week for those looking for both passive rewards and explosive growth. Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction: $1 Billion Buyback Sparks Optimism Ripple (XRP) is making history in October 2025 after announcing plans to raise at least $1 billion to buy back XRP through a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). This marks one of the largest corporate treasury fundraises in crypto history, signaling Ripple’s massive confidence in XRP’s future. The XRP token currently holds a market value of $13.8 billion, ranking it the fifth-largest cryptocurrency globally. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, confirmed the move as part of a strategy to enter the $120T corporate treasury payments market. This news strengthened market sentiment, pushing XRP price prediction models higher for Q4 2025. Many community members see the buyback as a bold attempt to stabilize XRP’s long-term price and assert its dominance in cross-border payments. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price News: HIP-3 Upgrade Ignites Trading Activity Hyperliquid (HYPE) is gaining major traction following its HIP-3 permissionless perpetuals upgrade, allowing users to create custom perpetual contracts without approvals. This update has significantly boosted on-chain volume and interest, turning the decentralized exchange into a top contender in DeFi this October 2025. The upgrade introduced new composability mechanics, meaning market participants can combine DeFi tools like lending, derivatives, and AMMs into a single custom setup. According to Sentora data, HYPE trading activity has reached multi-billion daily volumes. The HIP-3 model has made HYPE a standout performer, and current HYPE price news suggests the token could maintain strong momentum throughout Q4 2025. Final Thoughts: Ripple (XRP) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) Hold Steady While MoonBull ($MOBU) Leads the Race Ripple (XRP) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) have made powerful moves this October, restoring faith in DeFi projects and altcoin resilience. Yet, the best crypto to buy this week remains MoonBull ($MOBU) thanks to its structured growth and exceptional ROI potential. The MoonBull presale at $0.00006584 offers a limited-time entry for early buyers, promising a strong upside toward its listing price of $0.00616. With a 15% referral reward, a 95% APY staking system, and robust tokenomics, community members are positioning themselves now before the next price hike. It’s shaping up to be a defining month for MoonBull believers.

Announcing the plan at the inaugural Regional Investment Summit in Birmingham on Tuesday, Reeves will outline how she plans to end “pointless paperwork” and “unnecessary form-filling” faced by small businesses but committed to delivering transparency and certainty for businesses around mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The Treasury’s proposals are part of a wider drive to boost growth by cutting back on regulatory entanglements, according to the government. This development follows as the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) appeals to Reeves to seize the November budget and make substantial amendments on current tax law. In an October 13 news release, the think tank said this reform is significant in that it will allow Reeves to raise more money while mitigating the negative economic impacts. As for the IFS’s advice to the chancellor, officials at the London-based research institute cautioned Reeves against raising the current rate of tax in order to raise those extra funds (some 30 billion pounds, or about $40 billion) that she needs to meet her goals for boosting public finances. “What we really do not want in November is the encouragement of aimless changes and half-hearted solutions,” said Isaac Delestre, a senior research economist at the IFS. Delestre views November’s budget as a chance for real progress. Therefore, he urges the chancellor to use this budget to establish a more sensible tax system. CMA faces overhaul as Treasury pushes for faster, fairer M&A reviews Reeves will announce that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will undergo significant structural changes to improve efficiency and accountability. These are replacing its current panel-based decision-making with a board committee structure and carrying out detailed “phase 2” merger probes in-house rather than outsourcing them to independent experts. Any changes would have to undergo consultation and result in new legislation. The chancellor has made little secret of her impatience with regulators recently boasting that she had “got rid” of the chair of the CMA and plans to “take out” more as part of her pro-growth agenda. £10 billion investment drive unveiled at Birmingham summit The summit, described as last year’s overseas counterpart that attracted £63 billion of foreign investment into the country, is bringing around 350 business leaders, mayors and investors to Edgbaston cricket ground. Sponsored by Eon, HSBC, KPMG and Lloyds it will see bosses from British Land, Hammerson, Deutsche Bank, Kraft Heinz and Morgan Stanley attend alongside figures from West Bromwich Albion, Birmingham City FC as well as the Birmingham Royal Ballet. The government is expected to unveil £10 billion in new private investment, including a £6.5 billion injection from U.S. real estate firm Welltower into the care home sector. The Crown Estate will also announce a project expected to unlock £4.5 billion in value through land purchases at Harwell East science park, paving the way for new manufacturing spaces and 400 homes. Industry leaders have welcomed the Harwell East project, with CATCH UK, a chemical industry group, emphasizing the need for “urgent corrective action” to ensure domestic producers remain competitive. Meanwhile, the National Wealth Fund (NWF) will reveal £104 million in financing for clean energy projects, including onshore and offshore wind developments in Norfolk and Orkney and a heat network in Hull.

While the SPAC listing that Blockchain.com is reportedly considering would provide the company with additional capital flexibility and exposure following its previous downturns, it would also place the firm under increased scrutiny from regulators and investors. Blockchain.com considers listing publicly through SPAC merger Blockchain.com, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers, is reportedly considering going public through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), according to sources cited in reports. Blockchain.com was founded in 2011 and has been one of the oldest players in the crypto ecosystem, offering trading, wallet, and custodial services to millions of users worldwide. Its early start allowed it to build a large customer base and survive multiple market cycles. The company has reportedly appointed an advisor and held discussions about a possible SPAC deal. Blockchain.com has not yet made a final decision and details such as timing or valuation have not been disclosed. Blockchain.com has long held the goal of becoming a publicly traded company. When the firm appointed Goldman Sachs veteran Justin Evans as chief financial officer (CFO) in February, Evans said Blockchain.com was “taking the necessary steps to be a public company, if and when the public markets are available.” In addition to Evans, the company recently hired Mike Wilcox, the former CFO at Velocity Global, as chief operating officer (COO). The company’s use of a SPAC would offer a quicker and less complex path to the public markets than a traditional initial public offering (IPO). SPACs are blank-check companies created specifically to acquire existing businesses and they have recently regained popularity among crypto and fintech firms. Crypto IPO wave grows despite market volatility Blockchain.com has experienced the market’s volatility with its valuation rising to $5.2B in March 2021, and then to $14B in the next year in 2022, only to have taken a nosedive to $7B by November of 2023 due to falling crypto prices, lower trading activity, and regulatory uncertainty. However, the crypto industry has rebounded in 2025, supported by regulatory clarity and the institutional adoption of blockchain-based financial services. This recovery has renewed the interest in public listing ambitions among major players. In September, the U.S.-based exchange Gemini completed its IPO, pricing shares at $28 and closing its first trading day up 14.3% at $32, valuing the firm at roughly $3.3B. Similarly, Bullish, another cryptocurrency exchange, made its market debut in August, pricing shares at $37 and seeing them soar 83% to $68 by day’s end giving the firm a $10B fully diluted market capitalization. Meanwhile, Kraken, one of the largest global exchanges, is reportedly preparing for a traditional IPO as early as the first quarter of 2026. In September, Kraken raised $500M in a funding round that valued the company at $15B. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

According to him, independent and trustworthy statistics are crucial particularly for central banks, referring to them as “the backbone of sound monetary policy.” This comes as Nagel said that Europe must stop acting timidly in its trade relationship with China and start defending its own economic interests “in a more offensive way” during a financial gathering in Washington, Nagel said, “China needs Europe more than Europe needs China. We are a strong economy. We are four hundred fifty million people… So we should play the European card in a more offensive way.” According to the economist the continent should not rely on others to protect its markets. “The most important market for the European is Europe itself,” the ECB member said. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Trump’s on-and-off-again tariffs on China this year have led to a new wave of retaliation from Beijing, forcing Chinese exporters to redirect goods to markets such as Europe, where they are often sold under local production costs. Nagel points out the risks associated with central banks failing to function independently Nagel noted that trustworthy statistics were facing challenges lately. This happens when elected officials begin to openly question the reliability of key economic data that does not match the government’s view. Following these claims, the ECB member acknowledged that such allegations are powerful and replacing individuals who share unwanted information brings about even greater consequences. His remarks were made at an event in New York, following US president Donald Trump’s dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner due to disappointing job numbers and significant changes to previous data. Moreover, reports from sources highlighted that Trump frequently criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and tried to get rid of Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Regarding this report, Nagel cautioned against making decisions about monetary policy based on “political convenience” instead of careful economic analysis. He also mentioned that history clearly illustrates risks such as loss of public trust, financial chaos, and rampant inflation when central banks fail to function independently. Nagel expresses satisfaction with the ECB’s current monetary policy When the ECB developed their current monetary policy, Nagel expressed his satisfaction with the decision . He stated that he believed there was no need to make adjustments unless new data indicate a shift in the economic outlook. Regarding the situation, the president of the Bundesbank pointed out that he was very confident that the central bank is closing to its 2% price target. He added that he was not too worried about the bank missing this goal for a long time. “I feel quite comfortable with our current position,” Nagel stated during the IMF’s annual meetings in Washington. He further highlighted that if new information comes in that changes his view, then he will be open to adjusting his thoughts. However, for now, Nagel mentioned that he thinks they are in a good spot. Meanwhile, with inflation nearing the target and the economy proving resilience against challenges such as trade-related problems and wars, most policy makers are comfortable with current interest rates. Earlier this month, investors and economists anticipated that it is unlikely there will be another rate cut this year, despite eight cuts already in this cycle. This prediction was made after Nagel remarked that it would require a lot to shift his view that the ECB’s approach is suitable. On the other hand, some policy makers, such as Francois Villeroy de Galhau of France, have suggested that the bank should not rule out further cuts. They think the risks to growth and inflation are still greater.

While DOGE remains one of crypto’s most recognized names, its momentum is fading as investors search for what crypto to buy next with higher growth potential. That growing curiosity has brought Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into the spotlight, a DeFi project currently in Phase 6 of its presale, where over 70% of tokens have already sold out at $0.035, raising more than $17.65 million. With its dual-lending model that merges Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract systems, Mutuum Finance is being hailed by traders as the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2025.

The meme-coin now trades around $0.184, which is a critical support level that will be the deciding factor in its future direction. As long as bulls hold this level, a short-term rally towards $0.22–$0.25 is to be expected; but a clean breakdown of support will continue the bear trend and welcome deeper correction. As DOGE’s price action remains uncertain, investor attention is already starting to flow into newer opportunities in the market, with soon-to-be-listed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) flying under the radar, capturing more attention before the next big crypto cycle. For traders evaluating what crypto to buy, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming a standout option amid growing DeFi innovation.

Exchange Flows Show Withdrawals Based on exchange records, major centralized platforms recorded a net outflow of roughly 21,000 BTC over the past week. Coinbase Pro and Binance were named among those with the biggest withdrawals, showing about 15,000 BTC and 12,000 BTC moved off exchanges, respectively. Traders interpret such flows in different ways: some see accumulation into private wallets, others see funds repositioned by large traders.

In addition to SOL recovery, recoveries in Cardano and Hyperliquid were also steady with each recovering important support levels. This recovery has come about with an accumulation trend that will make the market ready for a wider breakout phase in late 2025. Concurrently, the rally has also revived the excitement to the presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which still has a good number of early investors calling it the best crypto to buy. Solana Builds Strength as Bulls Defend Key Levels Solana price rose 4% in the past 24 hours, indicating a new strength in the rising channel. The SOL price has been trading in a steady range of $185-$210, and buyers have been protecting the support at $190. According to the analysts, every test of this area is being received with active accumulation. This steady purchasing demand is a positive indicator of increasing confidence in the market. Technical traders regard the $205 to $210 as a possible breakout area that can cause the prices to go up to $246 and even to $300. Source; X Provided that Solana keeps holding above $180, it might proceed with its long-term growth pattern. Solana recovery has also led to a wider optimism in the altcoin market. Cardano Prepares for a Potential Technical Breakout Cardano is also exhibiting some stability with the token maintaining levels above the key support levels of approximately $0.65. ADA market data indicate that ADA is approaching a resistance area at $0.74 to $0.77, where sellers have been active in the last several sessions. When the market breaks out of this point it may indicate the beginning of a new short-term rise. Analyst Lark Davis observed that ADA recently showed a daily MACD golden cross, a precursor of large upsurge. Cardano has already shot up 150% since bottoming in September 2023 and has stayed in a distinct trend of higher lows. In the next major run, ADA may carry gains to $2.96 as long as the buying pressure is sustained. Source: X According to many traders, Cardano is currently one of the best crypto to buy at less than $1, as it has been assisted by technical strength and network enhancements that still continue to attract developers. Hyperliquid Growth Supported by Buyback Program Hyperliquid has been making continuous token buybacks amounting to over $521 million. These buybacks have replaced more than 5.6% of the circulating supply, which demonstrates steady protocol revenue. The gradual withdrawal of liquid supply has acted as a buffer when corrections were made recently and has thus created good grounds of recovery. Source: Tokenomist Under the new HyperEVM integration and active involvement in its ecosystem, the on-chain data of HYPE are healthy. The price action indicates that the token is trading within the range of $34 to $37 support indicating a sign of buyers accumulating in the range. With the trend, analysts estimate a possible rebound to a range of $45. The combination of lower supply, ecosystem growth, and long-term investor confidence have positioned Hyperliquid as a one of the most promising projects during periods of market consolidation to be the best crypto to own. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Attracts Investor Momentum Although there are already existing tokens that possess major support, new competitors such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are rapidly taking off. The presale that has been going on in the project has been registered with good participation of the retail and institutional investors. Subsequently, thousands of wallets have become part of the event and continue to boost the inflows every day as well as surpassing a few initial funding milestones. The PATRIOT50X bonus program, offered by MAGACOIN FINANCE has been the key to this rush. The incentive will reward the first participants who will earn up to 50% additional tokens. Analysts on X call it the XRP killer which may come to outperform even cryptos like Dogecoin or even Shiba Inu. Consequently, the presale is one of the most talked-about campaigns in all online communities, which makes MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the key upcoming listing candidates. It is now being listed as one of the best crypto to buy before the year 2025, as many traders note its large community base and clear presale process. Market Outlook The general market remains exhibiting a positive trend and Solana, Cardano and Hyperliquid are stable at strategic support points. All of the assets exhibit indications of gradual building up as the sentiment is slowly getting better. According to market analysts, the continued inflow into presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE makes investors ready to participate in the next stage of expansion. With the rotation of capital to new opportunities, it will be likely to focus on the developments which have both good fundamentals and community developments. As Solana has recovered, ADA has been on the technical upward trend, and HYPE has decreased supply, MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently one of the best altcoin to buy in the current accumulation phase.

53434188,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87075,1761008448,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Sets XRP Price For End of 2025,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-sets-xrp-price-for-end-of-2025/,"Crypto market analyst Whale.Guru, popularly known in the community as the “100x Gem Hunter,” has shared new price projections for major digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP. His updated forecast suggests moderate growth across the board and presents what he calls a more realistic outlook for the remainder of 2025. The latest analysis arrives amid heightened uncertainty in the broader cryptocurrency market. Most leading assets are struggling to regain momentum, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana all trading below their 30-day peaks. The decline has ranged from 4% to 18% across these tokens, while the Fear and Greed Index currently sits at 27, a level that indicates widespread caution among investors. Realistic end of 2025 crypto price predictions: Bitcoin – $250k Ethereum – $6k Solana – $350 BNB – $1.75k XRP – $5 What else? — Whale.Guru (@Whale_Guru) October 19, 2025 Bitcoin Expected to Regain Market Leadership Whale.Guru expects Bitcoin to remain the primary driver of the next bullish phase. In his projection, the world’s largest cryptocurrency could reach $250,000 before the end of 2025. Based on its current price of approximately $110,393, this would represent a gain of more than 126% and establish a new all-time high. Should this scenario unfold, Bitcoin’s market capitalization could approach $5 trillion, significantly improving overall sentiment in the crypto space. The analyst believes such a recovery would also create favorable conditions for large-cap altcoins, allowing them to follow Bitcoin’s trajectory with moderate gains of their own. According to his analysis, Ethereum could advance to around $6,000, Solana might rise to $350, and Binance Coin (BNB) could reach $1,750. These predictions indicate less than a 100% increase for each asset, a sign that Whale.Guru is focusing on steady market growth rather than speculative excesses. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Projection Revised to $5 In contrast to his earlier predictions of a supercycle that could propel XRP to $300, Whale.Guru has adjusted his expectations to a more measured $5 price target by the end of 2025. At its current price of $2.45 , this forecast implies a potential upside of roughly 103% over the next three months. While conservative compared to past estimates, this target would still mark a significant milestone for XRP, giving it a projected market capitalization of about $300 billion. Market observers note that factors such as institutional participation, potential ETF approvals, and Ripple’s expanding cross-border payment infrastructure could contribute to the token’s upward trajectory. Whale.Guru’s outlook aligns with projections from other market commentators, including Ash Crypto and Mario Nawfal , who have both placed XRP’s potential range between $5 and $10 if Bitcoin continues to strengthen. These overlapping forecasts suggest a growing consensus that XRP could deliver moderate, sustainable growth through 2025, rather than extreme price surges. The analyst’s revised tone reflects a more cautious but data-driven perspective compared to his previous predictions. Although a $5 XRP remains below earlier supercycle ambitions, achieving that level would still represent an unprecedented high for the token and a significant milestone in its long-term performance history.

53435067,609928,1761008458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53435067.jpeg,Grayscale Crowns Solana As Crypto’s New Powerhouse,https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-solana-crypto-new-powerhouse/,"Grayscale’s research team has delivered one of its most bullish assessments yet of Solana’s fundamentals, framing the network as the dominant venue for on-chain activity and a rare combination of scale, speed, and breadth. In a 17-minute read, the firm characterizes Solana as “crypto’s financial bazaar,” arguing that its “depth and diversity of on-chain activity” now set the pace for smart-contract platforms across core metrics: users, transaction volume, and transaction fees. “Solana is crypto’s financial bazaar,” Grayscale writes, adding that the network “stands out for the depth and diversity of its on-chain activity” and is “the category leader in terms of users, transaction volume, and transaction fees.” The report positions those three indicators as the most telling markers of real blockchain demand, concluding that the “diverse on-chain economy creates a strong foundation for SOL’s valuation and the necessary conditions for future growth.” Solana Is The Leading Blockchain By Activity At the token level, Grayscale places SOL squarely in large-cap territory, noting an implied network valuation of roughly $119 billion and ranking SOL as the fifth-largest crypto asset by market capitalization when excluding stablecoins, and the third-most liquid by average daily trading volume. The firm frames SOL as a “digital commodity that helps operate the network and provides investment access to growth in the Solana ecosystem,” positioning future price performance as a function of the network’s user base, throughput, and fee capture rather than narrative alone. The activity picture is central to the thesis. Grayscale highlights that Solana’s application layer now spans decentralized finance, consumer and social apps, and physical infrastructure networks, with standout traction in each. On the DeFi side, Solana’s DEXs have cleared more than $1.2 trillion in year-to-date volume, the highest tally across any blockchain ecosystem, while aggregator Jupiter is described as the industry’s largest by volume. In consumer crypto, memecoin launchpad and social venue Pump.fun is cited at roughly two million monthly active users and around $1.2 million in daily revenue. In the DePIN category, Helium’s migration and expansion on Solana anchors a real-world footprint Grayscale finds notable: “1.5 million daily users, 112,000 hotspots, and partnerships with major telecom companies like AT&T and Telefonica.” Beyond those flagships, Grayscale points to a long tail of more than 500 unique applications and a breadth of use cases that now includes brisk NFT trading (third among networks), significant stablecoin settlement (fifth), and a foothold in tokenized assets (seventh). The cumulative effect shows up in fees. “Although there’s variation over time,” the report states, “the Solana ecosystem earns about $425 million in fees per month — or more than $5 billion annualized,” which Grayscale calls “the most direct measure of total demand for a blockchain and its applications.” Performance characteristics remain a defining pillar of the analysis. Blocks arrive “every 400 milliseconds,” with transactions reaching probabilistic finality “in about 12–13 seconds.” Critically, low fees have persisted at scale. Users have paid an average transaction fee “of just $0.02 year to date,” while a local-fee-market design keeps congestion effects contained to hotspots of demand; Grayscale says median daily fees this year averaged “just $0.001.” The roadmap aims to compress latencies further. “A forthcoming upgrade to Solana called Alpenglow is expected to reduce finality time to 100–150 milliseconds,” the researchers note. User experience and architecture are framed as strategic differentiators. Grayscale calls Solana “a fast and cheap blockchain for everyone” that also “offers arguably one of the best new-user experiences in crypto.” The “monolithic” design, in contrast to layered rollup stacks, avoids bridging between execution domains, while wallet infrastructure — led by Phantom — is credited with smoothing onboarding and everyday use. SOL Tokenomics And Developer Momentum On the supply side, the tokenomics section emphasizes both dilution and offsetting staking yield . SOL’s issuance currently expands supply by about 4%–4.5% per year, which Grayscale calls a headwind “all else equal.” But with nominal staking rewards “around 7%,” the “real (inflation-adjusted) reward rate” lands in the “roughly 2.5%–3%” range, depending on conditions. “Currently around two-thirds of outstanding SOL tokens are staked,” the report adds. Developer momentum and potential “moats” are discussed in the context of the Solana Virtual Machine. Where EVM compatibility lets applications port across many chains with relatively low friction, Solana’s SVM “can’t be easily transferred to non-SVM blockchains,” a dynamic Grayscale says “potentially [contributes] to sticky demand.” The report tallies “more than 1,000 full-time developers working on Solana and SVM-based applications,” and finds that “the number of Solana-focused developers has grown faster than any other smart contract platform over the last two years.” That developer concentration, alongside escalating user activity and fee capture, is presented as reinforcing flywheels for the ecosystem. Competitive risks remain front and center. Grayscale underscores that some rival chains can be “even faster and/or cheaper,” often by “operating a more centralized network,” a trade-off users may accept depending on the application. Permissioned chains, while limiting openness, can be optimal in specific institutional contexts.At the monetary-asset end of the spectrum, the report is explicit that SOL “may be less suitable as a long-term ‘store of value’” relative to Bitcoin or Ether, citing higher nominal inflation and, more importantly, questions of resilience. “Solana’s efficiency comes at the cost of comparatively high hardware and bandwidth requirements, such that many of the network’s nodes operate in data centers,” Grayscale writes, warning that this “could become a source of centralization over time and a vector for third-party interference.” These are “complex and unsettled issues,” the report cautions, and investor perceptions may evolve. By Grayscale’s framework — users, transactions, and fees — Solana presently “is the leading network for on-chain activity.” The firm’s base case is that the scale and variety of Solana’s economy provide a “strong foundation for SOL valuation,” while acknowledging formidable competition and architectural trade-offs. The implicit investment lens is straightforward: if Solana continues to add users, process more transactions, and expand its fee base, “investors can anticipate a rising SOL price,” while accepting that price will not map one-for-one to fundamentals in the short run.

With no centralized oversight, ETH has become a stage where builders and grifters coexist, each leveraging the same tools of decentralization to vastly different ends. Can Ethereum Evolve Beyond Its Culture Of Exploitation? Ethereum has always been more than just a cryptocurrency. It’s a programmable, open finance framework that allows anyone to build and exploit ETH. According to AdrianoFeria’s post on X, this openness has enabled innovation and also allowed countless grifters to accumulate vast amounts of ETH by selling low-quality tokens and NFTs to retail investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Has A Fundamental Problem, Warns Cyberpunk Nick Szabo The mechanism of extraction was simple yet profound, so that retail investors, ironically seeking to gain more ETH exposure through higher beta plays, ended up parting with the very asset they sought to accumulate. These grifters effectively extracted ETH that might have otherwise remained in the hands of long-term holders. However, one of the earliest and most glaring examples was EOS. At its peak, it held about 7.2 million ETH, which is roughly 6% of the total supply, marking the largest single treasury in existence. A subsequent wave of Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and NFTs is believed to have extracted more ETH from the hands of long-term retail holders. This continuous speculative excess transferred wealth, creating selling pressure that ultimately slowed down ETH’s long-term appreciation. Furthermore, Adriano Feria asserts that ETH has finally moved beyond that phase and will be reflected in price action (PA) with steadier growth and much stronger relative strength during market corrections. Institutions are actively embracing ETH, and even hardcore BTC maximalists have been forced to acknowledge ETH’s technological strengths and the undeniable institutional traction it has attracted. These expectations are for a boring supercycle, and with crypto commentators (CT folks) still trying to call the top. Still, this very stability and institutional foundation is precisely what the ETH supercycle is meant to look like. Why Ethereum Legacy Belongs To Everyone A digital artist, ArtvisionNFT, from Ukraine, who specializes in NFTs, has revealed that in the fast-moving world of blockchain, history is at risk of being forgotten. As a result, the Covalent_HQ Ethereum Wayback Machine (EWM) was built to ensure the full history remains intact and accessible to everyone, anywhere, to access the verified blockchain data. Related Reading: Ethereum On-Chain Bloodbath: Rugs And Scams Erode Retail Confidence, What To Know However, EWM acts as a digital time capture, collecting, verifying, and storing old block using a decentralized system. Those process ensures that developers can use EWM to audit smart contracts, build analytics, and trace blockchain activity. EWM protects the transparency, accountability, and innovation in the broader Web3 ecosystem. At its core, Covalent_HQ’s mission is to make sure ETH’s story is never lost.

The altcoin has now secured over $16.5 million in funding , drawing thousands of new investors who see it as the next big breakout before major exchange listings. With the price still under $0.0006 and climbing hourly, early buyers are locking in fast, using the exclusive 50% bonus code: PATRIOTS100X before it expires. Funding Milestone Sparks FOMO Across the Market The latest figures confirm that MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the fastest-moving assets in the crypto market today. The project’s funding surge past $16.5 million has created a wave of urgency as the price automatically adjusts upward every hour, leaving latecomers paying more with each refresh. To celebrate the milestone, the MAGACOIN team announced a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using the code PATRIOTS100X , marking one of the most generous incentives seen this quarter. Thousands of wallets have already joined in just the past 48 hours, signaling the kind of network momentum usually seen before major exchange debuts. Experts tracking presale patterns predict up to a 75x ROI before listings go live, comparing the current setup to early-stage phases of meme-decentralized projects that later canceled zeros after listing. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Gaining Fast Traction Beyond the hype, investors are calling MAGACOIN FINANCE a safe haven amid ongoing market turbulence. While many assets remain down from their highs, this project stands out for its security-first framework, full audits, and transparent structure . It’s not just about gains; it’s about safety and smart positioning. With no venture capital influence and full verification on leading audit platforms, MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned trust in a space where few projects do. Traders are also using it as a hedge and diversification play, a move that balances exposure to both high-growth and secure assets as the broader market remains unpredictable. The token’s rise has been steady with no dips so far , giving holders confidence that early entry can still deliver explosive upside. Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead, but New Money Hunts Undervalued Altcoins While Bitcoin hovers near $110,000 and Ethereum sees heavy whale accumulation above $4,000 , the focus among new investors is shifting toward undervalued altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE . Bitcoin whales stacked coins below $107K, signaling confidence ahead of a possible push toward $123K. Ethereum, meanwhile, has seen large institutional buying — including BitMine’s $1.5B ETH purchase following the recent market dip. However, the price per Bitcoin or Ether leaves limited room for exponential growth compared to smaller caps. This rotation of capital into lower-priced assets has made MAGACOIN FINANCE a top choice for investors seeking the next high-upside play before the Q4 breakout cycle. Experts Predict a 75x ROI Before Listing Market analysts reviewing MAGACOIN’s structure suggest that if the current growth continues, the token could cancel two zeros in its next major cycle — transforming under-$0.0006 entries into prices closer to $0.05 or even $0.1 during the next bull run. That projection translates to more than 75x upside , making it one of the most talked-about early opportunities this quarter. The coin’s confirmed listings on both DEX and CEX platforms are expected to drive further demand once live, and many believe prices could reprice instantly once trading opens publicly. Final Call: Timing Is Everything With the price ticking higher every hour, timing is everything for those looking to position early. Thousands have already secured their holdings before the next increase, and bonus codes are running low. Use code: PATRIOTS100X on the official site to claim 50% extra tokens — available only for a short window. Once listings go live, this early phase closes for good.

Why It Matters for Banks, Investors, and Japan’s Economy The reform could normalize crypto inside Japan’s mainstream financial system, opening the door to bank-grade custody, trading, risk management, and compliance. Expect requirements such as capital charges, exposure caps relative to Tier 1 capital, market-surveillance, AML/CFT controls, Travel Rule adherence, and segregation of client assets. With over 12 million registered crypto accounts (a 3.5x jump in five years), Japanese demand is already deepening, and bank participation could accelerate that trend by improving trust, convenience, and liquidity. At the macro level, Japan’s 240% debt-to-GDP backdrop is pushing policymakers to balance innovation with stability. By enabling regulated access to Bitcoin and other digital assets,alongside the country’s push on yen-pegged stablecoins from Mitsubishi UFJ , Sumitomo Mitsui, and Mizuho, Japan signals a pragmatic path, which is to foster digital-finance growth while keeping systemic risks ring-fenced. Timeline, Safeguards, and What to Watch Next Implementation speed will hinge on whether the FSA proceeds via supervisory guideline updates (faster, narrower scope) or Diet legislation (broader, slower). Either way, expect tight exposure limits, stress-testing, and operational-risk standards for custody and exchange functions. Banks that enter the exchange business will need matching engines, institutional-grade custody, real-time monitoring, and robust KYC/AML tooling, likely catalyzing demand for regtech and market-infra vendors. Key catalysts: Final FSA guidance on capital treatment and exposure caps. Bank exchange registrations and first movers announcing BTC custody/trading. Progress on crypto’s reclassification as “financial products” (potentially smoothing the path for ETFs and broader securities-law oversight). Stablecoin rollouts (JPYC, bank-issued yen coins) driving on-chain settlement for corporates. If enacted, Japan’s plan could make it one of the most bank-integrated crypto markets in the world, providing institutional adoption while embedding crypto inside the country’s well-supervised financial rails.

This warning follows Beijing’s recent action of imposing sanctions on the US divisions of a South Korean shipping company because it eyes the US maritime industry for expansion with investment plans. In a statement dated Monday October 20, an American government official, who is serving as the US trade representative in the Trump administration, Jamieson Greer pointed out that China’s recent moves against private firms globally illustrate a worldwide trend of economic pressure focused on influencing American politics and managing the global supply chain. Greer further explained that the Asian country aims at discouraging foreign investment in America’s shipbuilding and other key industries. US-China maritime conflicts escalates raising tension in the industry Greer’s warning demonstrates an ongoing series of US-China maritime conflicts . Notably, China manages more than half of the world’s shipbuilding capacity and has been attempting to reinforce its control over the crucial South China Sea in recent years. This battle has significantly impacted the global economy as ship transport handles over 80% of international trade. Meanwhile, reliable sources have highlighted that even though the US is ranked as the country with the strongest navy globally, its shipbuilding capabilities are moderately low. To address this, the Trump administration has encouraged investments from South Korea, which is grouped as the second-largest shipbuilder in the world. China’s recent decision to implement sanctions on the US branches of a South Korean shipping company directly affected these efforts. To illustrate this, it prohibited individuals or organizations in China from conducting business operations with the US branches of South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean Co. Furthermore, China has warned that it will take further actions in response against the industry. Responding to China’s threat, Greer stated that attempts to scare them will not prevent the US from rebuilding its shipbuilding industry and fighting back against China’s efforts to dominate important industrial sectors. Greer’s statement is an example of the ongoing tensions. Sources have also noted that both countries have levied special port dues on each other’s commercial vessels, a measure that went into effect last week. To retaliate against China’s actions, the US intends to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports of key port equipment and could introduce a 150% import tax on other cargo handling gear. Trump plans to discuss about Taiwan with Xi Jinping Trump has been trying to diminish Chinese firms’ influence in strategic global ports, including ones lining the Panama Canal. With the severe actions from both the US and China, analysts have pointed out shipping as one of many issues creating tension between China and the US. This has raised concerns among investors around the world in recent years. To demonstrate these practices, Beijing has tightened export restrictions on rare earth materials and taken other steps. On the other hand, the US has stepped up restrictions on China’s access to chips and threatened the possibility of 100% tariffs. This week, Trump announced that he plans to discuss China’s territorial ambitions related to Taiwan, a self-governing island, when he meets with Xi Jinping, the President of the People’s Republic of China next week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. When reporters requested the president to answer questions on whether he thought China would ask for trade benefits in return for a discussion about Taiwan, Trump declined to respond.

Lubin posted on X and said Paradigm and other venture capitalists (VCs) want to to take as much value as they can from Ethereum and the wider ecosystem. He explained that their role is normal and only temporary as the industry keeps growing. His comments came as the community discussed the growing influence of big investment funds on the governance and research of Ethereum. Lubin says VCs help connect global capital to the growth of Ethereum Joseph Lubin said VCs take ideas and projects that begin in decentralized communities and make them ready for the traditional investors who control large amounts of global capital. He explained that many global investors do not yet fully understand crypto or trust it enough to invest directly, so VCs offer them familiar systems for managing money, checking projects, and protecting investments. This effort allows more capital to enter the crypto industry and reduces the feature that comes with new and unfamiliar technology. “We need VCs for now because they represent a comfortable bridge for the world’s capital to flow into our ecosystem.” the Ethereum co-founder said. Some people believe the influence of VCs is a risk to decentralization, but he sees it as a temporary phase. Lubin said Ethereum needs to work with the current financial system while building tools that will one day replace it. The co-founder of Ethereum also said new and fair “onchain investment platforms” will allow anyone, anywhere in the world, to invest in projects using tokens and smart contracts instead of going through large investment firms. “Very soon better, fairer, more broadly accessible onchain investment platforms with healthy tokenomics will mature sufficiently so that VCs will have no choice but to set up shop on these platforms,” Lubin said. The few large investors or organizations will slowly lose lose that power and ownership to people who actually use, build, and support these new systems. He believes Ethereum’s greatest strength lies in its openness, transparency, and neutrality. These values make it possible for people from every part of the world to connect, trade, and build together without depending on old financial institutions. Paradigm’s new hires spark debate over its growing role in Ethereum There has been intense debate in the cryptocurrency community about the growing influence of Paradigm in the Ethereum ecosystem. People voiced their concerns after two of the most respected researchers on the network took roles in projects backed by the venture capital firm. One of the researchers is Dankrad Feist, a long-time and highly respected member of the Ethereum Foundation. Feist announced that he was leaving the Ethereum Foundation to join Tempo , a new layer-1 blockchain that focuses on payments and stablecoins. The project aims to build a faster and more efficient blockchain system for global payments that can compete with both traditional payment rails and existing crypto networks. Mallesh Pai, who had previously worked with Consensys, joined Paradigm earlier in the year as a research adviser. He will guide the company’s growing research operations before moving to Tempo full-time in September. This information is according to his LinkedIn page. People say Paradigm could get too much control over the people and ideas that influence the long-term development of Ethereum, especially after Pai joined the firm immediately after Feist. Some users on social media say the growing number of corporate-backed blockchains like Tempo will slowly pull resources, talent, and energy away from the public networks of decentralized systems. However, some developers and analysts said the support from Paradigm will give scientists like Feist and Pai more freedom, funding, and infrastructure to experiment with new ideas that could later benefit the entire industry. Lubin responded to these debates and said he does not see Paradigm’s involvement as a threat to the independence that Ethereum has worked so hard to build. He explained that these movements are a natural and even healthy part of the evolution of any growing technology ecosystem. The Ethereum eco-founder added that more people now see this technology as a big part of the global economy because big companies and venture firms have shown a lot of interest in building new blockchains.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.5362 Market cap $538.71M Trading volume $177.38M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.5582 24-hour low $0.5227 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 16.62% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.7747 14-Day RSI 35.50 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 34 (Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $0.7754 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF is consolidating around $0.53 with low momentum and muted volume. The daily structure is still bearish but with signs of stabilization above $0.52. A breakout above $0.58 would confirm a short-term trend reversal. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart As of October 21, WIF is trading at $0.536, slightly below the green Alligator line at $0.548, signaling that the price remains under moderate bearish control. The daily candles have shown small-bodied formations, confirming a phase of consolidation after the sharp drop earlier this week. The Alligator lines are still fanned downward, suggesting that the overall market trend remains bearish despite the short-term stability. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The MACD is hovering around the neutral line, indicating that selling pressure has softened but there’s not enough buying strength to reverse the trend yet. Volume remains subdued, confirming a lack of strong participation from bulls. Immediate resistance stands near $0.548–$0.579, and a close above $0.58 would signal the first true bullish shift. On the downside, $0.52 acts as short-term support, while a break below $0.50 could open the door to $0.47. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, WIF has started to retrace after failing to sustain above $0.561, with candles now testing the $0.535 level. The pattern reflects mild profit-taking after a modest intra-day recovery. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview The MACD remains slightly positive but flattening, hinting that bullish momentum is fading. The support levels at $0.518 and $0.506 are critical; holding above these could allow another bounce toward $0.56, while losing them could drag price back toward $0.47. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.6219 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.5889 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.5800 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.6770 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.7747 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.8698 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.7754 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6697 SELL EMA 5 $0.7172 SELL EMA 10 $0.7674 SELL EMA 21 $0.8181 SELL EMA 50 $0.8750 SELL EMA 100 $0.8917 SELL EMA 200 $0.9919 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF is entering a stabilization phase after its selloff, showing weak but recovering momentum. Traders can expect sideways movement between $0.51–$0.57 in the short term, with a potential breakout forming only if volume returns and $0.58 is reclaimed with conviction. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Japan Considers Allowing Banks to Hold and Trade Bitcoin Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is weighing new rules that could let domestic banks store and exchange Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, marking a notable shift from its 2020 policy that barred direct crypto holdings due to volatility risks. Under the proposal, banks would be allowed to treat cryptocurrencies much like traditional financial assets such as stocks or bonds, provided they adhere to strict risk management and capital requirements. The Financial System Council, which advises the prime minister, is expected to review the proposal in the coming weeks.

Bolivia’s New President Plans to Use Blockchain to Fight Corruption Bolivia’s president-elect Rodrigo Paz plans to use blockchain technology to curb corruption and stabilize the economy as he prepares to take office on November 8, after winning with 54.5% of the vote. Paz’s administration aims to improve transparency in public spending by integrating smart contracts into government systems, ensuring that funds are traceable and harder to misuse. The initiative is part of a broader digital reform strategy focused on rebuilding trust in public institutions. He also intends to create a foreign exchange stability fund, where citizens can voluntarily report and deposit their cryptocurrency holdings to help support Bolivia’s reserves.

The move signaled Bolivia’s gradual transition toward a more open and blockchain-friendly economy. Paz’s blockchain agenda reinforces the global momentum toward digital transparency and crypto adoption, positioning Bitcoin and other decentralized assets as tools for accountability. As optimism for institutional crypto integration grows, investors may see renewed confidence reflected in Bitcoin’s market outlook. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Ascending Channel Hints at $115K Target Bitcoin is trading near $109,550, up 1.48% in the past 24 hours, holding firm inside an ascending channel on the 2-hour chart. The pattern reflects a controlled recovery after the mid-October dip, with the 20-EMA crossing above the 50-EMA, an early sign of renewed momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Buyers are defending higher lows since $105,500, showing steady accumulation. Resistance sits at $111,681, where a breakout could drive BTC toward $115,960 and possibly $119,800 if volume builds. A drop below $109,000 could trigger a short-term pullback to $107,455 or $104,430, both recent demand areas. The RSI around 63 points to sustained buying pressure without overheating, leaving room for further upside. As long as the structure holds, Bitcoin appears on track to test the $115K–$120K range, supported by improving liquidity and institutional inflows, hinting at a potential year-end rally if sentiment continues to stabilize.

The move comes as Beijing reasserts control over who can issue money-like tokens, even as Hong Kong builds a legal path for licensed stablecoin firms. Beijing Steps In People’s Bank of China and the Cyberspace Administration of China asked the companies not to go ahead with their projects, people familiar with the matter told reporters. Ant had said in June it planned to take part in Hong Kong’s pilot for fiat-referenced stablecoins, and JD.com had signalled similar interest. Hong Kong’s legislature passed a stablecoin bill in May that created a licensing regime for issuers, aiming to bring rules and clarity to the market after years of uncertainty. Under that law, anyone issuing stablecoins tied to Hong Kong dollars must hold a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. According to FT, Alibaba’s Ant Group and JD com have paused their plans to issue stablecoins in Hong Kong after receiving instructions from Chinese regulators, including the PBOC and CAC, to halt the projects. Hong Kong passed a Stablecoin Bill in May establishing a licensing… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 19, 2025 Industry Reaction And Risk Concerns Regulators in Beijing have warned that privately run stablecoins could threaten monetary control if large tech groups or brokerages were allowed to act like currency issuers. Reports have disclosed that PBoC officials were particularly uneasy about letting non-state firms issue tokens that might operate like money. Stablecoins are usually pegged to a fiat currency such as the US dollar and are widely used by traders to move funds between crypto assets, which is why officials worry about the scale and reach such tokens could achieve. The concern is less about the technology and more about who controls the payments and reserves that back these tokens. Hong Kong’s Timeline And What Might Happen Next Hong Kong has said it expects to begin issuing licenses under its stablecoin regime in the near term, with regulators signaling that only a limited number of licenses would be granted at first. Market watchers see the city as a testing ground for regulated, fiat-backed tokens — but mainland guidance can change the plans of Chinese firms that want to participate. The pause follows broader signals from Beijing about offshore digital asset activity. In recent months, regulators have also asked some brokerages to slow or stop tokenization and other real-world asset work tied to Hong Kong, reflecting wider caution about rapid growth of crypto-linked products across borders.

Ethereum MVRV Ratio Has Formed A Death Cross In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a signal that has appeared for Ethereum in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. This on-chain indicator measures the ratio between the ETH Market Cap and Realized Cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes To $105,000, Sentiment Sinks Into Extreme Fear The Realized Cap here is a capitalization model for the cryptocurrency that calculates its total value by assuming the ‘real’ value of each token in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Since the last transaction of any token is likely to represent the last time it changed hands, the price at its time would denote its current cost basis. As such, the Realized Cap is a measure of the total cost basis of the ETH circulating supply. In other words, the model represents the amount of capital the investors as a whole have put into the asset. The Market Cap, on the other hand, signifies the value that the investors are carrying in the present. Thus, its comparison with the Realized Cap in the MVRV Ratio tells us about the profit-loss situation of the holders. When the value of the indicator is greater than 1, it means the investors are holding more value than they put in. On the other hand, it being under the cutoff suggests the overall market is underwater. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Ethereum MVRV Ratio and its 160-day moving average (MA) over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum MVRV Ratio has witnessed a decline recently as ETH’s price has gone down, implying holder profitability has been dropping. With the latest drawdown, the indicator’s daily value has plunged below the 160-day MA. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted the previous instances of this crossover taking place. It would appear that the MVRV Ratio’s fall under this line in February led into a significant decrease in the ETH price from $3,300 to $1,400, a swing of almost 60%. Other instances of the crossover, however, didn’t mean much for Ethereum. It should be noted, though, that in these instances, including the one from earlier in the month, the metric was swift to recover back above the line, essentially canceling out the death cross.

The steady performance is indicative of growing investor confidence as traders adjust to the current mid-cycle phase, a period of often quiet accumulation ahead of the next big rally. Analysts pointed out that this is an environment that favors disciplined buyers. Both Cardano (ADA) and MAGACOIN FINANCE are shaping up as the best accumulation plays for investors who are looking for long-term exposure. Their stability, strategic development, and growing interest by both investors suggest that they can outperform when market momentum returns. Bitcoin Consolidates Above Key Support Bitcoin has solidly rallied in recent days, which improves its mid-term case. After hitting a low of $104,000, the top cryptocurrency has regained the $111,000 level and continues to show signs of resilience. Market data suggests that this range is now a good accumulation range for both the retail and institutional participants. Source: CoinMarketCap Analysts say that Bitcoin’s historical mid-cycle stance events are often accompanied by long periods of consolidation. During these times, traders take positions slowly in preparation for the next surge. The $100,000 support continues to be crucial as a breakout above $125,000 could signal renewed bullish momentum. The wider market sentiment has been boosted by a reduction in geopolitical risk as well as new optimism around trade negotiations. With the macro risks stabilized, the market is moving from short-term volatility to long-term positioning and fundamentals. ADA Attracts Long-Term Buyers Cardano (ADA) continues to draw attention from patient investors who are focused on the long-term. For weeks, the asset has been going sideways, without moving away from support near familiar levels. Analysts point out that ADA’s steady activity among long-term holders is indicative of confidence in its network growth. Its steady updates with development and an active community, along with its growing DeFi ecosystem, strengthen the argument to amass during this quieter phase of the market. ADA has rallied strongly in the late stages of previous cycles. Traders consider its current range of $0.65 to $0.70 a healthy base. If Bitcoin holds, ADA may be one of the first major altcoins to break higher as the next wave of capital rotation starts. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Recognition in Mid-Cycle Strategy MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting more attention from large investors quietly buying up as the market is stabilized. These whales are often early movers in new cycles, and so it looks like they are positioning for the next phase of expansion. Their steady purchasing reflects confidence in the long-term potential of the project and confidence in the market’s ability to withstand. To add to the excitement, the project recently introduced the Patriot50X bonus , offering early participants 50% additional tokens during the presale. The bonus has boosted investor sentiment, offering a tangible reward for those who jump on early while reinforcing allegiance to existing supporters. Analysts say this combination of high whale interest, combined with the structured rewards, is rare in early-stage projects. It is a disciplined approach that focuses more on sustainable growth and less on short-term hype. Many consider MAGACOIN FINANCE a middle-of-cycle standout – a project operating well during a consolidation period when others are stagnant. As the markets increase in stability, its verified transparency and early demand made it one of the best crypto opportunities lined up with Bitcoin’s wider recovery phase. Final Outlook Bitcoin’s ability to trade above $111,000 demonstrates growing confidence in the crypto market at large. This calm period, also often referred to as the mid-cycle accumulation zone, allows investors to prepare for the next uptrend. Within this landscape, ADA and MAGACOIN FINANCE are emerging as leaders. ADA appeals to those looking for network strength and gradual growth, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining recognition for those investors who see the value in ‘early’ entry, known transparency, and smart reward systems. Together, they are the sort of assets you define to the mid-cycle accumulation that matters, profitable-patient plays based on conviction, not hype.

The 50-week Simple Moving Average (SMA), often called the bull market baseline by traders, has acted as a reliable support zone since early 2023. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at around $111,200, showing a modest daily gain while still down over the past week. Bitcoin Retests Long-Term Support The chart shared by Merlijn The Trader shows that each time Bitcoin has retested the 50-week SMA since 2023, it has gone on to make new highs. The moving average has become a key level for identifying changes in trend. In early 2022, Bitcoin broke below it, marking the start of a broader correction. Since then, however, the price has repeatedly returned to this line before continuing higher. The most recent touch of the SMA has once again attracted attention from traders watching for signs of a new upward move. Merlijn stated: BITCOIN JUST RETESTED THE BULL MARKET BASELINE. The 50-week SMA marked every major liftoff since 2023. Smart money buys the retest. Retail buys the breakout. This chart separates traders from tourists. pic.twitter.com/hw8hWmOKPJ — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) October 20, 2025 Sentiment Still Unsettled After Liquidation Market confidence remains low following a large liquidation event on October 10. Funding rates, which reflect the cost of holding long or short positions in the futures market, dropped into negative territory on October 17. This suggests that many traders were leaning toward short positions, betting on further declines. Source: CryptoQuant Since then, funding rates have recovered and are now back above 0.005. Although this shift shows some return of buying interest, the caution in the derivatives market shows that traders are not yet fully convinced by the rebound. This kind of hesitation is common after a strong pullback, especially when losses were sudden. Key Price Levels in Play Bitcoin is currently trading near a resistance area at $111,440. This level marked the start of a previous decline that took the price below $108,600. According to analyst Lennaert Snyder, breaking and holding above $111,440 could open the way for a move toward $115,800. If that level is also cleared, price may revisit $120,800, where a fast selloff occurred earlier. Bitcoinsensus reported that the weekly candle closed above the $107,200 low, a move that could support a continued push higher. They also noted that the Bitcoin liquidity index has started to rise for the first time since July, a possible sign that new capital is entering the market. Broader Trends and External Pressure EGRAG CRYPTO noted that Bitcoin appears to be following a recurring pattern. The analyst suggested that the market may be entering the final stage of an upward cycle. Suggesting that a sharp reversal could follow after retail participation increases, EGRAG added, “Everyone will think we’re finally safe… but that’s where the real twist comes.” Notably, the recent correction was partly driven by political news, as we reported . A drop at the end of last week followed comments from former US President Donald Trump about new tariffs on China. This created uncertainty across financial markets and added pressure on crypto assets. As reported by CryptoPotato, data from prediction platform Polymarket showed some skepticism in the retail space. Their latest odds gave a 6% chance of aliens being confirmed this year, compared to just 5% for Bitcoin reaching $200,000. While meant to entertain, it reflects how cautious traders have become in setting near-term expectations.

After bouncing from $3,800 support, ETH is now touching the $4,100 resistance area that will determine the outcome, either reversing the trend bullishly or continuing with the correction. Despite the market fear index plunging to 30, analysts remain bullish on the $4,500 Ethereum target, noting good on-chain fundamentals and a growing network participation. Besides ETH, a Layer 2 project built on the Ethereum network called MAGACOIN FINANCE is set to capitalize on the same wave as investors look to get early access to scalable projects before the next rally. Fear Index Falls to 30 as Traders Turn Defensive The Crypto Fear Index dipping to 30 signals growing caution among market participants. This level reflects widespread unease, but also reflects conditions that have been followed in the past by large accumulation phases. Analysts point out that fear usually coincides with periods of opportunity to buy, when long-term investors come in quietly. Institutional traders seem to be taking advantage of this sentiment gap to add exposure. On-chain indicators show steady inflows of crypto into Ethereum staking contracts, hinting at continued confidence from major holders despite a lack of retail enthusiasm. Analysts believe such behavior indicates conviction in Ethereum’s medium-term outlook despite the short-term volatility that still exists. Volatility has compressed across leading assets, signaling that a decisive move could emerge soon. Traders now eye Ethereum’s key resistance zone as a potential trigger for renewed momentum before the end of October. Ethereum Tests $4,100 Resistance as Bulls Target a Breakout Toward $4,500 Ethereum price is again retesting $4,100 resistance, which has defined the market structure since late August. Trader Ted emphasizes this area as an important battleground where bulls and bears are fighting for control over a short-term period. Source: X A daily close above $4100 would be a technical change and confirm that buyers are regaining dominance. From there, ETH could progress towards $4,265, followed by a secondary target near $4,800, the upper boundary of its current range. Analysts consider these levels to be important checkpoints before the wider market can try to make a full recovery. Momentum indicators like RSI and MACD signal slow improvement with growing trading volume, adding further weight to the bullish case. A successful breakout would probably inspire broader confidence for altcoins, as Ethereum has historically led altcoin recoveries in similar phases. Conversely, rejection at this level would send ETH back towards $3,815, or even into the $3,575-$3,350 accumulation range. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rides Ethereum’s Path to $4,500 As Ethereum consolidates, MAGACOIN FINANCE, a Layer-2 project built on its blockchain, is drawing growing attention from analysts and early investors. The project benefits directly from Ethereum’s network activity and scaling upgrades, which continue to strengthen demand for Layer-2 infrastructure. Experts see striking similarities between MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early trajectory and Ethereum’s initial expansion in 2016. However, they note that MAGACOIN FINANCE entered the market with stronger security architecture and refined scalability mechanisms, providing a robust foundation for long-term growth. Some analyst projections suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 400x returns before Ethereum reaches its $4,500 target . The reasoning lies in its close alignment with Ethereum’s ecosystem, where every wave of adoption increases transaction flow across connected Layer-2 networks. Institutional investors have started positioning early, treating MAGACOIN FINANCE as a leveraged bet on Ethereum’s continued dominance in smart-contract markets. Final Outlook Ethereum’s battle near $4,100 represents a critical technical crossroads for the market. A clear breakout could validate a renewed uptrend toward $4,500, while rejection may trigger another short-term correction toward deeper support. Either outcome will shape November’s trading structure and influence altcoin sentiment. Despite the fear-driven environment, analysts maintain that Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong. ETF-related interest, network upgrades, and increasing transaction volumes continue to underpin the asset’s long-term strength. At the same time, attention is shifting toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say stands to benefit most from Ethereum’s rally. Both assets highlight how institutional capital is quietly preparing for the next recovery phase, reinforcing the narrative that the crypto market is setting up for a powerful rebound heading into 2025.

According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin appears to be entering the disbelief phase, which increases the possibility of a rebound to the upside. The contributor emphasized the slightly negative funding rate to support their analysis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Score Turns Negative With Trend Below $106,780 – When Will The Correction End? For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin disbelief phase occurs when a new uptrend begins, but most investors remain skeptical after a recent correction, doubting that the recovery is real. During this phase, lingering bearish sentiment and short positions often act as fuel for a stronger rally once confidence returns. Darkfost stated that investors’ skepticism toward BTC returning to bullish mode can be gauged through BTC funding rates in the derivatives market. Funding rates remained negative at -0.004% on the exchange for six out of seven days over the past week, indicating traders are still slightly bearish. The likely reason behind traders’ short bias is the October 10 crypto market crash that led to a liquidation worth $19 billion. Since then, traders have consistently chosen to short the market instead of getting trapped in another price pullback. However, the longer BTC remains in the disbelief phase, the stronger the potential for an explosive upside move becomes. Darkfost added: If the current uptrend continues to establish itself, the growing pile of short positions against it could become a powerful fuel for the next leg higher. As these shorts get liquidated, it would drive prices upward, triggering a short squeeze. If a short squeeze happens, then BTC could quickly rally to major liquidity zones around $113,000 level, and even as high as $126,000 region, where significant short orders liquidations are clustered. The analyst shared two previous instance where such a pattern played out. In September 2024, BTC fell to $54,000 before surging to a new all-time high beyond $100,000. Similarly, in April 2025, the flagship digital asset rallied from $85,000 to $111,000, before climbing even higher to $123,000. To conclude, the Bitcoin market may be on the verge of another short squeeze, fueled by investors’ skepticism. BTC Investors Need To Be Cautious Although BTC is giving hints of a looming short squeeze, investors should still exercise some caution before entering the market in hopes of an instant turnaround in sentiment. For example, Bitcoin activity recently slumped below its 365-day average, raising fears of a loss of momentum.

That said, some crypto analysts forecast that BTC is likely done with the price correction and is set to surge in the coming days. At press time, BTC trades at $110,814, up 2.8% in the past 24 hours.

According to Glassnode, last week’s sharp drop from $115,000 to $104,000 flushed out weak hands and triggered a defensive market rotation. Futures open interest and funding rates have declined, and demand for downside protection has surged, signaling a shift toward risk aversion.

The province’s energy ministry said on Monday that BC Hydro, a government-owned utility, will no longer accept new grid connection requests for crypto mining. The move comes after a two-year moratorium introduced in 2022, which officials say will now become a long-term policy aimed at protecting energy supplies and avoiding grid strain. Move Aims To Protect Electricity Supply For Job-Intensive And Revenue-Generating Projects BC, a global exporter of natural resources such as lumber, minerals and hydropower, plans to redirect available electricity toward industries that create more jobs and revenue for local communities. Future grid connections will be prioritized for sectors like natural gas processing, hydrogen production and manufacturing. According to Bloomberg, the Canadian province of British Columbia plans to limit power use by AI data centers and permanently ban new crypto mining projects. The province’s Energy Ministry said it will prioritize grid access for mining and natural gas industries to create more… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 21, 2025 The government said cryptocurrency mining consumes a large amount of energy. However, it provides little economic benefit to the province. Officials believe that redirecting electricity to industries with higher employment and investment potential will create greater public value. In comparison, pending crypto projects would have demanded more than 11,700 gigawatt-hours of power each year. That is enough electricity to supply hundreds of thousands of homes across British Columbia. Province Targets Balanced Grid Expansion Linking Energy Supply To Job Creation The permanent restriction is part of a broader set of energy policy reforms planned for late 2025. These reforms will determine how industrial electricity is distributed across the province. They will also set rules for fast-growing, high-consumption sectors such as data centers and artificial intelligence. In early 2026, BC Hydro will begin a competitive bidding process to allocate 400 megawatts of power. Of this, 300 megawatts will go to AI projects and 100 to general data centers. The process will run over two years. Meanwhile, traditional sectors such as mining, oil and gas, forestry and manufacturing will continue to have unrestricted access to industrial power, the ministry said. By 2026, construction on new transmission lines is expected to start. The expansion will continue through 2034 to strengthen BC’s grid and meet rising industrial demand. Officials said this long-term approach will help link power development with the province’s goals of job creation and economic diversification. BC’s Move Reflects Global Shift Toward Powering AI Over Energy-Hungry Crypto Mining The moratorium introduced in 2022 followed a sharp rise in crypto mining activity across British Columbia. Many companies were drawn to the province by its low-cost and renewable hydroelectric power. Soon after, BC joined other provinces such as Manitoba and Quebec in restricting crypto-related electricity use. The decision came amid growing environmental concerns and the instability of digital asset markets. At the time, policymakers warned that crypto mining consumed vast amounts of energy. They feared it could divert clean power away from households, hospitals and critical industries. Moreover, they questioned whether the largely automated mining operations brought any real employment or economic value to local communities. Since then, the government’s priorities have evolved. Officials now see greater long-term benefits in supporting AI and industrial projects that rely on stable electricity and generate stronger tax and job contributions. They say the move aligns with BC’s broader climate objectives and its transition toward a more resilient economy.

This uptick follows two consecutive Fridays of major drops, igniting fears and uncertainty among investors. These concerns have been compounded by predictions from experts about a potential bear market on the horizon. Looming Bear Market Threat Market analyst Doctor Profit, known for his accurate forecasts regarding the recent Bitcoin price trajectory, has recently cast doubt on whether market makers will allow both retail and institutional investors to exit at more favorable prices after incurring losses. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Moves: Can It Repeat The 36,000% Rally ‘Anomaly’ From Last Cycle? In a social media post on X (previously Twitter), he suggested that the maximum bullish scenario for the Bitcoin price in the near-term could reach around $116,500, representing a 9% increase from its current levels. However, he emphasizes that a drop below $101,700 would breach what he terms the “magic bull market line,” effectively confirming a bear market. Profit advises caution, predicting a significant move that could push the Bitcoin price below this critical threshold, signaling the end of the bull run. Adding to the bearish sentiment, the Bitcoin price is currently hovering below the short-term holder realized price of $112,500. This figure represents the average entry point for short-term traders and buyers, many of whom are now facing losses. On-chain data compiled by the expert also indicates that these traders are likely to sell off their positions if the Bitcoin price dips between 5% and 10%, potentially intensifying short-term selling pressure. Challenging Times Ahead For Bitcoin Price Profit further elaborates on the market conditions, pointing out that current price movements are indicative of market makers liquidating both bullish and bearish positions. “Nothing goes down in a straight line,” he notes, suggesting that while the market could be in a bear market, it is essential to remain aware of short-term fluctuations. He argues that high-leverage traders must be wiped out on both sides before the market experiences its next significant downward movement. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bull Run Over? Analyst Sees Echoes Of 2021 The expert also warns that every brief rally is designed to mislead bullish traders and liquidate late bearish positions. The market makers’ strategy appears to involve pushing Bitcoin toward the $116,500 region to eliminate late bears and generate sufficient liquidity for another downward price adjustment, potentially leading to new local lows. Looking ahead, Doctor Profit predicts that such price movements will continue to recur in the coming weeks and months, creating a challenging environment for investors in the volatile digital asset market.

Rodrigo Paz Pereira , who won the runoff that ended nearly two decades of rule by the Movement for Socialism, has made clean government a clear promise. He says modern ledgers can make money flows harder to hide. Blockchain Plan For Transparency Paz’s team is proposing the use of distributed ledgers for key public processes, including procurement and the tracking of public funds. Based on reports, the Central Bank of Bolivia relaxed a previous ban on cryptocurrencies in June 2024, a move that has opened the door for banks and fintechs to work with digital assets while keeping the boliviano as the official currency. Crypto activity in the country has grown sharply. Reported figures show crypto transactions rising from about $46.5 million in the first half of 2024 to roughly $294 million in the same period of 2025, a more than 500% jump in volume that has grabbed the attention of regulators and lawmakers. Why The Push Matters Supporters say blockchain will add a public, tamper-resistant record to budgets and contracts, which could make it harder for officials to hide graft. Critics warn that technology alone won’t fix weak institutions. They argue that audits, strong oversight and clear rules are still needed for any system to work. Reports have disclosed that the new administration is exploring pilot projects and international cooperation to build capacity, including ties with other countries that already use blockchain tools in some government functions. International Links And Local Caveats Bolivia has been seeking outside help. Based on reports, officials signed a memorandum of understanding with partners abroad to share regulatory ideas and technical know-how. That exchange could speed up implementation. At the same time, analysts note that rapid growth in crypto use raises its own challenges, such as consumer protection and money-laundering risks that must be managed. The Central Bank’s move to allow crypto interactions through formal banking channels was intended to reduce informal activity, but regulators now face new work in supervision and enforcement. Implementation details remain thin. Reports say pilot programs are likely to come first, focusing on a few government services before broader rollout. Success will depend on how public agencies adopt the tools, how clearly rules are written, and whether independent audits are used to check results. If the pilots expose gaps, they will be revised. If they work, the government could expand the approach to more areas.

The case has led to renewed attention on wallet configurations and user security practices after an image shared by a community member highlighted a key distinction between “cold” and “hot” wallets within the Ellipal app. James Rule (@RuleXRP), a prominent figure in the XRP community, posted a warning that included a screenshot from the Ellipal mobile interface. The post featured an arrow pointing to the option labeled “Add Hot Wallet,” showing how users can switch between connecting a cold wallet and creating a hot wallet in the same application. He cautioned users by writing, “DO NOT create a HOT WALLET in the @ellipalwallet APP with SEED/RECOVERY Phrases.” He also referred to the man who claimed the loss, alleging that the individual was “shilling a new YouTube Channel focusing on gold and silver.” DO NOT create a HOT WALLET in the @ellipalwallet APP with SEED/RECOVERY Phrases, etc etc. The guy that claims he lost $3 Million XRP is ""shilling"" a new YouTube Channel focusing on gold and silver. Be careful out there. pic.twitter.com/95sCX0RsWS — James Rule XRP (@RuleXRP) October 18, 2025 Ellipal’s Response Within hours, the post circulated widely among XRP holders, many of whom questioned how such a large amount could be stolen from a supposedly air-gapped device. Ellipal responded publicly to the growing concern, clarifying that its hardware wallets “are 100% air-gapped and never connect to the internet.” While Brandon, the man who lost the $3 million initially stated that the cold wallet on the app functions as a hot wallet , the company explained that the reported issue “came from a hot wallet setup, not from the cold wallet itself.” Its message concluded with a reminder to users to “stay safe and always keep your keys offline.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Lessons for Crypto Holders The distinction between wallet types is central to understanding the situation. A cold wallet is designed to remain isolated from any network connection, which prevents online attacks, and crypto experts have consistently advocated that XRP holders store their tokens in cold wallets . However, once a recovery seed is imported into a mobile or internet-connected app, it no longer functions as cold storage. This transition effectively converts it into a hot wallet, exposing private keys to potential compromise if the device is infected or insecure. Brandon allegedly imported his seed phrase into the mobile app before the theft occurred, allowing attackers to access the funds remotely. The case remains under investigation, but many market participants believe that the reported vulnerability lies not in the Ellipal device itself but in the configuration choices made during setup.

The price is now trading above $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.420 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

The bulls were able to push the price above $2.50, and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.647 swing high to the $2.190 low. However, the bears remained active near the $2.5350 level and prevented more gains.

Meanwhile, the Dogecoin Foundation’s commercial arm, House of Doge, made headlines by acquiring a majority stake in Italy’s historic football club US Triestina Calcio 1918. The move was made to integrate Dogecoin payments into match-day operations and to expand the coin’s real-world utility. Playful X Post Sends FLOKI Higher Elon Musk once again sent shockwaves through the meme coin market this week after a lighthearted post on his social media platform X triggered a sharp price rally. On Monday, Musk shared an AI-generated video featuring his Shiba Inu dog, Floki, declaring that the pup was “back on the job” as CEO of X. In the short clip, Floki is dressed in a tie and glasses, and playfully mutters, “Numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers? Is this working? Yay.” Almost instantly after the post, the price of the Floki ( FLOKI ) meme coin surged by almost 29%. The token climbed from a daily low of $0.00006572 to a high of $0.00008469 before correcting slightly to around $0.00007625. The move certainly proved that Musk still has influence over speculative corners of the crypto market, especially meme coins, which often trade more on hype and community enthusiasm than on fundamentals. FLOKI’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) This latest episode adds to Musk’s long history of causing volatility in the meme coin space. His past tweets, jokes, and even temporary changes to X’s logo previously fueled massive rallies in Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme-inspired cryptocurrency. Musk’s close association with Dogecoin even led to a 2022 class-action lawsuit that accused him of manipulating its price through media appearances and social media activity. That case was ultimately withdrawn in November of 2024, but it shed some light on just how powerful his market influence can be. The timing of Musk’s latest post also happened as the meme coin market struggled to recover from a series of sharp sell-offs earlier this month. Data from CoinMarketCap showed that on Oct. 11, the sector’s total value plunged by close to 40%, from $72 billion to $44 billion due to a wider crypto market crash. Although meme coins briefly rebounded, another wave of selling hit on Friday. Nearly $230 billion in overall crypto value was wiped out that day, but Musk’s viral post appears to have temporarily reignited optimism by reminding traders that even one tweet from him can still move markets. Dogecoin Buys Stake in Football Club In other meme coin-related news, the Dogecoin Foundation’s commercial branch, the House of Doge, took a major step into European sports by acquiring a majority stake in US Triestina Calcio 1918, one of Italy’s oldest football clubs. The move was announced Monday, and is Dogecoin’s boldest venture into professional football. Partnering with Brag House Holdings, Inc., the House of Doge became the “largest equity holder” in Triestina and plans to inject fresh capital into the struggling team to help fund football operations and community programs. According to the announcement , the investment was made to introduce modern crypto integrations into the club’s operations, including enabling Dogecoin payments for tickets, concessions, and merchandise during home matches. The House of Doge said the initiative will also help create a “modern payments structure” that enhances the match-day experience, supports the club’s financial stability, and expands the real-world use of Dogecoin. If successful, the partnership could give the meme coin more visibility among millions of football fans who watch Italy’s top-tier Serie A matches each week. Triestina was a founding member of Serie A in 1929, and spent decades in the lower divisions. In fact, it has not played in the top flight since 1958. The team currently sits at the bottom of Serie C and faces the risk of relegation to Serie C2, which is just one level above semi-professional football. The capital infusion from the House of Doge could therefore be vital in reviving the club’s fortunes both on and off the pitch. US Triestina Calcio 1918 The acquisition forms part of a growing trend of crypto firms investing in traditional sports to build brand recognition and utility. Solana-based Brera Holdings owns several clubs across Europe and beyond. For Dogecoin, this partnership is the latest in a series of efforts to expand its ecosystem. Earlier this year, the House of Doge collaborated with IndyCar driver Devlin DeFrancesco and Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing during the Indianapolis 500. DeFrancesco received part of his salary in DOGE and made a charitable donation in the same token.

The risk-on mood was established overnight by a robust finish on Wall Street, where concerns over U.S. regional banks eased and strong corporate earnings reports fueled buying. Meanwhile, Japanese shares hit new record highs amid expectations that Sanae Takaichi would become the next Prime Minister, signaling continued fiscal stimulus. Gold dipped to around $4,340 per ounce on Tuesday but remained close to the fresh record set in the previous session.

The Japanese yen weakened toward 151 per dollar on Tuesday, falling for the third straight session, as investors awaited a parliamentary vote expected to confirm Sanae Takaichi as Japan’s next prime minister. Sanae Takaichi won the lower house vote on Tuesday, officially becoming Japan’s first female prime minister. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 1.24% to above 3,880 while the Shenzhen Component gained 1.2% to 12,980 on Tuesday, with mainland stocks rising for the second straight session as easing Sino-US trade tensions continued to support market sentiment, and the offshore yuan inched up around 7.12 per dollar on Tuesday, nearing a four-week-high, supported by continued firm central bank guidance and signs of easing US-China trade tensions. Adding to the upbeat mood, President Donald Trump said he expects to reach a “fair deal” with China’s President Xi Jinping during their upcoming meeting in South Korea, tempering trade tensions. Meanwhile, Foxconn Industrial jumped 4% after Apple announced strong iPhone 17 sales in both the US and China. Foxconn is a major manufacturing partner for Apple.

India's net foreign direct investment turned negative in August 2025, marking the first time in the current fiscal year (2025/26), due to a moderation in gross inflows and a rise in repatriation. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.70% to 9,093 on Tuesday, extending gains from the previous session, as market sentiment remained buoyant amid progress on a key US-Australia trade agreement. The Australian dollar slipped to around $0.650 on Tuesday, breaking a two-day winning streak. U.S. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a USD 8.5 billion critical-minerals deal at the White House on Monday, aiming to secure access to Australia’s rich rare-earth resources as China tightens export rules. Domestically, investors now await flash PMI data, alongside speeches from RBA officials later this week. In the U.S. on Monday, all three major indexes ended higher on optimism over incoming earnings reports and fresh support from banks, while markets continued to assess the outlook of fewer trade barriers between the US and China. Investors now await Friday’s September CPI report for further insight, which was delayed due to the shutdown. U.S. stock futures were little changed on Tuesday as investors awaited a wave of major earnings reports, with Netflix, Coca-Cola, and General Motors set to release results later in the day: Dow +0.04% ; S&P 500 +0.04% ; Nasdaq +0.02% .

UpOnly NFT originated from the podcast show “UpOnly” hosted by Cobie, along with Ledger. The show invites top traders, project founders, fund managers, to discuss crypto trends. However, the program stalled roughly three years ago, following the FTX collapse in 2022 and the subsequent crypto winter. ‘When NFT is Burnt, Podcast Will Restart’: Cobie In May 2025, Cobie created a challenge that if someone burns the NFT, the program would return for another season. “OK I am no longer the decision maker on if UpOnly returns,” Cobie wrote in May. “The power is now stored within this NFT that I just minted. When the NFT is burned, the podcast will restart. Until then, please leave me alone.” OK I am no longer the decision maker on if Up Only returns. The power is now stored within this NFT that I just minted. When the NFT is burned, the podcast will restart. Until then, please leave me alone. https://t.co/5Mar75ifw6 — Cobie (@cobie) May 7, 2025 The offer however limited sponsorship rights or editorial control. Given the high dollar-amount set on the NFT, Cobie said at the time, “You couldn’t set a dollar amount on OpenSea so I just kept adding 0s till the number seemed too big for anyone to buy even as a joke.” On Tuesday, not only did Coinbase purchase UpOnly’s NFT, but it apparently overpaid the asking price of the non-fungible token . Soon after the Coinbase’s purchase, Jordan Fish, aka Cobie, conveyed his disbelief quite concisely . UpOnly Podcast Returns With ‘Eight Episodes’ According to the NFT fine print , the holder of the token “can compel Cobie and Ledger Status into performing, like monkeys, 8 episodes of UpOnlyTV.” “We are allowed to call you idiots for buying it, or ignore you completely with zero mentions of your existence during our 8-episode season,” the NFT description read. In a separate post on X, Cobie joked, “Im too old to have a crypto podcast imma be out here looking like Gary V.” “It has been 3 years since up only ended. I was in my 20s when it started, now I have grey hair. We will rename it Unc Only and I will spend $25m on cosmetic surgery. See ya soon.” It has been 3 years since up only ended.

Takaichi-san secured 237 votes out of 465 seats in the Lower House, a clean win that removed the need for any runoff. The victory followed a coalition agreement between the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Japan Innovation Party (JIP), finalized over the weekend. Under the deal, Takaichi will support several JIP-backed policies, including cutting the number of parliamentary seats, introducing free high school education, and enforcing a two-year suspension on the food consumption tax, according to a report from Reuters. Asian markets react to Takaichi’s leadership win The reaction on Tuesday morning was immediate. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.5% to reach a new all-time high, while the Topix index added 0.73%, both recording fresh records after Monday’s historic close. Market optimism spread quickly through the Asia-Pacific region, where traders followed the upward cues from Wall Street overnight. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index climbed by 1.17%, and the Hang Seng Tech Index advanced by 1.84%. Mainland China’s CSI 300 also surged by 0.3%, extending gains from the previous session. The U.S. tech rally, led by Apple’s stock surge, helped set the tone for the region’s trading day. In South Korea, markets stayed on an upward streak after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that Washington was “about to finish up” trade talks with Seoul. “The devil’s in the details, but we are ironing out the details,” Scott said during his interview. The comment lifted confidence across South Korean equities, with the Kospi index up roughly 61% year-to-date. Hyundai Motor shares climbed 6.45%, Kia Corp gained 4.28%, and Samsung Electronics added 1.73% by the end of trading. BOJ stance, global commodities, and U.S. earnings in focus A known conservative, Takaichi has often been described as a follower of Abenomics, the late Shinzo Abe’s signature economic model focused on easy money policies, fiscal expansion, and structural reforms. During the 2024 LDP leadership race, Takaichi-san criticized the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) plan to raise interest rates. Meanwhile, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda maintained that monetary policy would continue to be decided “without any preconceptions.” The yen got a slight boost, but it was mostly after BOJ board member Hajime Takata, who voted against keeping rates steady in September, reiterated his support for resuming hikes. The US dollar strengthened 0.08% to 150.710 yen, while the euro slipped 0.06% to $1.164. On the commodities front, spot gold dipped by 0.3% to $4,340.99 per ounce by 04:56 GMT, after touching a record $4,381.21 the day before. U.S. gold futures stayed flat at $4,357.80, while silver fell 1.2% to $51.83, platinum eased by 0.7% to $1,627.53, and palladium ticked up by 0.1% to $1,497.62. In the United States, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 33 points, less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures stayed slightly positive. Investors were preparing for a heavy week of corporate earnings, with Netflix and Coca-Cola set to release results on Tuesday, followed by Tesla on Wednesday. Analysts at Bank of America have said that around 75% of S&P 500 firms reporting so far had beaten earnings forecasts. The AI-driven momentum remained strong, with the “Magnificent 7” tech giants — including Apple , Microsoft, and others — expected to post 14.9% year-over-year profit growth, compared to 6.7% for the rest of the index, according to FactSet.

SOL price is now consolidating losses below $200 and might decline further below $182. SOL price started a fresh decline below $212 and $200 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a key rising channel with support at $188 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start another increase if the bulls defend $182 or $175. Solana Price Dips Again Solana price extended gains above $200 and $202, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL even surpassed $210 before the bears appeared. A high was formed near $208 and the price dropped. There was a move below $200 and $182. A low was formed at $174, and the price recently attempted a minor recovery wave. It climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $208 swing high to the $174 low. However, the bears remained active below $195. They protected the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $208 swing high to the $174 low. SOL is again moving below $190. Besides, there was a break below a key rising channel with support at $188 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading below $188 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $188 level. The next major resistance is near the $195 level. The main resistance could be $200. A successful close above the $200 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $208. Any more gains might send the price toward the $215 level. Downside Continuation In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $195 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $182 zone. The first major support is near the $175 level. A break below the $175 level might send the price toward the $165 support zone. If there is a close below the $165 support, the price could decline toward the $150 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is below the 50 level.

This uptick is part of its ongoing pre-launch activities that started on April 1, aiming at ramping up community support and securing adequate funds before its official launch. The Ascend of Husky Inu HINU's pricing strategy seems to be effectively engaging early investors, with the token's price being adjusted upwards every two days. This dynamic approach towards pricing has been crucial in reaching significant fundraising milestones, with the project successfully accumulating $903,126 towards a goal of $1.2 million. Significant Milestones and Future Plans Building up to its anticipated launch, Husky Inu has been setting funding milestones, each a testament to its growing investor confidence and community support. Notable milestones such as the $750,000 mark on May 16 and the $900,000 level earlier this month highlight the project's progressive financial backing. The continual financial achievements underscore the community's trust and the developers' dedication. With the official launch projected for March 27, 2026, the project team is also open to potentially moving the date forward, contingent on forthcoming strategic reviews and market conditions. These reviews aim to optimize the launch timing, ensuring it aligns with market readiness and investor interest. The upcoming review on January 1, 2026, will be particularly crucial in this planning phase. Wider Cryptocurrency Market Trends The broader cryptocurrency market has mirrored the enthusiasm around Husky Inu, with major currencies posting gains. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, has seen a nearly 3% increase, trading around $110,291. Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL) have also seen upward movements, contributing to a bullish market environment this week.

Japan Considering Allowing Banks To Offer Crypto-Related Services As reported by Japanese newspaper Yomiuri, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is considering allowing banks to acquire and hold digital assets like Bitcoin for investment purposes. This reform, if enacted, would change the banking landscape in the East Asian nation. Currently, banks are prohibited from making cryptocurrency acquisitions for the purpose of investments under FSA guidelines introduced in 2020. Under the new regulation, banks would be able to trade Bitcoin and other digital assets in a similar way to stocks and government bonds. There would also be certain safeguards to ensure the institutions’ financial stability. This isn’t the only rule change the FSA is looking at. According to the report, the regulator is also discussing permitting banking groups to register as “crypto exchange operators.” As these exchange operators, they will be able to offer digital asset trading and exchange services directly to customers. The intent behind the move is to make it easier for retail investors to participate in the cryptocurrency sector through institutions that are well-regulated and highly credible. The reform will be taken up in the next working group meeting of the Financial System Council, a government advisory panel under the Prime Minister. Whether the rule change will ultimately come to pass remains to be seen. In some other news, Beijing has put a roadblock on Hong Kong’s stablecoin plans, according to the Financial Times . Hong Kong launched its stablecoin legislature earlier this year, making it so that institutions seeking to issue fiat-tied cryptocurrencies in the region have to obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Several high profile names like Ant Group and JD.com had lined up to register with HKMA, with the first batch of licenses expected to arrive next year. It seems, however, that the tech giants have now put their plans on ice after Chinese regulators urged them not to move ahead, raising concerns about the rise of currencies controlled by the private sector. While China continues to be cautious about stablecoins, the rest of the world has been moving forward in adoption of these digital assets, including other Asian countries. According to a Friday report , three major Japanese banks are preparing to issue a yen-backed token before the end of the year. Separately, an earlier report from August noted that four major South Korean financial institutions were in talks with Tether and Circle, the issuers of the two largest stablecoins, USDT and USDC. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin has seen a jump of around 3% over the past day, recovering back above the $110,600 mark.

However, some analysts have advised caution as BTC’s next leg up could be delayed until December. Related Reading: XRP DEX Volumes Surge As Price Plunges: Smart Money Accumulating? Bitcoin To Move Sideways Until December? After the end-of-week market downturn, Bitcoin has bounced to the $110,000 level and is attempting to turn this area into support again. Notably, the flagship crypto has been trading within the $108,000-$120,000 price range since July. Last week, BTC recorded its second drop below the range lows, falling to the $103,500 mark on Friday. Over the weekend, the cryptocurrency’s price stabilized and reclaimed the $106,000-$108,000 area. Now, Bitcoin has recovered 6.2% from the recent lows and could potentially target higher levels in the short term. Analyst Crypto Kaleo pointed out that BTC’s multi-year ascending trendline has held as support despite the recent retest and overall sentiment turning bearish, suggesting that investors should “be more bullish.” Similarly, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted that despite the current market sentiment, which shows the Fear and Greed index remains at fear levels, the flagship crypto is “still perfectly holding that flipped resistance level,” around $108,000, and is holding it as support. “Not sure if this is the place to turn bearish. Support is support, until it is not,” the analyst affirmed. Altcoin Sherpa also shared a positive outlook, emphasizing that BTC’s chart doesn’t look “that bad when you zoom out,” as it remains in the same multi-month price range and could challenge the $114,000-$115,000 area. Nonetheless, the analyst cautioned that it may be “too early to really call any sort of bullish reversal,” forecasting that the cryptocurrency will likely see “a ton of chop over the next 6-8 weeks, and we range between 100k-115k and hopefully have a nice December.” $114,000-$116,000 Area Remains Key Rekt Capital stated that as long as the price holds the current levels, it could move to the $114,000 area for a key trend continuation across its range and potentially revisit the highs. To achieve this, the analyst explained that Bitcoin must reclaim its 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as support, which was lost after Sunday’s close below the $110,000 mark. The 21-week EMA has served as support during pullbacks since late Q2. He explained that the cycle has been one of downside deviations, with price weekly closing below key levels and positioning for a bearish retest before successfully reclaiming these levels as support and rallying higher. Based on this, “it’s not a given that price will reject from the 21-week EMA.” The analyst also shared an outlook for BTC’s range in the monthly timeframe, where it has been consolidating while upside wicking beyond the range high and downside wicking below the range low since July. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Moves: Can It Repeat The 36,000% Rally ‘Anomaly’ From Last Cycle? “As part of this consolidation, there is a potential Lower High developing which isn’t yet solidified; the upcoming Monthly Close will inform more about whether that indeed will become a resistance,” he detailed Rekt Capital concluded that a monthly close above the Lower High would invalidate the potential setup, and a close above the range high resistance would position Bitcoin for a range breakout, “especially if a November post-breakout retest of $116k into new support takes place.” As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $110,850, a 2% increase in the daily timeframe.

The company scooped up $250 million in ETH from Bitgo and Kraken on Monday, according to Arkham Intelligence which said “These accounts match Bitmine’s prior acquisition pattern.” “Will Tom Lee ever stop buying?” 3.2 Million ETH Holdings The wallets purchased 63,538 ETH this week and a whopping 379,271 ETH last week. This brings the total to 442,809 ETH worth around $1.74 billion at current prices purchased since the market crash. This aggressive dip buying , which Bitcoin treasurys have not replicated, has pushed BitMine’s total to around 3.17 million ETH, but the company has yet to confirm the most recent purchases officially. This would give it around 2.6% of the entire supply of the asset, and over 50% towards its target of 5%. From 163,000 ETH to 3.24 MILLION ETH in just 3 months. Bitmine’s accumulation is historic, week after week, they’ve been loading the bags nonstop: July 14 — 163K Aug 10 — 1.15M Sept 14 — 2.15M Oct 19 — 3.24M At this pace, they’re on track to control 5% of all $ETH in… pic.twitter.com/skfLh9vQAi — BMNR Bullz (@BMNRBullz) October 20, 2025 BitMine chairman Tom Lee is confident that this is not the top of the crypto cycle. “So I think we’re at the basement and working our way back up,” he told CNBC on Friday. Lee has also recently stated that BitMine is preparing to roll out its own Ethereum staking solution very soon. Coinbase is also bullish about fourth quarter momentum for crypto markets and the influence of digital asset treasurys (DATs). “Looking at the supply/demand picture, it’s hard to overstate the impact that digital asset treasury companies have had on markets this year,” wrote David Duong, head of research at Coinbase Institutional, in a recent research paper. Ether Prices Retreat The same crypto market pattern has playing out daily: Asia pumps markets with buying, and America dumps with selling, preventing any sustained upward momentum. As a result, Ether prices have fallen back below $4,000 again. ETH hit an intraday high of $4,080 in early trading on Monday, but sustained selling pressure on the US timezone pushed it back down to $3,940 where it currently trades. The asset has only seen a marginal recovery from its double dip in October and needs to clear $4,000, and stay above it, to see any real progress. Ethereum’s weekly chart is “loading a monster move” with a double retest of the exponential moving average, observed analyst ‘Merlijn the Trader” who added that it pumped 70% last time this was seen.

Here’s the Destination,https://timestabloid.com/chris-larsen-stuns-xrp-army-with-50m-xrp-transfer-heres-the-destination/,"A sudden transfer of 50 million XRP, valued at roughly $123.8 million, from Ripple executive Chris Larsen to an unidentified wallet prompted strong reactions within the XRP community. While such wallet movements are not uncommon in the digital asset space, this particular transaction led to fresh speculation about potential coordination between Ripple and U.S. regulatory entities. Crypto Expert Weighs In Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX), a well-known community commentator, shared his perspective shortly after Whale Alert reported the whopping transaction. He suggested that the transfer might signal deeper activity behind the scenes, outlining two main possibilities. One involved the idea that Ripple and the U.S. government could be working together during the shutdown period to finalize certain projects. The other centered on the belief that spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to XRP might be approved unexpectedly through procedural “loopholes.” He linked the timing of the movement to what he described as a potential effort between Ripple and government entities, suggesting that the shutdown could be a strategic window for progress on regulatory or market initiatives. Why Did Larsen Transfer 50 Million XRP? Shortly afterward, Larsen provided context for the wallet movement. In a post on X, he congratulated the Evernorth team on its launch and revealed that he invested 50 million XRP in the firm. He described Evernorth as filling “the missing link in XRP capital markets” and expanding the token’s use in decentralized finance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Evernorth positions itself as a platform dedicated to building infrastructure that connects XRP liquidity with decentralized finance applications. The firm, designed to operate as a public XRP treasury, has announced plans to go public through a merger expected to raise over $1 billion in gross proceeds . It aims to develop products that make it easier for institutions and developers to integrate XRP into lending, trading, and other DeFi mechanisms. Larsen’s 50 million XRP investment represents one of the largest individual contributions toward that goal, reflecting Ripple leadership’s continued commitment to expanding XRP’s role within decentralized finance . Remi Relief later released an update confirming that the tokens had been sent to Evernorth. However, he maintained that his earlier statements about potential government cooperation and ETF approvals still stood. He argued that even though the funds went toward a legitimate investment, the timing and conditions surrounding the movement kept his original theories relevant.

The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has started the week in positive territory, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and other cryptocurrencies trading in the green. Husky Inu (HINU) Rises To $0.00021673 Husky Inu (HINU) completed the latest price jump of its per-launch phase over the weekend, rising from $0.00021610 to $0.00021673. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, and has seen regular price increases. It aims to empower the Husky Inu community and continue its fundraising efforts as the launch date approaches. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to increase the HINU token’s value every two days. This has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross key fundraising milestones. It has also helped Husky Inu raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community, rewarding early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth. Husky Inu has also crossed the $900,000 fundraising milestone and has raised $903,126 so far. The project remains on track to reach its fundraising goal of $1.2 million as its official launch date approaches. Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 earlier this month. Official Launch Date Husky Inu has experienced remarkable growth and interest over its presale and pre-launch phases. The community has grown in strength and numbers, thanks to the dedication and enthusiasm of each member. The project’s official launch date, March 27, 2026, is just over six months away. Our goal has always been long-term growth and success, not short-term hype. However, the possibility of an earlier launch is open. The Husky Inu team will conduct a series of strategic meetings to assess market conditions and determine the optimal time to launch the project. The first two reviews were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025. The third review is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Cryptocurrency Market Starts New Week In Positive Territory Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has started the week positively. Bitcoin (BTC) is up almost 3%, trading around $110,291, while Ethereum (ETH) has reclaimed the $4,000 mark, trading around $4,038. Ripple (XRP) is up over 3%, and Solana (SOL) is up 2.57%, trading around $191. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 5%, while Cardano (ADA) is up 4.54%, trading around $0.663.

Andrew Cuomo Promises Crypto Reforms If Elected To Office New York City mayoral hopeful Andrew Cuomo plans to win over residents by promising to make the city the “global hub of the future.” Cuomo also plans to appoint a chief innovation officer (CIO) to lead efforts if elected as mayor. The mayoral hopeful outlined several emerging technologies, including cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and biotech, as key pillars for his run. Cuomo stated, “The next Mayor must make sure we’re also leading in the technologies that will define the next century — AI, blockchain, and biotech. That’s what this position is about: Keeping New York City not just competitive, but dominant in the global innovation economy.” Cuomo also plans to form an “innovation council” that will advise the CIO on policy development, industry standards, and consumer protection. The council will consist of three advisory committees, one for each of the focus areas. The crypto and blockchain advisory council will replace outdated regulations with an up-to-date framework promoting innovation while protecting consumer interests. Arthur Hayes Looking To Raise $250M For New Fund Maelstrom, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes’ family office, is seeking $250 million for a new fund that will look to acquire buyouts of distressed or undervalued crypto infrastructure and services companies. The fund will look to acquire equity stakes in trading and data analytics platforms, and will complete the deals through special purpose vehicles. According to sources, Maelstrom will assign between $40 million and $75 million towards each acquisition. Akshat Vaidya, Maelstrom’s co-founder and managing partner, stated that the fund will acquire crypto platforms that have strong fundamentals, clear valuations, and income-generating models. Strategy Can Convert Capital Into Bitcoin (BTC) In Hours: Michael Saylor Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has said that Bitcoin treasury companies like Strategy can turn fresh capital into BTC almost instantly. Saylor also posted a fresh teaser about another BTC purchase on Sunday. The Strategy executive chairman stated during an interview, “The investment cycle is a thousand times faster than technology, real estate, oil and gas, or anything else you’ve ever seen before in your life. Sometimes we’re literally selling 50 million an hour or 100 million an hour and buying the $100 million of Bitcoin the same hour. Like we could do a billion dollars of capital raising in a day, and we might have 20 million of exposure at 4 pm, and by 5 pm, 6 pm, we’re fully done.” Strategy is preparing to buy more BTC even as treasury companies face growing pressure after a sharp drop in net asset value (NAV). Strategy’s BTC purchases are often viewed as a bullish catalyst for the asset. Strategy is the largest corporate holder of BTC, with 640,250 BTC after its latest purchase on October 13. According to Saylor, Strategy can accumulate BTC and provide a return for investors far quicker than other avenues. “You can essentially sell it before you build. We’re literally building it in real time. We’re open for business every day with four credit ATMs. If someone hit the bid and wanted to buy $500 million in a minute, we could build a building in a minute. In 60 seconds. Trade is done. Cash changes hands. We create the collateral. We bought the Bitcoin underlying that day.” President Trump Confirms Meeting With Xi Jinping US President Donald Trump has confirmed he will be meeting Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Seoul, South Korea. Trump had previously stated he would not be meeting the Chinese president following a dramatic escalation in trade tensions between the US and China. “We're going to meet in a couple of weeks. We're going to meet in South Korea, with President Xi and other people, too. [Xi Jinping] is a very strong leader, a very amazing man. You can look at what he's done, where he is in his life. It is an amazing story. It's a story for a great movie. I think we're gonna be fine with China, but we have to have a fair deal. It's going to be fair.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week on a bullish note, up over 2%. The flagship cryptocurrency has reclaimed the $111,000 level and is trading around $111,088. BTC steadied itself over the weekend after enduring almost two weeks of selling pressure, rising 0.70% on Saturday and 1.37% on Sunday to settle at 108,676. However, the Crypto Fear& Greed index remains in “fear” territory. Data from Coinglass revealed that one of the biggest reasons behind the market rebound is confirmation that senior Chinese officials will be meeting with representatives from the US to resolve trade issues ahead of the APEC summit in South Korea. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the developments. The news comes as a relief for traders and investors. The US and China witnessed a dramatic escalation in trade tensions, sparking fears of another round of trade tariffs. China recently stated it would restrict exports of rare earth minerals to the US, a move that could potentially disrupt key sectors. It also hinted at retaliation against any new tariffs, adding that it no longer relies on American chips. Analysts believe several near-term catalysts are driving the recovery. The Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting is set for October 28-29, with investors anticipating a 25 bps rate cut. Lower interest rates typically weaken the dollar and support risk assets like BTC. New spot ETF filings have also buoyed investor sentiment, helping price recovery. Analysts believe approval of the ETF proposals of the XRP and Solana ETFs could boost institutional capital and further strengthen the market. However, some analysts fear the rally could be a dead-cat bounce, where prices bounce back temporarily before resuming the downtrend. BTC trader Daan Crypto Trades believes there is more volatility to come, stating, “Volatility is definitely high here due to the thin books post this massive market flush. Books are thin. Especially after the massive liquidation event last week. This, combined with weekend price action and a lot of emotional traders, makes for relatively volatile moves on low timeframes.” BTC and the broader crypto market crashed last Friday (October 10), after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls for software. The announcement was made in retaliation for China's imposition of restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. As a result, BTC plunged to $102,000 on Binance before recovering and settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 2% to $110,768. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, markets recovered on Sunday as BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. Source: TradingView The price faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday, ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $115,274. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $109,945. It recovered from this level to reclaim $113,000 and settle at $113,068, ultimately dropping 1.91%. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 2% to $110,804. Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday as BTC fell below $110,000 and settled at $108,198. The price plunged to a low of $103,516 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $106,463, ultimately dropping 1.60%. BTC rose on Saturday, rising 0.70% to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,208. Buyers retained control on Sunday as the price rose over 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,676. BTC has reclaimed $111,000 during the ongoing session and is trading around $111,060, up over 2%. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has started the week in bullish territory and has reclaimed the $4,000 level. The altcoin steadied itself over the weekend, rising 1.52% on Saturday and settling at 3,892. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rose over 2% and settled at $3,985. ETH is up 1.42% during the ongoing session, trading around $4,041. ETH’s recovery wave began on Saturday after the altcoin plunged to a low of $3,680 on Friday, forming a low around this level. The altcoin is facing resistance around $4,050, with the first major resistance sitting around $4,200. A clean break above these levels could send the price towards $4,500. On the other hand, if ETH fails to clear this level, it could begin a fresh downtrend that could drive the price towards $3,800 or lower. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs registered sharp outflows for the week ending Friday. Despite ETH’s price struggles last week, Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies, remains bullish about the asset. BitMine has accumulated a staggering $1.5 billion in ETH since the crash. The accumulation indicates BitMine and Lee’s conviction about ETH, despite Lee recently warning that the hype around digital asset treasuries (DAT) may be coming to an end. BitMine has made three major purchases since last Friday’s market crash, although the acquisitions are yet to be officially confirmed by the company. BitMine has established itself as the largest Ether treasury company, holding more than 3 million ETH, worth $11.7 billion. The company intends to hold 5% of ETH’s supply. Lee stated in a recent discussion with ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, “Ethereum could flip Bitcoin, similar to how Wall Street and equities flipped gold post 71.” Lee suggested that BTC and ETH could rise the same way the US Dollar rose to dominance in 1971 after President Nixon made it fully synthetic and no longer backed by gold. “When that happened, the immediate beneficiary was demand and a market to own gold. However, in response, Wall Street created products that made the dollar dominant, and the market cap of equities today is 40 trillion compared to 2 trillion for gold. Dollar dominance by the end of that period went from 27% in GDP terms to 57% of central bank reserves, and 80% of financial transactions, quotes. Dollar dominance is going to be the opportunity for Ethereum.” ETH plunged to an intraday low of $3,444 on Friday (October 10) after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese imports and export controls on key software. It recovered from this level to settle at $3,836, ultimately dropping over 12%. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the fell 2.21% to $3,752. ETH recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 11% to reclaim $4,000 and settle at $4,158. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose over 2% and settled at $4,224.

ETH has reclaimed the $4,000 mark during the ongoing session and is trading around $4,051. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) recovered over the weekend and is looking to reclaim the $200 mark after starting the week in positive territory. SOL is trading in an ascending channel, with steady accumulation around the $190 mark. According to analysts, the setup shows that each retest of the price’s lower levels is being met with strong buyer reaction, indicating that bulls are defending key support levels. The weekend recovery suggests that momentum could be returning, and a possible breakout towards $220 is possible if SOL reclaims $200. Analysts also pointed out that SOL’s current structure aligns with previous accumulation phases, generally seen before major rallies. They also point out that as long as SOL maintains its position above $180, the setup favors a continuation within the rising channel. “Everyone’s watching Bitcoin, but Solana might be the next big breakout story. It’s coiling inside a tight ascending channel, now absorbing supply near $190. Each retest of the lower trendline has found buyers faster, not slower. If this is an accumulation pattern, the next leg could be 50% higher.” SOL started the previous weekend deep in bearish territory as markets crashed. As a result, the price tanked to an intraday low of $170 before settling at $188, ultimately dropping over 14%. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell almost 6% to $177. SOL made a strong recovery on Sunday, rising nearly 11% and settling at $197. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, rising almost 6% to reclaim $200 and settle at $208.

This resurgence is led by major players in the space, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) , both showing robust performances over the weekend. Market Dynamics and Major Cryptocurrencies' Performance Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, trading between $107,000 and $108,000 over the weekend, finally closing at a strong $108,676 on Sunday. The premier cryptocurrency has continued its upward trajectory, currently trading around $110,731. This represents a more than 4% increase during the ongoing session. Ethereum, on the other hand, has successfully reclaimed the $4,000 mark, registering nearly a 5% increase with its current price hovering around $4,058. Other cryptocurrencies like Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) have also posted gains of 5% and 4%, respectively. Notably, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) have seen an increase of over 7%, while other altcoins like Chainlink (LINK) and Stellar (XLM) are not far behind, recording 11% and 6% increases respectively. Amidst this upward momentum, various altcoins including Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , Toncoin (TON) , and Polkadot (DOT) have also seen substantial gains.

However, market sentiment remains cautious, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index still in “Fear” territory at 30. Bitcoin Profit Taking Keeping Prices Subdued Analysts believe Bitcoin’s price action will remain subdued until long-term holders take profits. According to analyst James Check, the crypto market’s failure to recover was due to selling pressure, not manipulation, paper Bitcoin, or suppression. According to Check, the volume of sell-side pressure from Bitcoin holders is the source of resistance at the moment. According to crypto investor Will Clemente, the last year of relative weakness for the flagship cryptocurrency has largely been due to a supply transfer from Bitcoin OGs to traditional finance. “This dynamic will be mostly irrelevant in the coming years, just as everyone is focused on BTC’s relative weakness.” Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz echoed the same sentiment in an interview with Raoul Pal, stating, “There are a lot of people in the Bitcoin world who had rode this so long and finally decided, ‘I wanna buy something. People trimming because they’ve had a great run and we’re just digesting that turnover.” Meanwhile, BTC held on to a key level between $108,000 and $109,000, with analyst Rekt Capital stating, “Continued holding here could see the price rally to $120k+ over time. Stability here is absolutely key.” Strategy Can Convert Capital Into Bitcoin (BTC) In Hours: Michael Saylor Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has said that Bitcoin treasury companies like Strategy can turn fresh capital into BTC almost instantly. Saylor also posted a fresh teaser about another BTC purchase on Sunday. The Strategy executive chairman stated during an interview, “The investment cycle is a thousand times faster than technology, real estate, oil and gas, or anything else you’ve ever seen before in your life. Sometimes we’re literally selling 50 million an hour or 100 million an hour and buying the $100 million of Bitcoin the same hour. Like we could do a billion dollars of capital raising in a day, and we might have 20 million of exposure at 4 pm, and by 5 pm, 6 pm, we’re fully done.” Strategy is preparing to buy more BTC even as treasury companies face growing pressure after a sharp drop in net asset value (NAV). Strategy’s BTC purchases are often viewed as a bullish catalyst for the asset. Strategy is the largest corporate holder of BTC , with 640,250 BTC after its latest purchase on October 13. According to Saylor, Strategy can accumulate BTC and provide a return for investors far quicker than other avenues. “You can essentially sell it before you build. We’re literally building it in real time. We’re open for business every day with four credit ATMs. If someone hit the bid and wanted to buy $500 million in a minute, we could build a building in a minute. In 60 seconds. Trade is done. Cash changes hands. We create the collateral. We bought the Bitcoin underlying that day.” Most Institutions Retain Positive Bitcoin Outlook A survey by Coinbase has revealed that almost two-thirds of institutional investors retain a positive outlook for Bitcoin. David Duong, head of research at Coinbase Institutional, stated in a research report that most respondents are bullish about Bitcoin over the next few months. The institutional investor survey had 124 respondents, with 67% reporting a positive outlook. Duong also added that Bitcoin treasury companies were buying the dip, stating, “Looking at the supply/demand picture, it’s hard to overstate the impact that digital asset treasury companies have had on markets this year.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has made a strong start to the week and has reclaimed the $110,000 level. The flagship cryptocurrency fell to an intraday low of $103,516 on Friday but recovered over the weekend, rising 0.70% on Saturday and 1.37% on Sunday to settle at $108,676. The price is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $110,697. Selling pressure eased over the weekend, allowing BTC to recover. However, analysts expect markets to remain volatile, and investors will be cautious ahead of the FOMC meeting. Daan Crypto Trades stated in a post on X, “Volatility is definitely high here due to the thin books post this massive market flush. Books are thin. Especially after the massive liquidation event last week. This combined with weekend price action and a lot of emotional traders makes for relatively volatile moves on low timeframes.” Meanwhile, data from CoinGlass put liquidations over the past 24 hours at over $200 million. One of the biggest reasons behind the market rebound is confirmation that senior Chinese officials will be meeting with representatives from the US to resolve trade issues ahead of the APEC summit in South Korea. Analysts believe several near-term catalysts are driving the recovery. The Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting is set for October 28-29, with investors anticipating a 25 bps rate cut. Lower interest rates typically weaken the dollar and support risk assets like BTC . New spot ETF filings have also buoyed investor sentiment, helping price recovery. Analysts believe approval of the ETF proposals of the XRP and Solana ETFs could boost institutional capital and further strengthen the market. BTC and the broader crypto market crashed last Friday (October 10), after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls for software. The announcement was made in retaliation for China's imposition of restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. As a result, BTC plunged to $102,000 on Binance before recovering and settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 2% to $110,768. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, markets recovered on Sunday as BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067.

Data from Onchain Lens , which cited Hyperbot, shows the trader now holds 900 BTC in short positions valued at roughly $99.6m. The trade, placed with 10x leverage, is currently showing an unrealized or “floating” loss of about $1.1m.

Earlier this week, he deposited $30m in USDC to Hyperliquid before opening a Bitcoin short worth $76m . Just days earlier, he expanded his exposure again as Bitcoin attempted to recover from last week’s crash. Blockchain data suggests the same wallet entered around $115,783, bringing his total short exposure to 3,440 BTC valued at $392.6m at the time. Those positions briefly yielded about $5.7m in unrealized profit before prices rebounded. His latest $22m expansion signals that the trader expects further downside despite the recent stabilization in Bitcoin markets. The timing has drawn attention across crypto circles, with many traders speculating that the investor is positioning for another market correction. Reputation Built On Sharp Timing As Whale Profited From Bitcoin Downturns Linked To News Events The wallet first gained fame after reportedly earning $160m by shorting Bitcoin shortly before US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement triggered a sell-off. That timing led online communities to label the account the “Trump insider,” a name that has stuck through several high-profile trades. While the trader’s strategy has so far proved opportunistic, it remains uncertain whether this new bearish bet will pay off. Bitcoin’s funding rates have turned negative in recent sessions, suggesting growing caution in futures markets. Two Expected Fed Rate Cuts Could Unlock Trillions In Cash Sitting On The Sidelines At the same time, sentiment among institutional investors is turning more optimistic. A recent Coinbase Institutional report found that 67% of professional investors expect a major Bitcoin rally in the next three to six months. That optimism comes as central banks are widely expected to ease monetary policy. Coinbase forecasts two more rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve this quarter, a move that could release some of the $7 trillion currently parked in money market funds. However, uncertainty remains. Both institutional and retail investors view the macroeconomic environment as the biggest near-term risk for digital assets. Market observers say this mix of optimism and caution could fuel higher volatility as Bitcoin hovers near key technical levels. For now, the “Trump insider” appears to be betting that the next major move will be down, and that the market has yet to price in the pressure ahead fully.

According to data from @DefiLlama, the platform logged $1.1 billion in 24-hour volume, $9.7 billion over the past week, and a massive $34 billion in 30 days, surpassing established giants like Meteora, Raydium, and Pump. That makes HumidiFi not just a rising player, but the largest DEX on Solana. The Silent Giant of Solana DeFi HumidiFi operates differently. It has no public frontend. Trades are executed privately through aggregators using a quoting model that conceals order details. In other words, it runs as a “dark pool”, a private liquidity venue where large orders can be executed without revealing size, price, or direction. While this structure keeps it largely out of public sight, it has made HumidiFi the preferred choice for whales, market makers, and professional traders who value execution quality and privacy over transparency. This quiet dominance has shifted the narrative of Solana DeFi. It’s no longer just about open liquidity pools, it’s about efficient execution behind the curtain. Dark Pools: Solana’s New Trend A new wave is forming across Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. Dark pool AMMs, or “private automated market makers”, are capturing an increasing share of the chain’s total trading activity. Data from Blockworks Research shows that last week alone, Solana’s dark AMMs processed over $6 billion, accounting for nearly 30% of all on-chain trading. HumidiFi led the charge, handling $3 billion of that total, roughly 15% of all Solana trading volume. This marks a major cultural shift: from full transparency to trade efficiency and privacy. For traders, that’s a significant evolution. In traditional AMMs, every order is public, visible to bots and front-runners, exposing traders to slippage and copy-trading risks. Dark pools solve that by hiding trade details until execution, giving large traders an edge. What Makes HumidiFi Different HumidiFi isn’t your typical DEX. It’s a proprietary AMM (prop AMM), meaning it operates with its own liquidity model and execution logic. Rather than listing tokens on an open interface, it routes liquidity through aggregators like Jupiter and Meteora’s vaults. Users may not even realize they’re executing through HumidiFi when swapping tokens, yet it’s often HumidiFi handling the trade in the background. This stealth-like model gives the platform an edge in speed, liquidity depth, and anonymity. By removing a public-facing interface, HumidiFi avoids the pitfalls of heavy traffic, front-end exploits, and MEV (miner extractable value) attacks that plague public DEXs. Instead, it serves as the invisible engine behind Solana’s largest trades. Why Traders Are Moving to the Dark Side Traders are not just chasing hype, they’re chasing results. Large players, or “whales,” often face slippage when executing million-dollar orders on public DEXs. Their transactions can move the market before they’re even complete. HumidiFi fixes this by executing orders privately, protecting them from copycats and frontrunners. For professional trading firms, that’s gold. It ensures better execution quality, lower price impact, and greater control over strategy visibility. It’s not just whales either. Even mid-level DeFi users are starting to favor private AMMs for their smoother experience and lower volatility exposure. The Numbers Tell the Story The growth curve is steep. From zero visibility six months ago to $34 billion in monthly trading volume, HumidiFi’s rise is unprecedented. According to @DefiLlama, that’s higher than Raydium’s $29B, Meteora’s $22B, and Pump’s $16B during the same period. Meanwhile, HumidiFi’s daily average exceeds $1B, a level that places it not only ahead on Solana but competitive with smaller Ethereum-based DEXs. For context, major DEXs like Sushiswap and PancakeSwap fluctuate around similar daily volumes, proof that Solana’s dark liquidity model is maturing fast. The Trade-Off: Privacy vs Transparency But this new model comes with trade-offs. While dark pools improve efficiency, they reduce visibility. Without a public order book, there’s less insight into where liquidity sits or how trades are being routed. That raises questions about centralization and oversight. Who controls these private AMMs? Who verifies fair pricing? Aggregators like Jupiter have attempted to balance this with audits and integration frameworks. Still, not all players are known. Anonymous operators like ZeroFi and GoonFi remain unverified, sparking concerns within the Solana community about hidden influence and potential manipulation. Transparency is the cost of performance, and Solana’s DeFi scene is now testing where that balance lies. Community Reaction and On-Chain Buzz The reaction on X (formerly Twitter) has been loud, despite HumidiFi’s quiet approach. As noted by @SolanaFloor, HumidiFi’s dominance marks a defining moment for Solana’s DeFi market, where invisible protocols are driving visible volume.

HumidiFi Becomes Solana’s Largest DEX! @HumidiFi_ has overtaken all major Solana DEXs, logging $1.1B in 24h volume, $9.7B over 7 days and $34B in 30 days, surpassing Meteora, Raydium and Pump, according to @DefiLlama . Operating without a frontend and using private quoting,… pic.twitter.com/HhlOmALXeU — Crypto Miners (@CryptoMiners_Co) October 20, 2025 For many, HumidiFi’s rise proves that Solana’s ecosystem is maturing, catering to both retail traders and institutional-grade strategies. HumidiFi’s success is more than a leaderboard milestone. It reflects a deeper change in how DeFi participants think about trading. Solana’s speed and low fees already made it attractive to retail users. Now, with dark AMMs like HumidiFi, it’s becoming a magnet for sophisticated capital, the kind that once lived exclusively on centralized exchanges. As volumes rise and privacy tools expand, Solana could become the first blockchain to normalize private liquidity as a standard.

53444103,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=841002,1761029153,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53444103.jpeg,Reid Hoffman defends Anthropic amid feud with David Sacks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/reid-hoffman-anthropic-david-sacks/,"Two original members of the PayPal mafia, Reid Hoffman and David Sacks, are dragging their decades-old relationship into a public AI brawl. The dispute, which exploded on X on Monday, centers on Anthropic, a San Francisco-based AI company backed by Reid. David, who now serves as President Donald Trump’s handpicked AI and crypto czar, attacked the startup last week for what he described as regulatory fear tactics. Reid, who helped co-found LinkedIn and sits on Microsoft’s board, fired back hard. “Anthropic, along with some others (incl Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI) are trying to deploy AI the right way, thoughtfully, safely, and enormously beneficial for society,” Reid posted. “That’s why I am intensely rooting for their success.” Reid confirms stake in Anthropic and backs their AI approach Reid revealed that Greylock, the firm where he’s a partner, has also invested in Anthropic. That came on top of his previous early stake in OpenAI, making him one of the few tech insiders with money in both AI rivals. He said he usually avoids public commentary about the two companies but made an exception this time. “In all industries, especially in AI, it’s important to back the good guys,” Reid wrote in the same X thread. Reid has been sitting on Microsoft’s board since 2017, shortly after selling LinkedIn to the company for $26 billion. That same Microsoft now stands as OpenAI’s primary partner and funder, with its Azure infrastructure powering GPT models across sectors. Despite the conflict of interest, Reid still went out of his way to defend Anthropic, which was founded in 2021 by several OpenAI defectors who left over safety disagreements. The original rift between Reid and David has nothing to do with AI. It’s political. Both men were part of PayPal’s founding team back in 1999, along with Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Max Levchin, but have since landed on opposite ends of the political universe. Reid is one of the top Democratic donors in Silicon Valley. He gave millions to Kamala Harris’s failed presidential campaign. David, meanwhile, went full MAGA, hosted a Trump fundraiser at his San Francisco home, and now runs federal tech policy from inside the White House. Sacks accuses Anthropic of regulatory fear-mongering The flashpoint came last week, when Jack Clark, Anthropic’s policy chief and co-founder, published an essay titled “Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear.” The post argued for thoughtful guardrails in AI development. That’s when Sacks lashed out, saying Anthropic was “running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering.” He added that the company was “principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem.” Anthropic has opposed efforts by the Trump administration to block states from setting their own AI rules for 10 years. They’ve argued that state-level regulation is crucial for keeping AI systems safe and accountable. Sacks isn’t having it. On Monday, after Reid went public, Sacks responded: “The leading funder of lawfare and dirty tricks against President Trump wants you to know that ‘Anthropic is one of the good guys.’ Thanks for clarifying that. All we needed to know.” Elon Musk, who now runs his own AI firm, xAI, chimed in minutes later with one word: “Indeed.” Reid didn’t let that slide. “Shows you didn’t read the post (not shocked),” he wrote back. “When you are ready to have a professional conversation about AI’s impact on America, I’m here to chat.” Then Jason Calacanis, co-host of the All-In podcast with Sacks, invited Reid to come back on the show this week, writing, “Come on the pod.” Reid had been on before by the way, in August, right before the 2024 election. He replied that he was “open to coming back on” but “this week is packed.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Tech|Anthropic|Google|Greylock|LinkedIn|Microsoft|OpenAI|xAI,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-21 06:45:53

Schon gestern warnte er vor dem Widerstandsbereich um 112.000 US-Dollar und genau dort prallte Bitcoin jetzt erneut ab. Die Folge: eine deutliche rote Kerze nach unten. Der Trader sieht darin die Bestätigung, dass der aktuelle Abwärtstrend noch nicht vorbei ist. Während sich viele über den Rückschlag ärgern, bleibt Rover gelassen. Er hat seine Kaufzonen längst vorbereitet und wartet darauf, dass Bitcoin noch etwas tiefer fällt. Nach eigenen Angaben liegen rund 50 Millionen US-Dollar an Kauforders bereit, nicht nur für Bitcoin, sondern auch für Ethereum. Auch Blackrock ist am Verkaufen, Quelle: https://farside.co.uk/btc/ Auf dem Chart zeigt sich ein klassisches Muster: tiefere Hochs auf der Oberseite, höhere Tiefs auf der Unterseite, eine Phase der Kompression, wie sie typisch ist, bevor es zu einem großen Ausbruch kommt. Für Rover ist entscheidend, ob Bitcoin die Marke um 106.000 US-Dollar hält. Fällt der Kurs darunter, rechnet er mit einem deutlichen Rücksetzer in Richtung 100.000 US-Dollar. Sollte diese Zone halten, wäre ein erneuter Anstieg bis 112.000 US-Dollar denkbar. Zyklus schon am Ende? Er beobachtet außerdem die Liquiditätszonen im Markt. Viele Short-Positionen liegen offen, während oberhalb des Kurses noch ungenutzte Liquidität wartet. Das könnte kurzfristig zu einem Short Squeeze führen, wenn größere Player ihre Positionen absichern. Dennoch bleibt der Analyst vorsichtig. Auf Wochenbasis verliert der Markt an Momentum, und der MACD zeigt erste bärische Signale. Für Rover ein Hinweis, dass sich Bitcoin dem Ende seines Zyklus nähert. Der sogenannte „Bitcoin High-Cycle-Profit-Indikator“ deute ebenfalls darauf hin, dass die Rallye langsam ausläuft. Seine Einschätzung: kein sofortiger Crash, aber ein mögliches Ende der aktuellen Haussephase. Bitcoin könne in eine längere Seitwärtsphase oder sogar in eine mehrmonatige Korrektur übergehen. Trotzdem sieht Rover Chancen für einen letzten Anstieg, eine „Blow-off-Top“-Bewegung, bei der der Kurs ein letztes Hoch erreicht, bevor der Markt endgültig abkühlt. BITCOIN SHORT SQUEEZE INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/79FqIZiEOL — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) October 21, 2025 In dieser Phase plant er, aktiv zu werden. Sollte Bitcoin noch einmal in die Zone um 100.000 US-Dollar fallen, will Rover massiv kaufen. Erst wenn Panik den Markt erfasst, sieht er den idealen Zeitpunkt für neue Long-Positionen. Für ihn bleibt Geduld entscheidend. Auf kurzfristiger Basis ist er weiter neutral bis leicht bärisch, auf mittlere Sicht aber bereit für die nächste große Bewegung. Sein Fazit: Die Party ist noch nicht vorbei, aber das Licht wird langsam gedimmt. Trader sollten sich auf eine volatile Phase einstellen, in der schnelle Richtungswechsel die Regel sind. Ein Durchbruch unter die 100.000 US-Dollar-Marke könnte den Markt kurzfristig erschüttern, langfristig aber eine attraktive Kaufchance eröffnen. Als Alternative zu Bitcoin investieren derzeit aber schon viele in den Vorverkauf von Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). Schon über 24,4 Millionen US-Dollar wurden investiert, einer der größten Presale des Jahres 2025. Immer neue Updates, Quelle: https://bitcoinhyper.com/de/news Bitcoin Hyper als Alternative mit Zukunft Das Timing für die neue Layer 2 Blockchain könnte kaum besser sein: Am heutigen Dienstag hält die US-Notenbank ihre Konferenz zu Zahlungssystemen, bei der erstmals auch führende Köpfe der Kryptobranche teilnehmen, darunter Vertreter von Chainlink, Fireblocks, Coinbase und BlackRock. Viele Analysten sehen darin einen wichtigen Schritt hin zu einer engeren Verbindung zwischen klassischem Finanzsystem und Krypto-Sektor, was Bitcoin Hyper in die Karten spielen könnte. Das Projekt baut das erste High-Performance-Layer-2-Netzwerk für Bitcoin auf Basis der Solana Virtual Machine. Ziel ist es, Bitcoin nicht nur als Wertspeicher zu nutzen, sondern als aktiv einsetzbares Asset für DeFi-Anwendungen, Gaming und reale Vermögenswerte. Mit Transaktionsgeschwindigkeiten auf Solana-Niveau könnte Bitcoin Hyper eine völlig neue Nutzungsdimension eröffnen. Jeder übertragene BTC ist dabei durch echtes Bitcoin im Hauptnetz abgesichert, die Geschwindigkeit steigt, die Sicherheit bleibt. Der native Token HYPER treibt das Netzwerk an, deckt Gebühren, dient als Governance-Coin und kann mit einer dynamischen APY von 49 Prozent gestakt werden. Angesichts der aktuellen Marktunsicherheit sehen viele Investoren in HYPER eine Chance, indirekt von Bitcoin zu profitieren, über ein Projekt, das den Nutzen der größten Kryptowährung massiv erweitern will. Natürlich sind auch hier die Risiken eines Memecoins zu kalkulieren, schnell Anstiege bieten auch immer die Möglichkeit für schnelle Kursstürze. Wer früh dabei ist, kann dennoch günstiger als zum Listingpreis einkaufen. Die laufende Presale-Phase endet in Kürze, der Preis liegt aktuell bei 0,013145 US-Dollar pro Token. Wer an die Zukunft von Bitcoin im Anwendungsbereich glaubt, dürfte Bitcoin Hyper genau beobachten. Hier noch Bitcoin Hyper Presale Token kaufen. Hinweis: Investieren ist spekulativ.

The company said Travel Wallet will be its main card-issuing partner in South Korea and the two companies will launch a joint prepaid card for users to spend cash and crypto anywhere in the world. Crypto.com strengthens its reach in South Korea through Travel Wallet deal More than 8 million customers hold, exchange, and spend over 40 different currencies through Travel Wallet’s mobile app and card. Crypto.com will use this large user base and trusted payment network with its secure financial systems to create a smooth experience for users to exchange cash, crypto, and digital currencies on one platform. President and Chief Operating Officer of Crypto.com, Eric Anziani, said people in South Korea already use digital payments and are willing to try new financial technologies that make their lives easier. According to him, the country is the perfect place for Crypto.com to expand its services and build stronger connections with local users. The Chief Operating Officer said working with Travel Wallet will help his company make crypto payments faster, simpler, and more rewarding. He added that everyone should be able to access cryptocurrencies and joining forces with Travel Wallet will create a world where people can spend digital assets as freely as they spend regular money. Travel Wallet adds crypto features and stablecoin support for global users Travel Wallet will use the crypto-as-a-service (CaaS) technology by Crypto.com, so that users can trade digital assets directly on its mobile app. The company will also use its KRW-based stablecoin on both platforms to support cheaper and faster international transfers. Travel Wallet’s Chief Executive Officer, Kim Hyung-woo, said the partnership with crypto.com marks “the beginning of a new payment era where fintech finance meets blockchain finance.” He explained that the company wants to build one system that can hold and trade foreign currencies, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins at the same time. Kim said South Korea will benefit more from the partnership and his company will be able to create a more open and efficient financial space for millions of users worldwide. The CEO said his company wants people to use crypto for shopping, travel, or sending money to family abroad, just as easily as they do with cash. Crypto.com has been gaining popularity in South Korea apart from Travel Wallet. The company in fact said this month that it will serve as the APEC CEO Summit Korea 2025’s official crypto payments partner. The event is scheduled to be held in Gyeongju from Oct. 28-31, 2025, and the participation of global CEOs and top experts will be invited to share big ideas for AI, digital innovation and global economic growth.

Following its latest purchase, the firm’s total ETH holdings now stand 3.24 million tokens. BitMine Continues To Stack Ethereum Despite Crash According to a press release issued earlier today, BitMine Immersion Technologies, a leading Ethereum treasury firm has further increased its ETH holdings. The firm added another 203,800 ETH over the last week, worth approximately $820 million. Last week’s purchase has increased BitMine’s total ETH holdings to 3.24 million ETH, representing roughly 2.7% of the active circulating supply. In addition, the company holds 192 Bitcoin (BTC) and $219 in cash. The firm has $1.34 billion in combined crypto and cash holdings. BitMine’s frequent ETH purchases have propelled it as the leading public company in terms of ETH held on its balance sheet. Earlier this month, the firm had reported that its total ETH holdings had surpassed 3 million tokens. Commenting, Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine said: The crypto market saw one of its largest deleveraging events ever last week and this put downward pressure on ETH prices. Open interest for ETH sits at the same levels as seen on June 30th of this year. Given the expected Supercycle for ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward. We acquired 203,826 ETH tokens over the past week pushing our ETH holdings to 3.24 million, or 2.7% of the supply of ETH. We are now more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH. Lee added that he sees Ethereum as a “truly neutral” blockchain which is likely to witness growing institutional adoption. He added that BitMine remains committed to accumulating 5% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. Following today’s announcement, the NYSE-listed firm’s stock BMNR surged an impressive 7.76%, trading at $53.72 at the time of writing. The stock is up an astonishing 640.87% over the past six months. Is ETH Destined For A New High? As institutional adoption of Ethereum grows, analysts are predicting new all-time highs (ATH) for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. According to crypto analyst HAMED_AZ, ETH can surge to $6,400 on the back of a new bullish wave. Recent trends show that some institutional investors are even replacing BTC with ETH, due to the latter’s greater flexibility and wider variety of uses. Major asset manager, BlackRock recently shifted some of its BTC holdings to ETH. That said, some analysts are cautious of the trend of Ethereum treasury firms adding ETH on their balance sheets. At press time, ETH trades at $4,019, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|bitcoin|BitMine|blockchain|btc|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ethereum Adoption|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-21 07:00:44

The platform aims to provide a self-custodial and high-speed solution for perpetual futures trading, allowing crypto traders to speculate on price movements without the limitation of expiry dates. Solana’s Percolator Documentation Released The documentation for Percolator was released on GitHub, where it is described as “implementation-ready.” It introduces two primary components: a Router and a Slab program. The Router manages collateral, portfolio margins, and cross-slab routing, while the Slab program functions as a matching engine overseen by liquidity providers (LPs). Each slab operates independently, enabling what Yakovenko refers to as “fully self-contained matching and settlement.” Related Reading: Analyst Uses AI To Show How The XRP Price Could Rally To $1,700 This design ensures that any issues arising from a particular slab do not affect users who have not interacted with it. Yakovenko emphasized the advantages of this architecture, stating: This design keeps each LP’s slab fully self-contained and innovable, while the Router guarantees atomic routing, portfolio netting, and capability-scoped safety. The project’s GitHub repository already shows completed data structures for order books and memory pools, although the development of liquidation systems is still in progress. However, no official launch date has been announced. Competition In Derivatives Market Intensifies Currently, the Solana Foundation has not disclosed whether Percolator will receive formal ecosystem support or if it will emerge as a community-driven protocol. Should it succeed, Percolator would add to the expanding repertoire of native financial primitives being developed on the Solana blockchain, which already includes decentralized options, lending protocols, and tokenized asset platforms. At present, the code for Percolator remains under review on GitHub, and developers engaged with the repository indicate that the project is “deep in testing.” This suggests that a launch could be imminent, provided that the liquidation and governance components are finalized. The introduction of Percolator comes at a critical time, as competitors like Hyperliquid (HYPE) are expanding their presence in the derivatives-focused DEX space. Related Reading: ‘Buy Of The Century’: Cardano Could Be The 2026 Game-Changer Under $0.20 — Analyst Hyperliquid recently implemented permissionless, builder-deployed perpetual contracts through its HIP-3 upgrade, allowing users to stake a minimum of 500,000 HYPE tokens—approximately $18 million—to launch their own perpetual markets with independent margin rules. Hyperliquid accounted for 35% of all blockchain revenue in July, attracting users away from platforms like Solana, Ethereum (ETH), and BNB Chain. Asset manager VanEck recently noted that Hyperliquid has successfully retained high-value users, thanks in part to its “simple, highly functional product.” As of press time, SOL is trading at $187.70, marking a 20% loss over the past fourteen and thirty days. This puts SOL 35% below its all-time high of $293, which was reached earlier this year.

His message, which originally marked a turning point in Washington’s approach to digital assets, continues to resonate with the XRP community as it marked a turning point for the perception of digital assets in the U.S. Trump’s post stated that the reserve would help “elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration.” He explained that his Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward with the reserve, naming “XRP, SOL, and ADA” as part of the initiative. At the time, the announcement was seen as a significant validation of XRP’s role in the digital asset space and a clear signal of government-level support for its utility. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! Mr. President named #XRP as the first Crypto Strategic Reserve Currency. Remember this! pic.twitter.com/RQmiQXzfZ2 — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 18, 2025 Renewed Confidence in XRP’s Future Since Trump’s return to office, XRP has benefited from a series of policy moves that have strengthened the digital asset market in the U.S. His administration’s stance has helped restore confidence among institutional investors and positioned XRP as a key player in the evolving digital economy. Trump’s administration ended the SEC’s war on crypto , and market optimism surrounding his pro-crypto stance and policies contributed to XRP achieving a record price this year , driven in part by speculation that the asset remains an important element of the government’s digital strategy. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The original executive order, which established a framework for a national crypto reserve, emphasized that the U.S. would safeguard key digital assets rather than sell them. While the Bitcoin reserve became the first component to be formalized, the creation of the broader Digital Asset Stockpile was seen as a foundation for integrating other cryptocurrencies such as XRP. The Continuing Relevance of Trump’s Crypto Vision Even though official documentation later focused on Bitcoin as the primary reserve asset, Trump’s public endorsement of XRP continues to hold symbolic and strategic weight. His post is frequently referenced by analysts who view it as an early indicator of how XRP could play a long-term role in U.S. digital asset policy. JackTheRippler’s recent post brought that vision back into focus, reminding the community of the moment when Trump named XRP among the assets shaping the U.S.’s strategic financial future .

While open interest was halved, most crypto exchanges continued operating with minimal disruption,” the analysts wrote. Earlier this month, the overall cryptocurrency market plunged by more than 10% after US President Donald Trump announced he would impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. Initially totaling $10 billion, liquidations quickly swelled to nearly $20 billion.

According to analysts, “While less reputable tokens virtually disappeared, Bitcoin only fell 15% to its bottom and closed the day down 8%.” Company analysts also maintained their optimistic expectations for Bitcoin, predicting that the price could reach $141,000 by December. Furthermore, the TD Cowen report noted that Bitcoin's global adoption continues unabated. For example, in Japan, the number of digital asset account holders has quadrupled to over 7.9 million. *This is not investment advice.

SNX is the native token for the Synthetix Network and is used for governance. It is listed on top exchanges like Binance, Uniswap, Coinbase, OKX, and Bybit. Synthetic is a decentralized protocol that allows you to create and transact synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Is SNX a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in five years? Let’s get into the SNX price prediction and technical analysis.

Cryptocurrency loses 13.69% of its value. SNX coin may find support around $1.39. As of October 21, 2025, Synthetix price analysis reveals a bearish trend. The altcoin’s price decreased to $1.50 over the past 24 hours. Overall, the cryptocurrency lost a massive 13.69% in value as it corrects following a sharp spike to $1.87$. No buyer support was observed up until the time of writing, as the altcoin continues to fall. SNX/USD 1-day chart: SNX faces strong accumulation The one-day price chart of the Synthetix coin confirmed a downward market trend following a high spike as investors divest. The cryptocurrency price has decreased to $1.50 over the day. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify the presence of selling pressure. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance is wide, leading to high volatility for the coming days. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the resistance, has shifted to $2.06. Meanwhile, its lower limit, serving as support, has moved to $0.727. SNX/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator curve is trending in the neutral area, currently at 54.69. This situation suggests that sellers have control of the SNX price, and further instability in the market can be expected if the bears sustain their momentum. SNX/USD 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of Synthetix Coin also signals selling pressure on the coin at the current price level. The SNX/USD price decreased to $1.51 in the past few hours. The high volatility levels suggest an increased probability of an upcoming reversal or more price oscillation. The upper Bollinger band has shifted to $2.74, marking the resistance level. The lower Bollinger band has moved to $1.28, showing the support level. SNX/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Its value decreased to 46.44 over the past four hours. The downward curve on the RSI graph reflects an imbalanced trading environment. The bears have been dominating the price chart for the past few hours and are still trying to maintain their lead. This trend has also resulted in a relatively unbalanced trading setup for intraday traders.

Synthetix Coin price analysis shows a downward trend regarding the ongoing market events. The coin price has decreased to $1.50 in the last 24 hours. If the bearish momentum continues, the SNX price might retest support at the $1.39 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $7.36 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is in a bearish mode, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting negative sentiment as the SNX price decreased to $1.50, losing 13.69% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.95 for the current year, which is still quite higher than the current Synthetix price. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2028. However, this is not investment advice, and anyone willing to purchase SNX tokens should seek independent professional consultation. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level after 2029. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years, considering the long term Synthetix price forecast. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $8.45, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $8.45 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Source: Coinmarketcap Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3, as per historical SNX market data. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The highest price of the SNX token was 2.27 in January, but it corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and in July, the token peaked at $0.781, showing significant growth. From August to September, SNX’s average price remained around $0.65 to $0.67, and in October 2025, SNX is trading above $1, as the current sentiment is bullish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SNX|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-21 07:11:42

Key Takeaways: Coinbase is urging the US Treasury to update outdated AML rules, arguing that current frameworks fail to address risks. The company recommends using AI, APIs, and blockchain analytics to detect illicit activity more effectively. Coinbase proposes regulatory sandboxes and safe harbors to encourage innovation. Instead of relying on stricter enforcement, the company argues that innovation through blockchain analytics and artificial intelligence should form the foundation of future financial crime prevention. “When bad guys innovate in financial crime, good guys need innovation to keep pace,” said Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, in an X post accompanying the exchange’s 30-page response to Treasury’s request for comment on “Innovative Methods to Detect Illicit Activity Involving Digital Assets.” Coinbase Calls US AML Rules Outdated Coinbase’s filing describes the current AML system as outdated and inefficient, noting that it often floods regulators with low-value reports while forcing firms to store excessive amounts of customer data. The company claims this approach both compromises privacy and fails to deter sophisticated criminal operations. Instead, Coinbase proposes a results-driven approach that leverages modern technologies to improve monitoring and enforcement. Among its key recommendations, Coinbase urged Treasury to establish regulatory “safe harbors” for companies using AI and API-driven compliance tools, recognize decentralized IDs and zero-knowledge proofs as legitimate forms of customer verification, and promote know-your-transaction (KYT) blockchain analytics as a superior alternative to traditional reporting. Third: Amend the Bank Secrecy Act’s customer identification requirements to include decentralized identification and zero-knowledge proofs as part of an approved identification verification process. 4/6 — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) October 20, 2025 “Blockchain and other innovative technologies can counter these emerging risks,” Grewal wrote, adding that Treasury should actively promote the adoption of digital tools to identify and deter illicit activity. He said this would align with the objectives of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, which sought to modernize the BSA. Coinbase also called for regulatory sandboxes to allow exchanges and agencies to jointly test compliance innovations before formal implementation. The company believes public–private collaboration could accelerate progress and provide clearer guidance for firms seeking to deploy AI or blockchain-based tools in AML systems. Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer, echoed this sentiment, writing that the government should “follow in the footsteps of crypto exchanges” by embracing innovation rather than resisting it. “Modernize AML with proven digital tools like AI, APIs, digital IDs, and blockchain analytics,” he urged. At @coinbase , we’re constantly modernizing our defense systems to protect our customers and national security. The government’s approach to combating financial crime should be no different. That’s why policymakers should embrace innovation to modernize AML with proven digital… https://t.co/82GfJSzRDs — Faryar Shirzad (@faryarshirzad) October 20, 2025 Top Crypto CEOs to Meet Senate Democrats as Crypto Bill Talks Stall As reported, a high-profile meeting between leading crypto executives and Senate Democrats is set for Wednesday, led by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, in an effort to revive progress on long-delayed U.S. crypto market structure legislation. Gillibrand, one of the few Democrats vocal about providing regulatory clarity for digital assets, co-sponsored the Responsible Financial Innovation Act with Senator Cynthia Lummis and has remained a central figure in bipartisan crypto policy efforts. Executives from Coinbase, Chainlink, Ripple, Galaxy Digital, Uniswap, Circle, Kraken, a16z Crypto, Jito, and the Solana Policy Institute are expected to attend the closed-door roundtable, according to journalist Eleanor Terrett.

53444727,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=841041,1761030910,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53444727.jpeg,ISS opposes $9 billion CoreWeave merger with Core Scientific,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/iss-coreweave-deal-for-core-scientific/,"Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) on Monday told investors to vote against the $9 billion acquisition of Core Scientific by CoreWeave, saying the data-center operator has done well enough on its own and doesn’t need to be absorbed. The recommendation came ahead of the October 30 vote, and the ISS is warning that Core Scientific has “achieved considerable success as a standalone company” and can keep growing independently, according to Reuters . The proposed CoreWeave takeover, first announced in early July, was an all-stock offer valued at $20.40 per share, which placed Core Scientific’s worth at about $9 billion. At that time, the deal looked generous, a 66% premium above the company’s market price. But since then, CoreWeave’s stock has fallen while Core Scientific’s price has climbed, flipping the math and leaving shareholders questioning why they should trade up for less. Investors question CoreWeave’s structure and value Opposition started building almost immediately. Two Seas Capital said it would vote no, citing “concerns with the sale process, deal structure, and valuation.” The firm argued that the fixed exchange ratio left Core Scientific investors exposed to CoreWeave’s price swings, a risk that’s already materialized. As the trading floor punished CoreWeave’s stock, the total offer value sank. Then Trip Miller, head of Gullane Capital in Memphis, added his voice. His firm, which owns $200 million in Core Scientific shares and is the third-largest holder behind Vanguard and BlackRock, said he couldn’t support the deal. “Under the math of the deal today, I would have to vote no,” Miller said. He called the merger “a flawed structure” that values his shares below their current market price. Investors seem to agree. After ISS’s call to reject the deal, Core Scientific’s stock rose more than 5% in post-market trading, closing at $18.81, while the conversion deal now values those same shares at just $17, a 10% discount, which proves that markets favor independence. CoreWeave’s rapid expansion is increasing its debt massively Since its March IPO, CoreWeave’s market cap has soared to $70 billion, tripling within months as it raced to dominate the AI infrastructure scene. The company has struck major deals with OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia , all of which depend on massive computing power. But behind that success is an aggressive expansion financed by heavy borrowing. In its second-quarter earnings, CEO Michael Intrator said customer demand was so high that the firm needed to build data centers “on a planetary scale.” He said CoreWeave was “aggressively expanding its footprint” to keep up with orders. The company reported revenue of $1.2 billion, more than double from a year earlier, and a revenue backlog of $30.1 billion, also twice what it was at the start of the year. But its operating margin dropped from 20% to 2%, showing how costs are eating into profits. The company also revealed that its debt hit $11.2 billion by the end of Q2, a 40% jump since January, with borrowing costs between 7% and 15%. It’s currently running 470 megawatts of data-center capacity and aims to exceed 900 megawatts by late 2025, enough to power about one-fifth of New York City. If the Core Scientific acquisition went through, that figure would more than double its operational output and push future contracted power above 3 gigawatts.

Among the top cryptocurrencies under $1, three stand out for their strong fundamentals, active communities, and long-term growth setup, Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . DOGE continues to thrive on massive community engagement, ADA remains a cornerstone of blockchain innovation with expanding DeFi integration, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a serious coin in decentralized finance with its dual-lending protocol that merges Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract systems. Currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 70% sold, MUTM is quickly gaining traction among analysts debating what crypto to invest in before the next major rally. With a mix of established resilience and breakout innovation, these three tokens could be the next big movers aiming for the coveted $5 milestone this market cycle. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis: Clean Reclaim Setup Points Towards Bullish Continuation Cardano (ADA) is exhibiting a clean reclaim setup after the latest correction, wherein price finds firm support around $0.624 and trades very close. The major level to keep an eye on is $0.631, provided ADA remains above this area, the technical direction tips in favor of bullish continuation towards $0.641–$0.645 in the short term. In the long run, Cardano could cross $3.10 ATH to hit $5. Its near-term trend is a sign of increasing market optimism following a sharp drop, which is a signal that ADA can be setting up for its next bull cycle if momentum persists. As traders monitor these short-term breakdown levels, most investors are now expanding their scope towards promising DeFi prospects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a project that many are considering among the best cryptos to buy now before the next big boom. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Prediction: Accumulation Suggests Potential Breakout Dogecoin (DOGE) still maintains its all-important $0.185 support level firmly after a steep correction, and this level again continues to be an all-important accumulation base. Bidders now seem to be clearly holding the line at this level as the momentum starts to unwind and trading volume accelerates at the lows. A solid reclamation of the $0.20 level could be the springboard to an even more powerful push higher into $0.25–$0.30, validating the larger bullish setup. With the assumption that DOGE is supported above $0.185, the setup is good technically, a recipe that usually spells serious breakouts after episodes of quiet accumulation. While DOGE could rally further, $5 remains far out. While investors wait to see if DOGE can spark its next boom, others are already directing attention to fledgling DeFi upstarts such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is being recognized as a top crypto to invest in and gaining strong interest ahead of 2025’s subsequent big cycle. Mutuum Finance Rockets Past $17.7M in Presale Mutuum Finance is sending shockwaves minute by minute as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Its presale goes on uninterrupted, with more than 17,330 buyers investing over $17.7 million thus far in the project. The token is now at its lowest possible price, $0.035 at presale stage 6. Mutuum Finance is causing ripples with its action-packed leaderboard rewards, designed to attract its investment community around the clock. Its largest clients have bought $12,538, $11,667, $1,027 worth of MUTM tokens over the past 24 hours, a healthy sign of growing demand and confidence in the project. The most invested earns a $500 MUTM bonus every day in the challenge and commitment culture from investors. Members must buy at least once every 24 hours, to win a ticket. Lending and Borrowing Protocol Soon Mutuum Finance will release its lending and borrowing protocol as a world-class DeFi project. Version 1 (V1) launches on the Sepolia Testnet this year with fundamental features like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the liquidator bot. The fast presale expansion has made it an ideal benchmark for investors seeking the best cryptos to buy now during a changing market scenario. As DOGE and ADA bounce back, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking over the spotlight. At $0.035 in Phase 6, with a raised amount of $17.7 million and 70% sold out, it’s one of the best cryptos to buy now. Join the Mutuum Finance presale to position yourself in MUTM, a crypto to invest in with strong potential, at its lowest price. This project continues to be highlighted as the top crypto to invest in for forward-looking investors.

Recently, a new record was set for ZEC locked in shielded pools. ZCash (ZEC) is extending its trend of locking more coins in shielded pools. In the past day, the supply of shielded coins expanded to a new all-time high, following more retail deposits. Another 959 ZEC were shielded, adding to the more rapid trend of adoption for privacy coins. The creator of ZCash noted the new record and the potential for locking even more ZEC in shielded pools. Another day, another ATH. 959 more ZEC shielded. https://t.co/n7u2XZNofS — zooko🛡🦓🦓🦓 ⓩ (@zooko) October 21, 2025 Shielding more ZEC also means the buyers may not sell, instead using their coins for storage. ZEC is seen as a long-term proposition, an anonymous coin usable in the DeFi space. The depositors to shielded pools will most probably avoid selling their ZEC on centralized markets, instead using the coins on Solana in their bridged and shielded version. More ZEC coins are being added to shielded pools, suggesting accumulation instead of selling for profit. | Source: ZEC Dashboard . In the past three weeks, around 1M ZEC entered shielded pools, and has not been dumped on exchanges. Retail is also still shielding coins , instead of taking short-term profits. ZEC retains its price range The recent interest in the ZCash project and its bridging to Solana is the main factor behind the ZEC price action. ZEC stayed solidly above $250, recently reclaiming the $270 level. The most bullish predictions is for the coin to attempt a recovery to $500. The coin has positioned itself as unique, despite the creation of more recent anonymous coins and tokens. ZEC is also one of the few assets to grow in BTC terms. In the past year, ZEC grew by 337% against BTC, going as high as 0.002 BTC. ZCash retains a track record of one decade, and has claims to fulfilling one of the predictions of Satoshi Nakamoto for an anonymous version of Bitcoin. Additionally, the ZEC community boasts the millions of ZEC coins locked in the shielded pools as one of its positive trends. ZCash gets a boost from retail, whale buying ZEC open interest remains relatively low compared to other older altcoins. On Binance, open interest is over $91M, out of a total of $210M. However, the most notable activity of ZEC is on the Near Protocol. ZCash is boosting new ways of using ZEC, as the coin has been recently removed from the Keystone wallet. The Zashi app is currently the main access point for trading and shielding ZEC. Near Protocol swaps and access to the Zashi wallet means retail traders have a wider access to ZEC. Additionally, data shows a whale has swapped up to 50 BTC per day for ZEC coins. The rise of ZEC also showed not all privacy coins were the same. Most of the privacy assets, including new coins, took a hit during the latest market correction. Monero (XMR) still traded around $305, as its social media mindshare is still high. Railgun (RAIL) stalled its rally at around $2.51, as most other privacy coins took a downturn following the end of the altcoin market.

The meme coin sector momentarily slowed down, hinting at a potential rally if the broader market stabilizes after its recent downturn.

The hourly price chart confirms that Pepe attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a further recovery rally in the coming hours. If Pepe’s price holds momentum above $0.00000726, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.0000797. Pepeusd Chart By TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000635, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000461. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price faced strong selling around recent highs. This pushed the price of PEPE toward the intra day low of $0.0000069. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.000008 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news A significant regulatory development occurred with PEPE’s inclusion in Indonesia’s approved cryptocurrency list on September 1, 2025. PT Central Finansial X (CFX), Indonesia’s first crypto exchange licensed by the Financial Services Authority (OJK), officially designated 1,444 crypto assets as legally tradable in Indonesia, including popular meme coins like PEPE, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Floki (FLOKI). PEPE Price Prediction October 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000008 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000011. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) October 2025 0.000008 0.000011 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is enhancing tools and libraries that facilitate the integration of $DOGE as a payment option for businesses. According to predictions and technical analysis, Pepe could achieve a minimum price of $0.0048 in 2026. The price may rise to a maximum of $0.0058, with an average expected trading price of $0.0050. Pepe Price Prediction 2027 The forecast for 2027 suggests that Pepe will have a minimum price of $0.0071. The maximum price is projected to be $0.0084, with an average price of $0.0073 throughout the year. Pepe price prediction 2028 By 2028, the lowest predicted price for Pepe is $0.0102. It might reach a maximum price of $0.0122, with the average price expected to be around $0.0105. Pepe price prediction 2029 Based on forecasts and technical analysis, the price of Pepe in 2029 is expected to start at a minimum of $0.0149. It could reach a maximum of $0.0179, with an average trading value of $0.0154. Pepe price prediction 2030 Drawing from deep technical analysis of past PEPE data, the price in 2030 is projected to have a minimum value of $0.0204. The maximum price could reach $0.0258, with an average value of $0.0211 throughout the year. Pepe price prediction 2031 By 2031, the lowest predicted price for Pepe is $0.0246. It might reach a maximum of $0.0313, with the average price expected to be around $0.0266.

Another prominent event could similarly propel Pepe to unprecedented levels. Cryptopolitan predicts that Pepe’s lowest price in 2025 will be $0.000024.

53445638,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=841057,1761032841,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53445638.jpeg,Germany’s banks democratize private equity for retail clients,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/german-banks-open-private-equity-to-all/,"German retail banks are increasingly offering private equity funds to the country’s growing pool of small-scale investors, with lenders from Deutsche Bank to fintech star Trade Republic looking to tap into the expanding asset class. The push comes as private capital groups hunt for new sources of funding, with institutional investors reluctant to commit more until prior investments return cash. “German retail investors represent one of the world’s largest untapped pools of wealth and private equity firms are eager to gain access,” said Claudio de Sanctis, head of retail banking at Deutsche Bank, which recently established a private markets product with Switzerland’s Partners Group. Similar efforts are underway internationally. In the US, Donald Trump signed an executive order opening the $9 trillion retirement savings market to a broader range of assets, while UK wealth managers are increasingly offering private market products to retail clients. Fintech platforms lower barriers, opening private markets to smaller investors Investment thresholds vary. Deutsche Bank requires a €10,000 minimum and at least €200,000 in client assets, while Trade Republic partnered with EQT and Apollo to offer exposure from just €1. BlackRock has also teamed up with UniCredit’s German arm HVB and online broker Scalable Capital to give clients access to private equity with a €10,000 minimum. Germany has traditionally taken a wary view of private equity. Back in 2004, Social Democratic chair Franz Müntefering had spoken of buyout investors being harmful across companies. Nonetheless Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a former head of the board of managers for BlackRock Germany, points to a more welcoming environment in the country for alternative asset managers. German households have some €9 trillion in financial assets, more than a third of which is sitting in cash or low return deposits according to Bundesbank data. Private equity is also a significant growth opportunity, according to Christian Hecker, co-founder of Trade Republic. Hecker noted robust early demand for Trade Republic’s private markets launch and believes that asset class to be a core component in the portfolios of retail investors over the next five years despite general German skepticism around capital markets, as Germans are eager to invest in private companies. Industry experts warn that private equity offers opportunity but comes with risks German investors have lagged behind their US and UK peers. Steffen Pauls, CEO of Berlin-based Moonfare, said, “In investor behavior and understanding of private equity, Germany is about 10 years behind.” But momentum is building: Bundesbank data analyzed by Lemon.markets and Smartbroker show securities accounts grew by almost 50% over the past decade, adding nearly 12 million since 2015. About one in five Germans now participate in capital markets , driven largely by digital platforms and regulatory changes supporting semi-liquid listed funds, or Eltifs. German savers are still showing some caution, after incurred heavy losses during the 2008 financial crisis on gated open-ended real-estate funds. The private-equity upswing is fueled mainly by supply rather than demand, noted Ali Masarwah, who runs wealth adviser Envestor. In such slightly frosty conditions, at Moonfare the company recently liquidated a closed-end private equity fund for lack of investor demand. Industry leaders also caution against expecting too much, too soon. Steffen Meister, chairman of Partners Group, said products that promise high returns and liquidity often rely on leverage and lofty fees, adding that many will disappear over the next 10 years. De Sanctis at Deutsche Bank echoed the concerns. “It is important that clients understand what they invest in,” he said, but added there was also an opportunity: “If we introduce this critical asset class to affluent and retail investors properly, we’ll have done a real service to our community.” In private equity, veterans’ perspectives are changing perception over time. Meister said that attitudes in Germany have dramatically transformed from 10 or 20 years ago and the industry is no longer tainted with the same stigma.

Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal stressed modern tools must counter advanced crypto crimes. AI and Blockchain Solutions Coinbase seeks BSA safe harbors for AI and API-based compliance systems. These focus on governance, cut false positives, and protect privacy. Zero-knowledge proofs and decentralized IDs streamline user verification. “Criminals innovate; we must too,” Grewal posted on X. KYT and Regulatory Sandboxes Coinbase advocates know-your-transaction (KYT) blockchain analytics to track asset flows. KYT surpasses outdated reporting that overwhelms regulators.

The firm urges Treasury to endorse KYT and create sandboxes for testing public-private compliance models.

Evernorth’s $1 Billion Merger And XRP Treasury Launch This strategic initiative comes in the wake of a significant legal victory for Ripple, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concluded a high-profile lawsuit that accused the company of selling unregistered securities to institutional investors. Under the current administration the regulatory agency has taken a new crypto-friendly approach, also dropping lawsuits against other key players in the industry. Evernorth has stated that the anticipated merger, expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2026, will establish it as the largest publicly traded XRP treasury company. On the matter, Evernorth’s CEO Asheesh Birla stated: Evernorth is built to provide investors more than just exposure to XRP’s price. As we capitalize on existing TradFi yield generation strategies and deploy into DeFi yield opportunities, we also contribute to the growth and maturity of that ecosystem. This approach is designed to generate returns for shareholders while supporting XRP’s utility and adoption. It’s a symbiotic model: our strategy is designed to align with the growth of the XRP ecosystem. Ripple Co-Founder And Major Firms Join The Venture The fundraising effort also includes a substantial $200 million investment from Japanese firm SBI , which has historical ties to SoftBank, in exchange for equity in the venture. Birla emphasized Evernorth’s intent to explore acquisition opportunities, stating that the company plans to build out its investment team as it grows. The deal has garnered the participation of Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, as well as notable digital asset firms like venture capital firm Pantera Capital, and cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. This announcement follows Ripple’s recent acquisition of GTreasury, which was heralded as a significant advancement in its growth strategy. Ripple aims to provide solutions that allow corporations to unlock idle capital, leveraging the multi-trillion-dollar global repo market through partnerships, such as the one with prime broker Hidden Road. As Bitcoinist reported , this acquisition marks the blockchain payment company’s third major transaction in 2025, following its earlier procurements of prime broker Hidden Road and stablecoin platform Rail. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.47, up nearly 3% over the past 24 hours as the broader crypto market sees a slight recovery from last week’s crash, which brought fear and uncertainty back to the industry.

Here’s What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/finance-strategist-majority-of-xrp-on-exchanges-is-already-gone-heres-what-is-coming/,"Concerns over XRP’s dwindling availability on exchanges have grown recently, and Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, has shared his view on the current market structure. He remarked that “the majority of XRP on exchanges is already gone,” a statement that reflects what data has shown for months. XRP reserves on trading platforms continue to fall as more tokens move into private wallets. The steady outflow signals that holders are securing their assets for the long term, reducing the liquidity available for traders. This movement indicates that circulating liquidity for XRP is becoming increasingly limited. When the available supply diminishes while long-term interest remains, market dynamics can change rapidly. Investors have often viewed low exchange reserves as a signal of accumulation, especially when supply metrics continue trending downward. Aljarrah’s statement therefore points to a structural tightening of XRP’s available supply, which could eventually force its price upward once demand rises. The majority of XRP on exchanges is already gone. With so little liquidity left, any significant demand will force the market to absorb the remaining supply instantly. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 19, 2025 Potential for a Supply Shock If Aljarrah’s assessment proves accurate, XRP could be approaching a point where normal trading demand overwhelms the remaining market liquidity, leading to a supply shock . A supply shock occurs when demand surges while available tokens are insufficient to meet that buying pressure. In such situations, price adjustments can happen swiftly as traders compete to obtain scarce assets. In the case of XRP, this potential supply shock would be amplified by how concentrated holdings have become outside exchanges. Many holders are reportedly positioning their tokens for long-term use within institutional payment systems or storing them securely in offline wallets. That trend reduces the number of XRP tokens readily available for short-term trading and creates a supply bottleneck that could heighten volatility when new demand appears. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What Will Happen to XRP’s Price? When supply constraints coincide with renewed buying activity, market conditions typically favor price appreciation. XRP has already seen increased institutional and retail attention, and moderate demand could have a pronounced multiplier effect . With the token’s liquidity pool shrinking, any large-scale accumulation could move prices quickly. Aljarrah highlights an important distinction between price speculation and actual market structure. If exchanges indeed hold significantly fewer tokens , market makers and traders would need to adjust to thinner order books. This would reduce the ability of the market to absorb large buy orders smoothly, creating an environment where small waves of buying could push prices higher than expected.

Muto explained that this is because replacing Russian supply could take time and come with a side of financial crisis for Japan, as the Asian LNG market remains tight and that rising procurement costs could drive up electricity prices for homes and industries. Muto didn’t offer a timeline or specific details on when shipments could end, but did say that gas from Russia’s Sakhalin‑2 project currently supplies about 10% of Japan’s total LNG imports, describing it as an important lifeline for the country’s power sector. Japan’s trading houses own a stake in the Russian Sakhalin-2 plant, the closest LNG export terminal to the country. Furthermore, much of the fuel bought from the project is supplied under long-term purchase agreements, some of which don’t expire until the 2030s. Japan is the only G7 country without a set deadline to end Russian gas purchases. Muto pointed out that Japan’s strategy focuses on reducing exposure without risking blackouts or price spikes. Washington presses Tokyo to halt Russian energy imports The comments came just as the United States ramped up efforts to cut off Russia’s energy revenue streams. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato during talks in Washington last week that the Trump administration expects Japan to stop importing energy from Russia altogether. The push is part of the White House’s broader strategy to choke Moscow’s war financing and isolate it from global trade partners. At the same time, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters on Monday that the U.S. Senate will delay voting on new sanctions legislation targeting Russia until after President Donald Trump’s planned meeting with Vladimir Putin. “At the moment we’re kind of hitting the pause button,” Thune said. The proposed bill would allow Trump to impose tariffs of up to 500% on imports from countries that continue buying Russian energy while not providing active support to Ukraine, a list that includes China, India, and Japan. Thune previously said the Senate would hold a vote within about 30 days, but the bill has stalled for months despite backing from 85 senators. Trump has yet to give the green light, saying he wants to wait for his one‑on‑one with Putin before locking in new penalties. Meanwhile, oil prices slipped for the second straight day on Tuesday as traders grew nervous about weak demand and a looming supply surplus. Brent crude futures fell 17 cents, or 0.28%, to $60.84 per barrel at 0343 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for November delivery dropped 0.52% to $57.22. The more active December contract slid 0.33% to $56.83. Prices reached their lowest since early May after rising concerns that the U.S.–China trade dispute could hurt global growth and reduce oil consumption. Both Brent and WTI have moved into contango, a market condition where near‑term prices are cheaper than future contracts, suggesting ample supply and softening demand. Analysts said the decline reflects both economic tensions between Washington and Beijing and the ongoing production policy of OPEC+, the alliance of oil‑producing countries led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, according to Reuters . Despite weakening prices, OPEC+ is still pushing ahead with its plan to add more oil to the market, a decision that could extend the global glut through next year. Analysts expect the oversupply to grow, and the International Energy Agency last week projected a surplus of nearly 4 million barrels per day by 2026.

Bears think $126,000 was the top, and BTC will fall below $100,000, and 2026 will be a bear market mainly because of the four-year cycle, he observed before adding: “IMO that is a BIG misunderstanding.” There have been four-year cycles that revolve around the Bitcoin halving, “But three cycles are not enough for a reliable pattern,” he said. It is also “absolutely not guaranteed” that the top is again 18 months after the previous halving, which is now in October. This Cycle Is Different … Or Is It? The analyst then suggested that the cycle top could very well be in 2026, or 2027, or 2028. “Actually, I am much more interested in the average price level than the top (or the bottom),” he said. “What I do know is: there has not been a fundamental Bitcoin phase transition yet in this cycle,” he continued. “Either the big jump has yet to come, or we have transitioned into a more stable price regime, dominated by institutions, fund mandates, and rebalancing … Both scenarios are very bullish for Bitcoin.” Bears think $126k was the top, and btc will fall below $100k, and 2026 will be a bear market mainly because … the 4 year cycle!?

Willy Woo observed that the liquidity driving the cycle top of the last bull market came from from paper derivative markets, which is a short term instrument. “This cycle is shaping up differently. Paper has already started dropping away, while longer term spot liquidity is holding up for now.” When Bitcoin dropped below $104,000 last week, many feared a bear market had just begun and were wishing for the price to go up a bit more so that they could just exit at a decent level, said analyst ‘Rekt Capital.’ They added that “people feel differently about price now,” after the recovery, but that was posted before today’s slump. Bitcoin Price Tanks Again Bitcoin has tanked more than 3% over the past few hours, crashing back to $107,700 during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session. It appears to have hit support around the critical $108,000 level and the plunge had stopped there at the time of writing. What remains clear is that crypto markets are still very jittery and need some solid fundamentals to get the boost that analysts are looking for.

53448536,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/how-to-balance-formality-and-authenticity-in-crypto-pr,1761038506,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/53448536.jpeg,How to Balance Formality and Authenticity in Crypto PR,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/how-to-balance-formality-and-authenticity-in-crypto-pr,"In crypto PR, tone is everything. Too formal — and you sound detached. Too casual — and you lose credibility. The best communicators walk a fine line between authority and relatability, turning brand announcements into conversations rather than broadcasts. Formality builds trust; authenticity builds connection. The challenge is not choosing one over the other, but weaving both into a consistent brand voice that feels real and reliable. This balance didn’t emerge overnight — it evolved as the crypto space matured and audiences demanded transparency. It’s part of a larger shift we explored in how the tone of press releases changed from institutional formality to strategic humanization , a key milestone in the transformation of modern crypto PR. Why Tone Matters More Than Ever Crypto audiences aren’t faceless investors anymore; they’re informed participants. They sense sincerity instantly — and tune out marketing language that feels preprogrammed. A rigid, overly corporate tone worked in traditional finance, but it clashes with Web3’s culture of openness. At the same time, over-casual voices risk sounding unprofessional or unprepared. The question every brand should ask isn’t “How should we sound?” but “How can our tone reflect what we actually stand for?”That shift in mindset — from presentation to authenticity — is one of the defining characteristics of next-generation crypto communication. The Dual Nature of Voice: Formality vs. Authenticity Both tones serve a function — one earns credibility, the other earns emotional trust.Think of them as two sides of the same communication coin. Formality Authenticity Conveys structure, professionalism, and authority Conveys transparency, personality, and trust Ideal for official statements, compliance, or technical updates Ideal for community posts, blogs, AMAs, or founder insights Reduces ambiguity and signals reliability Creates emotional connection and accessibility When blended, they create strategic sincerity — communication that’s structured but never sterile. Adapting Tone to Context Context determines the right balance. A press release about a partnership requires discipline; an AMA about the same partnership requires openness. Every channel has its rhythm, and every audience expects a different level of intimacy. Crypto PR succeeds when tone adapts — not shifts completely, but evolves with purpose. This adaptability is what separates campaigns that feel authentic from those that feel rehearsed. It also ties directly to why formal announcements alone can’t sustain long-term trust , a dynamic explored in our broader research on credibility-building communication models. Humanizing the Formal Formality doesn’t mean stiffness. You can be precise without being robotic. A well-written announcement can carry warmth — through clarity, through intention, through a founder’s quote that feels spoken, not scripted. Tech PR used to hide behind templates; crypto PR thrives when structure serves emotion. Here’s a simple approach: Lead with verified facts. Frame them in accessible language. End with a human insight or forward-looking statement. That’s the formula for credibility that feels alive. Authenticity Without Oversharing The flip side of transparency is vulnerability. Some teams mistake “being real” for “sharing everything.” Authenticity isn’t about volume — it’s about intention. Speak clearly about your process, challenges, and values, but never at the cost of consistency or professionalism. It’s not rawness that builds connection — it’s relevance. A balanced tone shows confidence, not chaos. Building a Brand Voice That Lasts A coherent tone grows through repetition and reflection. Audit your brand voice regularly — from announcements to blog posts, from X threads to AMA scripts. Ask: Does this sound like us? Consistency breeds familiarity; familiarity breeds trust. And understanding how narrative consistency compounds over time explains why the strongest crypto brands no longer separate PR, marketing, and storytelling — they treat them as one evolving language. Conclusion In a market where attention fades fast, tone becomes your signature.Formality gives structure; authenticity gives soul. Together, they create messages that sound believable because they sound human. Crypto audiences don’t want perfection — they want presence. And the brands that master that equilibrium will outlast every market cycle — not because they shout louder, but because they sound like they mean it.",More News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SPONSORED|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-10-21 09:21:46

X user Dr Profit, for instance, claimed that a drop below the critical level of $101,700 may confirm a bear market. On the other hand, different factors like the reduced amount of BTC stored on exchanges hint that it’s not all doom and gloom.

The visible ROI (views, reposts, impressions) is only the surface. The real return lies deeper — in SEO signals, authority building, and measurable shifts in brand visibility over time. The problem isn’t that press releases don’t work — it’s that few projects know how to measure what actually works. Understanding why distribution alone no longer equals visibility is the first step, as explored in our breakdown of how press releases evolved from broadcast tools into strategic credibility assets. The New Economics of Attention In 2025, attention is fragmented across platforms. A single press release competes with millions of updates every hour — but its hidden value lies in the digital residue it leaves behind: backlinks, indexation, branded searches, and topic relevance. The key question isn’t “How many people saw it?” but “Where did it echo — and how long did it stay visible?” That’s where the ROI begins. Visibility vs. Discoverability Traditional PR reports love “reach” — a big number that often means very little. Modern crypto PR, however, values discoverability — the ability for your project to be found, cited, and referenced after the initial buzz fades. Metric Type Old PR Focus Modern ROI Focus Visibility Number of reposts or placements Indexation rate across domains Traffic Raw click volume Referral quality & time on page Mentions Quantity of pickups Sentiment-weighted mentions Backlinks Total link count Domain authority & longevity Conversions Immediate spikes Sustained user inflow post-campaign What we used to call “exposure” is now just input data. True ROI is found in how well that data compounds into authority. Measuring the SEO Footprint Press releases have one measurable advantage: links. Even low-traffic placements contribute to a site’s backlink profile, signaling to search engines that your brand is active, verified, and referenced. This creates a silent growth engine — improving discoverability and keyword ranking for months after publication. The question isn’t whether your release “went viral,” but how much long-term search equity it created. To capture this value: Track backlink growth after every campaign. Use branded search analytics (Google Trends, Ahrefs, SEMrush). Measure the average lifespan of organic mentions. Map traffic sources from distributed articles over 30–90 days. These aren’t vanity stats — they’re the architecture of digital credibility. The Behavioral Side of ROI Crypto PR is behavioral: investors, users, and journalists act on familiarity signals. When people repeatedly encounter your name across different outlets — even in automated distributions — it builds subconscious trust. That’s why the ROI of press releases is often invisible in metrics but visible in momentum. This ties directly to how narrative consistency compounds over time , as our main framework on PR integration explains — credibility isn’t built by bursts of noise, but by steady recognition. Integrating Press Releases Into Data Loops The biggest mistake projects make is treating press releases as isolated actions. When connected to analytics tools, they become feedback nodes that show which narratives perform best. Example integration workflow: Distribute the release through 2–3 relevant newswires. Track coverage and link metrics in real time. Identify outlets or regions generating highest referral quality. Feed those insights into the next campaign’s targeting. This transforms PR from a guessing game into a measurable growth engine — a loop of testing, data, and refinement. The True ROI Equation Let’s strip away the buzzwords. The real ROI of a press release can be defined as: ROI = (Reputation Gain + SEO Value + Conversion Flow) / Distribution Cost If even one of these components compounds over time — especially authority signals or branded searches — your ROI continues to grow long after the initial spend. That’s the compounding logic most teams miss. When ROI Doesn’t Exist Of course, not every press release pays off. If it’s written with no keyword strategy, distributed on irrelevant sites, or disconnected from your campaign narrative — it becomes just another receipt. As our research on why press releases fail without integration demonstrates, content without context is invisible PR. Before publishing, ask: Does this release serve a measurable goal (SEO, awareness, credibility)? Is there a post-distribution plan for amplification? Can we track referral flow and conversions accurately? If you can’t answer “yes” to all three, you’re not investing — you’re donating. Final Thoughts Press releases aren’t dead; they’ve just gone under the radar. Their real impact doesn’t happen on Day 1 — it accumulates over time, in backlinks, brand searches, and sentiment shifts. Crypto teams that treat distribution as data, not decoration, unlock ROI that others never see. Because in the new PR economy, credibility isn’t what you publish — it’s what stays visible after the noise fades.",More News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|SPONSORED|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-10-21 09:27:24

The proposed ETF would hold stETH and rely on verified smart contracts, deep secondary-market liquidity, and integration with custodians and exchanges. Since launch, Lido users have earned more than $2 billion in staking rewards, and the protocol’s total value locked now exceeds $33 billion. According to Kian Gilbert, Head of Institutional Relations at the Lido Ecosystem Foundation, the filing reflects growing recognition of liquid staking as a core pillar of the Ethereum ecosystem. He emphasized that Lido aims to merge decentralization with institutional-grade standards. SEC Position on Liquid Staking The press release also notes that the SEC has previously clarified that issuance, redemption, and trading of liquid-staking tokens are not treated as regulated securities activities when performed under established technical and administrative processes. If approved, VanEck’s product would become the first U.S. ETF backed by stETH, potentially opening the door to broader institutional use.

With the crypto market looking for strong fundamentals and innovative protocols, analysts and early adopters are asking what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in before the next bull cycle. This emerging token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , combines a dual-lending DeFi model, merging Peer-to-Peer agreements with Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, to deliver both scalability and real-world utility. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 70% sold out and $17.7 million raised, MUTM is positioning itself as one of the top crypto coins to buy for investors seeking substantial gains while minimizing exposure to the hype-driven market. With a clear roadmap, strong community support, and innovative financial mechanics, this token is quickly becoming a standout in the DeFi market, offering a compelling alternative to traditional ADA plays. Cardano (ADA) Technical Perspective: Crucial Support Under Spotlight as Bulls Plan Next Move Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.63, with the market waiting for a possible last leg down to the wave 2 support area of $0.55–$0.47. Resistance is still strong in the $0.66–$0.70 area, and ADA needs to retake this level to prevent deeper corrective pullback. If the token is unable to break above $0.70, the move can complete the correction phase, which can pave the way for the next upside impulse. As traders eye these crucial levels and position themselves for ADA’s next leg, most are also on the hunt for new opportunities in DeFi and are looking to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a project often highlighted among the top crypto to buy in 2025. Mutuum Finance’s Stable Growth Generates Market Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is causing huge ripples in the DeFi space, being one of the most auspicious cryptos to keep an eye on this year.

With more than 70% of Phase 6 now sold, Mutuum Finance is seeing unprecedented demand as its popularity increases as a go-to high-potential cryptocurrency with sound long-term prospects. For those investors wondering what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in prior to the 2025 market boom, MUTM is quite possibly one of the best options based on its fundamentals, traction, and stability. Early investors stand to reap possible enormous returns as MUTM prepares to enter the open market. Most cryptocurrency analysts have ranked Mutuum Finance high on their 2025 to-watch list, with its strong fundamentals and unique DeFi products being the top reasons it is set to excel.

This appeal was made public after the Treasury Department requested feedback on suitable ways to combat illegal activities in the crypto sector. Regarding the situation, Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, wrote a letter dated Friday, October 17, and then shared an X post on Monday, October 20, stating that money laundering methods have become more sophisticated due to the advent of new technologies. To solve this, Grewal called law enforcement to adopt these technologies to fight against these dangers. Grewal calls on the US government to use cutting-edge technologies Earlier, Coinbase’s chief legal officer highlighted that blockchain and other cutting-edge technologies are essential in addressing emerging dangers in the crypto ecosystem. Therefore, he urged that the Treasury and other policymakers should encourage their use to identify and stop illegal activities. “This would align with a primary objective of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, which aimed to update the Bank Secrecy Act,” he continued. Faryar Shirzad, a Chief Policy Officer, weighed in on the topic of discussion. In an X post , Shirzad greatly supported Grewal’s view, arguing that the US government needs to draw inspiration from crypto exchanges by utilizing reliable digital tools, such as AI , APIs, digital IDs, and blockchain analytics, to update and improve its anti-money laundering efforts. As one of Grewal’s several recommendations for the Treasury, h e wants the government department to consider establishing a special rule under the Bank Secrecy Act for businesses that use AI and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) driven monitoring tools. In a follow-up post on X on Monday this week, he mentioned that the criteria for that safe harbor should focus on governance and outcomes instead of applying a one-size-fits-all approach. Coinbase’s chief legal officer made these remarks after he observed that companies have been hesitant to fully use AI in anti-money laundering efforts because of unclear regulations in place. He also expressed that APIs face challenges like inconsistent standards and regulatory differences. Hence, Grewal suggests that offering clear guidelines on acceptable use cases would be beneficial. This is because it would clearly define data privacy requirements and standards for interoperability, boosting the confidence of firms to adopt and integrate APIs into their systems. The Treasury’s recommended guidelines sparks controversy in the crypto ecosystem Coinbase’s chief legal officer also wants the Treasury to provide guidelines that acknowledge and encourage the use of decentralized IDs and zero-knowledge proofs as legitimate forms of customer verification, in addition to blockchain analytics clustering for compliance with anti-money laundering laws. This recommendation was made after Grewal noted that the new guidance should encourage the sharing of information related to potential illicit activities involving blockchains, while ensuring that those involved in a blockchain transaction are not dealing with too much record-keeping. Meanwhile, in its notice dated August 18, the US Treasury had asked the public for comments on innovative methods to identify crypto-related illegal activities as required by the GENIUS Act. Jim Harper, a non-resident Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, shared a different perspective. He argued that a system should be established for communication, enabling law enforcement agencies to ask crypto firms for details required in their investigations directly.

The bears have the upper hand as a move further down to $100,000 is starting to become a distinct possibility. Will the $BTC price take the plunge, or will a last-ditch bounce save the day? How far down will this reversal impulse take $BTC? Source: TradingView The 8-hour chart for $BTC shows how the price has been staying in the top half of the descending channel, except of course for the huge fakeout that resulted in the all-time high. That said, the price has just confirmed below a major trendline. It now remains for the price to come down to the full extent of this reversal impulse, whatever that may be. The $109,000 horizontal support has failed, at least on this time frame, and now the $BTC price is testing horizontal support at $107,400. More horizontal support can be found at $105,600, and then the mid-point of the channel should also act as a good support, as it has done up to now. The last line in the sand is probably $98,000. This level also concurs with the bottom of the channel. In order to save the bull market, the price would need to bounce hard and fast from there. $98,000 an obvious level for a bounce? Source: TradingView Zooming out into the daily time frame it can be seen that the $BTC price could be about to drop through the 200-day SMA. In itself, this isn’t the end of the world for $BTC given that the 200-day SMA has been breached for an extended period three times so far in this bull market. That said, it is another support level that could fall by the wayside. As one can see, possibly the most obvious level for a bounce is in fact the $98,000 horizontal support. A candle wick down to the bottom of the descending channel would perhaps provide some balance and symmetry into the bargain. Notwithstanding, this kind of a move would probably spread fear and terror throughout the crypto market. Not just any last vestiges of leverage could be expunged from the market, but quite possibly many spot positions would also be sold - a likely environment for a huge rally back to the upside … 50-week SMA is the definitive bull market support Source: TradingView The weekly chart view for the $BTC price provides some crucial information. The main standout here is the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). This average has provided support to the bull market all the way through up to now. Only the odd short candle wick has pierced through it at what were very difficult, but pivotal times for the Bitcoin bulls. If the 50-week SMA is to continue to provide that last support, it would suggest that the $BTC price won’t in fact go all the way down to the $98,000 level. $100,000 might just be a possibility if a candle wick came down that far. Of course, there is the possibility that the 50-week SMA could provide the signal that the bull market is over, should the price close and confirm below. One last factor to consider is the Stochastic RSI. The negative price action since the all-time high has helped to bring the indicators almost down to the bottom. If one looks left at the last time this occurred, one can observe the near 70% rally that took place. Things may be balanced on a knife edge, but they may be far from over yet.

Blockchain data shows that Larsen transferred 50 million XRP , worth approximately $123.8 million, to an unknown wallet, according to Whale Alert’s insights on October 20. Chris Larsen XRP transfer. Source: Whale Alert The transfer, completed in under an hour, marks Larsen’s first major XRP movement since July. Notably, between July 17 and 23, 2025, he moved $175 million XRP, with about 140 million landing on exchange platforms. At the time, the impact on XRP remained muted, as the asset traded above $3. Why Larsen transferred XRP While the initial transfer of the tokens was unknown, Larsen later confirmed on X that the tokens were part of an investment in Evernorth, a Ripple-backed firm that recently announced a $1 billion Nasdaq SPAC merger. Congrats @ashgoblue and the @evernorthxrp team on today’s launch! Evernorth fills the missing link today in XRP capital markets, and XRP usage in DeFi products. I’m proud to invest 50M XRP in the firm (you may see some wallet movement on this). https://t.co/AAbkO6WlZe — Chris Larsen (@chrislarsensf) October 20, 2025 Evernorth, supported by Ripple, SBI Holdings, and Armada Acquisition Corp II, aims to build the largest public XRP treasury and create a regulated investment vehicle to facilitate institutional exposure to the cryptocurrency. The company is expected to raise $1 billion in gross proceeds , with $200 million already committed by Ripple affiliates and partners. Larsen congratulated the Evernorth team, describing the firm as “the missing link in XRP capital markets” and emphasizing its role in expanding XRP’s use within decentralized finance. However, the move has revived long-standing tensions between Ripple insiders’ market activity and investor confidence. With Larsen still holding 2.58 billion XRP valued at about $8.8 billion, analysts remain divided over whether the transfer signals bullish institutional positioning or a prudent hedge before potential volatility. XRP price analysis Following the latest move, XRP price has not shown any significant movement, as the asset is trading in tandem with broader market sentiment. By press time, XRP was valued at $2.41, having plunged over 2% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline, the token is down 2.3%. XRP seven-day price chart.

Now, the most important resistance for XRP remains the $2.50 mark, which is central to sustaining any hopes of the asset reclaiming $3.

Celebrity investor and crypto trader Jeffrey Huang, better known by his alias Machi Big Brother, is staring down potential losses of millions after taking several leveraged long positions on Ether. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is trading in the red at the time of this publication, down 4% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. Whale continues mounting long bets, ignoring market downturn Over the weekend, Huang received an injection of 220,000 USDC from investment firm QCP Capital and deposited it into Hyperliquid to add to his long position on ETH. At the time of the deposit, Ethereum’s price stood roughly at $3,831.24. The coin made a small price comeback to the $4,000 level during the start of this business week, reaching $4,077 before tanking over 4.6% to $3,843 in Tuesday’s early Asian trading sessions. Huang was holding 1,439 ETH, equivalent to around $5.5 million, with a liquidation price set at $3,734.49, before he decided to expand his exposure by depositing another $100,000 USDC into Hyperliquid today. That raised his holdings to 2,575 ETH, or approximately $10.14 million, with a new liquidation threshold of $3,843.56. To avoid liquidation, Machi( @machibigbrother ) deposited another 105K $USDC into #Hyperliquid — and he's still adding to his $ETH long. Position: 2,600 $ETH ($10.02M) New Liquidation Price: $3,803.71 https://t.co/2iUTdMaBI2 pic.twitter.com/kNIwLW9M3J — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 21, 2025 At around 5 AM UTC, he made a third deposit of $105,000 USDC to avoid immediate liquidation. He added and added to his long, upending the position to 2,600 ETH (valued at roughly $10.02 million) and adjusted the liquidation price to about $3,803.71. According to data from Hyperdash, which monitors derivatives positions, Huang’s ETH long position is leveraged 25x with a position value of roughly $10,118,420, an entry price of $3,955.13, and a liquidation threshold of $3,803.86. His margin usage is 95.72%, with more than $404,736.80 in margin currently at risk and a negative unrealized PnL of –$164,933.12 (–40.75%). Since he entered at about $3,955 per ETH and the current price is near $3,894, his position is already drowning deep underwater. Huang entered the long at $3,955.13 but, at about $3,894.20, he is already down by roughly $61 per ETH across his 2,600-ETH position. If ETH’s price falls toward or below the liquidation price of $3,800, he would completely lose the margin he deposited. Machi Big Brother would need to inject additional more USDC as collateral to bring margin usage below the critical threshold and give him more room to absorb further price drops. As reported by Cryptopolitan less than two weeks ago, Huang reportedly realized approximately $44 million in profits from long bets on the Plasma (XPL) token just prior to October 1, during what crypto traders refer to as “Uptober”. However, a drop of up to 46% in XPL’s price saw those once-realized profits evaporate, leaving Huang sitting on an unrealized loss of nearly $9 million on a separate 5x leverage position. ETH price crumbles under pressure, bull signals fade Most cryptocurrencies, like ETH, have not yet found their footing back to October-start levels, with losses from Bitcoin and altcoins causing a 3% market cap loss in the broader market. After a bounce to clear the $3,880 and $3,980 levels on Monday, including surpassing the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from $4,292 to $3,677, Ethereum has failed to sustain the upside. Bears took back control around the $4,080 resistance zone, and the price did not settle above the 61.8% Fib retracement level. According to “trading psychologist” Jimie NLP, ETH’s price behavior follows a repeating rhythm of trending down, consolidation, and finally a price breakout. However, he mentioned that in the current phase, the breakout is “stalled” because traders are watching for mean-reversion setups while buying low and selling high within the tight $3,800-$4,100 range.

Bitcoin’s sudden drop from $115,000 to $104,000 in just four days is being described by analysts as a fast and ruthless market cleanup that shook out weaker players. Although Bitcoin has rebounded, sentiment has not fully healed. Traders are still cautious, and this defensive stance is visible in current positioning and capital flows. On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Market Stress Glassnode highlighted several signals pointing to defensive behavior across the market: The RSI briefly broke below its lower band and remains in a weak zone Cumulative volume delta stays negative, showing continued selling pressure Spot volumes fell during the drop, signaling soft demand Open interest and funding both declined The 25-Delta Skew in options surged, showing increased demand for downside protection Long-Term Holders Accumulate as Confidence Lags Analysts also noted that NUPL has turned negative and RPL fell below prior lows, both signs of rising stress in the market. However, Realized Cap continues to climb, suggesting long-term investors are quietly accumulating Bitcoin despite short-term fear. Glassnode concluded that while the rebound is encouraging, the market remains fragile and confidence must return before bullish momentum can resume. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant recently suggested that Bitcoin may be entering the late stages of its bullish cycle, adding more intrigue to what comes next. Analysts say the coming weeks may bring the next decisive shift. ETF flows, liquidity trends, and macro events could either reignite momentum or deepen caution. A bullish scenario would require stronger inflows and a recovery in demand, while a bearish outcome could emerge if defensive positioning intensifies and liquidity weakens. With tension building on-chain, markets may be approaching an inflection point where the next major breakout or breakdown forms. For context, CryptoQuant recently suggested that Bitcoin may be entering the late stages of its bullish cycle, adding more uncertainty — and excitement — to what lies ahead.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-21 09:46:38

According to on-chain analyst Ai Yi, the transfer from SpaceX account follows a 3-month hiatus. The analyst suggested that the move is likely to be an internal management move and not a sale. “In July, SpaceX’s sudden transfer had its receiving address marked by Arkham as a Coinbase Prime Custody address.

The recent fund movement shows similar prior patterns. In July, SpaceX transferred 1,308 BTC, valued at about $153 million to Coinbase Prime wallets. These movements have led to speculations about SpaceX’s BTC holdings. One user speculated that the company’s BTC reserve strategy seems “ more aggressive .” Analysts believe that the transfers are just part of managing their wallets efficiently. Interestingly, per Arkham, SpaceX once held a much larger position — roughly 28,000 BTC at its April 2021 peak — but pared back the size during the market turmoil of 2022. Following the recent transfer, the SpaceX-linked wallet has a balance of 5,790 Bitcoin, valued at $625 million at current prices. Elon Musk Grips Tight on Crypto Among Elon Musk’s companies, Tesla had been an aggressive BTC accumulated; however, confirmed in 2022 that it had sold 75% of the 38,747 BTC at a loss. Tesla now stands 11 th among the top corporate Bitcoin holders , accumulating a total of 11,509 BTC. The car maker’s entire BTC holdings are valued at about $1.241 billion at current prices. Combined, the two Musk-linked companies now hold roughly $1.86 billion in Bitcoin on paper. Bitcoin fell 2.71% to $107,829 in the past 24 hours, underperforming the broader crypto market. The largest crypto is trading at $107,719 at press time.

The inflows follow a recovery of meme activity, as Pump.fun is still the top platform for creating memecoins. Pump.fun’s native token PUMP is attracting smart money inflows, as the price bounced off its recent lows. Despite the end of the altcoin market, specific assets are still recovering. PUMP still traded at $0.004, close to its initial sale price. The token bounced from last week’s lows of $0.0033, recovering to the higher range for the past week. PUMP is still up by 25% in the past month, despite the short-term volatile trading. The recent focus on BTC has shifted the spotlight from memes. Based on Messari research, overall mindshare for PUMP is down by over 47% . A lower retail interest and slowing mindshare may turn into a moment of silent accumulation, waiting for a comeback for Pump.fun. Smart money added 17% PUMP to their balances Smart money has also increased its PUMP balance by over 17%, based on Nansen research. The token is still carefully traded, as altcoin markets remain fragile. However, PUMP is considered a bet on a long-term trend of rewarding creators and moving traditional creators to Solana.

Over 60% of PUMP whales are going long, compared to around 65% on centralized exchanges. The token is still seen as risky, as Hyperliquid whales usually take more aggressive short positions. PUMP open interest also recovered to $346M, though still down from a recent peak above $365M. The token still has $1.3B market cap, which is considered relatively low for one of the leading token platforms. During the lifetime of the PUMP token, the Pump.fun team bought up over 9% of the total supply. However, since September, PUMP repurchases slowed down, leading to the relative price weakness. Pump.fun takes the lead on Solana Meme creation still continues on Solana, despite the more difficult time in reaching high valuations. Pump.fun is back to launching over 95% of tokens on Solana. The meme platform wars have ended, and even LetsBonk.fun is showing minimal activity. The platform is still holding its position against Four.meme, which generated a highly active Binance meme season. Four.meme still bet on curated tokens, relying on several strong rallies instead of trading in the ‘trenches’. Pump.fun remained the leader for token generation on Solana, displacing previous contenders during the meme token wars. | Source: Dune Analytics . Pump.fun still holds the record with over 13M lifetime tokens, while Four.meme still has around 589K tokens. The platform still had a few days with 15K to 59K new tokens created. Pump.fun fell to a baseline of around 13K daily tokens generated. As usual, only a small fraction of those tokens move onto a DEX. Despite this, Pump.fun still generates around $2.9M in daily fees, based on new token generation and legacy trading on its own DEX, PumpSwap.

FLOKI’s official X account declared it the ‘#1 trending token on CxoinGecko,’ branding itself as ‘Elon’s dog .’ With $FLOKI riding Musk’s viral wave, the newest contender in the block is quietly stealing the spotlight – Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . A meme token built on a body-building trading doge that represents gym pumps, raw strength, and the grind of the bull market. Beyond the high-octane meme appeal, the project is already building a loyal community united by its bold ‘crush the charts’ motto. Check out our in-depth $MAXI price prediction here. BlackRock Launches IB1T ETP on UK Markets as Bitcoin Hyper Becomes One of the Best Meme Coins October 21, 2025 • 10:00 UTC BlackRock just launched its iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) on the London Stock Exchange with the starting price of $11.10. As the official press release states, the goal is to expose ‘retail investors (i) with specific knowledge and/or experience of investing in similar products’ to Bitcoin and other digital assets in a regulated ecosystem. BlackRock’s IB1T is now available in 12 registered locations, including Austria, Spain, Portugal, UK, and Germany. The news is bullish for Bitcoin and could catalyze its Q4 run once $BTC breaks the $120K resistance point again. When that happens, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) may also see visible boost, although the presale is already in full bull mode. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2, promising a faster, cheaper, and more scalable Bitcoin ecosystem, Bitcoin Hyper already raised $24.4M in presale and it targets a Q1 2026 release date if the market is favorable.

53449511,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87079,1761040829,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Revealed: Insiders Are Accumulating These 3 Altcoins For 15x Gains,https://timestabloid.com/revealed-insiders-are-accumulating-these-3-altcoins-for-15x-gains/,"Insiders have quietly built positions in three altcoins, betting on explosive growth amid crypto market shifts. Dogecoin (DOGE) has climbed 5% in the last day, hovering near $0.19, while Cardano (ADA) dipped into an opportunity zone at $0.641, drawing buyers despite resistance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , the standout best crypto to buy now, raised $17,750,000 since presale launch and onboarded 17,340 holders. Phase 6 sells at $0.035, up 250% from phase one’s $0.01, yet insiders eye 15x potential across these picks. Analysts spot rebound signals in DOGE and ADA, but MUTM’s DeFi utility propels it ahead as the top crypto. Early accumulators position for gains, underscoring these as prime altcoin targets in turbulent times. Dogecoin Eyes Rebound Path Analysts have flagged Dogecoin’s ascent within a channel since early 2023. The token defended $0.16 support, aligning with a 0.618 Fibonacci level. Therefore, momentum builds if that holds firm. Yet, breaking $0.21 remains crucial; failure here stalls progress. Higher, $0.29 resistance looms, a past rejection point tied to the channel’s midline. Success there could thrust DOGE toward $0.45 soon. One expert even projected $0.86 by 2026 under bullish flow. Another voice echoed a $1 push, citing uptrends from 2024 and higher lows. Still, DOGE’s meme roots cap reliability compared to structured plays. Thus, while rebounds tempt, deeper utility elsewhere draws sharper focus. Cardano Enters Accumulation Phase Cardano has slipped into a zone where holders face losses between -9% and -19% MVRV ratios. Historically, such dips signal bottoms; selling eases as buyers step in. Consequently, sentiment shifts toward recovery. Chaikin Money Flow readings confirm inflows over recent days, crossing above zero for positive capital flow. This pattern often precedes bounces, especially with muted sales. ADA clings above $0.623 support yet battles $0.661 overhead. A push past that targets $0.696, and sustained hold over $0.754 validates strength. Downside risks $0.608 if pressure mounts. However, ADA’s struggles highlight gaps in immediate yield, unlike protocols blending lending with token incentives. So, accumulation here intrigues, but execution lags behind emerging DeFi leaders. Mutuum Finance Accelerates Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance has opened phase 6 of its 11-phase presale, pricing MUTM at $0.035 as the best crypto to buy now. Investors snapped up 70% already; phase 6 sells out rapidly. Thus, this marks the final window for tokens at that level before phase 7 hikes 14.3% to $0.04. Launch arrives at $0.06, promising current buyers 420% ROI post-deployment. The team finalized a CertiK audit, scoring 90/100 on token security. Moreover, Mutuum Finance launched a bug bounty program. This is in partnering with CertiK, allocating $50,000 USDT across four severity tiers. Each vulnerability level carries tailored rewards, bolstering protocol integrity. Lending Protocol Takes Shape Developers at Mutuum Finance announced its lending and borrowing protocol buildup. Version 1 heads to Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, featuring liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bots. Initial support covers ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, or collateral. Borrow interest rates tie to utilization, dropping low during abundance to spur loans and climbing in scarcity to draw deposits. Stable rates option locks predictability at borrowing, though starting higher than variable to offset risk. Rebalancing kicks in if variables surge 10% beyond stables, ensuring fairness. Overcollateralization mandates extra backing, with liquidations triggering at 70% thresholds for most assets. Liquidators claim bonuses on discounted collateral, preserving solvency. Holder Incentives Build Engagement The MUTM team rolled out a dashboard tracking top 50 holders, plus a fresh 24-hour leaderboard update. Daily, the top user earns $500 in MUTM bonuses after one transaction in the window; resets hit 00:00 UTC. Past 24 hours crowned buyers at $7,036.48 and $6,619.13. Meanwhile, a $100,000 MUTM giveaway splits $10,000 to each of 10 winners celebrating presale. Participants submit wallets, finish quests, and invest minimally $50 to qualify. These moves foster community, yet P2C pools deliver instant yields on shared assets, while P2P vaults enable custom loans isolated per deal. Borrow caps limit exposure on volatile tokens, and enhanced collateral efficiency boosts limits for correlated stables like USDC. Accumulators favor Mutuum Finance as the top crypto amid altcoin volatility, blending secure lending with holder perks for sustained 15x upside. DOGE and ADA tease rebounds, but MUTM’s mechanics ensure real yields. Secure spots in phase 6 before it vanishes; act on this best crypto to buy now.

Speaking on the Milk Road podcast on October 20, Moreno argued that the path to fresh highs remains open if spot demand stabilizes and the macro overhang from US–China tariff negotiations clears. The key inflection he’s watching is Bitcoin reclaiming its on-chain traders’ realized price near $115,000. “The resistance will be around $115K,” he said. “If the price goes above that… the range that we could expect is $150–$195K. To the downside… it’s around like $100K.” Bitcoin Bull Run Is Reset Moreno characterized the October 10 deleveraging as the largest dollar liquidation in the history of Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetuals, with roughly $20 billion in open interest wiped out in a single day as total OI fell from an all-time high near $78 billion to around $58 billion, later hovering closer to $56 billion. He noted that in unit terms the event was “a little bit short of the FTX liquidations,” but emphasized that the dollar magnitude reflected today’s larger derivatives base, not a structural break. The relative resilience of spot price—Bitcoin “only got to… $110,000” that day, after a wick to “103,000” two days prior—underscored, in his view, that demand and the cycle’s price floor sit well above prior cycles even amid forced unwinds. “It doesn’t put you in a bearish market,” Moreno said, adding that buyers still absorbed supply quickly enough to avert a trend break. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters ‘Disbelief Phase’ – Could Short Sellers Face The Next Squeeze? CryptoQuant’s composite “bull score” of ten on-chain indicators had already rolled over before the crash, dropping from roughly 80 to 40 by October 6 as momentum cooled and spot demand began to contract. After the liquidation, the score slid toward 20, which Moreno described as “on the bearish side right now.” He stressed that on-chain metrics are not price predictors so much as risk gauges: “It’s going to signal to you the risks… when all these metrics… converge into telling you there’s increasing risks, then it’s when you have to be more careful.” Several datapoints pointed to a market that was stretched into the shock. Total crypto open interest set a record near $78 billion just before the event, a classic over-leverage tell. Profit-taking surged above $3 billion in early October as spot neared the prior all-time high in the $124K–$126K zone, fitting CryptoQuant’s “profit–pause–push” framework in which aggressive realization precedes cooling. Moreno also highlighted that spot demand flipped from growth to contraction around October 6—days before tariff headlines and the liquidation—helping explain why the risk backdrop was deteriorating even without the macro spark. “We were starting to see some high profit taking… not only because of the macro events,” he said. Who’s Selling, Who’s Buying Bitcoin? The compositional flow of coins during the drawdown supports the view of a rotation rather than a structural buyer strike. Moreno said “OG” whales and early miners—an aggregate cohort he estimates hold roughly 600,000 BTC excluding Satoshi—resumed distribution as prices pushed past $100K, a recurring dynamic in every cycle as supply migrates to new hands. Institutional demand, by contrast, remained steady. Related Reading: Bear Market Alert: Top Expert Claims Bitcoin Price Fate Hangs On $101,700 Support Level Because ETF custodial wallets often bucket between 100 and 1,000 BTC per address for security, CryptoQuant tracks that “dolphins” cohort as a proxy. “That cohort… is still buying,” Moreno said, adding that whales increased their accumulation “during this correction,” with year-over-year holdings expanding “above trend.” Liquidity conditions corroborate the bid: stablecoin market caps, led by USDT, continued to expand through the drawdown, a pattern he would not expect “if we are… in a bear market.” Altcoins were far more fragile around the shock. Transactions sending altcoins to exchanges spiked to year-to-date highs during the liquidation, signaling a scramble for exits across low-liquidity names. Moreno cautioned that this cycle has been notably selective across sectors rather than a blanket “alt season,” and reiterated a theme that has become more obvious in 2025: robust protocol activity and fee generation no longer translate mechanically into token outperformance without explicit economic linkage. “Even if the protocol is doing well doesn’t necessarily mean that the token is going to do well,” he said. What To Expect From Q4 And 2026 Macro remains the wild card for Q4. Moreno believes rate-cut expectations are largely embedded—“the market already… has priced what the Fed will do”—and that only an unexpectedly large cut would be a fresh positive catalyst. By contrast, the US–China tariff trajectory is front-and-center. “If we get that out of the way then… a really positive Q4 can resume,” he said, noting that tariff headlines were the proximate trigger for October’s deleveraging and were also behind a sharper demand contraction back in March–May. Until clarity returns and spot demand re-accelerates, he expects chop around well-defined levels. That leaves Bitcoin boxed between a tactical resistance and a psychological floor. Moreno pegs the traders’ on-chain realized price near $115,000 as first resistance and the $100,000 area—where short-term holders sit on roughly a 10% unrealized loss—as the downside line where forced selling typically abates in bull markets. A decisive reclaim of $115K would, in his model, validate a run toward $150,000–$195,000. “We’re not that far… from the previous all-time high,” he said, adding that new highs in Q4 are plausible if the tariff overhang resolves. As for the cycle peak, he leans against an extended mania deep into 2026 or 2027, citing CryptoQuant’s diminishing-intensity bull readout even as price has risen. “I would not expect… more than Q1 2026,” he said, with the caveat that timing tops remains guesswork. “Probably we all are going to be wrong.” At press time, BTC traded at $108,187.

AA reported that an investigation was launched by the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's Office as part of the fight against illegal betting and virtual gambling, and that detention warrants were issued for 24 suspects who were determined to have transferred a total of 3.665 billion lira. It was stated that 15 of the 24 suspects were caught and 9 were still wanted.

Le istituzioni si spostano da Bitcoin a Ethereum Le principali criptovalute, tra cui Ethereum e Bitcoin, stanno ora cercando di recuperare terreno. Tuttavia, Ethereum sembra guidare la ripresa grazie all’aumento dell’adozione istituzionale, un segnale del suo potenziale a lungo termine come leader tra le altcoin. In una mossa che ha scosso sia il settore crypto che quello della finanza tradizionale, BlackRock, il più grande gestore patrimoniale del mondo, avrebbe spostato parte delle sue riserve di Bitcoin su Ethereum.La notizia, diffusa da Coin Bureau sulla piattaforma X , ha rapidamente attirato l’attenzione dell’intera community crypto. Questo coraggioso “switch” segnala un cambiamento significativo nel sentiment istituzionale e una crescente fiducia nel potenziale di crescita di Ethereum nel lungo periodo.Il passaggio di BlackRock verso ETH sottolinea l’importanza crescente di quest’ultimo come pietra angolare della finanza decentralizzata (DeFi) e delle infrastrutture finanziarie di nuova generazione, anche se Bitcoin resta dominante come riserva di valore. Secondo i dati condivisi da Coin Bureau, il colosso degli investimenti avrebbe trasferito circa 272,4 BTC (pari a circa 28,3 milioni di dollari) su Coinbase Prime. Poche ore dopo, BlackRock avrebbe prelevato oltre 12.098 ETH per un valore di 45,4 milioni di dollari. Bitmine segue l’esempio accumulando ETH Anche Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. ha iniziato ad accumulare ETH a un ritmo sostenuto. Un recente report di BMNR Bullz rivela che la società ha acquistato centinaia di migliaia di ETH nell’ultima settimana per rafforzare la propria tesoreria digitale. Nonostante il crollo del mercato, l’azienda continua a puntare con decisione su Ethereum portando il totale a 379.271 ETH (circa 1,5 miliardi di dollari).Con questa imponente operazione, Bitmine dimostra la propria convinzione nel ruolo crescente di Ethereum come motore dell’innovazione blockchain. Durante il crollo di venerdì, Bitmine ha acquistato oltre 72.898 ETH per 281 milioni di dollari. Tre giorni prima, aveva già comprato 104.336 ETH per 417 milioni di dollari. Dopo il crollo del weekend, è seguita un’ulteriore acquisizione di 202.037 ETH, portando il totale a 379.271 ETH in una sola settimana. La strategia di accumulo costante riflette la visione del Co-CEO Tom Lee, secondo cui Ethereum sarà la spina dorsale dell’economia digitale.Secondo BMNR Bullz, non si tratta di un semplice segnale di acquisto, ma di un vero e proprio cambiamento epocale nel panorama degli investimenti crypto. Ethereum come copertura contro l’inflazione Anche figure di spicco della finanza globale stanno ora sostenendo Ethereum come asset rifugio.Tra questi c’è Robert Kiyosaki , miliardario e autore del celebre libro “Padre ricco, padre povero” , che ha incluso ETH tra i principali strumenti di copertura contro l’inflazione. Con l’inflazione in crescita e l’aumento della pressione sul ceto medio e sulle fasce più deboli, Kiyosaki ha esortato le persone a non fare affidamento sul “denaro falso” dei governi, ossia le valute fiat. Al contrario, invita a investire in oro, argento, Bitcoin ed Ethereum, che definisce “il vero denaro”.",Uncategorized|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-21 10:01:57

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-gold-is-pumping-xrp-soon-heres-why/,"The financial landscape in 2025 has seen gold command an influence few assets can match. Its surge past $4,300 an ounce this year has become a focal point among traders who see it as a signal for what comes next across global markets. For Levi Rietveld, the creator of Crypto Crusaders, gold’s movement is not only historic but predictive. He believes its performance is about to lift the digital asset market, with a particular focus on XRP. Rietveld shared a video arguing that gold consistently acts as a guide for other markets. “Gold is the number one leading indicator of where the markets are going,” he said. His view extends across asset classes, claiming that it does not matter whether one looks at Bitcoin, the stock market, or real estate. According to him, gold always moves first. Gold Is Pumping #XRP Soon? pic.twitter.com/ELxKMPpEMB — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 18, 2025 Gold’s Record Performance Gold’s rise in 2025 has been remarkable by any measure. Futures crossed $4,300 an ounce for the first time in history, marking an increase of more than 60% since the start of the year. Many analysts link this rally to global uncertainty and shifting investor sentiment toward safe assets. However, Rietveld believes that gold is a precursor to what digital assets will do next . He pointed out that every time gold futures have reached new highs, cryptocurrencies have soon followed. “Sometimes it takes a month. Sometimes it takes two months,” he said, referencing the lag he has observed between gold’s performance and crypto market movements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Linking Gold and XRP While some market participants have shown many links between gold and XRP , Rietveld’s reasoning builds on the historical pattern he sees between the commodities and crypto markets. In his analysis, gold’s sustained upward trajectory often signals a renewed appetite for risk among investors once the price stabilizes. That, he believes, sets the stage for digital assets such as XRP to advance. XRP has remained one of the most discussed assets in the digital finance space due to its connection to Ripple’s payments technology and its potential for institutional use . The correlation is not always immediate, but those who track it closely regard gold’s recent performance as an early signal of where value could move next. While Rietveld did not provide a timeline, he expressed confidence that the gold rally will soon translate into upward pressure on XRP’s price, and many experts share this belief that something good is coming .

Valuation estimates CRCL at $185.6 per share, a 47% premium, with a 71.8% probability of outperforming its current price; a Buy rating is recommended. Key risks include interest rate declines and distributor bargaining power, but long-term USDC growth and network effects are expected to offset these challenges. Investment Thesis Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) is the second-largest stablecoin provider in an industry with potentially high network effects. Circle’s value proposition is a winner compared to its closest competitor in terms of trust and regulatory compliance. The company aims to disrupt the payment industry with its unique relationships with financial and crypto institutions, and it exposes a potential investor to great optionality. The company is linked to the more extended crypto world, and that will make the stock price fluctuate with high volatility. I estimate Circle’s stock value to be around $185.6 per share, a 47% premium over its current stock price, with a probability of 71.8% of not losing money in the investment. I recommend buying the stock. Potential Network Effects Stablecoins as payment systems are businesses with network effects, as you can observe in the current credit card industry, dominated by Visa ( V ) and Mastercard ( MA ). The value of your product, the USDC stablecoin, grows as more consumers or businesses use it, but to use it, a large number of consumers or merchants must accept USDC. Therefore, volume is critical for this business. I consider Circle as being in a better position than Tether, its main competitor and the market leader, with a market capitalization of USDT of $181 billion. Tether is mostly used for crypto trading and large cross-border transactions, but regulatory concerns have limited its adoption by institutional clients. USDC is more payment-oriented, and the real utility of stablecoins is more favorable to institutional clients. I consider Circle a clear winner, but even if the company just remains as the second leader in the market, that is not a bad position, as in the credit card market, where there are two leaders. Stablecoins are a more convenient payment method, as payment speed is almost instant compared to 1-5 business days in traditional payments. The cost per transaction is less than $0.1 compared to 1.5%-3.5% for a regular credit transaction. It is able to manage smart contracts with automatic possibilities and is fully transparent. The market could reach $500 to $750 billion in 2028, which is double the current market value. If Circle has a 33% market share and is growing due to its strategy of regulatory compliance and institutional trust, the company could reach $190-$285 billion USDC valuation, considering a 38% market share. That would mean a x2.5 or x3.8 multiplier from current revenue. Since I consider that distribution fees will increase but at a much lower rate, and marginal costs are close to zero, there will be an increase in free cash flow even if interest rates decrease by a considerable amount. Currently, daily payments on stablecoins are $30 billion , which is less than 1% of total payments in all technologies. The reserve return rate was 4.14% in the last quarter, way down from a year ago in the equivalent quarter at 5.17%. The current Federal Reserve (Fed) funds rate target range is 4.00–4.25%, and it is expected to decrease to 3% in 2026. If this scenario is true, it will mean a 25% decrease due to lower interest rates, and as we have seen, it is offset by the increase in TAM expansion and market share gain. Even if lowering interest rates to 2%, the fall in revenue would be 50%, but as a one-shot, compared to a TAM expansion in a stable coin, that could reach in the long run a 20% growth rate . Meaningful Wallets, MeWs, in the last quarter were 5.7 million, growing 68% from a year ago. Reserve revenue increased 49.9% thanks to an 86% increase in USDC circulation, offset by a decrease of 27.7% in interest rate. Distribution Costs Are Not a Concern One of the major worries an investor can have is about distribution costs. The company is paying handsomely to partners like Coinbase in a revenue-sharing agreement. The deal states that Coinbase will receive 100% of the interest income from USDC held on the Coinbase platform and 50% from USDC held outside the Circle and the Coinbase platform. Distribution costs can be a concern, but as volume rises and network effects are higher, the balance of power will change. Distribution costs have grown 64.6% to $406.5 million, much higher than the 50% growth rate in reserve income. Distribution costs over revenue have increased from 58.3% last year to 64.1% last quarter, reflecting the intense efforts of Circle to extend its network and capture network effects. The distribution deal is favorable to the distributor partner, with the hope of reversing the bargaining power in the future when the network gets a higher volume. The percentage of USDC held in Circle’s platform has increased from 2% in 2024 to 10% in 2025. USDC on the Coinbase platform has increased from 18% to 21% in a less meaningful way, and the USDC held in a platform different from Coinbase and Circle has decreased from 80% to 69%. It is positive, from a margin perspective, to hold more in Circle’s platform, but as long as Coinbase is increasing, gross margins will suffer. Operating expenses increased just 16.4% if IPO-related expenses are excluded, supporting the economies of scale of the business model and why high distribution costs are secondary. Operating costs over revenue have decreased from 31.0% in Q2 2024 to 24.1% in Q2 2025. Valuation In my valuation methodology, I discount projected free cash flows at a convenient WACC. I define cash margin as net income adjusted for non-cash items such as amortization and depreciation, stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax, offering a clearer view of operational cash generation than standard margin metrics. I project interest rates will decrease to 3% in 2026 and, conservatively, to 2%, the Fed’s target in 2027 and later (Figure 1). This is a conservative assumption, considering this monetary expansion as the worst-case scenario for Circle. USCD circulation will grow at a decreasing rate until reaching 20% as the long-term growth rate. I consider Other Revenue as a diversified type of revenue, thanks to the optionality that a blockchain network provides. Examples of these revenue sources are Circle Wallets, Circle Contracts, Circle Paymaster, and CCTP. With those assumptions, the growth rate would decrease in 2027 to 10% from 37.6% the previous year due to the deceleration of interest rates. In 2028, the revenue growth rate will go up to 46.9% and then decrease in the next year to stabilize at 20%. Figure 1: Author I estimate that margins for Circle will increase over the ten-year period in my model. My base case assumption is that Circle will increase its power over crypto exchanges, as Coinbase, and will negotiate better terms once USDC has consolidated its network effects. Cash margin will increase in year ten to 22% from the current 18%. From 2027 to 2029, margins will decrease due to the current bargaining power of crypto exchanges and the need to extend USDC circulation. Cash flows will be discounted at 11.3% WACC because the beta is 1.80. The risk-free rate is 4.2%. Debt, as a percentage of market capitalization, is 1%, and I consider it to have no excess cash. The perpetual growth rate is set at 3%, which is slightly better aligned with the long-term GDP growth rate. Figure 2: Author My value estimate has just reached $185.6 per share (Figure 2), up 47% from its current stock price. Risks and Uncertainties The main risk is interest rate risk. As interest rates lower, Circle's revenue will decrease if USDC circulation doesn’t grow. The current macroeconomic environment is favorable to a dovish approach; the Fed just lowered 25 bps interest rates to 4.00–4.25%. This issue doesn’t concern me because the maximum decrease would be two percentage points, which is 50% in revenue, but as a one-time decrease. However, the counterbalance item is USDC volume growth that will be for the long term. This last quarter has increased by 86%, and I expect to grow at a high rate in the coming years, multiplying by 8 in the next 5 years. About 71% of stablecoin volume is generated by bots. The main use case is high-frequency trading in other cryptocurrencies, with about 88% of total transactions, and 22% is for payment and remittances. Therefore, its high transaction volume is not comparable to Visa or Mastercard and doesn’t reflect a real utility use but a speculative one. If this picture doesn’t revert in the coming years, the most attractive attribute of stablecoins, the utility as a payment method, will vanish, and it will become just another speculative crypto. Those risks would affect revenue. I model, due to its high uncertainty, as the revenue growth rate could fluctuate +/-15 percentage points over the base case 90% of the time. Another risk is the bargaining power of distributors like Coinbase. As I said, it is not a concern for me. However, I have to recognize that the industry structure could turn favorable to the crypto exchanges, and their negotiating power would increase, pressing margins. I model it as the cash margin could change +/- 5 percentage points over the base case 90% of the time. Introducing those risks in my model and running Crystal Ball, I’ve found that the probability that the stock’s value is greater than the current stock price is 71.8%. Conclusion Circle is an attractive business with network effects in the emerging cryptocurrency industry. It is not a speculative stock, as it has a real value proposition: a digital payment system. It is differentiated with respect to its main competitor by its trust and compliance approach, attracting solid institutional clients. Based on a growing USDC circulation and a decreasing interest rate environment, while increasing diversified revenue sources with moderated margin improvement, I value the company at 185.6 per share, a 47% premium over its stock price. The probability of exceeding its current stock price is 71.8%. Therefore, I recommend buying the stock.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-21 10:10:21

The $375 million deal aims to change how market players invest in crypto projects. The official announcement highlights: With this acquisition, we’re building a full-stack solution for crypto projects and investors, covering everything from launch to fundraising to secondary trading. Notably, Cobie, known for advocating for fairness and transparency in digital assets, founded Echo to improve inclusivity. The latest acquisition comes hours after CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed Coinbase spent $25 million to purchase Cobie’s UpOnly NFT.

The duo aims to open the sector of on-chain fundraising to communities, not only corporations. Coinbase breaks fundraising barriers Raising money to fund new projects has been challenging in the digital assets market. Ordinary investors rarely access early opportunities, while most founders struggle to attract serious investors. Meanwhile, Coinbase has acquired Echo to fix this. With Echo, projects can raise funds privately or publicly directly from the communities, using the Sonar tool. The model connects builders seeking funding and cryptocurrency enthusiasts who trust in what they are creating. The cryptocurrency exchange aims to unlock capital markets by making them more accessible, efficient, and transparent. While it will prioritize token sales at first, Coinbase plans to expand Echo’s utility to cover real-world assets (RWAs) and tokenized securities in the coming times. The Coinbase team says : Integrating Echo’s tools will help us enable more direct community participation, joining projects with capital, entirely on-chain. While we’ll start with crypto token sales via Sonar, we plan to expand support to tokenized securities and real-world assets over time, leveraging Echo’s infrastructure. Echo’s success as a fundraising platform Echo is an on-chain startup with a track record of success. For instance, it has facilitated nearly 300 deals, helping projects raise more than $200 million since its launch. Moreover, its new and innovative product Sonar has seen notable traction. Sonar has powered multiple successful token sales, including the thriving Plasma’s XPL . Echo stands out due to its community-driven approach. It allows projects and their supporters to directly connect, alleviating the need for using traditional venture funding. That creates the inclusivity and transparency, which aligns with Coinbase’s ethos. Coinbase expands on its full-stack mission Echo’s purchase comes shortly after Coinbase added Liquifi to its ecosystem to limit table management and simplify token creation. The two acquisitions boost the exchange’s offering by creating a robust pipeline for cryptocurrency startups. Projects now have everything, from token creation to fundraising and exchange listing. The team highlighted: While Liquifi strengthened our ability to support builders at the start of their journey, Echo extends that support into fundraising. That establishes Coinbase as a one-stop platform for investors and builders, supporting early-stage projects to take off.

In this article, we break down everything interesting related to them that has happened recently. ‘MicroStrategy Built for XRP’ Evernorth – a new venture backed by Ripple – recently revealed that it will seek listing on Nasdaq through a merger with blank check company Armada Acquisition Corp II. It is expected to raise over $1 billion in proceeds and will focus on accumulating XRP. Speaking on the matter was the former Ripple executive, Asheesh Birla, who will spearhead Evernoth as CEO. He said the entity will look at “acquisition opportunities” and establish an investment team. Among the main backers of the multi-billion-dollar initiative are Japanese firm SBI and crypto exchange Kraken. The news caused huge enthusiasm across the XRP Army. The X user Ripple Bull Winkle argued that Evernorth is basically “MicroStrategy built for XRP from the ground up.” He claimed that the company would purchase XRP tokens directly from exchanges, reducing the circulating supply and positively impacting the price. “But it’s not just buying pressure. They’re also creating utility: liquidity pools, lending, and yield programs built around XRP as the base asset. More on-chain use = more transaction volume = more reason for institutions to hold XRP for settlement,” he added. Larsen Offloads XRP Contrary to Evernorth, whose ultimate goal is accumulating a substantial XRP stash, Chris Larsen dumped some of his holdings. CryptoQuant’s data shows that he sold 50 million tokens (worth over $120 million) on October 20. While some X users expressed concerns that this move might cause panic and lead to a price downtrend, others reminded that Larsen is among the prominent backers of Evernorth, and the sale represents a donation to the newly established firm. “Evernorth fills the missing link today in XRP capital markets and XRP usage in DeFi products. I’m proud to invest 50M XRP in the firm (you may see some wallet movement on this),” Larsen clarified on X. XRP Price Outlook Ripple’s cross-borded token has been on a severe downtrend in the past two weeks, with its price plunging by almost 20% to the current $2.42 (per CoinGecko’s data). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Nonetheless, multiple analysts believe it has yet to reach new peaks during this cycle. One of the biggest bulls is the X user ChartNerd, who envisioned a potential price explosion to as high as $27. Meanwhile, Santiment’s data shows that crowd sentiment toward XRP has dropped to its lowest point in nine months. This may sound like bad news for the asset’s investors and proponents, but the platform reminded that the crypto market is unique, and prices often move against overall expectations.

The move coincided with SpaceX transferring more than $268 million in BTC to new wallets following months of inactivity, sparking discussion about institutional positioning and whether a short-term reversal is near. SpaceX Transfers $268 Million in BTC On-chain data shows SpaceX shifted 2,490 BTC (worth roughly $268.4 million) to two new wallets after a three-month pause. Blockchain tracker OnchainLens identified the transfers, 1,197 BTC to address bc1qq787… and 1,298 BTC to bc1qj7en…, both associated with Coinbase Prime Custody. SpaceX ( @SpaceX ) has transferred 2.49K $BTC , worth $268.47M, to a new address after being dormant for 3 months. – 1.197K $BTC to bc1qq787 – 1.298K $BTC to bc1qj7en https://t.co/sHZdsBsJor pic.twitter.com/fqMDO8A0wA — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) October 21, 2025 According to Arkham Intelligence , SpaceX now holds 5.79K BTC valued at about $626.9 million, down 2.2% as Bitcoin prices softened. Analysts say the transfers likely reflect internal custody management or migration to institutional cold storage rather than outright sales. While not indicative of liquidation, such large moves often trigger caution among traders, leading to short-term volatility or leveraged position resets. Key Takeaways: SpaceX holds roughly 5,790 BTC worth $627 million. Recent transfers totaled $268 million in BTC. The timing aligns with Bitcoin’s brief dip below $108K. Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Tests $107,400 Support as Bulls Defend Rising Channel Bitcoin is hovering near $107,400, where its rising channel’s lower boundary meets the 20-EMA, a key short-term support. Price action shows buyers attempting to defend structure as sellers test near-term momentum. Since mid-October, BTC has printed higher lows, suggesting accumulation despite brief corrections. Yet the bearish engulfing candle near $110,400 signals fatigue at resistance. The RSI around 45 and a flat 50-EMA point to consolidation rather than reversal. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC holds above $107,400, upside targets lie at $111,700 and $115,900. A drop below could expose $104,400 and $101,100. Trade Setup: Aggressive traders: Long near $107,500, stop $106,900, target $111,600. Conservative traders: Wait for a close above $109,000 for confirmation. Maintaining this rising channel remains vital to preserving Bitcoin’s short-term bullish outlook. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $24.3 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013145 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

Rather than focusing on short-term price movements or speculative hype, he shared a personal account to reinforce conviction, drawing from his life experience and broader historical parallels. His narrative centered on the nature of opportunity—how it often goes unnoticed, how it is challenged, and why persistence matters in a developing market like crypto. Quite possibly one of the most important XRP videos you will ever watch… pic.twitter.com/A9OftbtwK5 — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) October 19, 2025 A Personal Testimony on Identifying Opportunity Hilton, aged 56, began by underscoring his years of experience, noting that his insights come not from theory but from lived events. He revisited a story that, according to him, had previously motivated members of his private group. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, before becoming deeply involved in crypto, he was working in corporate software sales. He was successful financially but unfulfilled. During a visit to his father in Charlotte, North Carolina, he encountered what became a turning point: his father had launched an early e-commerce website, hitchfinder.com, investing heavily at a time when the internet was viewed with skepticism. Hilton saw the untapped potential in online retail, asking to buy into the internet side of his father’s business and committing to grow it. Despite strong resistance from suppliers who doubted the legitimacy of online commerce, he pushed forward. Over time, what began as an ambition to sell a handful of products daily evolved into a company processing more than a thousand orders per day before it was eventually sold in 2008. He framed this experience as a lesson: transformation does not arrive with certainty or comfort. It requires foresight during periods of public doubt. Drawing a Parallel Between Early Internet Resistance and Crypto The core of Hilton’s message lies in the comparison between the early internet era and today’s cryptocurrency landscape. He recalled how the media and traditional businesses once framed the internet as a threat, dismissing it as a dangerous trend. He noted that similar patterns of resistance are visible today in how mainstream institutions approach crypto, particularly XRP and blockchain innovation. Hilton referenced regulatory pressure, including actions like the SEC lawsuit against Ripple, as examples of broader institutional reluctance. However, he argued that opposition from traditional finance is not a sign of weakness but an indication of disruption. According to him, financial institutions initially attempt to suppress what they cannot yet control. They accept and endorse a technology once they identify paths to monetize it. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Commitment Amid Uncertainty Hilton stressed that owning XRP or any major cryptocurrency today resembles being present during the evolutionary stages of the internet, before global acceptance and mass integration. He acknowledged challenges such as volatility, market manipulation, and negative narratives, but insisted these are inherent to frontier sectors. He reinforced that opportunities rarely present themselves with fanfare. Instead, they appear subtle—requiring belief before validation arrives. His message to investors was not focused on immediate gains but on understanding crypto as one of the last remaining untamed financial arenas, still beyond full institutional control. Final Reflection Hilton concluded with firm caution: Those who relinquish their position may eventually buy back exposure through the same institutions currently resisting adoption. His reflection served as both encouragement and warning—suggesting that patience and conviction will define participation in one of this era’s most consequential technological and financial shifts.

53452725,https://finbold.com/?p=255827,1761047300,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Here’s why Bitcoin price is crashing today,https://finbold.com/heres-why-bitcoin-price-is-crashing-today/,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) reversed sharply again on Tuesday, October 21, sliding nearly 3% and trading as low as $107,552 in the early hours, having lost all of its weekend momentum. The asset moved in step with the overall crypto market, whose total valuation has dropped more than 2% to $3.67 trillion. As expected, the new setback is tempering expectations for “Uptober,” the month known for strong gains, with Bitcoin now down 6.30% over the past month, trading at $108,290 at the time of publication. BTC monthly price chart. Source: Finbold Altcoins mirrored Bitcoin’s decline. Ethereum ( ETH ), for example, has dropped 5.3% to $3,859, while XRP has fallen 2.2% to $2.41, showing little reaction to Ripple Labs’ announcement of a new treasury-backed vehicle, Evernorth. At the same time, BNB shed 5.7%, while Cardano ( ADA ) and Solana ( SOL ) lost between 4% and 6%. Among memecoins, Dogecoin ( DOGE ) saw the greatest losses, losing 4.3%. Why is Bitcoin down? As mentioned, the global crypto market tumbled sharply over the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin sliding under heavy selling pressure as investor sentiment flipped. The sell-off was accelerated primarily by $320 million in leveraged crypto positions being liquidated over the last 24 hours. Similarly, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded further net outflows on October 20, extending a four-day withdrawal streak, as BlackRock saw $101 million in redemptions. Furthermore, with the Fear & Greed Index at 33 (“Fear”), BTC appears oversold, but the sentiment might turn ahead of the U.S. crypto policy roundtable scheduled for October 21–22. AWS outage sinks crypto Adding to the turmoil, yesterday’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage disrupted operations on major exchanges, including Coinbase . The resulting loss of access to digital assets led to further panic selling as algorithmic systems fired off liquidations. Thus, the correction not only underscores the crypto’s reliance on institutional adoption and macro elements but also its weakness to technical disruptions.

Here Are the Details",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/peter-szilagyi-former-lead-developer-at-the-ethereum-foundation-criticizes-vitalik-here-are-the-details/,"Péter Szilágyi, a former lead developer at the Ethereum Foundation, has sparked a heated debate in the crypto community by suggesting that Vitalik Buterin’s influence has become overly deterministic in the Ethereum ecosystem. Former Ethereum Developer Criticizes Buterin: “The Direction of Ethereum Depends on Your Relationship with Vitalik” In a letter sent to the Ethereum Foundation administration last year but made public on Sunday, Szilágyi claimed that the Ethereum ecosystem is controlled by “a narrow circle of five to ten people and a few venture capital funds.” According to the developer, the success of new projects largely depends on their relationships with this inner circle: “The direction of Ethereum was always dependent on your relationship with Vitalik,” he said. Szilágyi also noted that fundraising and project approval mechanisms have become vulnerable to the influence of certain vested interests. Citing his own experience, he said he only received $625,000 from the Ethereum Foundation over six years, while Ethereum's market capitalization reached hundreds of billions of dollars during the same period. Following the controversy, Polygon Foundation CEO Sandeep Nailwal stated on the X platform that he was “beginning to question his loyalty” to Ethereum. “We never received direct support from the Ethereum Foundation or the community; instead, we faced obstacles. I still felt a moral commitment to Ethereum, even though it cost me billions of dollars,” Nailwal said. Similarly, Sonic Labs co-founder Andre Cronje criticized the Ethereum Foundation for its lack of communication, stating that he struggled to get a response from executives. While the Ethereum Foundation and Buterin did not comment on the matter, Buterin posted a post praising the Polygon team the same day, commending Nailwal and his team for Polygon's early investment in ZK-EVM technology and infrastructure projects like AggLayer. The Ethereum Foundation has undergone a significant restructuring in recent months. After laying off several developers in June, the foundation has announced a new strategy for managing its remaining ETH reserves. *This is not investment advice.

53453072,610571,1761048045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53453072.jpeg,Ripple CTO David Schwartz Joins Another Company In New Leadership Role,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-david-schwartz-joins-another-company/,"Ripple’s longtime chief technologist David “JoelKatz” Schwartz has unveiled his first post-Ripple move, saying he will serve as a strategic advisor to Evernorth, an XRP-focused vehicle led by former Ripple executive Asheesh Birla. “XRP community – I promised I’d have an update on my next adventure soon right? Well here’s the start: I’ll be a strategic advisor to Evernorth, helmed by my friend Asheesh Birla,” Schwartz wrote , adding that Evernorth was founded “as a regulated, scalable investment vehicle to tap into opportunities for XRP in DeFi and capital markets, extending the entire XRP ecosystem.” He closed with: “I’m excited to get started!” The Old Ripple Connection Schwartz’s announcement arrived alongside Evernorth’s own reveal that it has signed a business combination agreement with Armada Acquisition Corp II to go public on Nasdaq. The combined company is “expected to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ‘XRPN,’ subject to the satisfaction of the listing requirements,” with more than $1 billion in gross proceeds targeted, including a $200 million commitment from Japan’s SBI. The release says net proceeds will primarily fund open-market XRP purchases, positioning Evernorth as “the largest public XRP treasury company.” The Birla–Schwartz connection is longstanding. Birla joined Ripple in 2013 and rose to become General Manager of RippleNet, the company’s cross-border payments business, before moving to the company’s board in 2022. On the day he stepped back from his “day job”, Birla wrote: “After ~9 amazing years I’ve decided to wrap up my day job at Ripple. Luckily, I’m not going far as I join the Board of Directors.” In announcing Evernorth this week, Birla said he will step down from Ripple’s board to lead the new venture. Schwartz’s advisory role at Evernorth intersects with his own transition out of Ripple’s C-suite. Earlier this month, he disclosed that he will step down as Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer at year-end after more than a decade in the role, moving to Ripple’s board and remaining active in the XRP Ledger community. He revealed that he wants to spend more time with family while “not going away from the XRP community.” Evernorth’s capital-markets blueprint is expansive. The company plans to use its war chest to accumulate XRP and to “actively grow XRP per share over time” by lending to institutions, providing market liquidity and deploying capital into XRP-based DeFi strategies. The press release outlines complementary ecosystem initiatives—running XRPL validators, using Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin as an on-ramp to XRP DeFi, and supporting projects across payments, capital markets and tokenized assets—framing Evernorth as both a treasury vehicle and a development catalyst. The company says Ripple will participate as a strategic investor, and that Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse, Stuart Alderoty and David Schwartz are expected to serve as strategic advisors while Evernorth maintains independent governance. For XRP’s institutional storyline, the architecture matters. By targeting an exchange listing under “XRPN” and explicitly eschewing a passive ETF wrapper, Evernorth positions itself as an active, yield-generating public company with a balance sheet anchored in XRP. If the deal secures shareholder and regulatory approvals, the parties are aiming to close in the first quarter of 2026, converting non-redeemed AACI Class A shares one-for-one into Evernorth shares at closing. Schwartz’s phrasing—“here’s the start”—reads like a deliberate tell that his Evernorth role is only the first of multiple XRP-aligned ventures he plans to take on following his CTO transition. He has already confirmed he will remain engaged with XRPL and Ripple at the board level; today’s advisory post adds a capital-markets dimension to that presence.

The transfer marks the second major wallet activity for the firm this year. Arkham Intelligence tracker revealed today that SpaceX transferred 2,485 BTC worth about $268.47 million to two new addresses. The token was distributed as follows: 1,197 BTC to the first address and 1,298 BTC to the second address. Following the transfer, no outgoing sales have been recorded so far, suggesting an internal restructuring of cold storage or a change in custodial arrangements. SpaceX holdings drop to 5.79K on Coinbase Prime Custody The latest wallet transfers mark the second major movement after the July transfer reported on Cryptopolitan, which saw 1,308 BTC worth roughly $153 million at the time being moved after almost three years of inactivity. The wallet showed no activities afterward, indicating that the movement could have been an internal custodial change. SpaceX’s total holdings in July were 6,977 BTC held through Coinbase Prime Custody, valued at around $818 million at the time. Currently, the firm has roughly 5,790 BTC via its Coinbase Prime Custody account, valued at around $626.4 million based on Arkham on-chain data . So far, the aerospace technology firm has not made any official statement, but the on-chain activity suggests it is repositioning part of its Bitcoin holdings. Elon Musk’s firm Bitcoin holdings became public in 2021 when he confirmed that Tesla had acquired BTC. Later, filings revealed SpaceX had written down approximately $373 million in digital asset losses through the 2021-2022 market shakedown. On the other hand, Tesla sold most of its holdings towards the end of 2022, leaving SpaceX to make infrequent but notable adjustments, which some analysts say aimed to improve security, custody, and transparency. However, along the way, the automobile firm regained its holdings with over 1,150.9 BTC, currently valued at roughly $1.24 billion based on on-chain data . Institutional holders rebalance Bitcoin exposure CryptoQuant analysis identified that long-term holders (LTHs) have reduced their holdings by roughly 337,300 BTC, and short-term holders (STHs), on the other hand, have added 351,100 BTC, indicating a significant redistribution of Bitcoin supply. Bitcoin STH/LTH Supply vs. ETF Flows vs. Strategy. Source: CryptoQuant At the time of publication, Bitcoin traded at $107,753, down 2.6% over the past 24 hours and 3% over the week, according to CoinMarketCap . The token has also maintained an average of $61.33 billion trading volume over the past 24 hours, marking an increase in volatility by over 4%. Despite the downturn, institutional inflows from ETFs and corporate treasuries have remained stable, cushioning the decline. SoSoValue data shows the US spot Bitcoin ETF has recorded a $40.47 million net outflow over the past 24 hours and a cumulative net inflow of $61.5 billion as of today. The total net assets stand at $149.66 billion, representing roughly 6.7% of the tokens’ total supply. SpaceX’s Bitcoin holding strategy mimics the broad ecosystem trend of large corporations integrating BTC and other digital assets into their treasury strategies. Examples such as Strategy and Marathon Digital firms view BTC as a reserve asset that can be incorporated into a company’s financial strategy as an investment alternative. For now, it remains speculative whether the aerospace engineering firm will remain committed to long-term holding and whether the current movement will maintain significant exposure while optimizing custody and compliance structures.

The project, originally designed to make mining more accessible through mobile devices, has maintained strong community engagement despite delays in mainnet development. As the broader market prepares for another wave of DeFi project growth, tokens like Pi are drawing attention for their potential to reintroduce utility to community-driven cryptocurrencies. Alongside this renewed attention, Remittix (RTX) continues to emerge as one of the best crypto presales of 2025, positioning itself as a project solving real-world financial problems with practical applications in global payments. Pi Network Shows Steady Movement Amid Renewed Interest Pi Network’s price is currently at $0.2070, a meager 0.36% increase from the past 24 hours. The token’s market capitalization is estimated at around $1.71 billion backed by a 24-hour trading volume of $15.76 million, rising 14.89% from yesterday. This incremental growth shows that investors have a cautious but upbeat attitude that Pi would benefit from the return of liquidity on centralized platforms and DeFi. Investors remain focused on whether Pi’s eventual open mainnet will bring expanded functionality such as crypto staking or cross-chain compatibility, which could position it among the next big altcoins of 2025. However, while Pi’s momentum is growing, the spotlight in the altcoin market continues to lean toward projects offering verified real-world use cases — and that’s where Remittix stands out. Why Remittix Is Gaining Stronger Traction Remittix (RTX), currently priced at $0.1166 per token , has surpassed $27.5 million raised with over 679 million tokens sold, showing one of the fastest-growing presales in the market. The project is developing a crypto-to-fiat payment bridge that enables users to send digital assets directly to traditional bank accounts across over 30 countries — a major step toward mainstream crypto adoption. Here’s what continues to drive attention toward RTX: Global Reach: Crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries Security Verified: Fully CertiK-audited and #1 ranked pre-launch token on CertiK Low Gas Fees: Designed for fast, affordable transactions Real Utility: Bridges DeFi and traditional finance Active Presale: Massive $250,000 Remittix Giveaway and 50% bonus with code RTX50 Remittix’s verification by CertiK provides strong investor confidence, while its upcoming listings on BitMart and LBank mark major liquidity milestones. The project has also introduced a 15% USDT referral program, offering instant rewards to participants — making it one of the best DeFi projects of 2025 with a functioning ecosystem even before launch. The Momentum Keeps Building The Remittix DeFi project continues to expand through wallet beta testing and steady community growth, all while maintaining transparency and progress recognition through platforms like CertiK and Remittix.io . Its blend of real-world utility, secure tokenomics, and strong presale milestones positions it as one of the top cryptos under $1 to watch. With Pi Network maintaining community relevance and Remittix breaking new ground in financial connectivity, both tokens reflect how investor focus in 2025 is shifting toward crypto with real utility, but only one is already delivering it.

Here’s What Is Next,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-open-interest-just-bottomed-out-heres-what-is-next/,"A quiet shift is happening beneath XRP’s price charts , one that could mark the beginning of a new momentum phase. In recent weeks, the XRP futures market has seen a dramatic contraction in open interest, signaling that a major wave of leveraged positions has just been flushed out. Historically, such resets have preceded sharp market reversals or renewed bullish breakouts, especially when paired with strong spot demand and improving liquidity conditions. According to crypto market analyst Chad Steingraber, XRP’s open interest has just bottomed out, and that could be the prelude to something much bigger. The Sharp Reset in XRP Derivatives Open interest (OI) measures the total value of outstanding futures contracts and is one of the best indicators of speculative activity in the crypto market. When open interest rises rapidly, it usually means traders are piling in with leverage, often amplifying both gains and losses. Conversely, when open interest collapses, it often signals mass liquidations or widespread position closures, a “cleansing” of the market. Open Interest XRP just bottomed out… We’re ready to rock… https://t.co/AamHXHEIkL pic.twitter.com/eolAs5AEnQ — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) October 21, 2025 Recent data shows XRP open interest dropped to about $3.49 billion, with the token trading near $2.36, according to derivatives market analytics platforms. This represents a steep reduction from the recent peak near $12 billion earlier in the quarter. The contraction reflects an aggressive shakeout in both long and short positions, leaving the market structurally lighter and more balanced. Why the Bottoming of Open Interest Matters Periods of low open interest are often misunderstood. While some view it as a sign of waning interest, experienced traders interpret it differently — as the calm after a storm. When leverage is drained from the market, volatility caused by forced liquidations tends to decline, and price action begins to reflect organic demand rather than speculative excess. This current environment could therefore provide the foundation for a more stable and sustained rally. With fewer leveraged players left to trigger cascading liquidations, XRP’s next leg upward would likely be built on actual spot buying and institutional demand rather than short-term speculation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Dynamics: The Stage for a Rebound The futures reset also coincides with XRP’s strengthening macro backdrop. The asset continues to see increased institutional interest following Ripple’s expanding global partnerships and RLUSD’s integration into major financial discussions. XRP’s spot trading volume has remained relatively steady even as futures activity cooled, a sign that long-term holders are quietly accumulating while leveraged traders retreat. As liquidity consolidates and funding rates stabilize, conditions could favor renewed upward movement. Analysts are now watching closely for fresh capital inflows, which often follow market flushes like this one. What Comes Next for XRP If historical patterns repeat, XRP’s open interest bottoming could mark the end of a speculative downcycle and the beginning of a new accumulation phase. Traders will be closely monitoring whether open interest begins to rise again — but this time, alongside a steady price uptrend rather than wild swings. Chad Steingraber’s observation captures the prevailing sentiment: the market may have just reset the board, setting XRP up for its next major move . With leverage cleansed and momentum rebuilding, the stage appears set for XRP to “rock,” as Steingraber put it — but this time, with stronger foundations beneath it. XRP’s open interest bottoming is more than a data point; it’s a psychological and structural turning point. The flush-out of leverage resets trader sentiment and offers the market a clean slate. Whether this leads to a sharp rally or a gradual climb, the conditions now favor a more sustainable growth path. For patient investors, this could be the moment that defines XRP’s next chapter.

The project earned one Platinum and two Gold awards, marking a significant achievement in the global creative industry. Organized by the International Awards Associate (IAA), the MUSE Awards received over 13,000 entries from around the world in its 2025 Season 2 competition. Submissions were evaluated by a panel of more than 100 industry professionals from 30 countries, with winners selected for their innovation, craftsmanship, and impact across design and visual storytelling. Casual Films’ submission centered on KuCoin’s core brand message, “Trust First, Trade Next,” and was created to visually articulate the company’s renewed focus on security, transparency, and user empowerment. The full video is available to view here: https://museaward.com/winner-info.php?id=235823 . “We are immensely honoured that our brand film for KuCoin has been recognized with a Platinum and two Gold Muse Creative Awards,” said Executive Producer and Creative Director Thomas J Elliott of Casual Hong Kong. “This project was a bold creative endeavour to translate the complex, dynamic world of cryptocurrency into a compelling human story about security and opportunity. To be celebrated at this level is a true testament to the power of collaborative storytelling and a shared vision with the KuCoin team to push creative boundaries.” KuCoin CEO BC Wong emphasized the central role of trust in the company's mission and the broader crypto ecosystem. “In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, trust is the foundation upon all meaningful innovation being built,” said Wong. “With ‘Trust First, Trade Next,’ we're reaffirming our commitment to delivering a platform where users can trade with confidence. “Partnering with Casual Films has allowed us to communicate this message authentically through powerful storytelling, and we’re proud of this MUSE Awards recognition that highlights our shared dedication to building lasting trust in the crypto space.” The short film tells the story of a father and son navigating ocean waves, a visual metaphor for the emotional and strategic balance involved in financial decision-making. Grounded in empathy, the narrative highlights how trust and consistency are fundamental to both family bonds and financial journeys. All entries in this season of the MUSE Creative and Design Awards were reviewed through a blind judging process to maintain objectivity. The jury featured respected figures such as Jeremy Smith, Design Director and Lecturer at Irving Smith Architects, and Florian Seidl, Design Manager at Lavazza.

Futures Lead Trading Activity Derivatives continued to dominate BTCC’s trading landscape, with $1.03 trillion in futures volume and $124 billion in spot trading. The company also boosted its Risk Reserve Fund by $2.4 million, raising the total to over $19 million. “This quarter's growth has been impressive. We've crossed 10 million registered users globally, and Bitcoin's rally certainly helped drive that momentum,” said Alex Hung, Head of Operations. Expanded Listings and Market Reach BTCC added several new tokens during the quarter, including ASTER, MYX, FLOCK, LINEA, and WLFI. The platform now supports over 400 futures pairs and 460 spot trading pairs. Altcoins such as XRP ($70B), SOL ($32B), and DOGE ($20B) also saw strong volume. NBA Partnership Highlights New Branding Push In a move to broaden its audience, BTCC announced a partnership with NBA All-Star Jaren Jackson Jr., marking the exchange’s first foray into sports sponsorship. “Partnering with Jaren allows us to connect with a broader audience and demonstrate that smart moves apply both on the court and in crypto trading,” said Aaryn Ling, Head of Branding.

Its recently launched News Center, offering live market updates and educational content, will be expanded to cover AI, macroeconomic trends, and trading insights. “As announced previously, we're tripling our workforce to 3,500 employees because we see a bigger opportunity here,” Hung said. “We want to build a platform that allows people to use crypto in their daily lives, not just for trading.” Now in its 14th year of operation, BTCC continues to position itself as a secure, transparent, and user-centric platform amid growing competition in the global digital asset space.

The expert noted that some traders believe the local top has already been reached at $126,000 and expect a drop below $100,000 in 2026. However, PlanB disagrees with this view. He reiterated that although the four-year halving cycle does influence the market, making predictions based solely on it is a mistake. According to the analyst, the Stock-to-Flow model indicates the average price of an asset over the cycle, not its peak or bottom. In the previous three cycles, the period of six months before the halving and eighteen months after it was indeed profitable, but this is not enough for a reliable forecast, the expert noted. PlanB suggested that Bitcoin’s peak may not occur in 2025, but instead in 2026, 2027, or even 2028. He believes this will depend on a fundamental “phase transformation” — a market shift that has not yet occurred in the current cycle. Among the technical signals that PlanB considers critical for the start of a “big jump” are: RSI has not yet reached 80 The realized price has not deviated from the 200-week moving average Outlook for the Coming Cycle He added that either the “big jump” is still ahead, or the market has transitioned to a more stable regime dominated by institutions and funds. In both cases, he believes this is positive for Bitcoin, and a major bear market without a strong upward move is unlikely.

Prices shift by the minute, trends turn overnight, and emotions can easily overpower discipline. That is why crypto portfolio management has become an essential part of modern investing. It offers a structured, data-driven approach to organizing, monitoring, and adjusting digital assets. What Is Crypto Portfolio Management? Portfolio management means allocating assets strategically to balance potential returns with acceptable levels of risk. In crypto, that means more than just holding Bitcoin or Ethereum. It involves diversifying across tokens, sectors, and even investment styles — from stable assets to emerging altcoins — and keeping that mix aligned with personal goals. A typical portfolio management process includes: Asset allocation: Deciding what percentage of the portfolio goes into each coin or token. Performance tracking: Monitoring price changes, overall profitability, and exposure levels. Rebalancing: Adjusting holdings as markets move to preserve the intended balance. Risk management: Limiting exposure to volatility or single-asset dependence. Traditional investors have long relied on tools that automate and visualize this process. In crypto, however, most platforms still focus narrowly on trading or price charts. That is where Clapp.finance is a next-generation tool that brings the same level of automation to crypto. Clapp Offers All-In-One Portfolio Management Solution Most crypto investors today juggle multiple apps: one for swaps, one for analytics, another for portfolio tracking, and yet another for fiat withdrawals. Managing performance across these fragmented platforms can be tedious and error-prone. Clapp approaches the problem differently. It is built as an all-in-one environment for crypto portfolio management , combining performance tracking, diversification, automation, and secure storage under one roof. While many exchanges merely let users swap or stake, Clapp gives investors the ability to plan, simulate, and execute long-term strategies with clarity. Real-Time Tracking and Actionable Insights Clapp’s foundation is constant visibility. Every portfolio includes real-time profitability metrics, showing how assets are performing at any given moment. Investors can track growth, profit, and allocation changes instantly — without exporting data or juggling spreadsheets. For deeper analysis, Clapp introduces Time Machine , a backtesting system built into the app. It includes two levels of simulation: General Backtesting lets users test combinations of assets against historical market data to assess how they would have performed over time. Rebalancing-Based Backtesting adds realism by modeling how periodic adjustments could have affected long-term returns. Source: Clapp app Together, these tools help investors make informed, evidence-based decisions — before committing capital. Time Machine stands out as one of the most valuable analytical tools among crypto portfolio apps. Automation and Smart Adjustments Even the most carefully designed portfolio drifts when markets move. Clapp’s smart rebalancing system handles that automatically. Users set their ideal structure once — for example, 40% Bitcoin, 30% Ethereum, 30% altcoins — and Clapp continuously maintains it. The app automatically reallocates assets when weightings shift, ensuring the portfolio remains consistent with the investor’s chosen strategy. This automation removes much of the emotional friction that often leads to poor timing decisions. It makes portfolio management proactive rather than reactive. Upcoming Tools: Risk Management and Flexible Investing Clapp’s roadmap introduces a new layer of sophistication. The upcoming risk management toolkit will include stop-loss triggers and other protective features designed to help investors control downside exposure. The platform is also expanding portfolio flexibility, allowing users to add or remove assets, make partial withdrawals, or convert entire portfolios into another asset — all without rebuilding from scratch. These changes reflect a growing demand for adaptability in fast-moving markets. Secure, Regulated, and Ready for Everyday Use Behind its functionality, Clapp is built with strong infrastructure. The app’s wallet and storage system use Fireblocks’ institutional-grade security, trusted by major financial institutions worldwide. Clapp operates as a licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in the Czech Republic, ensuring compliance with European regulations. The company is also pursuing additional licenses in Dubai, Slovakia, El Salvador, and Mauritius — signaling its intent to grow as a regulated, global platform. The Value of an Integrated Approach By merging portfolio management, fiat exchange, and secure storage, Clapp brings traditional investment discipline into the crypto world. Its combination of real-time data, historical simulations, automation, and regulatory protection transforms digital asset management from a fragmented process into a coherent system. For investors who want to manage crypto with the same structure and clarity as traditional assets, Clapp provides a single, unified space to plan, track, and refine strategies.

Coin Bureau shared a timetable showing when several asset managers are set to receive decisions or further action on their filings, presenting a clustered window that could carry broader implications for institutional accessibility to XRP. Key Dates for Major Applicants The schedule outlines a sequence beginning with Grayscale on October 18, followed by 21Shares on October 19, and Bitwise on October 20. Canary Capital is listed for October 23, WisdomTree for October 25, and Franklin Templeton on November 14. This succession of dates underscores how multiple firms are seeking to formalize XRP exposure through regulated investment products, concentrating attention on how the regulatory landscape may respond within a short timeframe. THIS WEEK COULD BE BIG! Will ETF approvals move the altcoin market? pic.twitter.com/K9Ynq4nx5r — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) October 19, 2025 Institutional Access and Regulatory Considerations The timing of these filings has prompted commentary around the potential impact of approvals, particularly in the context of broader market conditions and procedural constraints. One observer noted concerns regarding the disruption of government activity, suggesting that administrative delays could influence the outcome. Another pointed out that while ETF approvals may not drive immediate market surges, they play a significant role in shaping credibility. By offering structured, compliant investment vehicles, ETFs can increase confidence among institutional participants and create pathways for larger capital inflows over time . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What These Filings Represent While price speculation often surrounds ETF discussions, the underlying significance lies in formal market integration. Approval of such products would indicate recognition of XRP as an asset suitable for regulated markets, expanding its reach beyond retail access. Even if prices are not moved immediately, the presence of multiple prominent asset managers pursuing similar products signals sustained institutional interest. Each deadline will serve as a reference point for gauging regulatory posture and appetite for new digital asset offerings. Focus Shifts to Regulatory Outcomes With six distinct dates now clearly outlined, attention will turn to how decision-makers approach these applications. Whether approvals, delays, or requests for additional information are issued, each response will contribute to the broader narrative around digital asset legitimacy in traditional financial infrastructure. For observers, these developments are less about rapid price reaction and more about the long-term framework being built around institutional engagement with XRP.

On Monday, Argentina’s central bank announced it had inked a $20 billion exchange rate stabilization deal with the U.S. Treasury Department. The deal brought the total amount of U.S. assistance for the third-largest economy in Latin America to $40 billion. Argentina’s central bank stated, “These operations will enable the Central Bank of the Argentinian Republic (BCRA) to broaden its range of monetary and exchange rate policy tools, including the liquidity of its foreign reserves.” U.S. banks stall Argentina’s $20 billion loan over collateral According to a WSJ report, the banks are looking for a pledge or guarantee to ensure they receive their money back. The report confirmed that bankers are awaiting word from the Treasury Department over what collateral Argentina can offer them or whether Washington intends to support the facility independently. In the report, analysts said that the banks cannot take action without Washington’s support. They claimed the Treasury has been overseeing the larger package, even though banks typically set up these kinds of rescue facilities on their own. The analysts argued that if the banks’ collateral question is not answered, the lending facility, which hasn’t been formalized, might not come together. A U.S. Treasury spokesperson said, “discussions on this facility remain ongoing, and we look forward to sharing more details when these talks are complete.” The report also revealed that U.S. banks haven’t been lending to Argentina and have been shut out of the international capital markets for years. Successive governments have borrowed dollars or printed money rather than cutting spending to narrow chronic budget gaps, leading to runaway inflation. The third-biggest economy in Latin America has missed nine sovereign debt payments, including three since 2000. The IMF has provided the Argentine government with more than 20 bailouts to close the gap since the 1950s. The bailouts include a facility that was agreed to earlier this year. U.S. Treasury intervenes to stabilize Argentina’s falling peso As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement that the Treasury had “directly purchased Argentine pesos” as part of the program. Bessent stated that the peso’s decline and shrinking central bank foreign reserves have left the country in a “moment of acute illiquidity.” The Treasury secretary explained that the swap line would give Argentina immediate access to U.S. dollars in exchange for pesos. The Argentinian peso closed at a record low, down 1.7% on the day to end at 1,475 per dollar. Bessent admitted that the U.S. might suffer losses if the peso’s value declined during the swap period. The Treasury Secretary reassured policymakers that the USD-Peso exchange was being carried out via an Exchange Stabilization Fund under his direct supervision. Some nations, like Mexico, have pledged other assets to protect U.S. taxpayers in similar transactions. Brad Setser, the Whitney Shepardson senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), stated that the peso is steadily losing value. He added that the peso could continue to decline if the IMF compels the government to allow it to float and have its price determined by market forces freely. “The risks from these operations are unusually large. Should the peso depreciate, which many think is not only likely but necessary, the Treasury would be left holding assets that have fallen in value.” – Brad Setser , Whitney Shepardson, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Argentina’s currency is down 30% against the dollar this year. The currency depreciated further on Monday as Argentines braced for economic instability risks ahead of Sunday’s midterm elections.

According to Polkadot’s website insight, the Asset Hub is a Layer 1 bridge for non-native tokens and an experimental ground for decentralized asset management. Crypto.com activates stablecoin Asset Hub transactions post-migration The announcement comes exactly three weeks after Binance supported Polkadot and its sister network Kusama to migrate from Layer 0 metaprotocols to Asset Hubs. Developers of the protocols explained that the transition helps users manage their assets in the Polkadot ecosystem effectively by improving compatibility for token issuers and DeFi platforms.

A non-sufficient asset can only exist in an account that already has a minimum native balance, referred to as the Existential Deposit (ED). The threshold for Polkadot is 0.01 DOT, while on the Kusama Asset Hub, it is 0.000003333 KSM, both ten times smaller than the EDs on their respective Relay Chains. Sending a non-sufficient asset requires the recipient account to meet the ED requirement. On the other side, sufficient assets do not require the account to have any balance of the native token. Polkadot has mentioned that the first sufficient assets available on its Asset Hub are USDC and USDT, identified by asset IDs 1337 and 1984, respectively. Other assets available include Ethereum (ETH), wrapped Ether (wETH), Kusama (KSM), alongside foreign assets transferred via cross-chain bridges Snowbridge and Polkadot Kusama bridge. Asset Hub users are being asked to verify the authenticity of tokens before making any transactions, as anyone can create and name assets on the Asset Hub using similar names and try to defraud them. Crypto.com integrates service in Brazilian retail trading platform At the end of the previous business week, Crypto.com completed its integration with SpiderTrader, a Brazilian trading platform catering to thousands of active retail traders. The integration has made SpiderTrader the exchange’s first fully integrated broker in Brazil, granting the latter company access to Crypto.com’s trading engine on the SpiderTrader interface. “This partnership with SpiderTrader marks an important step in our strategy to collaborate with regionally trusted platforms. Brazil and the wider LATAM region are vibrant markets for crypto adoption, and this integration allows us to better serve local users through trusted partnerships,” Karl Turner, Director at Crypto.com Exchange, said in a recent press briefing. Company activities continue in South Korea In other related news covered by Cryptopolitan, Crypto.com announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with South Korean fintech company Travel Wallet. Travel Wallet, founded in the year 2017, has garnered more than eight million users and provides multi-currency wallets and global payment cards services in over 40 fiat currencies. Under the agreement, Travel Wallet will become Crypto.com’s preferred issuing partner in South Korea, which will see it launch a co-branded prepaid card for users to spend both fiat and crypto globally. The companies will also collaborate on integrating Crypto.com’s “crypto-as-a-service” (CaaS) technology into the Travel Wallet app to trade and hold virtual assets directly within the platform. Crypto.com also mentioned that the collaboration will jointly promote Travel Wallet’s KRW-denominated stablecoin in both ecosystems and improve cross-border payment efficiency through fast and low-cost transactions. “Travel Wallet will build a unified payment ecosystem encompassing foreign currencies, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins. This move is set to significantly elevate the global competitiveness of Korea’s fintech industry,” said CEO of Travel Wallet Kim Hyung-woo. Still within the Asian jurisdiction, the crypto trading platform revealed it will participate in the upcoming APEC CEO Summit Korea 2025 as the event’s official partner. The summit will take place in Gyeongju from October 28 to 31, where executives, policymakers, and KOLs will meet to discuss digital innovation, artificial intelligence, and economic trends.

Million Dollar Purchase Made!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/coinbase-makes-another-huge-cryptocurrency-move-million-dollar-purchase-made/,"Deals in the crypto sector have accelerated this year as the crypto-friendly Trump administration has encouraged companies to expand their businesses in the United States. At this point, the latest news came from Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States. Coinbase said today that it has acquired investment platform Echo in a cash-and-stock deal worth approximately $375 million and aims to bring fundraising tools to its platform. While the official statement came from Coinbase, Echo founder and online nickname Cobie, Jordan Fish, also confirmed the agreement on the social media platform X. Coinbase stated that the reason for investing in Echo was very simple and that by acquiring Echo, they wanted to create more accessible, efficient and transparent capital markets. Fish said Echo will remain a standalone platform under its existing branding for now, but he plans to integrate Echo's public token sale product, Sonar, into Coinbase. Coinbase explained that the deal will allow startups to secure custom-designed fundraising mechanisms tailored to their user bases and expand opportunities for investors to directly access early-stage projects. Coinbase also acquired a special NFT from Echo founder Jordan Fish for $25 million yesterday. Cobie had announced that if his “Up Only” NFT was purchased, he would resume his podcast, which he had paused since the FTX crash at the end of 2022. Coinbase has been attracting attention with its acquisitions this year. Its $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit, the largest crypto derivatives exchange, has garnered considerable attention.

According to Moonchaser, many XRP fans misunderstand how market value works by claiming that XRP has no market cap. The economist highlighted that XRP, like any other asset or cryptocurrency, is affected by supply, demand, and liquidity. Economist Explains The Reality Behind Price Reaching $100,000 Moonchaser, who studied economics and previously worked as a forex analyst, says that some people in the XRP community believe the token can reach extreme prices because they think it has “no market cap.” This idea, Moonchaser explains, is built on a misunderstanding of how currencies are valued and traded in real-world markets. In their view, economic principles apply equally to all assets, whether they are fiat money, commodities, or digital tokens. Related Reading: Dogecoin 3rd Cycle Explosion: Analyst Revels The Only Difference From Last Two Cycles Using the U.S. dollar as an example, Moonchaser notes that every currency has a measurable total value based on the amount in circulation and its global trade. The dollar’s value changes daily because of the balance between supply, demand, and liquidity. The same rule applies to the XRP price, which also trades across international markets and follows the same market laws. It means that XRP’s price is not free from limits and cannot simply rise endlessly based on belief or community hype. Moonchaser stresses that ignoring these realities creates unrealistic expectations within the XRP community. According to them, calling XRP a “currency” does not make it limitless in value; instead, XRP functions within the same market framework that governs all other financial assets. XRP Can’t Overtake Bitcoin Due To Market Structure In their post, Moonchaser further explains that market capitalization, which is price multiplied by circulating supply, applies to every form of tradable asset. Whether it’s fiat money, gold, or a digital coin, traders can always calculate the total market value. XRP is no exception to this rule. The economist points out that XRP has a measurable circulating supply and a price that moves through normal market discovery, where the balance between buyers and sellers directly determines its potential value, not wishful thinking. “Currency does not mean a capless asset,” Moonchaser says, reminding traders that every market has structure and limits. Related Reading: Why The Dogecoin Price Could Still Hit A 600% Rally To Send It Above $1.5 Moonchaser emphasizes that their comments do not spread fear or negativity toward XRP. Instead, they want XRP investors to understand the realistic economic structure behind its price movement. XRP’s market position depends on measurable data, not speculation about infinite growth. The economist concludes that this is not FUD—it is simply market reality based on economics. Through this explanation, Moonchaser helps the XRP community see that price growth depends on genuine demand and market behavior, not dreams of capless value. While XRP continues to be an essential player in digital finance, the idea of it reaching $100,000 or surpassing Bitcoin remains far from economic reality.

Visa’s latest research confirms this shift, illustrating how blockchain-based credit is transitioning from niche DeFi circles into mainstream institutional finance. The global payments giant’s newly released white paper signals a major milestone in the recognition of stablecoins as critical instruments for the future of global credit infrastructure. Visa’s Report Signals a New Era for On-Chain Lending Visa’s in-depth report , Stablecoins Beyond Payments: The On-Chain Lending Opportunity, explores how tokenized dollars are reshaping traditional credit systems. The company notes that the on-chain lending market has already originated more than $670 billion in stablecoin loans over the past five years, with borrowing volumes reaching around $51.7 billion monthly as of mid-2025. According to Visa, programmable stablecoins, those that integrate seamlessly with smart contracts, can unlock vast potential in lending, collateralization, and credit markets. Visa is now highlighting Ripple’s RLUSD alongside USDC & USDT in its new report on stablecoins powering on-chain lending. It’s a sign that RLUSD built for institutions, multi-chain, and regulation-ready is stepping beyond payments into real credit market infrastructure.… pic.twitter.com/1Hngu5OD0A — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) October 20, 2025 The report suggests that financial institutions are beginning to view these blockchain-based assets not merely as a means of transferring value, but as the building blocks of new credit architectures that operate continuously, without the constraints of legacy systems. Why Ripple’s RLUSD Inclusion Is a Landmark Development Among the stablecoins analyzed in Visa’s report are USDT, USDC, and Ripple’s RLUSD — a lineup that signals a profound recognition of Ripple’s growing institutional footprint. RLUSD, launched by Ripple in late 2024, was designed as a regulation-ready, multi-chain stablecoin aimed at meeting the liquidity and compliance demands of global financial institutions. Its inclusion alongside market leaders USDT and USDC in Visa’s data set underscores that Ripple’s dollar-backed token is being treated as a legitimate participant in institutional credit markets. This distinction suggests that RLUSD has progressed far beyond its payments-oriented origins, moving into use cases such as treasury management, institutional settlement, and on-chain lending infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As Visa frames it, the emergence of compliant, transparent stablecoins like RLUSD creates an environment in which financial institutions can safely integrate blockchain-based liquidity into their credit and risk management frameworks. BankXRP Draws Attention to Visa’s Recognition Crypto market commentator BankXRP was among the first to spotlight Visa’s mention of RLUSD on X. In their post, BankXRP highlighted how Visa’s decision to list RLUSD alongside industry heavyweights marks a pivotal step for Ripple, positioning the company to play a deeper role in credit market modernization. The observation quickly gained traction among XRP supporters and industry analysts, many of whom interpreted Visa’s acknowledgment as a sign that Ripple’s stablecoin is crossing into mainstream financial consciousness — not just as a blockchain payment asset, but as a tool for real institutional liquidity. A Glimpse Into the Future of Credit Infrastructure Visa’s research envisions a world where tokenized dollars like RLUSD anchor a 24/7, automated lending ecosystem powered by programmable finance. With stablecoins serving as real-time collateral and settlement instruments, the traditional boundaries between payments, lending, and credit issuance could blur entirely. For Ripple, this development is validation that its strategy — integrating compliance, liquidity, and interoperability into RLUSD — is resonating with the very institutions that will define the next phase of digital finance. If adoption continues along this trajectory, Visa’s acknowledgment of RLUSD could mark the start of a broader institutional embrace, where Ripple’s technology becomes a cornerstone of how global credit truly moves.

At the time of writing, ETH was priced at around $3,900, with a daily trading volume of $33.3 billion. The token has declined 4% in the last 24 hours and 3% over the past week. Price Sits Below Prior High Ethereum is trading just below its former peak, a level last tested before the 2020 rally. According to Cryptocium, the structure today looks nearly the same. In both periods, ETH paused at resistance after months of consolidation and later broke out with momentum. $ETH – History Repeats Itself Ethereum might seem slow right now, but in reality, it’s forming the exact same price action we saw back in the 2020 cycle. ETH is sitting at its previous ATH level, while the RSI is retesting its bearish trendline. Same thing, different time, pic.twitter.com/v7YV7pvzNM — Cryptocium (@Cryptocium_id) October 21, 2025 Notably, the current resistance area is around $4,000 to $4,100. Analysts have noted that ETH needs to close above this level to confirm any continued move. Until then, the price remains in a zone that has rejected attempts to climb higher. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) also follows a familiar path. During the 2020 move, RSI spent months under a trendline before breaking out just ahead of the rally. ETH is now testing a similar line again. Cryptocium described the setup as “ the same thing, different time ,” noting how the current RSI structure matches the previous one. If the RSI pushes through, it may suggest a shift in momentum. For now, traders are watching to see if the pattern holds. Traders Monitor $3,900–$4,100 Zone Javon Marks posted a chart showing Ethereum retesting the breakout zone near $3,900. He noted that a measured move from this setup could put ETH above $8,000 if the level holds. This type of projection uses the height of the previous range to estimate the next move. DaanCrypto said , “ You’d want to see some daily close above that point ,” referring to the $4,100 area. Other analysts added that a drop to $3,750 would open the door for long setups if a bounce follows. If not, the price may test lower ranges. Large Buyers Remain Active While price action has been mixed, institutional demand continues. BitMine Immersion Technologies made another Ether purchase this week. The company acquired $250 million worth of ETH from Bitgo and Kraken, as CryptoPotato reported . Funds also charted inflows. Ethereum-based products took in $205 million over the last week. A 2x leveraged ETP brought in $457 million, showing that large players are still positioning during this consolidation.

The move followed a weekend rebound from below $104,000, but analysts now warn that weak derivatives activity and upcoming U.S. inflation data could bring more turbulence. Short-Lived Uptick Reveals Market Fatigue At first, the price rise from $106,000 to nearly $112,000 seemed positive, but an assessment by analyst CryptoMe, shared on social media on October 21, shows that key market metrics tell a different story. According to the market technician, Open Interest, which reflects the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts, did not climb significantly during BTC’s price ascent. CryptoMe interpreted this as little appetite for opening new leveraged positions. Furthermore, the funding rate stayed below the neutral level of 0.01, and CME futures saw low volume, meaning traders weren’t willing to pay extra to keep long positions. “In short, there wasn’t the aggressive liquidity inflow or position-opening enthusiasm we were hoping for,” wrote the analyst. This technical weakness comes at a sensitive time. On Friday, October 24, the latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data will be released. All financial markets pay close attention to this inflation report, and in the past, it has caused big price swings in cryptocurrencies. A higher-than-expected figure could put a lot of downward pressure on Bitcoin, with the current market structure showing that buyers are mostly concentrated between $97,500 and $104,000, while the $100,000 level serves as an important psychological support. “There’s visible demand in this range. But don’t forget, psychological supports are not very strong supports,” CryptoMe cautioned. Meanwhile, CoinGecko data shows that Bitcoin has dropped 2.5% in the last 24 hours and 4.6% in the past week. The flagship cryptocurrency is now worth 14.5% less than its all-time high recorded on October 6, when it exceeded $126,000. Market capitalization stands at roughly $2.15 trillion, with daily trading volume around $60 billion. Analysts Split on Next Move Given its recent performances, observers are divided over Bitcoin’s next direction. Dr. Profit recently told followers that “bulls will be proven wrong,” predicting a drop below $101,000 soon, while veteran trader Bob Loukas warned that “complacency here is dangerous” as Bitcoin enters a critical point in its four-year cycle. On the other hand, CryptoAmsterdam suggested in a post today that BTC has “reclaimed the range low” and could still hold it as mid-term support, even though a deeper retrace is possible if that level breaks. On his part, Titan of Crypto noted that the monthly LMACD cross, still unconfirmed, could signal either a cycle top or the start of a bear phase.

After weeks of declines, market sentiment remains fragile, with many traders questioning whether the altcoin can find solid footing. However, some analysts still see potential upside — provided XRP manages to reclaim higher levels and attract renewed buying interest. Related Reading: The Bitcoin OG Is Back – Opens Massive Short After $30M USDC Deposit Fresh data from CryptoQuant sheds light on an important dynamic unfolding behind the scenes. Since the beginning of October, a clear shift has emerged in the behavior of XRP whales. According to the Whale-to-Exchange Flow chart for Binance, a surge in large deposits began on October 1st and persisted until October 17th, marking one of the most active periods of whale movement this year. This pattern typically signals mounting selling pressure, as large holders transfer assets to exchanges either to take profits or manage risk. Yet, for some analysts, these flows may also indicate repositioning — whales preparing for the next major move once volatility subsides. With on-chain activity rising and price volatility tightening, XRP now finds itself at a pivotal point where the next breakout — or breakdown — could define the rest of October’s trend. XRP Whale Activity Signals Selling Pressure According to insights by CryptoOnchain, the surge in XRP whale activity reached its peak on October 11th, when Whale-to-Exchange Transactions climbed to nearly 43,000 — one of the highest levels recorded this year. Such a sharp rise in inflows to centralized exchanges like Binance typically signals mounting selling pressure, as large holders prepare to liquidate positions, secure profits, or hedge against further downside risk. This wave of whale transfers aligns closely with the broader price trend. Since early October, XRP’s market structure has weakened, confirming that these on-chain movements were not random but rather part of a larger distribution phase. When comparing data, the timing is striking: the escalation in exchange deposits directly corresponds with a sharp price drop from above 3.0 to roughly 2.3, underscoring the weight of institutional or high-net-worth selling. Such coordinated behavior among large holders often sets the tone for short-term market direction. Historically, heavy whale inflows tend to precede local bottoms, as the liquidity created by sell pressure eventually attracts new buyers. However, for now, this pattern reinforces caution — suggesting that XRP remains under pressure until the outflow-to-inflow ratio flips back in favor of accumulation. If selling eases and outflows rise again, it could mark the early stages of stabilization. Until then, whale behavior remains a key signal to watch, especially as the asset attempts to recover from one of its steepest declines in recent months.

XRP Price Analysis: Bulls Struggle to Regain Momentum XRP is showing signs of short-term stabilization after weeks of selling pressure, trading around $2.42 at the time of writing. The recent bounce from the $2.30 support zone suggests that buyers are attempting to defend this key level, but the broader structure remains fragile. The chart shows that XRP continues to trade below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, signaling that the short- to mid-term trend remains bearish. The price failed to reclaim the $2.60–$2.70 resistance range, which now acts as a major supply zone following the sharp decline from early October highs near $3.0. The 200-day moving average, currently hovering around $2.55, is also capping upside momentum, reinforcing the difficulty for bulls to regain control. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Rely on STH Realized Price Support Cluster: Loss Could Trigger $100K Retest If XRP closes above $2.60, it could open the door for a retest of $2.90. However, losing the $2.30 support would expose the next key level near $2.00, where the market may attempt to find stronger demand. Overall, XRP remains in a delicate position — oscillating between potential recovery and further downside risk. The coming sessions will be decisive, as price action consolidates under heavy whale-driven selling pressure and uncertain sentiment.

The crypto asset’s multiple ETF applications signal growing institutional interest. In the filing, 21Shares stated that the Trust will issue common shares to track INJ’s performance, adjusted for liabilities and expenses. CF Benchmark Ltd. will calculate the Pricing Benchmark, reflecting INJ’s performance in U.S. dollars. The 21Shares team said the Trust will hold INJ to achieve its investment goals. The team also explained that the Trust’s staking model aims to maximize the portion of its INJ available for staking while controlling for redemption and liquidity risks. It added that the model determines an equal optimal utilization rate by balancing expected yield against potential costs. However, the Staking Services Provider will have no control over the amount of INJ the Trust will stake or the timing of its staking. 21Shares aims to provide investors with direct INJ exposure 🚨 BREAKING: 21Shares just filed for a new $INJ ETF. This is a major signal of growing institutional interest, making $INJ one of the few digital assets with multiple ETF products in progress. @21Shares is among the world’s largest exchange traded product issuers. pic.twitter.com/xjWSZJVmsT — Injective 🥷 (@injective) October 20, 2025 The company revealed in its October 20 filing with the U.S. SEC that the proposed INJ ETF will provide investors with direct INJ exposure. The ETF will hold physical INJ tokens in cold storage custody, and its regulated third-party custodians will be the Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, and BitGo Trust Company Inc. CoinGecko data showed that Injective’s trading volume surged 5.4% in 24 hours, hitting $79.4 million, indicating increased market activity. INJ’s price is currently $8.80, but it has ranged between $7.81 and $10.04 over the past week. Meanwhile, staking has reportedly remained strong even after price dips, signaling steady INJ holders’ confidence in the token’s future. The crypto community has also confirmed that retail and institutional participants are closely watching the token’s development. One crypto commentator noted on X that multiple ETF filings reflect increasing trust in INJ by institutions. The ensuing discussion reveals that Injective’s ecosystem is strongly supported by its committed user base. 21Shares’ application for an INJ ETF also represents growing interest in L1 blockchains. News about the application is also boosting the token’s market visibility and sentiment. The 21Shares team believes the industry should anticipate INJ access via their INJ ETF in the coming months. However, the Trust will not invest in derivatives. 21Shares’ filing strengthens INJ’s market position The injective blockchain is reportedly gaining attention due to its rising institutional interest and fast growth. The network’s team claims the L1 blockchain processes over 25,000 transactions per second using DPoS (delegated proof-of-stake) consensus. The Injective Council recently held its first meeting, which focused on improving the ecosystem’s strategic goals and governance. 21Shares said its ETF filing aligns with these expansion efforts, boosting Injective’s standing among established blockchains. The ETP issuer also believes long-term demand for INJ could increase as institutions continue to explore the crypto asset. The 21Shares team noted that investors are weighing staking opportunities as they evaluate INJ performance alongside potential ETF inflows. Meanwhile, the token’s price data and rising ETF interest signal new trading dynamics in the crypto industry. Institutional filings are also driving short-term liquidity spikes that encourage holders to increase INJ exposure or staking. However, the team warned that no INJ exchange is immune to risks, although the Trust does not buy or sell INJ on spot markets. The closure or temporary shutdown of INJ exchanges due to business failure, fraud, government-mandated regulation, or hackers and malware can reduce confidence in the Injective network or slow down mass adoption. The failure of spot markets or any other major component of the INJ ecosystem can result in adverse effects on INJ markets and could, therefore, negatively impact the Trust’s performance. Further, the team believes negative perceptions and customers’ manipulation of INJ spot markets may generally reduce confidence in INJ, resulting in greater INJ price volatility.

This short extension gives early participants one final opportunity to position themselves before trading begins on major exchanges, where heavier demand could quickly push prices higher. With the claim date locked for October 27 at 2 p.m. UTC, holders now have six days left to join this pre-listing phase. Post-TGE, Snorter Bot’s roadmap shifts toward a multi-chain expansion beyond Solana, enabling its trading engine to scan and capture breakout meme coins across other ecosystems. At $0.1083 per token, this marks what could be the last chance to grab SNORT before it goes live. Why Early Investors Are Stocking Up on SNORT at Presale Anyone who’s been following the Snorter Bot Token presale knows it’s shooting for the top of the Telegram trading bot race, competing head-on with Banana Gun, Maestro, and Trojan. Where Snorter sets itself apart, though, is in its technical foundation and speed. Built on Solana, it inherits the chain’s hallmark low fees and rapid transaction processing. And instead of using standard public RPC endpoints that often get congested during high-volume trading, Snorter operates through custom RPC connections, which are dedicated Solana nodes that prioritize its transaction flow. That architecture not only makes Snorter incredibly fast at executing trades but also gives it an edge in meme coin breakout detection. The bot continuously scans Solana’s live transaction queues, validator feeds, and liquidity pools, identifying new mints, liquidity injections, and sudden on-chain shifts that typically signal early-stage meme coin launches. Source: https://snortertoken.com/ Once those tokens are detected, traders can act instantly through Snorter’s Telegram interface, where they can place trades directly within the app. Despite its simplicity, the system’s accuracy comes from a multi-layer filtering protocol, where every detection is automatically screened for contract safety, liquidity depth, and red flags. Honeypots, rug pulls, and shallow pools are filtered out in seconds, leaving only tokens that meet Snorter’s on-chain safety standards. It’s this combination of speed, precision, and protection that has fueled Snorter’s explosive presale — raising over 4x more than Banana Gun — and why early access to the SNORT token could become one of the most valuable advantages in the trading bot space today. Post-TGE: Snorter to Launch AI-Driven Auto-Trading on Telegram Speed and precision mean little if a Telegram trading bot is confined to a single chain. With Binance-based meme coins recently stealing the spotlight, including one trader’s legendary 2,260x flip that turned a $3,500 币安人生 (Binance Life) trade into $7.9 million in just three days, cross-chain capability is now the new frontier. That’s what’s coming next for Snorter Bot as post-TGE, the project will begin its multichain expansion, first integrating with Ethereum, then branching out to Binance, Base, and Polygon. This step gives Snorter access to the most active meme coin ecosystems and places it ahead of competitors like Trojan, which remains limited to Solana. Feature-wise, Snorter is adding more tools directly within Telegram. One major update is the Portfolio Dashboard: by simply typing /portfolio, users receive a rich performance card displaying profit/loss, cost basis, and realized gains — all in real time, without leaving the app. Source: https://snortertoken.com/ Later in its roadmap, Snorter will introduce AI-assisted trading algorithms, enabling automated trade execution directly through Telegram. This feature will work alongside the existing copy-trading system. Additional DeFi partnerships are also planned to expand the SNORT token’s utility, which will include governance voting rights, allowing holders to participate in major protocol decisions and upcoming feature upgrades. Even a Fraction of Market Share Could Send SNORT’s Valuation Soaring The SNORT token sits at the core of a powerful trading system that could redefine how crypto traders operate. Over the past week alone, leading bots like Banana Gun, Maestro, and Trojan collectively handled $392 million in trading volume. If Snorter delivers on its goal of being the faster, smarter alternative, even capturing a fraction of that flow could send its current fully diluted valuation of $54 million soaring several times higher. Source: https://dune.com/whale_hunter/dex-trading-bot-wars That kind of potential, however, only belongs to those who move early. Snorter has opened one final six-day window to buy SNORT at its exact list price, offering a fair shot before it begins trading on major exchanges. Given the project’s growing attention and its ambitious roadmap, this could mark the last chance to secure SNORT at what may prove to be its lowest-ever price. Here’s the Final Opportunity to Get Ahead of Everyone Else To buy SNORT at its list price, head to the Snorter Bot Token site and buy the token using SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or a credit card. SNORT is also the project’s staking token and can be staked in its native protocol, which currently delivers a 103% dynamic APY . For the smoothest experience, consider using one of the best crypto wallets in the space in Best Wallet. Presale balances appear directly in-app, claiming is seamless once SNORT goes live, and holders get early access to new project listings through Best Wallet’s “Upcoming Tokens” feature.

A SPAC route is viewed as quicker and less complex than a traditional IPO. The hiring of a CFO (Justin Evans) from Goldman Sachs and a COO (Mike Wilcox) indicates preparations for a public company structure. The step would further develop crypto infrastructure and identify the best cryptocurrencies to buy – such as $HYPER and $PEPENODE – as the blockchain economy expands. Crypto wallet and exchange firm Blockchain.com is reportedly exploring a public listing via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Following in the footsteps of other planned public listings by major exchanges, such as Kraken and Gemini, Blockchain.com’s move attracts attention not only for the firm itself, but also for what it may signal about the broader cryptocurrency market momentum. Could this be the moment that infrastructure stocks and token projects align for a resurgence? With the specter of a SPAC in the background, the best crypto to buy now includes $HYPER , $BNB, and $PEPENODE – learn why as we go. Blockchain.com’s Background Blockchain.com, founded in 2011, has grown into a well-established name in the cryptocurrency space, offering wallet, trading, and custody services to millions of users. Over the years, the company has weathered multiple market cycles as one of the longest-running large crypto exchanges and built a substantial user base. Rather than pursuing a traditional initial public offering (IPO), Blockchain.com is reportedly weighing the SPAC pathway. A SPAC is a ‘blank-check’ company created to acquire existing businesses and bring them public more quickly. The advantages include quicker access to public markets, potentially lower complexity, and faster execution, all of which are very appealing in a volatile environment. However, the SPAC route comes with caveats: Increased regulatory oversight Investor scrutiny The challenge of delivering on public-company expectations Leadership and Readiness Blockchain.com continues to expand ahead of the potential SPAC. It beefed up its leadership, bringing in Justin Evans, a former Goldman Sachs finance executive, as CFO, and hiring Mike Wilcox as COO. On the technical development front, the company recently announced a partnership with Ondo Finance. Though negotiations over the SPAC are reportedly ongoing, no formal announcement has been made regarding deal structure, timing, or valuation. Crypto Market Environment Sets Up Best Crypto to Buy The timing of Blockchain.com’s move is noteworthy. After a difficult period, signs of life emerge. Regulatory clarity is improving, and public listing ambitions among crypto infrastructure firms are gaining momentum. Gemini completed an IPO in September, while Bullish achieved a public debut via a SPAC in August. Meanwhile, Kraken’s much-delayed IPO looks to be back on track under new leadership . Taken together, the picture is one of renewed confidence and optimism – enough optimism that major exchanges like Blockchain.com want to get to market sooner, rather than later. As Blockchain.com prepares, watch these three best crypto to buy for major gains potential. 1. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) – Mining Comes to Memes with Big Bonuses Don’t trade meme coins – mine them. That might seem crazy, but with PepeNode ($PEPENODE) it’s now possible. Buy meme nodes to outfit your virtual mining rig in a gamified mine-to-earn mechanism. Upgrade your facilities with the $PEPENODE token, and unlock bonuses in $PEPENODE – but also in popular meme coins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. You can also stake $PEPENODE during the presale, currently at a dynamic 677% APY. PepeNode is a meme coin, but one with a unique, gamified approach to earning more tokens. That makes $PEPENODE one of the more promising crypto presales, with the potential to bring together meme coin traders and blockchain gamers in one presale. Learn how to buy $PEPENODE and join the presale, which has already raised over $1.8M, featuring notable whale purchases of $91K and $18K . Our price prediction indicates that the token could surge rapidly from its current value of $0.0011094 to $0.0031, resulting in 180% gains. Visit the $PEPENODE presale page today. 2. BNB ($BNB) – Original Binance Project Now Grown to Top-4 Crypto Originally the utility token of the Binance Smart Chain, $BNB has long since outgrown Binance itself. The fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the world, BNB, boasts a nearly $150 billion market cap. The ecosystem encompasses dApps, DeFi protocols, bridges, and additional components. By some estimates, BNB Chain has more daily active users than any other blockchain. It’s also EVM compatible, meaning there’s always room to integrate BNB with other protocols and vice versa. $BNB itself is up 80% over the past year, sitting just north of $1,076; this represents better performance, percentage-wise, than even Bitcoin’s 67% gains. You can learn more about $BNB at the website . 3. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin’s Long-Awaited Layer-2 Upgrade Arrives What draws whale buys of $379K and $274K to a crypto presale? The only reason to invest that much is to get in on the ground level of a project with game-changing potential – and that’s just what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) offers with its Layer 2 upgrade for Bitcoin. The core idea is simple: deposit $BTC to a Bitcoin Canonical Bridge and mint wrapped $BTC on the Hyper Layer 2. This allows investors to deploy their wrapped $BTC across the entire crypto economy, from dApps to microtransactions. That’s because the Solana Virtual Machine – home of the canonical bridge – supports the complicated smart contracts that make DeFi possible. But Hyper isn’t just a Layer 2 ; it’s a hybrid solution that keeps final transaction settlement on the Bitcoin Layer 1, preserving the stability and security that helped make Bitcoin famous. With Hyper, actual Bitcoin microtransactions are possible, leveraging the lower transaction costs and faster speeds on the SVM. That’s the kind of utility and potential that can draw $24M to a presale. And with tokens expected to reach $0.02595 from their current $0.013145, investors who get in now could see 100% gains by the end of the year. Visit the Hyper presale page to stay up-to-date with the latest information. In the meantime, there’s every chance that Blockchain.com’s exploration of a SPAC listing is more than just corporate maneuvering. It could be a litmus test for the crypto infrastructure sector’s readiness for the public markets – and that could set the stage for $BNB, $PEPENODE , and $HYPER to soar.

The independent researcher wrote an X thread on Tuesday saying he tested the system to find “design flaws he could abuse,” during his investigations for fraudulent actors. Zashi is a self-custody crypto wallet developed by Electric Coin Co., the team behind Zcash (ZEC), a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency launched in 2016. The wallet allows users to send, receive, and spend ZEC while keeping their financial activity hidden from intermediaries, corporations, or government surveillance. ZachXBT wrote about how he tested Zashi’s integration with NEAR Intents because of the “recent hype,” wondering if it kept the same level of anonymity Zcash users expect from shielded transactions. Investigator identifies privacy flaw in moving SOL to Zcash In his experiment, ZachXBT bridged 1 SOL from Solana to Zcash using NEAR Intents to Zashi wallet. He then shielded the funds for privacy after confirming both the source and destination transactions. The blockchain security sleuth then used Zashi’s “CrossPay” feature, which lets users spend shielded ZEC and send equivalent value in another crypto, to fund an Ethereum address with 0.005 ETH. 3/ Now let’s say I want to anonymously fund an ETH address from my Zashi wallet with my shielded ZEC so I use the “Crosspay” feature via Near Intents to receive 0.005 ETH to the following address: 0x6dda3649f19191a9df465f4010019f2f59c34bc4 pic.twitter.com/5cMDG83MN9 — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) October 21, 2025 While the main transfer completed after several minutes, ZachXBT discovered an unexpected refund transaction of 0.001598 ZEC sent to the same transparent address from which he had originally shielded the funds. According to the well-followed crypto security investigator, the automatic refund created a visible link between his shielded and unshielded addresses, undermining the privacy that Zcash’s shielded system is meant to protect. Zashi Wallet Near Intents transaction reveals shielded address. Source: ZachXBT The refund transaction was publicly traceable on the Zcash blockchain and could have allowed anyone to match timing and amounts between the NEAR Intents system and the refund itself. “Someone can simply match up timing/amounts from the Near Intents address and identify ZEC refund txns, allowing someone to deanonymize your t-address you initially shielded ZEC from since it is static and refunds are not shielded,” ZachXBT surmised. Zashi Wallet promises updates to solve the traceability issue The Web3 security researcher revealed that the flaw came from how NEAR Intents handles refunds for cross-chain transactions. In his example, the Near Intents Zcash address used was publicly visible, meaning refund transactions were processed transparently rather than within Zcash’s shielded pool. Since Zashi’s integration reuses the same transparent address for refunds, the linkage becomes obvious to on-chain analysts. After identifying the flaw, ZachXBT said he contacted the Zashi development team, who acknowledged the issue and confirmed plans to introduce ephemeral addresses. These temporary wallet addresses will disappear after each transaction to reduce traceability, if the update is implemented as intended. They also told him shielded refunds will be included within NEAR Intents in a future update. Despite the flaw, ZachXBT coined Zashi an “enjoyable wallet experience for privacy,” noting that it fixes several user interface and experience issues he had encountered with Monero, another privacy coin . “I am considering offering a service for individual traders or boutique funds looking to anonymize their activity,” he said, adding that interested parties could contact him directly for a collaboration. When a follower told him his idea is similar to how cybersecurity consultants who are hired to breach secure systems to identify weaknesses, ZachXBT agreed. NEAR Intents protocol all-time volume reaches $2 billion NEAR Intents is experiencing an uptick in user activity and transaction volume that has now crossed $2 billion, according to data from Dune Analytics. Daily blockchain volume by month on the intent-based system has increased by 379%, with user counts surpassing 457,000 since September 21. NEAR Intents is a multichain transaction protocol that automates cross-chain actions through an intent-based mechanism. Instead of manually bridging or swapping tokens, users or AI agents acting on their behalf broadcast their desired outcome, such as swapping one token for another. In the last 24 hours, users have made $65 million worth of token transactions, with ZEC making up 10% of the grand total. The wallet currently supports two live features, Zashi Swaps and CrossPay, which went live earlier this month. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The company said diluted EPS was $1.01 and adjusted EPS was $1.12. It also reported adjusted EBITDA of $629 million, driven by gains from its crypto trading desk and investment positions. According to the earnings report, total equity is at $3.2 billion with $1.9 billion in cash and stablecoins by September 30. Galaxy’s trading volumes jumped 140 % compared with Q2, boosted by demand for spot and derivatives. The company also executed a $9 billion bitcoin sale totaling more than 80,000 BTC. Galaxy credited its performance to record trading activity and rising institutional participation. Galaxy expands Helios data center and secures major financing Construction of Helios, Galaxy’s massive data center in Texas, stayed on schedule through September, and phase I of the build was funded after Galaxy secured a $1.4 billion project financing facility, fully covering the $1.7 billion cost. The Helios project got another boost when CoreWeave signed a Phase II lease agreement and exercised its final option for 133 megawatts of additional power, bringing its total commitment to the full 800 MW capacity approved for artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. Galaxy said it received a $460 million equity investment from one of the world’s largest asset managers, generating $325 million in net proceeds to help fund Helios and general operations, earlier this month, but didn’t say who the asset manager is. The company also expanded the Helios property through a strategic land acquisition, increasing the site to over 1,500 acres with 2.7 gigawatts of potential future power capacity, which is currently being reviewed by ERCOT. Trading, lending, and asset management push quarterly records Galaxy’s Global Markets division posted a record adjusted gross profit of $295 million, lifted by strong crypto trading and a robust investment banking quarter. The average loan book expanded to $1.8 billion, reflecting higher demand from clients across its lending suite. In investment banking, Galaxy said it acted as co-placement agent and financial advisor on Forward Industries’ $1.65 billion private placement, and also advised Coin Metrics on its sale to Talos. The Asset Management and Infrastructure Solutions arm brought in $23 million in adjusted gross profit, supported by $2 billion in net inflows into its alternative investment products and ETFs. The company ended the quarter with $9 billion in assets under management and $7 billion in assets under stake, boosted by $4.5 billion in new digital treasury mandates that generate $40 million in annual recurring fees, said the earnings report. After the quarter closed, Galaxy’s staking division completed integration with a global digital asset custodian, allowing clients to stake directly through Galaxy validator nodes, opening a new distribution channel for staking services.

The new line will allow users to bet on short-term price movements for major cryptocurrencies. Chainlink’s Oracle network supplies verified real-time price data to determine the outcomes of the bets. The feature allows users to bet on whether the price will rise or fall within a 15-minute window and appeals to active users seeking fast engagement. Polymarket integrates Chainlink oracles to power its new prediction market Today, the online prediction firm revealed that the 15-minute crypto market operates like traditional prediction markets but at a higher frequency. Participants can bet on yes or no shares representing their predictions on short-term outcomes. The shares have been priced between $0 and $1. For instance, a yes share price of $0.4 means 40% market confidence that the asset will move up or down for the specified time. Bitcoin up or down? 15 minute up/down crypto polymarkets now live. Powered & secured by @Chainlink 🤝 https://t.co/mmH5M4uiCj pic.twitter.com/IWv6UuAsSv — Polymarket (@Polymarket) October 20, 2025 The latest feature uses Chainlink’s decentralized oracles that aggregate pricing data originating from several verified sources to ensure transparency, security, and resistance against manipulation. The oracles ensure that final settlement prices are accurate, removing reliance on centralized intermediaries. Polymarket will use USDC stablecoins to settle the markets on the Polygon blockchain network, favoring high-speed transactions and lower fees. Polymarkets operates non-custodial, meaning users can retain control of their assets throughout the trading period. The latest feature integration follows Polymarket’s growth in user participation. The firm’s weekly volume surged, especially during the election period in the U.S. The company now bets on the latest development to attract retail and professional traders who prefer faster market outcomes. The new market closely follows the short-term trading patterns used by traditional finance, minute-by-minute Options and Futures trading. The main difference in this case is Polymarkets’ design, which simplifies participation by removing the need for leveraged positions and brokerage accounts. The online prediction firm aims to make short-term speculations readily available to users while maintaining a blockchain-based system’s decentralized and transparent characteristics. Earlier this month, the firm received backing from institutions such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. ICE invested $2 billion in the platform to help integrate blockchain-based prediction systems into mainstream finance. Cryptopolitan covered that ICE’s investment was expected to strengthen Polymarkets’ legitimacy and relaunch in the U.S. market, boosting its valuation to $9 billion. Polymarket aims to operate under a trading strategy rather than a betting platform in this market. ICE distributes Polymarket’s event-driven data and sentiment indicators through its broader financial analytics offering. BTC, ETH, and SOL to feature in Polymarket’s 15-minute prediction market The new 15-minute markets are accessible via Polymarkets UI , which is optimized for desktop and mobile users. The firm reiterated that privacy and anti-fraud protections are intact, and all transactions occur on-chain. The platform implements sybil-resistance and transparency measures that safeguard participants against manipulation and false data submission. As of now, the online prediction platform has not revealed which assets will be incorporated in the short-term markets, but speculations online indicate Bitcoin, Solana, and Ethereum are expected to be included at the onset. The platform’s decentralized nature allows global participation while maintaining immutable and publicly verifiable data. Polymarkets currently uses the Polygon blockchain without a token. The firm relies mostly on viral topics to push trending pairs and additional volumes from sports predictions. The firm has a unique set of prediction categories that combine news and social media influence outcomes. The latest release follows a surge in Polymarket’s activity, with open interest reaching $172 million, its highest level in a year. The platform has also expanded to support Bitcoin deposits and continues to run on the Polygon network without a native token. Dune Analytics data also shows the firm has over 400K transactions in October alone, including Negrisk and CTFExchange Orders matched. With these developments, the firm hopes its ambitions to offer a token sale via airdrops or even an IPO next year in the U.S. may be valid.

However, while XRP remains a staple for many portfolios, growing buzz in the crypto community points toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi token currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 70% already sold out at $0.035 per token. Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as one of the best cryptos to buy right now, thanks to its dual lending model that integrates Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools and Peer-to-Peer lending, creating a more flexible, capital-efficient ecosystem. With over $17 million raised and a fast-selling presale, analysts see Mutuum Finance following a trajectory similar to early-stage DeFi giants, making it a standout choice for investors seeking the next major altcoin before the 2025 bull market kicks off. XRP Soars as Whales Buy and ETF Frenzy Intensifies Following a series of weeks of consistent downtrends, XRP has gained momentum once again, over 4% above recent levels as whale investors bought unprecedented quantities of the token. The subsequent decline in open interest in XRP futures to a level last seen in June is a warning that speculative trading is on the retreat, a signal that long-term investors are asserting themselves. In addition to the solid narrative, Ripple’s planned $1 billion treasury increase and increasingly prevalent talk of the possible XRP ETF have reignited long-term expansion hopes through 2025. With investor morale back and institutional interest still gathering pace, much of the market is also starting to explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a fast-growing project that’s gaining attention right alongside the likes of XRP.

The project is becoming increasingly popular with high-profile investors and even falls under the top crypto to buy this year. The project has already achieved its 6th presale level, and the token already broke through to $0.035 after it rallied 16.17% from stage 5. Growing investor interest has watched more than 17,330 investors invest more than $17.7 million so far in the presale. Phase 6 is currently 70% sold out but still has time to be filled with the countdown still on for investors to be included in the project before the phase becomes completely sold out. Missing phase 6 means paying 14.28% more when stage 7 kicks off at $0.04. Lending & Borrowing Protocol Debut The project will unveil its much-awaited lending and borrowing protocol , a monumental step towards reshaping DeFi. V1 will be launched on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and have some of the most important functionalities at the forefront of decentralized finance, such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. USDT and ETH will be featured on the launch date and subsequently become available for collateral, borrowing, and lending, offering a secure and hassle-free user experience. Mutuum Finance leaderboard is interesting record level investment by the investor base in the wake of its crowd-based reward platform. Largest purchasers in the past 24 hours alone have ordered $12,538, $11,667, and $1,027 worth of MUTM tokens each, illustrating increasing mania and frenzy on the platform. Top investors earn a $500 MUTM token day reward in an effort to boost repeated investment and long-term commitment. Ripple (XRP) is up again thanks to whale purchases and new optimism regarding an XRP ETF. However, while still popular with the markets, analysts recommend Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the best crypto to buy today. Now in Phase 6 of presale and 70% sold out, MUTM is currently priced at $0.035 and has rallied $17.7M from over 17,000 investors. With its dual-lending mechanism of Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract platforms, MUTM provides robust real-world DeFi utility, a feature that differentiates it from meme and hype tokens. Mutuum Finance V1 protocol goes live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, with ETH and USDT lending, mtTokens, and liquidators.

Cautious market mood traders remain hesitant despite ongoing interest in Chainlink’s ecosystem. Range-bound action LINK is consolidating between $17.70 and $19.07, awaiting a breakout or further pullback. On October 21, 2025, Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $17.89, showing a 5.68% decline within the past 24 hours. The token has trended downward from the day’s high of $19.07, approaching strong support at $17.70 as market pressure increases. This correction follows a week of mixed trading sentiment in the altcoin sector. Despite the decline, Chainlink continues to hold investor attention due to its expanding use in decentralized oracle networks and blockchain data integrations. Chainlink 1-day price chart: LINK testing key support levels On the daily chart, Chainlink’s price structure reveals a decisive rejection of the $19.07 resistance, indicating a temporary loss of bullish momentum. The asset’s current trading zone around $17.89 is positioned slightly above its immediate support at $17.70, indicating that buyers are defending this critical level to prevent further declines. The recent bearish candles form a mild downtrend, suggesting cautious sentiment following earlier gains. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing mid-range levels, reflecting a slowdown in buying activity but not a complete reversal of trend strength. Price movement below the 20-day moving average reinforces the possibility of short-term consolidation before a potential rebound attempt. If LINK holds above $17.70, the price could stabilize and attempt another move toward $18.50 and $19.07. Conversely, a decisive drop below support may trigger a deeper correction toward the $17.50 area. Chainlink 4-hour price chart: LINK short-term momentum weakens On the 4-hour chart, LINK reflects a consistent downward trajectory after failing to sustain gains above $18.98 earlier in the session. The token briefly rebounded near $17.80, but selling pressure quickly resumed, confirming weak short-term momentum. The repeated rejections near the $18 range show that bears maintain control in the intraday timeframe. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView Price action forms a descending channel, illustrating controlled selling rather than a sharp sell-off. The lower boundary of this pattern aligns closely with $17.70, a zone that remains crucial for maintaining short-term stability. If bulls successfully defend this level, LINK may attempt to retest resistance near $18.50 and $19.07 in the following sessions. However, if bearish momentum persists, the pair could extend its decline further, testing new short-term lows. Chainlink technical indicators: levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $20.52 SELL SMA 5 $20.03 SELL SMA 10 $20.99 SELL SMA 21 $21.16 SELL SMA 50 $22.09 SELL SMA 100 $20.90 SELL SMA 200 $17.66 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $21.32 SELL EMA 5 $21.95 SELL EMA 10 $22.74 SELL EMA 21 $22.92 SELL EMA 50 $21.21 SELL EMA 100 $19.11 SELL EMA 200 $17.65 BUY What to expect from Chainlink? Chainlink’s immediate focus remains on holding the $17.70 support, which will define its short-term trajectory. A strong defense at this level could attract buyers looking for a potential rebound toward $18.50 and $19.07, signaling renewed bullish activity. However, if the support fails, LINK may face additional downward pressure, extending losses toward lower price zones. Market participants are likely to monitor trading volume and broader cryptocurrency sentiment to gauge the strength of the recovery. As long as LINK remains range-bound between $17.70 and $19.07, consolidation is expected before a decisive breakout occurs. The following sessions will be crucial in determining whether Chainlink regains upward momentum or continues its corrective phase. Is Chainlink a good investment? Chainlink remains a strong project in the blockchain space, known for its vital oracle technology and growing integrations across DeFi and enterprise applications. Its steady development and expanding partnerships continue to support long-term potential. In the short term, LINK’s price near $17.89 reflects market caution, with trading likely confined between $17.70 and $19.07 until a clear breakout occurs. While fundamentals stay solid, investors should monitor market sentiment and price stability before making new entries. Why is the LINK price down today? The decline in Chainlink’s (LINK) price to $17.89, representing a 5.68% drop, is mainly driven by short-term profit-taking and broader market weakness across major altcoins. After several days of testing resistance near $19.07, traders appear to be locking in gains, leading to increased selling pressure. Additionally, uncertainty in the broader cryptocurrency market has contributed to a cautious sentiment, prompting investors to reduce their exposure to volatile assets. LINK’s inability to maintain momentum above key resistance levels has reinforced a corrective phase, pushing the token closer to its $17.70 support. The overall pullback reflects temporary market fatigue rather than a shift in Chainlink’s strong long-term fundamentals. Recent news In October 2025, Plasma, a layer-1 blockchain focused on stablecoin infrastructure, integrated Chainlink’s services through the SCALE program to enhance its oracle, data, and cross-chain capabilities. This collaboration enables developers to access Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), Data Streams, and Data Feeds, fostering advanced DeFi applications and cross-chain innovations. Following the announcement, Plasma’s native token XPL surged, while Chainlink (LINK) gained 6.7% over the week, reflecting heightened ecosystem momentum. The integration significantly strengthens Plasma’s stablecoin transfer mechanisms and developer engagement, with the network reporting $6.5 billion in assets within a week of launch. Drawing from past Chainlink integrations, this partnership is expected to drive both short-term market activity and significant growth in user engagement. And long-term growth across the DeFi landscape. Will Chainlink reach $50? Based on long-term forecasts from industry experts, Chainlink (LINK) is projected to reach $50 by 2027, indicating potential future price movements as its ecosystem and user adoption continue to grow. Will Chainlink reach $100? Chainlink can reach $100 by 2029, according to expert predictions, indicating a potential turning point. Does Chainlink have a promising long-term future?

With over $430 million raised, more than 27 billion BDAG coins sold, and a community of 312,000 members, the project has become one of the most closely followed Layer-1 launches of 2025. Meanwhile, altcoins like Litecoin (LTC) and TRON (TRX) are showing renewed strength. The Litecoin (LTC) price forecast points toward $180, while the Tron (TRX) bullish outlook reflects growing network activity and market support. These developments reflect a positive market shift, yet BlockDAG’s hybrid technology, expanding ecosystem, and approaching Genesis Day continue to highlight it as the best crypto to buy today. Litecoin Builds Toward $180 as Market Confidence Improves Known as “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” Litecoin (LTC) is regaining momentum as analysts forecast a climb toward $180 in the coming months. The Litecoin (LTC) price forecast shows strong upside potential supported by solid technical data and lasting fundamentals. Currently trading near $118, LTC maintains its position above the 200-day moving average, often viewed as a reliable sign of long-term strength. Analysts also note increased open interest in Litecoin derivatives, signalling growing market participation. Litecoin’s utility remains a key factor in its continued relevance. With low fees, quick transaction times, and proven network stability, it remains a top option for global payments. Despite competition from newer chains, its efficiency and resilience keep it steady in the market. Following its recent halving, supply has tightened, which may further support gradual appreciation. Analysts agree that consistent on-chain activity and Litecoin’s historic durability strengthen the case for it reaching $180 and holding its position among leading altcoins. TRON Shows Rising On-Chain Strength Ahead of Breakout At the same time, TRON (TRX) is preparing for a potential breakout as both its technical setup and network activity strengthen. The Tron (TRX) bullish outlook is supported by data showing its Total Value Locked (TVL) climbing to $6.37 billion, a 5.8% weekly gain, while active addresses have surpassed 18.2 million. These figures show growing participation and steady adoption across its ecosystem. TRON’s leadership in the USDT stablecoin market, now exceeding $77 billion in circulation, reinforces its key role within the digital finance landscape. Technically, TRX is trading around $0.35, with analysts watching resistance near $0.44. The Spot Volume Bubble Map signals accumulation, a pattern that often precedes major upward price moves. Experts suggest the current setup mirrors earlier TRON market cycles, including those in 2021 and 2024, both followed by strong rallies. With rising transaction volume and consistent network revenue, the Tron (TRX) bullish outlook indicates that a breakout could form in Q4 2025. BlockDAG’s $0.0015 Price Draws Strong Market Interest While Litecoin (LTC) and TRON (TRX) continue to capture attention, BlockDAG remains at the centre of crypto discussions. Its Batch 31 presale at $0.0015 is nearing completion, with over $430 million raised, more than 27 billion BDAG coins sold, 312,000 holders, 20,000 miners distributed, and over 3 million X1 app miners active worldwide. A key focus for the community is Genesis Day, set for November 26, 2025, which will mark BlockDAG’s shift from presale anticipation to full network operation. This event will debut the BlockDAG Explorer, a tool that provides DAG-based visualisations, real-time transaction tracking, and miner performance data. Alongside it, the Dashboard V4 will go live, featuring live analytics, order tracking, and leaderboards, reinforcing transparency and engagement across the ecosystem. Beyond technology, BlockDAG has strengthened its public visibility through its long-term collaboration with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team. This partnership integrates the BlockDAG brand across Formula 1® events, showcasing blockchain innovation to a global audience. Analysts describe this alliance as a key move for credibility and exposure, connecting digital innovation with mainstream audiences. With momentum building, BlockDAG will go LIVE on Binance this Friday, October 24, at 3 PM UTC, for an exclusive AMA highlighting insider developments, new roadmap announcements, and insights leading up to Keynote 4: The Launch Note and GENESIS DAY. Built on a hybrid PoW + DAG framework supporting 2,000–15,000 transactions per second, and with confirmed listings on over 20 centralised exchanges, BlockDAG stands out for its technical reliability and growing user base. Analysts predict post-listing prices could reach $0.05, with longer-term projections targeting $1, placing it among the best cryptos to buy heading into 2025. Final Thoughts As Litecoin (LTC) moves toward its $180 target and TRON (TRX) positions for a breakout, BlockDAG continues to hold the spotlight as one of the most discussed best crypto to buy options in today’s market. With Batch 31 nearly sold out at $0.0015 and Genesis Day approaching, BDAG offers a final entry window before its next stage begins. Its strong partnerships, hybrid Layer-1 infrastructure, and global participation distinguish it from speculative market players. Along with transparent presale tracking and global brand visibility through Formula 1®, BlockDAG’s roadmap highlights a credible approach to adoption and scalability. As the crypto market moves into another growth phase, few projects combine momentum, technology, and legitimacy as effectively as BlockDAG. For those watching the evolution of next-generation Layer-1s, BDAG’s steady progress and community-driven expansion make it the best crypto to buy as 2025 approaches.

Vitalik’s Unexpected Admission In the short video clip, Vitalik Buterin is seen reflecting on the early vision of blockchain networks and how they compare to Ripple’s architecture. He remarks that while people often speak of “cryptocurrency 2.0” as the Internet of Value, it is actually Ripple that fulfills that description. He went further to clarify that Ethereum, unlike Ripple, functions as “an arbitrary processor for state transaction functions” rather than a dedicated global value network. Vitalik Realized #XRP Beats #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/CRWFRU8Ped — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 21, 2025 The resurfaced statement, though made nearly a decade ago, underscores a critical differentiation that many in the crypto industry have since come to acknowledge: Ripple designed the XRP Ledger (XRPL) specifically to facilitate instant, low-cost value transfer, a task that neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum was originally optimized for. Ripple’s Edge in the Payments Race While Bitcoin was built to serve as a decentralized, censorship-resistant store of value, Ripple’s technology was engineered with a practical mission: to modernize the global payments infrastructure. The XRPL enables near-instant settlement, minimal fees, and seamless liquidity management across currencies and borders. This distinction has made XRP a preferred choice for institutions and fintech firms seeking efficiency in cross-border payments. Ripple’s growing ecosystem of partnerships with banks, payment providers, and even governments reflects the real-world validation of its design philosophy, one that Vitalik himself once acknowledged, long before the term Internet of Value became a mainstream narrative. Levi Rietveld Revives the Debate By reposting this historical clip, Levi Rietveld reignited discussions about the core purpose of various cryptocurrencies. His post framed Buterin’s words as a subtle yet powerful recognition that XRP’s architecture solves problems Bitcoin never intended to address. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Rietveld’s timing is notable; it comes amid a period of heightened attention on Ripple’s institutional expansion and increasing speculation about XRP’s growing role in global financial networks. His commentary positions XRP not merely as an alternative crypto asset but as a pivotal infrastructure layer that aligns with the financial industry’s evolving needs. What This Means for the Crypto Landscape The resurfaced clip doesn’t diminish the significance of Bitcoin or Ethereum, but it does highlight how different blockchains excel in different domains. Bitcoin remains the undisputed leader in digital scarcity and store-of-value properties , while Ethereum continues to dominate decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ripple and the XRPL, however, stand out as purpose-built systems for the movement of value — the very use case that Vitalik once identified as Ripple’s defining advantage. Levi Rietveld’s post has therefore sparked more than nostalgia — it has revived a deeper discussion about crypto utility versus ideology. As Ripple continues to expand its payment infrastructure globally, Vitalik’s decade-old remark now feels prophetic. In the realm of utility, efficiency, and real-world adoption, it seems even the Ethereum co-founder once realized what many institutions are discovering today: when it comes to moving value seamlessly across the world, XRP may indeed beat Bitcoin.

Here Are the Details…,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/blackrock-attracts-major-bitcoin-btc-whales-to-wall-street-here-are-the-details/,"BlackRock and other asset managers are luring Bitcoin whales to Wall Street, Bloomberg reported. Accordingly, large whales in the US who have been holding large amounts of Bitcoin for a long time have begun converting their spot BTC assets into ETFs. BlackRock is leading the way on this issue, and BlackRock's Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, said the company has already facilitated the conversion of over $3 billion worth of Bitcoin into its ETF. This July, a regulatory change allowed large investors to transfer their Bitcoin into an ETF and trade it for shares. At that point, both the IRS and SEC changed rules in July to allow investors to convert their Bitcoin directly into coins and into ETFs without paying taxes. Following this rule change, large Bitcoin holders began shifting their funds to Wall Street ETFs. BlackRock has completed over $3 billion worth of ETF conversions to date, while demand for Bitwise and Galaxy is also increasing. BlackRock's Mitchnick declined to comment on the number of trades whales made under the IBIT ETF, but said greater clarity from regulators would increase volumes and the participation of major banks. Mitchnick added that client demand ranges from investors looking to move just 20% of their Bitcoin into an ETF to those looking to transition entirely to TradFi. *This is not investment advice.

Speaking Tuesday at the Payments Innovation Conference in Washington, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the central bank is preparing to take an active role in what he called a “revolution transforming payments.” Christopher Waller told attendees that the Fed “intends to be an active part of that revolution,” adding that he’s asked staff to explore a “payment account” model — a potential “skinny” master account that would grant firms access to the Fed’s payment rails. According to remarks shared at the event, Waller said the agency must learn how to merge new payment technologies with the traditional banking system. The conference was the first of its kind for the Fed, bringing crypto into its official agenda for the first time. It set a serious tone around how the U.S. financial infrastructure could adapt to stablecoins, AI-based payments, and tokenized systems that are now growing beyond regulatory reach. Fed pressed to modernize systems as crypto and AI collide At 9:50 a.m. ET, a high-profile stablecoin panel began, led by Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital, alongside Charles Cascarilla from Paxos, Tim Spence of Fifth Third Bank, Fernando Terres from DolarApp, and Heath Tarbert of Circle. Their message was clear: the Fed must upgrade its payment infrastructure and define clearer rules for crypto. Sergey Nazarov, co-founder and CEO of Chainlink, said the Fed’s systems need to become interoperable with stablecoins and tokenized deposits. “The payment landscape represents the buy side of the digital asset economy,” Nazarov said, adding that strong risk frameworks would help the U.S. stay competitive in global payments. Jackie Reses, CEO of Lead Bank, warned that innovation without security could end in disaster. She said AI-driven fraud and deepfake scams could “destabilize trust” if not addressed properly. “It’s always going to be great, until everybody’s grandma is defrauded,” she said, urging the Fed to move cautiously as it integrates AI into financial systems. Michael Shaulov, CEO of Fireblocks, shifted the discussion to economics, warning that stablecoins could reshape credit markets and influence how the Fed conducts monetary policy. Jennifer Barker, global head of treasury services at BNY, followed by outlining what regulators need to prioritize: 24/7 payment rails, technical standards, fraud detection, and a framework for liquidity and redemption in crypto-linked deposits. Bridging banks with crypto’s real infrastructure By 9:30 a.m. ET, before the second session began, Nazarov addressed one of the biggest hurdles: interoperability. He said existing financial networks remain fragmented and outdated, with problems in compliance, identity verification, and accounting systems. Nazarov told Fed officials that a hybrid model (one combining current financial infrastructure with modern regulatory frameworks) could come to life within five years. Reses, who returned to speak again, didn’t mince words about how far behind traditional banks still are. She said most institutions lack the wallet infrastructure and transaction processing systems needed to manage crypto on-ramps and off-ramps. Even though KYC systems have matured for large institutions, she added that retail users remain shut out of easy access to these tools. Reses also predicted that the stablecoin ecosystem will grow naturally through market demand, not by centralized design.

53462594,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=841120,1761066043,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/53462594.jpeg,"Pundit Outlines The Possibility Of The XRP Price Getting To $1,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-getting-to-1000/,"A recent post by XRP commentator Remi Relief on the social media platform X has looked into the possibility of XRP’s price reaching the $1,000 price level. XRP is currently trading well below even the double-digit mark. However, according to this crypto commentator, XRP can get to $1,000, and the world doesn’t need to wait until 2030 for this to happen. Vision Of XRP’s Global Purpose In his post, Remi Relief questioned the widespread belief that a $1,000 price target could only be achieved by XRP by 2030. The timeline for XRP to reach $1,000 is going to be far less than that, with the analyst noting that the global economy is moving too quickly for it to take that long. He described the altcoin’s rise as something far bigger than predictions, and this is because the cryptocurrency is set to play an important role in stabilizing the world’s financial system. Related Reading: XRP Price To Crash 40%? Analyst Reveals Worst-Case Scenario Remi Relief’s outlook places XRP at the core of a growing realignment in the world’s financial system. “It’s going that high for the world’s sake,” he said. He contends that the cryptocurrency’s growth is tied to a global effort to rebalance debt and liquidity. Hence, the recent price crashes we’ve seen with XRP and other cryptocurrencies are a deliberate play by institutional players to accumulate more XRP while smaller investors capitulate. According to Remi Relief, these shakeouts are deliberate and designed to clear the market so that major entities can assume dominance before the price finally explodes. He also suggested that political resistance, particularly from the Democratic Party in the United States, could slow or suppress XRP’s ascent, as maintaining control over the traditional banking system aligns with their interests. If such resistance succeeds, the token might fall short of the $1,000 target but could still reach between $100 and $300 before stabilizing. Nonetheless, this is an acceptable outcome given the current XRP price levels. What Must Align For The Altcoin To Reach $1,000 Extraordinary developments in both market structure and adoption would be required in order for XRP to reach a four-digit price level. Predictions like these, as we’ve seen from many XRP enthusiasts, are dependent on whether the token gains widespread adoption in the world’s financial ecosystem. Related Reading: XRP’s Most Important Week In History: Here’s What’s Coming For Ripple Institutional integration would have to expand to a scale where XRP becomes an indispensable liquidity bridge for global payments, central bank settlements, and large-value transfers. At the same time, demand from major financial institutions, including banks, fintech companies, and possibly even governments, would need to grow exponentially in order for this to be reflected in the XRP price. At the same time, a reduction in the liquid supply would be needed. This could happen through large-scale lockups, increased network utility, or widespread adoption in tokenized asset systems that reduce the circulating supply of XRP. In another post on the social media platform X, Remi Relief projected that the altcoin’s price could surge to $1,700 if it repeats its 2017/2018 performance. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.42.

The Binance Coin (BNB) price has jumped to $1,300, reclaiming third place in market capitalization, while the PEPE coin price edges closer to a breakout that could set fresh highs. Amid this market strength, BlockDAG’s $0.0015 special price offer with the TGE Code has captured attention, signaling its final presale stage ahead of the awaited Genesis Day on November 26. Excitement for these top crypto coins continues to grow across online communities and global trading platforms. Each holds a unique position: BNB for its institutional strength, PEPE for its community-driven rally, and BlockDAG (BDAG) for its expanding hybrid Layer-1 design built for scalability. As the market heads into its final quarter of 2025, these combined factors highlight how innovation and liquidity together are shaping crypto’s next major cycle. PEPE Coin Targets Its Key Breakout Level The PEPE coin price is now nearing a key resistance zone after an extended consolidation period. Currently valued near $0.00001, it is forming a bullish wedge pattern that hints at potential upward momentum. Analysts suggest that a confirmed move above $0.00002 could push the PEPE coin price toward $0.00003, potentially setting a new all-time high. After a quiet first half of the year, renewed enthusiasm for top crypto coins like DOGE and PEPE has drawn traders back into meme markets. Sustaining support above $0.000008 remains crucial for this pattern to hold. If the PEPE coin price clears resistance with solid buying volume, analysts expect a strong meme-coin wave in Q4 2025. The community is closely watching this possible breakout. A decisive move could turn overall sentiment bullish, positioning PEPE among the top crypto coins to watch as 2025 comes to a close. BNB Hits $1,300 and Secures Third Place in Market Ranking The Binance Coin (BNB) price has surged to $1,326, overtaking XRP to become the third-largest cryptocurrency with a market value surpassing $182 billion. The coin recorded an impressive 28% weekly rise, adding over $40 billion in capitalization and outperforming Bitcoin’s smaller 5% increase. Reports indicate that CEA Industries now holds 480,000 BNB tokens valued at about $585 million, aiming to accumulate 1% of BNB’s total supply before the year ends. This move reflects strong confidence in Binance’s expanding ecosystem. With over 60 million monthly active addresses on BNB Chain and new government-supported initiatives in Kazakhstan, BNB’s fundamentals remain solid. The current price movement has also drawn comparisons to its 2021 rally, suggesting possible continued gains. Whether driven by increased usage or speculative activity, Binance Coin remains one of the top crypto coins fueling the market’s bullish tone in Q4 2025. BlockDAG’s $0.0015 Price and TGE Code Begin the Final Phase While the Binance Coin (BNB) price and PEPE coin price remain at the center of exchange discussions, BlockDAG is preparing for its most significant milestone yet, Genesis Day, scheduled for November 26. Currently in Batch 31 with a special presale price of $0.0015, the project has raised over $430 million, ranking among the most successful presales of 2025. BlockDAG will connect with Binance in a highly anticipated AMA on Friday, October 24, at 3 PM UTC. This milestone session promises roadmap progress, insider updates, and a closer look at Keynote 4 and GENESIS DAY. With BDAG holding at $0.0015 in Batch 31, code “TGE” is the last chance to maximize earnings before the dashboard upgrade and price increase. The introduction of the TGE Code marks the last acceleration phase before the mainnet launch and exchange listings. It rewards early buyers with a rank-based airdrop system, giving them priority access once trading begins. Beyond the growing interest, BlockDAG continues to make measurable progress. Global distribution of its mining devices has scaled, with more than 20,000 X-Series units shipped and operational worldwide. Together with 3.5 million X1 mobile app users, these figures highlight how fast the ecosystem is expanding. From a technical standpoint, EVM compatibility remains one of its strongest advantages. This feature enables Ethereum-based projects to shift smoothly to BlockDAG, gaining lower transaction costs and faster performance. Combined with its hybrid PoW and DAG design, developers can deploy smart contracts easily while ensuring scalability and reliability. As the top crypto coins compete for visibility, BlockDAG’s $0.0015 presale and TGE Code stand out for their focus on openness, verified hardware, and active adoption. With Genesis Day fast approaching, its progress reflects not just excitement but readiness to enter the market with real functionality from day one. Final Takeaway! The rising momentum across top crypto coins shows where market interest is heading. The PEPE coin price is nearing a potential breakout, signaling possible volatility and opportunity. The Binance Coin (BNB) price remains strong above $1,300, supported by consistent network expansion and global participation. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s $0.0015 presale price continues to attract attention as it moves toward Genesis Day, backed by tangible results like shipped miners, EVM support, and a confirmed launch roadmap. Together, these shifts highlight the diversity shaping Q4’s crypto outlook, blending meme-driven excitement, strong network infrastructure, and growing adoption. As the countdown continues, one fact is clear: whether it’s PEPE’s humor, BNB’s dominance, or BlockDAG’s precision, these three represent the driving energy behind the top crypto coins leading the market into 2025’s final quarter.

53462628,https://bitzo.com/2025/10/ethereum-price-prediction-eth-slips-below-4000-bulls-are-trapped,1761066051,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/53462628.jpeg,"Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Slips Below $4000, Bulls are Trapped",https://bitzo.com/2025/10/ethereum-price-prediction-eth-slips-below-4000-bulls-are-trapped,"Ethereum has once again slipped below the $4,000 mark, triggering widespread liquidations and highlighting mounting selling pressure in a risk-averse market. After multiple failed attempts to close above the critical $4,100 resistance, traders now face renewed downside risks as momentum indicators turn bearish. Outset PR's proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence offers a comprehensive analysis of crypto-native media performance, analogous to how crypto traders monitor fluctuations in ETH pricing. This capability enables PR campaigns to be strategically aligned with prevailing market trends and contexts. Repeated Rejections Trap Bulls at Key Resistance For the past week, Ethereum has struggled to break above the $4,100–$4,200 zone — a region many analysts associate with its 2020 breakout pattern. This persistent rejection has effectively trapped bullish traders, leaving leveraged positions vulnerable to liquidation. Source: coinmarketcap The RSI at 44.47 signals weakening momentum, while the MACD histogram (-24.68) confirms a bearish divergence, reinforcing the case for further correction. ETH is now retesting the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $3,954 — a crucial support level. A clear break below could open the path toward $3,750, a deeper retracement level last seen during early Q3 consolidations. Derivatives Show Risk-Off Behavior Market data underscores growing caution among traders. The crypto fear index sits at 33, reflecting elevated fear and risk aversion. Meanwhile, derivatives open interest dropped 3.26%, a sign that participants are scaling back leverage exposure amid uncertainty. ETH’s 24-hour liquidation heatmap recorded over $210 million in long positions wiped out near $4,000, intensifying bearish sentiment. This wave of forced selling has compounded volatility, pushing 7-day implied volatility to 47% — the highest in nearly two months. Traders appear to be unwinding positions aggressively rather than accumulating at dips, suggesting that short-term sentiment remains defensive. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Macro Headwinds Amplify Selling Pressure Ethereum’s technical weakness is unfolding against a backdrop of broader macro uncertainty. Rising Treasury yields, risk-off positioning in global markets, and a stronger U.S. dollar have collectively weighed on crypto liquidity. As Bitcoin dominance climbs, capital continues rotating out of altcoins, leaving ETH and other major assets exposed to deeper pullbacks. Unless Ethereum quickly reclaims the $4,100 resistance zone, the path of least resistance appears to remain downward. Short-term traders are now watching for reactions at $3,950–$3,750 to gauge whether the market can stabilize — or whether a deeper correction is in play. Outlook: Bulls on the Defensive In the near term, Ethereum’s outlook remains fragile. Technicals confirm a loss of bullish structure, derivatives data reflect reduced appetite for leverage, and sentiment has turned fearful. While oversold conditions could prompt a temporary bounce, sustained recovery will likely depend on broader market stabilization and a confirmed close above $4,100. Until then, ETH bulls remain trapped, and volatility may continue to dominate short-term price action. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The trader opened a 4x leveraged long position worth $35 million, equivalent to 9,082 ETH, at an entry price of $3,875, according to onchain data shared by Lookonchain on October 21. Despite a minor unrealized loss of about $112,619 (-1.28%), the trader remains fully committed to a long position, maintaining 100% exposure to Ethereum. This trader, with $3.2M in total profit and a 100% win rate, just opened a 4x long on 9,082 $ETH ($35M). https://t.co/tNbDLgKwkV pic.twitter.com/AmFvE64snV — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 21, 2025 Historical data from the same wallet shows an impressive streak of profitable trades. In October alone, the trader secured multiple six-figure wins, including $1.14 million from a long ETH position closed on October 20 and another $1.38 million from a Bitcoin ( BTC ) long earlier in the month. Interestingly, the trader’s bullish outlook on Ethereum comes at a time when the second-largest cryptocurrency faces heightened volatility across the broader market . Ethereum rebounding Since the position was opened, Ethereum has shown renewed strength, reclaiming the $4,000 mark. The rebound coincides with easing ETF outflows and increased whale accumulation ahead of the U.S. CPI report on October 24. Outflows fell to $145 million from $311 million last week, signaling reduced selling pressure as traders hedge inflation risks with ETH. At the same time, excitement around the upcoming Fusaka upgrade on December 3, which is expected to double Layer 2 data capacity and cut fees by 40%, has added to bullish momentum.

At this point, although Bitcoin has risen today, it has continued to decline despite its traditional upward trend in October and is still looking for direction. Analyst James Van Straten said that Bitcoin continued to struggle in October, which is known as one of the strongest months in history. The analyst noted that Bitcoin is moving sideways between its 200-day and 365-day simple moving averages (SMA), adding that the $103,000 support level is critical. Stating that the 200-day SMA has mostly served as support for Bitcoin since the 2023 cycle began, the analyst stated that when this level cannot be held, the 365-day SMA acts as secondary support. Stating that the 365-day SMA is located at $100,367, the analyst said that Bitcoin is stuck between the 200 and 365-day SMAs. “While investors generally expect a price increase in October, market sentiment has so far failed to meet those hopes. BTC consolidated between the 200-day SMA of $107,846 and the 365-day SMA of $100,367. This is the fourth time this cycle that Bitcoin price has been stuck between these two averages, and this sideways trend could last for months. The analyst also noted that the 200-day SMA is often used as a dividing line between bull and bear markets, saying, “Breaking above the 200-day SMA is the key to a short-term recovery and trend reversal. However, if it fails to break above this line, a prolonged sideways movement is likely to continue.” The analyst recently noted that key levels to watch for Bitcoin include $103,509 (2025 investor cost basis), $100,000 (psychological basis), and $112,100 (short-term cost basis). *This is not investment advice.

53462728,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87140,1761066320,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Time Traveler to XRP Holders: You Are Richer Than 70% of the Rich in the USA Right Now,https://timestabloid.com/time-traveler-to-xrp-holders-you-are-richer-than-70-of-the-rich-in-the-usa-right-now/,"A provocative claim is stirring intense debate across the crypto community. According to a post by Time Traveler on X, those holding XRP today are “richer than 70% of the rich in the USA.” The statement immediately caught attention—not just for its audacity, but for what it implies about how the digital economy is redefining wealth itself. Beneath the headline lies an eye-opening comparison between the value of XRP holdings and the net worth of America’s upper class, a comparison that, surprisingly, isn’t as far-fetched as it sounds. The Viral Statement That Sparked Conversation Time Traveler’s post struck a chord because it challenges the traditional metrics of affluence. For decades, wealth in America has been measured in dollars, assets, and ownership stakes. But Time Traveler’s comment reframes that narrative, suggesting that crypto holdings, particularly XRP, can propel ordinary investors into wealth brackets once reserved for the elite. His remark is not merely speculative hype; it’s a reflection of the shifting landscape where digital assets increasingly rival traditional stores of value. If you hold XRP, you are richer than 70% of the rich in the USA right now. — 𝚃𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚃𝚛𝚊𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚛 (@Traveler2236) October 20, 2025 Defining “The Rich” in the United States To understand the scale of Time Traveler’s assertion, it’s essential to define what “the rich” actually means. According to recent data from the Federal Reserve’s 2023 Distributional Financial Accounts, the top 10% of U.S. households by net worth begin at around $1.6 million. Within that group, the 95th percentile—roughly the midpoint of the top 10%—has an estimated net worth of $3.8 million, while households at the 97th percentile typically possess between $4 million and $6 million. So, when Time Traveler says XRP holders are richer than 70% of the rich, the implication is that some of these holders have net worth exceeding that of about 97% of the American population. It’s a striking statement that demands a closer look at XRP’s market value and what kind of holdings could justify such a comparison. The Current Value of XRP and Its Implications As of report time, XRP trades at approximately $2.42, maintaining its position among the top-ranked digital assets by market capitalization. This valuation forms the basis for the wealth comparison. If one were to hold around 1.6 to 2 million XRP, that would translate to a dollar value between $3.8 million and $5 million, a range that places the holder within the upper few percentiles of U.S. wealth distribution. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In practical terms, this means that early XRP investors, particularly those who accumulated during its early years when the token traded for mere cents, could now find themselves sitting on portfolios that rival those of established millionaires. Time Traveler’s post, therefore, is not an exaggeration but a mathematical observation grounded in current economic realities. The Bigger Picture: Wealth, Volatility, and Digital Transformation While Time Traveler’s claim holds for certain holders, it doesn’t imply that every XRP investor shares that level of affluence. Cryptocurrency remains a volatile asset class, and wealth measured in tokens can fluctuate dramatically within hours. However, the underlying message of the post is deeply significant. It highlights how blockchain technology and early digital adoption are dismantling traditional barriers to wealth creation. In a financial world once dominated by legacy systems, crypto assets like XRP are creating parallel pathways to prosperity . A Redefinition of Wealth Time Traveler’s viral statement may sound sensational, but it speaks to a broader transformation underway in global finance. For a select group of XRP holders, the math genuinely checks out; they stand wealthier than much of America’s elite. More importantly, the post encapsulates the essence of the crypto revolution: wealth is no longer determined solely by access to traditional financial instruments but by foresight, timing, and belief in technological change. In a world where code increasingly competes with capital, Time Traveler’s message is both a revelation and a reminder that the future of wealth might already be here, and it’s digital.

Founded in 2019 and licensed in multiple jurisdictions, the studio has earned its reputation for fairness, creativity, and exceptional design. Now, TRUE LABS is taking its next major step — a leap from traditional gaming into GameFi with TRUE World and the launch of the $TRUE token in Q4 2025. TRUE Token’s Big Launch Backed by Scale TRUE World is a live, integrated ecosystem, already counting over 2.5 million users. It connects players across popular games and Telegram apps through a GameFi-powered loyalty layer. Here, every win, quest, and milestone carries lasting value: players earn digital collectibles, real-world assets (RWA), and progress that actually means something. Why Watching $TRUE Token Listing If history teaches anything, gaming tokens backed by genuine adoption often become breakout performers. One of the most striking examples was Axie Infinity’s AXS, which surged from around $3 in June 2021 to over $120 by October that year — a 40× rally driven by massive user engagement and clear token utility within its ecosystem. That explosive growth made AXS a textbook case for how gaming-utility tokens can outperform when player demand meets real utility. It also turned Axie into a household name during the 2021 GameFi boom. TRUE LABS Could Be the Next Major Catalyst TRUE LABS enters the same space but with one decisive advantage: it’s already a fully operational studio with millions of players, hundreds of partners, and a proven pipeline of games. The $TRUE token will power every layer of this existing ecosystem — from tournaments and quests to staking, collectibles, and governance. Players will use $TRUE to access premium missions, enhance rewards, and trade in-game assets, while partners can integrate it into their own titles and loyalty programs. With this, TRUE LABS is tokenizing an already-thriving audience. $TRUE Tokenomics The $TRUE token is the economic backbone of the TRUE ecosystem designed to power rewards, upgrades, and participation across TRUE World. It’s a token with real use cases, organic player demand, and sustainable allocation. With its capped supply and early circulation designed for stability, $TRUE aims to build long-term value through utility, not hype. Total Supply: 100 000 000 $TRUE Allocation for Ecosystem Developments: 40% Allocation for the Community and Grants: 33% Source: true.world What to Expect Given the scale of TRUE LABS and the clear utility baked into its ecosystem, this is shaping up to be one of the most anticipated token launches in the GameFi sector. If past cycles are any guide, early movers often see the highest rewards. Projects with large user bases and strong fundamentals — like TRUE LABS — are exactly the kind worth watching.

This is a gut check on margins, post-incentive demand, and whether Robotaxis are still a pipe dream or a near-term reality. With the S&P 500 and Nasdaq brushing up against fresh highs, and tariffs on auto imports still stuck at 25%, the stakes are heavier than ever. Tesla stock staged a ridiculous comeback at the end of Q3, clawing back all its early 2025 losses. That rally came off optimism around the company’s AI push, a record quarter in deliveries, and a sudden political ceasefire between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. Still, plenty of traders are asking if this bounce has legs, especially with U.S. economic growth slowing and EV demand getting squeezed by rising prices and disappearing tax breaks. Investors monitor tax credit fallout and profit margin impact The big headline number for the quarter is Tesla’s expected $26.27 billion in revenue, according to Bloomberg, a 4% surge from the $25.18 billion booked this time last year. Analysts are projecting adjusted earnings per share at $0.53, with EBITDA pegged at $3.78 billion. But most of those gains came before the Sept. 30 expiration of the federal EV tax credit. That’s key. Buyers rushed to close deals before the incentive vanished, which helped Tesla post 497,099 deliveries, its highest quarterly total ever. That delivery figure blew past Wall Street’s estimate of 439,800, and even beat the 462,890 cars shipped in Q3 last year. Energy storage also hit a new record, with 12.5 gigawatt-hours deployed. But that sales momentum might not hold. Elon already warned during Q2 that the end of EV credits would bring “a few rough quarters.” The real test starts now. To respond, Tesla rolled out cheaper “Standard” trims for its Model 3 and Model Y in early October. They’re stripped down with smaller batteries, rear-wheel drive, and fewer features. Price tags: $36,990 for the 3, and $39,990 for the Y. Whether that helps shore up demand without destroying margins is the key unknown. Robotaxi rollout and shareholder meeting take center stage Meanwhile, eyes are locked on what Tesla says about its Robotaxi roadmap. The company began testing autonomous ride-hailing in Austin during summer and expanded the coverage area weeks later, but those cars still have a human safety driver onboard. In California’s Bay Area, Tesla has also been running similar tests, though those rides are fully human-driven for now. Local officials aren’t thrilled, and the company’s next moves in Nevada and Arizona remain unofficial. Analyst Dan Ives is doubling down on the autonomy story. In a note to clients, he wrote, “We continue to strongly believe the most important chapter in Tesla’s growth story is now beginning with the AI era now here. It starts with autonomous, then robotics, as we believe the autonomous valuation is worth $1 trillion alone to the Tesla story over the next few years.” Barclays analyst Dan Levy called Robotaxis the “most central aspect” of Tesla’s growth pitch, and said investor focus now is on when safety drivers will be removed in Austin. Nancy Tengler, a longtime Tesla investor and CIO at Laffer Tengler Investments, told Yahoo Finance that investors will also press for updates on Cybercab and Optimus robot production, both supposedly headed for 2026 ramp-ups. Another flashpoint: the Nov. 6 shareholder meeting. Tengler said “a key focus” will be Elon’s new $1 trillion pay package. That proposal has drawn fire. Proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have already recommended shareholders vote it down. Meanwhile, Elon’s current comp plan is still tied up in Delaware court, after a judge agreed with shareholders who said the board didn’t give them enough info before approving it.

As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time high of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2025 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Sonic Token S Price $0.1703 Market Cap $490.29M Trading Volume (24-hour) $52.27M Circulating Supply 3.22B S All-time High $1.03 on Jan 4, 2025 All-time Low $0.04356 on Jan 29, 2025 24-h High $0.18 24-h Low $0.1669 Sonic (S) price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 17.31% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $ 0.2663 14-Day RSI 31.98 (Neutral) Green Days 13/30 (43%) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 34 (Fear) 200-Day SMA $ 0.3829 Sonic price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : Sonic is consolidating around $0.17 with low volatility A break above $0.18 could push price toward 0.22 Falling below $0.16 may trigger renewed bearish movement Sonic (S) price analysis 1-day chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView Based on the 1-day chart as of October 21, Sonic (previously FTM) is trading in a bearish consolidation phase after a sharp decline, currently hovering around $0.17. The RSI at 34.83 suggests weak momentum, nearing oversold conditions, while the MACD remains negative, indicating persistent selling pressure. Price is moving close to the lower Bollinger Band at $0.12, signaling potential short-term support. A rebound above $0.18 could trigger a mild recovery toward the mid-band resistance at $0.22, while failure to hold above $0.16 may push Sonic lower toward $0.12. Overall, the trend remains bearish with possible short-term stabilization. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart, Sonic (previously FTM) is trading near $0.17 with low volatility and weak momentum. The MACD lines are almost flat, indicating indecision and limited market activity. The Balance of Power at 0.90 shows a slight increase in buying strength, hinting at potential short-term accumulation. Bollinger Bands are narrowing between $0.16 and $0.18, suggesting an upcoming breakout phase. If Sonic breaks above $0.18, it may retest resistance at $0.22. Conversely, a drop below $0.17 could send it toward $0.16 or lower. Overall, Sonic remains range-bound with mild bullish bias pending confirmation.

Sonic (previously FTM) is likely to remain in a consolidation phase as traders await stronger market signals. The price is holding near $0.17 with low volatility, and technical indicators such as the flat MACD and narrowing Bollinger Bands point to indecision. A breakout appears imminent—closing above $0.18 could trigger short-term bullish momentum toward $0.22, while failure to sustain support near $0.16 may renew bearish pressure. The RSI hovering near the oversold zone suggests a potential rebound if buying volume increases. Overall, Sonic’s short-term outlook remains cautiously neutral with slight bullish potential if momentum strengthens. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.5123 price by 2025 and $3.72 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and assessing personal risk tolerance are essential for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity. Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $3.11 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $3.72. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic will not approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $5.53. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good, long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast prices could reach between $3.11 and $3.72, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

On the lower end, corrections may pull the price to $0.6868 with an expected average trading price of around $0.7112. However, this is supported by the network’s rebrand momentum, scalability upgrades, and stronger developer activity. Expanding DeFi and gaming applications are expected to increase demand. Yet, competition from other Layer-1 and Layer-2 ecosystems may restrain rapid surges, keeping prices within this projected range. Sonic price prediction 2027 Sonic’s (prev. FTM) 2027 forecast of $1.06–$1.19, averaging $1.08, is linked to growing adoption of its rebranded ecosystem. By then, expanded DeFi, NFT, and gaming use cases are expected to strengthen utility and demand. Network scalability upgrades and rising developer engagement support gradual appreciation, while market cycles keep growth within range. Sonic price prediction 2028 In 2028, Sonic’s market price might stabilize at $1.80 while attaining an average trading price of around $1.58, and a minimum price of around $1.52. Sonic price prediction 2029 Sonic is expected to reach a maximum of $2.37 by 2029. However, it could fall to $1.96 with an average price of $2.02.

Its main lender, Growler Mining, will now take over the crypto-mining company. Under a court-supervised plan, Project Triumph, Growler will convert its debt into ownership, taking a major stake in the company’s equity. The restructuring was filed under the UK Companies Act. It revealed that Growler will convert about $7.5 million in secured loans and provide new funding in exchange for 87.5% of Argo’s recapitalized equity. Structure chart. Source: Project Triumph Practice Statement This leaves unsecured bondholders with 10% and existing shareholders with a mere 2.5% stake, effectively wiping out most existing equity value. The restructuring also aims to prevent insolvency and preserve Argo’s Nasdaq listing. “Unless the Plan Company [Argo] implements a restructuring of its balance sheet, the Plan Company will be unable to obtain the funding it needs and will be insolvent on both a cash flow basis and a balance sheet basis,” Argo said . Argo to be taken off the London Stock Exchange Argo will be taken off the London Stock Exchange. This will end its six-year run as one of the UK’s few publicly traded crypto companies. However, its shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq if the company meets the requirements, including planning a reverse stock split before January 2026. The company will still be incorporated and have its major office in London, but it will only focus on the US capital market. Argo was the first crypto company to go public on the London Stock Exchange in 2018. It raised about $32 million and was worth $61 million then. Argo’s operational profitability has been severely impacted by outdated mining equipment and high energy costs. Its Bitcoin output has significantly declined, falling from nearly six coins per day in 2022 to barely two in 2024. Argo stated that its liabilities include senior unsecured notes that it is unable to service, and it has very limited liquidity. In fact, at one point, the company reported $866,000 without further funding. The company also said it cannot raise external financing on viable terms. To that end, without the restructuring, it would be insolvent both on a cash-flow and balance-sheet basis. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the company previously sold its Helios facility in Texas to Galaxy Digital and now concentrates its mining operations at Canada’s Baie-Comeau site and US hosting centers in Tennessee and Washington State. Stakeholders are at risk of losing their equity value The first major court hearing is scheduled for 5 November 2025 at the High Court of Justice in London. Plan meetings where voting happens are scheduled for 28 Nov 2025, and the sanction hearing is scheduled for 8 Dec 2025. The restructuring plan will be voted on by shareholders, noteholders, or holders of senior unsecured notes, and the Secured Lender, which is Growler. If approved and sanctioned, the rights and claims of participants, creditors, and shareholders will be affected. Shareholders (existing ordinary shares) and ADR holders are informed that they may lose substantial value or have their holdings restructured. Noteholders of the senior unsecured notes are in a tough spot because the company hasn’t paid the interest and doesn’t see a way to return the full amount without this reorganization. However, if any class votes it down and the Court doesn’t override, the plan may not succeed. Meanwhile, a new retail advocate has been appointed for non-institutional investors to review the plan’s fairness and represent retail holders’ concerns to the court. Get seen where it counts.

This move marks the official end of the device's lifecycle. “Solana Mobile Saga has reached the end of its support lifecycle. Compatibility with new software or services cannot be guaranteed,” the company stated on its website. This means devices will no longer receive updates, making them more vulnerable to security risks and apps may become inoperable over time. Customer support will also be limited to general inquiries only. Solana Labs did not respond to requests for comment. Unveiled in May 2023, Saga aimed to bring the Web3 ecosystem closer to everyday users by integrating blockchain technology into the mobile world. The device was touted as an alternative to Apple and Google's restrictive app store policies. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Announces It Will List a New Altcoin - Price Jumps Significantly However, Saga's support lifespan, which lasted just two years, fell well short of mobile industry standards. Apple devices receive software updates for at least five years, while Google phones receive software updates for seven years. It's unclear why Solana Mobile is ending support so early. The company is still working on its second-generation phone, the “Solana Seeker,” which was unveiled in August 2024. Saga is more remembered for its memecoin airdrops than its Web3 integration. Devices were shipped to users with pre-installed cryptocurrency wallets. In late 2023 and early 2024, several Solana-based memecoin developers airdropped tokens to these wallets, both for marketing and to reward users. Initially worth a few hundred dollars, these tokens reached values that far surpassed the phone's selling price during the memecoin craze of 2024. Although official support has ended, unopened Saga devices are still fetching high prices online, in some cases up to three times their retail value. *This is not investment advice.

As savvy investors search for the next big opportunity, SUI, XPL, and NEAR are emerging as promising contenders. These affordable coins exhibit strong fundamentals and growth potential, hinting at an imminent rise. Discover how these cryptocurrencies are poised for significant breakouts. Sui (SUI) Shows Signs of Recovery Despite Recent Struggles Source: tradingview Sui's price is in a range between $2.24 and $2.97, trying to bounce back. It faced a downturn, dropping over 10% in a week and more than 26% in a month. There's potential for growth if it breaks past the current resistance at $3.36. If it moves beyond, it may aim for $4.09, marking a possible increase of over 30% from its current range. The 10-day and 100-day averages are close, suggesting stabilization. However, the high RSI and Stochastic values hint at caution. Investors are closely watching to see if Sui can sustain a rebound or if it will dip closer to its support levels, noted at $1.90 and $1.17. Plasma (XPL) Shows Big Potential After Recent Surge Source: tradingview Plasma (XPL) is currently trading in a range between $0.35 and $0.52 after a staggering monthly rise of over 320%. The token recently cooled off with a weekly drop of nearly 9%, but the overall growth trend remains. Key charts indicate that there is significant room for upward movement. If XPL crosses its nearest resistance level of $0.63, it could quickly aim for the next target at $0.81. This marks a possible gain of over 50% from its current peak. With current momentum indicators like RSI and Stochastic being high, Plasma's outlook seems promising. However, previous sharp gains suggest traders should watch support levels closely as well. NEAR Protocol on the Brink of Breaking Key Levels Source: tradingview NEAR Protocol is showing a current price range between $1.99 and $2.61. Recently, the coin has faced a downward trend, with a significant drop of over 25% in the last month. It is close to its nearest resistance level at nearly $3 and has strong potential if it can break past this point. Looking further, the next resistance is above $3.50, which suggests room for growth of about 80% from its low. The market indicators show high buying pressure, and if NEAR can maintain this momentum, it could reverse its recent losses and climb higher. Conclusion SUI, XPL, and NEAR show strong potential for growth. These coins are not only affordable but also have solid fundamentals and promising technologies. As they gain more attention, their value can rise. The market trend appears favorable for these assets, indicating a possible breakout. The performance of SUI, XPL, and NEAR in recent times suggests that they are well-positioned for significant gains. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Traditional forms like cash and cards remain foundational, while mobile wallets, instant transfers, and digital currencies are rapidly gaining ground. In place of one method dethroning another, the reality is coexistence. Users pick what fits their needs, moment to moment. This mix shapes everything from retail checkouts to gaming platforms. Traditional Payments: Cash and Cards Still Play a Role Cash usage continues its slow decline, yet it persists in many everyday scenarios. Among older generations or in lower‑tech settings, coins and banknotes remain a fallback, especially in places or situations where digital infrastructure is weak. Surveys in the UK show that certain consumer segments still rely on cash for regular day‑to‑day purchases. Debit and credit cards remain deeply embedded across commerce. Their ubiquity, consumer familiarity, and integration with banks keep them relevant. In the UK’s 2025 payments forecasts, cards continue to command a large share of transaction volume, even as alternative digital forms gain momentum.Contactless card payments (tap to pay) are now normalized in high street shops, cafés, and transit, often paired with wallet tokenization to improve security. Some users, especially in digital entertainment and gaming, still value simplicity in payment flows. In the online casino world, for example, a pay by phone casino appeals to those seeking a frictionless deposit experience where deposits are charged to the user’s mobile phone bill, without needing to share bank or card details. That it remains a sought feature underscores how older models adapt and persist even as new options emerge. The Rise of Mobile, Instant, and Alternative Payments Mobile payments and wallet services have surged in the UK. The mobile payments market is projected at £2.13 billion in 2025 , with expectation of strong growth through 2030.Over half of UK adults now use a mobile wallet at least once a year.Open banking, QR payments, and wallet‑to‑bank integrations further push real-time movement of funds. Yet adoption isn’t uniform. The Payments Association’s consumer behavior survey notes that technology-savvy younger groups more readily embrace new digital options, while older or lower-income users still depend on cash or cards.Some prefer the reassurance of familiar rails, particularly for larger or recurring payments. In the casino and gaming sector, this shift shows up in how deposit flows are designed. E‑wallet options like PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay are default choices, especially for mobile users. These methods emphasize speed, minimal redirection, and strong security via biometric or two‑factor authentication. Meanwhile, the UK payments ecosystem itself is evolving. In 2025, the rollout of the New Payments Architecture (NPA) introduces faster payments capabilities and ISO 20022 support, improving rails for real-time transfers.Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) is also changing consumer credit in digital contexts. Once anchored to retail, BNPL adoption is accelerating in services, gaming, and other sectors, including nontraditional demographics. How Payment Methods Coexist in Practice In 2025’s hybrid environment, different payment types like cash, cards, crypto , cohabit based on context, trust, cost, and convenience. High‑value transactions or deposits may default to bank transfers or card payments because they offer higher limits, chargeback features, and settled auditing. Meanwhile, small or impulse payments gravitate toward mobile wallets or instant options because they reduce friction. Digital platforms mirror this. Many will offer a layered stack like credit/debit card, e‑wallets, bank transfer, and sometimes carrier billing. The choice helps satisfy mandates around user inclusion, risk management, and user experience. Where phone‑bill deposits remain active, caps and compliance measures often limit daily or monthly amounts. Furthermore, legacy methods inform design norms for newer flows. The instant confirmation and minimal user inputs formerly required by phone‑bill deposits set the bar high. Modern wallet and open banking designs now aim for similarly instant, low-friction deposit and authentication paths. What to Watch in 2025? The coexistence model will likely persist. Users will pick rails based on situation, preference, and risk appetite. Cards remain reliable; mobile wallets and open banking will grow; legacy billing models taper but inform design. Key areas to watch: ● Fraud and security innovations: Biometric ID, device binding, and behavioral analytics are becoming standard to protect fast, mobile-first payments.● Regulatory pressure on BNPL, carrier billing, and consumer protection in gaming: Authorities are tightening rules to ensure transparency, spending limits, and safer deposit practices across digital platforms.● Interoperability across rails: Consumers expect seamless transfers between banks, wallets, and apps, pushing providers to connect systems more efficiently.● Emergence of digital central bank money in the consumer realm: CBDCs like the digital euro are being tested as secure, programmable alternatives to physical cash.● User interface evolution: Payment UIs are focusing on speed and simplicity, with one-tap flows and fewer steps, while keeping legacy users in mind. In the end, the payments world in 2025 is full of layering, adaptation, and fluid choice. Cash, cards, mobile bills, wallets, and instant rails all have roles.

According to a post on their website, the decision means existing users will no longer receive firmware or security patches, exposing devices to potential risks and compatibility issues as newer apps evolve. Customer assistance will now be limited to general inquiries, signaling the complete phase-out of active product support. Short Run for Solana’s Blockchain Phone Launched in May 2023, the Saga was envisioned as a step toward mainstream Web3 adoption. It offered native crypto wallet integration, decentralized app access, and freedom from traditional app store restrictions. The phone was produced by OSOM, a California-based hardware firm, in collaboration with Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of Solana Labs. However, the device’s commercial performance fell short. Initially priced at $1,000, it was later reduced to $599 after slow sales. Despite a surge of interest from Solana enthusiasts, only about 20,000 units were sold, missing the initial 50,000-unit target. Comparatively, the Saga’s two-year lifespan appears short against competitors Apple and Google typically provide at least five to seven years of updates. From Web3 Innovation to Memecoin Phenomenon Interestingly, the Saga’s most enduring legacy may not be its blockchain integration but its unexpected role in Solana’s memecoin boom. Each unit shipped with a preloaded crypto wallet that became a prime destination for token airdrops. Developers used these wallets to reward early adopters and drive community engagement. As the memecoin frenzy escalated in late 2023, some of these tokens surged in value, at times surpassing the phone’s original retail cost severalfold. Consequently, unopened Saga phones now trade for up to three times their retail value on secondary markets. Solana’s Price Outlook Source: X While the phone project winds down, Solana’s native token (SOL) continues to show resilience. The asset trades at $194.21 with a market cap exceeding $106 billion. Analyst Daniel Ramsey noted that Solana has consolidated below its $210–$250 resistance zone for 579 days.

Shares of gold mining companies plummeted, while BTC regained over 8% of its price against gold. Gold showed its volatile side after dipping to $4,101.07. The precious metal was among the top gainers for 2025, in what looked like a price discovery rally. However, the nominal price of gold for now only reflected the increased money supply, in addition to the overall market hype for the ‘debasement trade.’ As a proxy metric, the Van Eck Gold Miners ETF extended the day’s losses to over 9.4%. The day’s dip is the worst performance for the ETF since the pandemic shock in March 2020. Van Eck Gold Miners ETF sank by over 9% for the past day, reflecting the general slump of gold mining stocks and bullion gold. | Source: Yahoo Finance As gold moved down from the $4,300 range and stopped producing new daily records, gold mining shares also took a downturn. Gold mining companies lost over 9% for the past day Other leading miners also suffered deep daily losses. Barrick Mining Corp. (NYSE: B) is down 9.10% for the day to $31.57. Newmont Corp (NEM) fell by 9.10% to $86.11. Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) fell by 9.59% to $161.39. The shares all took a downturn following recent six-month highs, tracking gold’s performance. Smaller gold mining companies also suffered a wide range of daily losses following the slide in bullion prices. Gold was only one of the day’s losers. Silver also broke its trend, sinking to $49.33 per ounce and shrinking this year’s gains to 41.8%, down from over 60%. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, gold and silver crashed on profit-taking, following a rally not seen in decades. Gold buyers are facing a recovering US dollar, as the dollar index started inching up since October 16. The general hype for bullion gold also dissipated after the asset hit a recent peak at $4,381.52. BTC regains its strength against gold The sudden slide in gold prices boosted the strength of BTC against the precious metal. BTC gained up to 8.1% in terms of gold ounces, bouncing after a year of sliding against gold. The recent gold crash coincided with a rapid BTC recovery. BTC rallied to $112,519, after briefly rising above $113,000 on a short squeeze. BTC remained the year’s top gainer, retaining 68.1% in net gains. BTC remains more volatile compared to gold, but it has also shown that precious metals can still have overbought rallies and go through corrections. Despite this, the prediction market on whether BTC will outperform gold in 2025 is still undecided, giving only 25% probability on Polymarket. The rapid collapse of gold is sparking hopes of redistributing liquidity, which may flow back into BTC and selected crypto tokens. Historically, BTC has started some of its significant rallies following the peak in gold prices. Tokenized gold also took a step back, including PAXG, which briefly traded at a premium to spot gold, the equivalent of over $5,000 per ounce. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Tokens like Floki, Bonk, and Fartcoin are generating buzz. Could this be their moment to shine? Explore which coins are showing potential for growth and what’s fueling the renewed interest in these quirky assets. Floki Coin Bounces Back with Growth Potential Source: tradingview Floki's current trading price ranges from six to seven-thousandths of a dollar, hinting at a positive short-term movement. The coin has jumped nearly 3% in the past week, showing signs of recovery. Floki is now approaching a resistance level at close to nine-thousandths of a dollar. If it breaks through, it could climb another 11% to reach a bit over a ten-thousandth of a dollar, spotlighting its growth potential. While Floki saw a 17% drop last month, its 15% rise over six months shows resilience. With the RSI nearing 62, sentiment remains bullish. If the trend continues, Floki may soon test new heights. Bonk (BONK) Shows Potential Despite Recent Dips Source: tradingview Bonk (BONK) is hovering between a low of around $0.00001287 and a high of $0.00001666. While it's recently dipped about 7.89% over the past week and over 33% this month, the six-month trend shows a positive climb by just over 3%. The nearest resistance sits slightly under $0.000019, offering room for a possible rise. If BONK breaches this level, it might aim for the second barrier at roughly $0.000022, which could mean a potential increase of around 35% from its current high. With indicators like RSI and Stochastic showing upward movement, BONK might find strength for a comeback, but it's important to keep an eye on the overall trend. Fartcoin on the Rise: Possible Bounce Back on the Horizon Source: tradingview Fartcoin is currently priced between thirty-two and forty-five cents. It’s been a bumpy ride with a recent drop of over 15% just last week. However, there's a glimmer of hope. If it breaks above the fifty-three-cent resistance level, it could jump by nearly 20%. This potential surge points to a possible stronger upwards trend. Breaking past this level could even see Fartcoin aiming for sixty-seven cents, marking a significant increase of almost 50% from its current upper range price. Despite recent declines, indicators suggest Fartcoin has room to climb if momentum sustains. Conclusion FLOKI, BONK, and FARTCOIN are showing strong signs of making a comeback. Their recent market movements hint at renewed interest and potential growth. These coins have captured attention with their unique appeal and community support. Market trends suggest that the memecoin sector might be ready for a resurgence. Investors and enthusiasts will keep a close eye on these developments. Memecoins have surprised before, and they might just do it again. This sets the stage for an interesting period ahead for FLOKI, BONK, and FARTCOIN.

The pundit alluded to a liquidity shortage and how there might not be enough demand as everyone tries to offload their coins at the same time. Why Not Every XRP Investor Will Be Able To Sell At The Top In an X post , Diana echoed Jake Claver’s statement that a lot of exchanges won’t have the liquidity to let XRP holders exit at the market value. The pundit remarked that many token holders won’t be able to just cash out if the price rises to, like $10. She explained that this is because if too many people try to sell at once, the market doesn’t have enough buyers ready to take all those orders at the same price. Diana noted that this is a result of thin liquidity. As such, those looking to sell at $10 might have their order filled at $8.50. She added that this is what is known as slippage and that it could cause investors to lose thousands in a few seconds. The pundit also gave an illustration of how the rush to sell during parabolic rallies is just like when everyone is trying to leave through the same door when the fire alarm goes off during a concert. In this case, the liquidity is like the door, and it won’t be able to accommodate everyone. Diana stated that the issue of liquidity matters more for XRP because while retail traders use Coinbase or Kraken , banks, hedge funds, and corporations don’t. Instead, she claimed that they trade off-exchanges through private deals called OTC trades. The pundit further remarked that with Ripple’s $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury, more XRP liquidity is about to move off crypto exchanges and into corporate systems. She noted that this is great for real-world adoption, but that it means that there will be less of the altcoin available on public markets when everyone tries to sell. What Holders Should Do Diana advised XRP holders to plan ahead, as when the next XRP bull run hits, prices could surge higher than ever, but cashing out won’t be simple. As part of the plan, she told investors to move their tokens off crypto exchanges now and set their sell targets early. The pundit added that holders should use limit orders instead of market orders. Diana stated that when the altcoin finally goes vertical, the winners won’t be those who timed the top but those who were ready for it. Jake Claver , CEO of Digital Ascension Group, had also warned XRP holders that without custody, tax strategy, and wealth infrastructure before the liquidity event, many would fumble to generate wealth. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.42, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|coinbase|Coinmarketcap|Diana|Digital Ascension Group|GTreasury|Jake Claver|Kraken|OTC|ripple|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-21 18:00:35

The teaser, a five-second clip posted on X, showed just three tabs: “Livestream,” “Today,” and “10 a.m. PT.” That’s all it took. Just hours before the livestream, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted separately, saying the company was launching a product he’s “quite excited about!” The YouTube livestream was titled “Introducing ChatGPT Atlas” and included a short description that confirmed it: this was OpenAI’s new browser. It’s now available for macOS users globally, with support for Windows, iOS, and Android “coming soon,” according to the post. This is a full browser product, and it comes just as competitors are racing to push similar AI-based tools into the hands of users. OpenAI browser competes directly with Google and Perplexity This wasn’t OpenAI’s first move in the browser lane. In January, the company introduced Operator, an AI agent that used a browser to carry out tasks. But Operator wasn’t a full browser on its own, it just operated inside one. This new product changes that completely. With ChatGPT Atlas, OpenAI officially becomes a browser company too. That puts it on a collision course with both Google and Perplexity AI, which have been fighting to win user attention and market share. Earlier in October, Perplexity rolled out Comet, an AI-powered browser available worldwide for free. It works like an assistant; searching the internet, organizing tabs, writing emails, shopping, and more. All the tasks people usually spread across apps can now happen in a single AI-driven interface. And it doesn’t stop there. Google, under pressure since ChatGPT’s original launch in late 2022, added its Gemini model to Chrome in September. It allows users to ask questions about pages, manage tabs more easily, or handle multitasking inside one window. Search for a YouTube clip? Schedule a call? Translate something? Gemini now handles that. Still, the reaction to OpenAI’s new browser hit Google hard. Sundar Pichai reacts to OpenAI moves, admits timing hurt Google During a panel chat with Marc Benioff at Salesforce’s Dreamforce event last week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai was asked how he felt when OpenAI released ChatGPT before Google could get its own tool out. Marc described Google as the “absolute leader in AI” and called OpenAI “this little company in San Francisco.” Sundar responded, “But you’re right, credit to OpenAI, they put it out first.” He added that Google had been working on a chatbot internally, but didn’t release it at the time because it wasn’t ready for public use. “We hadn’t quite gotten it to a level where you could put it out and people would’ve been OK with Google putting out that product. It still had a lot of issues at that time.” Sundar said that Google already had serious investments in AI infrastructure, its own chips, and research teams, and that they were well prepared when ChatGPT launched. But the timing was off. “For me, when ChatGPT launched, contrary to what people outside felt, I was excited because I knew the window had shifted,” he said. Sundar also admitted that Google didn’t react right away because it had a higher “reputational risk” than OpenAI. Still, the internal response was anything but chill. The New York Times reported that Google issued a “code red” and moved fast to catch up. Whole departments were redirected to work on AI, and it wasn’t until March 2023 that Google finally launched its own chatbot. The tool first came out as Bard, but was later renamed Gemini. That entire timeline matters now more than ever.

In a world where there is no customer support or undo button, understanding how to secure your assets is not optional; it’s essential. That’s exactly what Phil Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, sought to explain in his recent breakdown on the difference between cold and hot wallets — and the one mistake that can ruin everything. Understanding Cold and Hot Wallets Kwok begins by clearing up one of the most common misunderstandings among crypto users: the distinction between cold and hot wallets. As he puts it, “A cold wallet is simply a wallet that isn’t connected to the Internet.” This includes hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor, or even an offline seed phrase written on paper. Because they remain completely offline, cold wallets provide a strong defense against online hacks and phishing attacks. quick breakdown on cold vs hot wallets! and how to keep your crypto safe https://t.co/QEG07Cwm02 pic.twitter.com/MJGDFNJuR8 — Phil Kwok | EasyA (@kwok_phil) October 19, 2025 In contrast, Kwok explains, “A hot wallet is one that [is] actually connected to the internet.” These are the wallets used on your phone, browser, or computer for everyday transactions. They offer speed and convenience but are always exposed to online threats. The key takeaway is simple: cold wallets are for storing wealth securely, while hot wallets are for daily use and quick access. Confusing their roles or merging them introduces unnecessary risk. The Critical Mistake Most Users Make One of the most serious errors Kwok highlights is importing a cold wallet seed into a hot wallet, a move that completely defeats the purpose of having cold storage. He warns bluntly: “Never upload that [cold wallet seed phrase] into a hot wallet.” Once your seed phrase touches an internet-connected device, it’s no longer cold. The very act of importing that seed creates a digital bridge between your secure offline funds and the online world, a bridge hackers are always waiting to cross. Kwok emphasizes that “your security is only as good as your weakest link,” and if that weakest link is an imported seed on a browser extension or mobile app, the entire protection system collapses. Even if the hardware device remains intact, its security is lost because the seed, the master key, is already exposed. Building Safer Habits for XRP Storage Kwok’s advice is not just about avoiding mistakes but also about cultivating security discipline. He insists that users should keep their cold and hot wallets completely separate, never merging or syncing them under any circumstances. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A cold wallet should remain untouched by internet-connected devices, while a hot wallet should be treated as disposable, used only for trading or daily transfers. He also urges users to avoid digital backups of their seed phrases. Taking screenshots, saving photos, or storing them in cloud-based notes is a common and dangerous practice. Instead, write the phrase down on paper, store it securely, and ensure it never comes into contact with the internet. Kwok further recommends using distinct devices for wallet management, keeping browser extensions or apps isolated from your everyday browsing environment. Finally, for users who need to move funds from cold storage, the right process is to sign transactions offline using the hardware wallet, and then broadcast them online without ever exposing the private keys. This simple step keeps the security wall intact and ensures your seed remains offline where it belongs. What to Do If You Suspect a Compromise Kwok’s guidance also covers what to do in worst-case scenarios. If you suspect your seed phrase has been exposed, even for a moment, act immediately. The only safe option is to create a new cold wallet with a brand-new seed phrase and transfer your funds without delay. Compromised wallets can be drained within minutes once their keys are discovered online, so hesitation can be costly. Security Is a Habit, Not a Feature In the end, Phil Kwok’s message is about responsibility and awareness. Cold and hot wallets each serve a purpose, but mixing them nullifies their advantages. The moment convenience takes priority over discipline, security begins to crumble. By following Kwok’s simple but vital principles — separating cold from hot, never importing cold seeds into connected devices, and treating seed phrases like the digital keys they truly are — users can protect their XRP and other cryptocurrencies from preventable loss . In the crypto world, security is not paranoia; it is preparation. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Every transaction is visible, making it unsuitable for businesses or individuals needing confidentiality. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is the next step in this evolution, built to solve this exact issue. It is the first asset to be both digitally scarce and cryptographically private. By using advanced zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) lets you prove ownership of your assets without revealing what they are or how much you have. This powerful technology creates a true “digital vault”, a store of value that is secure, scalable, and completely confidential, designed for the future of finance. Why Privacy is the New Premium The financial world, both traditional and decentralized, has long grappled with the tension between transparency and privacy. While transparency can foster trust in some contexts, it becomes a liability when dealing with substantial wealth or strategic operations. Imagine a corporation needing to move significant capital without revealing its financial maneuvers to competitors, or an individual wanting to secure their legacy without attracting unwanted attention. Current digital assets, including Bitcoin, fall short. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) addresses this by making privacy a core, immutable feature. It’s built on advanced cryptographic proofs, specifically zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs, which allow for the verification of transactions without exposing any underlying data. This means you can prove solvency, authenticate ownership, or execute trades, all while maintaining complete confidentiality. This capability is paramount for securing sensitive information and protecting digital assets from public scrutiny. A Secure, Scalable, and Confidential Ecosystem Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is not just a concept; it’s a robust Layer 1 blockchain ecosystem designed for the future of finance. Its architecture integrates cutting-edge privacy with remarkable scalability. The project’s core technology ensures that user data, identities, and transactions are shielded from public view. This is achieved through confidential transactions, where amounts and addresses remain hidden, and shielded smart contracts, allowing decentralized applications to process private logic. For scalability, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) employs zk-Rollups, bundling thousands of transactions off-chain, and recursive proofs, which validate other proofs to drastically reduce computational overhead. This allows the network to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second (TPS) while maintaining low fees. The blend of high performance and impenetrable privacy is what sets Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) apart, making it an ideal platform for protecting digital assets. The Architect of Future Wealth Protection The Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) project has meticulously engineered its network to be a sanctuary for digital assets. Security is paramount, with smart contracts undergoing formal verification and the system designed for post-quantum readiness through zk-STARK integration. This ensures that assets held within the Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) ecosystem are protected not just today, but against future technological threats. Beyond its foundational technology, ZKP offers a rich ecosystem of features, including private DeFi protocols for swaps and lending, zero-knowledge identity solutions for compliance without exposure, and private NFTs. This expansive utility means Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) can serve a multitude of sectors, from finance and healthcare to supply chain management, where proving authenticity without revealing sensitive data is crucial. This comprehensive approach establishes Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) as a leader in confidential financial infrastructure. The Opportunity: Pre-Purchase Future-Proof Bandwidth This is the asset that whales and institutions have been dreaming of, a way to move and store wealth without painting a target on their backs. With its capability to ensure both digital scarcity and cryptographic privacy, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) offers a solution that truly satisfies the demands of high-net-worth individuals and large organizations. The upcoming whitelist opening for Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) presents a rare opportunity. This is not merely an investment in a token; it’s a chance to pre-purchase the future-proof bandwidth that will underpin a network destined for mass usage. Securing early access means positioning yourself ahead of the curve, preparing for a future where privacy and verifiability are indispensable. This unique chance allows participants to gain entry-level pricing for what promises to be the world’s first truly private digital gold. Summing Up The Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) project fundamentally redefines what a digital asset can be. By engineering a solution to the transparency problem inherent in earlier digital currencies, it delivers a secure, scalable, and completely private store of value. The innovative use of zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs creates an ecosystem where ownership is verifiable without sacrificing confidentiality, establishing an unparalleled “digital vault.” This is built for individuals and institutions who require discretion. As the global demand for data protection and private financial operations intensifies, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is positioned to become a foundational pillar of next-generation blockchain. The whitelist opening soon offers an exclusive chance to pre-purchase its future-proof bandwidth.

With spot ETH quoted around $4,000, Patel anchored his thesis to a tight cluster of reclaim and invalidation levels on both ETH/USD and ETH/BTC, emphasizing that lower-timeframe behavior must align with higher-timeframe structure to keep the bullish path open. Key Price Levels For Ethereum Now On the weekly ETH/USD chart, Patel said the market “wicked lower into the August open last week but held above the previous weekly low and trendline support,” resulting in an inside week that nevertheless closed “marginally below that major pivot.” The pivot is explicit: “We want to see this pivot at $4,093 reclaimed immediately and not flipped into resistance here on the lower timeframes, or else we could expect another flush of the lows towards that 2025 open.” Related Reading: Ethereum Death Cross That Last Preceded A 60% Drop Just Returned If buyers do force the reclaim, Patel expects last week’s action to stand as a quarterly low: “If we do reclaim $4,093 here, which is what I expect, we should have our quarterly low now in and I would want to see $4,400 flipped into support for the move higher into all-time highs and beyond.” He framed the weekly invalidation at $3,700, warning that a close below would put the yearly open on watch as “last-stand support” for the bullish structure; failure there risks “a much bigger unwind back into $2,850.” Patel’s base case remained constructive: “acceptance back above $4,093 into next week and then a close above $4,400 for October, leading to new highs through $5,000 in early November and a very strong month for ETH.” The daily ETH/USD read connects that high-timeframe blueprint to momentum and market structure. Patel noted “momentum exhaustion into the lows” followed by a higher-low last week, a formation that now must be defended. He wants to see the sequence reassert itself with a drive above the mid-range and a subsequent higher-low above the weekly pivot: “we absolutely want to see this structure now protected and price to form a higher-high above the mid-range at $4,352 and then another higher-low above $4,093 before a breakout higher and a push towards fresh highs.” For confirmation of an impulsive leg, he flagged a trendline break, a flip of the ATH-anchored VWAP into support, and an RSI regime shift: “If we get a trendline breakout and price flips that ATH VWAP into support with daily RSI above 50, I’d expect a move into $4,950 very swiftly, followed by price discovery in November.” The daily invalidation mirrors the weekly logic: if $4,093 acts as resistance and the market pushes below $3,700—then closes beneath it—“we’re absolutely retesting the yearly open,” in his view. ETH Vs. BTC Against Bitcoin, Patel contends that the relative pair has likely printed its Q4 low. On the weekly ETH/BTC chart, price was rejected at trendline resistance, then retraced to the yearly open and held, closing “marginally green” while respecting trendline support off the 2025 lows. “It is my view that the Q4 low for the pair has formed here,” he wrote, adding that a retest and break above the descending boundary into early November would set the stage for a measured expansion: “acceptance above 0.0417 opens up the next leg higher into 0.055.” He placed weekly invalidation at 0.0319. Related Reading: Ethereum Kimchi Premium Spikes To New High — Sign Of Impending Sell-Off? The daily ETH/BTC map refines those signals into actionable levels. Price “marked out that low between 0.0319 and the yearly open before bouncing hard and reclaiming 0.036 as support.” Ideally, 0.036 now acts as a springboard; if not, Patel allows for a higher-low “above the 0.0319 level before continuation higher.” The tactical tell would be a flip of nearby supply: “If we can flip 0.0379 as reclaimed support here, that would be promising for the view that a trendline breakout is imminent, following which I would expect 0.0417 to be taken out and price to head higher, with minor resistance above that at 0.049 before 0.055.” He also identified a confluence band below: “We have a confluence of support between 0.0293 and 0.0319, so flipping that range into resistance would be very bearish ETH/BTC.” Taken together, Patel’s Oct. 10 blueprint hinges on three synchronizations: ETH/USD must swiftly reclaim and defend $4,093; $4,400 must convert from ceiling to floor to clear the runway toward prior highs and a potential $4,950 extension; and ETH/BTC should drive through 0.0379 and then 0.0417 to confirm relative-strength breadth beneath any dollar-denominated breakout. The downside is equally crisp: failure to reclaim $4,093, a weekly close below $3,700, and a subsequent loss of the yearly open would validate the risk that, in Patel’s words, Ethereum could “unwind back into $2,850.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,872.

53466218,610711,1761073246,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53466218.jpeg,"2,496 Bitcoin Moved After Years Of Inactivity – Long-Term Holders Take Action",https://bitcoinist.com/2496-bitcoin-moved-after-years-long-term-holders/,"Bitcoin is once again under pressure as the market navigates a volatile and uncertain phase. After briefly reclaiming the $111K level, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is struggling to maintain $110K as a stable support zone. Sellers are regaining control, and bearish traders are calling for a deeper retrace toward lower range levels — possibly below the six-figure mark. Adding to the cautious tone, fresh data from CryptoQuant reveals a concerning on-chain development: old Bitcoin coins are waking up. This metric, which tracks previously dormant BTC moving on-chain, has shown a sharp increase among coins aged 3–5 years, indicating that long-term holders are starting to move or sell part of their holdings. Historically, such behavior has preceded phases of heightened volatility or deeper corrections, as these older coins often represent significant, high-volume supply entering the market. While some analysts interpret these moves as long-term holders taking profits after the year’s rally, others warn that renewed selling from this group could intensify downward pressure. As market sentiment turns defensive, traders are watching closely to see whether Bitcoin can defend key support zones or if these “old coins” will fuel the next leg of a broader correction. Long-Term Holders Move Supply as Selling Pressure Builds Top analyst Maartunn shared data revealing a notable spike in long-term holder activity, with 3–5-year-old BTC spent jumping to 2,496 BTC — a significant move considering the typically dormant nature of this cohort. These “old coins” represent Bitcoin that hasn’t moved in years, often held by investors with high conviction. When this group becomes active, it usually signals a major shift in market dynamics. Historically, such spikes in long-term holder activity tend to occur near macro turning points, either as a sign of distribution during local tops or early reaccumulation phases after deep corrections. In the current context, this rise in aged coin movement could mean two things. First, it might reflect profit-taking from early holders who are capitalizing on gains as market volatility intensifies. Second, it could indicate reallocation or strategic rotation, where coins move between wallets as investors prepare for renewed market turbulence. This comes amid a backdrop of persistent selling pressure, with Bitcoin struggling to hold above the $110K level. The broader market remains cautious, as liquidity thins and short-term traders react to each downside move. While long-term holders moving supply can appear bearish in the short run, it’s also a natural part of market cycles — often preceding phases of redistribution that ultimately strengthen long-term structure. If Bitcoin can absorb this supply and maintain support above $106K–$108K, it could set the foundation for a more sustainable rebound. However, failure to do so might confirm a deeper correction, potentially testing the $100K zone once again. Testing Support Amid Renewed Weakness Bitcoin is struggling to find momentum after days of selling pressure, currently trading around $107,800. The 3-day chart shows BTC fighting to stay above the 200-day moving average (green line) near $106,000, a crucial support that has historically served as a base during major corrections. The bounce from the recent $103K low suggests some buying interest, but momentum remains fragile as bulls attempt to defend this key zone. The 50-day moving average (blue line), sitting above $112,000, now acts as short-term resistance, with a broader supply area forming around $117,500 — the same level that capped previous rallies. A close above this threshold could confirm a short-term reversal, signaling renewed buyer confidence. However, repeated failures to reclaim it may invite another wave of selling pressure. Market structure remains neutral-to-bearish, with volatility compressing following the October 10 flash crash. If BTC loses the $106K–$107K zone, downside targets could extend toward $100K, where the yearly average offers the next layer of support.

In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $8 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $5.41 Market cap $113.72M 24-hour trading volume $33.33M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $1.41 on Oct 11, 2025 24-hour high $5.48 24-hour low $5.07 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 20.43% (Extremely high) 50-day SMA $8.21 200-day SMA $9.01 Sentiment Bearish Green days 11/30 (37%) Fear and Greed Index 34 (Fear) ORDI price analysis On the day of writing (October 21), ORDI’s price rose by 2.21% in 24 hours but is down 3.48% in the last seven days. Its trading volume rose by 37.78% showing trader conviction in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades below the Williams Alligator trendlines, signaling an eventful market as the price bounced off resistance levels ($8.09 Fibonacci midpoint) and key moving averages. The coin has registered negative momentum in the last week. The MACD and signal lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, signaling a bear market. At the same time, the relative strength index (RSI) is in neutral territory at 36.83. It is oversold when the RSI falls below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI is moving sideways at the $5.40 mark with MACD confirmation (0.03). The William Alligator trendlines show its volatility has fallen. The move comes following a sharp drop over the weekend when it fell below $6.00.

ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index indicating a prevailing fear among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which is just above $112,000, following a brief recovery. Why is ORDI down? ORDI’s drop reflects technical triggers, Bitcoin-driven risk aversion, and technical overextension. Its status as a “Bitcoin beta” leaves it vulnerable during dominance rallies, while thin liquidity amplifies price movements. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030?

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10. In October, it traded above the $8 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-21 19:05:00

It’s the Digital Collateral,https://timestabloid.com/black-swan-capitalist-xrp-isnt-something-you-sell-its-the-digital-collateral/,"The conversation around XRP has evolved far beyond the idea of a speculative cryptocurrency. What was once dismissed as just another altcoin is now being reevaluated as a potential backbone of the next-generation financial infrastructure. As the global economy edges closer to a digital, tokenized framework, the role of XRP is increasingly being understood not as a mere asset to trade, but as a form of digital collateral that could anchor liquidity, settlement, and institutional trust in a new financial era. XRP’s Role in the Evolving Financial System XRP was designed for speed , scalability, and interoperability. Its primary function—bridging currencies across borders—has positioned it uniquely within discussions about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), tokenized deposits, and real-time settlement. The idea of digital collateral builds on this foundation. In essence, it suggests that XRP could serve as a universally liquid and trust-minimized asset to support settlement and credit flows in an increasingly interconnected financial world. As I’ve said for years, XRP isn’t something you sell. It’s the digital collateral for where this entire financial system is heading. The play is to profit from other digital assets while the debt-based system keeps running, then rotate into gold, silver, and tangible assets. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 20, 2025 Unlike traditional assets that rely on intermediaries for clearance and settlement, XRP’s design allows for instant finality . This efficiency could make it a preferred choice for institutions seeking to optimize capital reserves while minimizing counterparty risk. Versan Aljarrah’s Strategic Perspective Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, has consistently argued that XRP should not be viewed through the lens of short-term speculation. In a recent post on X, Aljarrah reiterated that “XRP isn’t something you sell—it’s the digital collateral for where this entire financial system is heading.” He emphasizes a disciplined investment approach: profit from volatile digital assets while the traditional, debt-based system continues to function, then strategically rotate those profits into gold, silver, and other tangible stores of value. This perspective aligns with a macroeconomic strategy—one that anticipates a gradual revaluation of financial instruments as the global monetary system transitions toward digital settlement frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Regulatory and Institutional Landscape Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has now reached a final resolution, bringing much-needed clarity to XRP’s regulatory status. Ripple and XRP are no longer constrained by legal uncertainty—a shift that could accelerate institutional adoption and pave the way for XRP’s broader use as a compliant financial instrument. Institutions exploring on-chain settlement and tokenized collateral systems can now consider XRP without the overhang of litigation risk. This development gives credence to Aljarrah’s long-term vision, suggesting that XRP’s fundamental utility may soon be recognized on a global scale. From Speculation to Utility Treating XRP as digital collateral requires a shift in mindset. Investors must view it not as a vehicle for quick profit but as an instrument embedded within the emerging financial infrastructure, much like U.S. Treasuries underpin today’s credit system. This perspective acknowledges XRP’s potential to bridge the gap between fiat systems and blockchain-based liquidity markets. However, this transition will not happen overnight. Institutional acceptance, custody frameworks, and standardization remain key challenges. Yet, as more enterprises and payment networks experiment with tokenized assets and on-chain settlements, XRP’s designed functionality appears increasingly relevant. The Long Game of Digital Collateral Versan Aljarrah’s position underscores patience and foresight. He believes XRP’s greatest strength lies not in price volatility but in its utility as the collateral layer of the next financial paradigm. The prudent strategy, as he outlines, is to navigate the ongoing market cycles wisely—leveraging opportunities across the digital asset space, then consolidating wealth into tangible stores of value. In this framework, XRP stands as more than a cryptocurrency—it represents the architecture of digital trust in a world steadily moving beyond paper money and manual settlement. For those aligned with Aljarrah’s Black Swan Capitalist vision, XRP isn’t a trade. It’s a position in the future of finance.

However, this development has also sparked a different debate in the cryptocurrency community: The commentary on gold made 25 years ago by Hal Finney, an early Bitcoin pioneer who is frequently accused of being Bitcoin's founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, has come back to the fore. In a 2000 assessment, Finney described gold as “just a piece of yellow metal,” adding that nanotechnology could even extract gold from seawater in the future, and arguing that no one would invest serious effort in this mineral in the long term. Related News: Solana (SOL) Makes Unexpected Early Announcement - May Upset Users Known for his belief in technology and innovation, Finney's views are now widely considered an early prediction reflecting the “spirit of Bitcoin.” According to cryptocurrency historians, Finney is the most likely person, statistically, to be Satoshi Nakamoto. This view is based on Finney's extensive knowledge of cryptography, his contributions to Bitcoin's early days, his interest in Japanese culture, and the fact that he lives just 11 kilometers from Dorian Nakamoto, the alleged Satoshi. For Bitcoin to surpass the total market capitalization of gold, its current price would need to reach $1.43 million. *This is not investment advice.

He believes that the milestone is a testament to the real-world impact of USDT on global financial inclusion. Tether has been making efforts to expand digital dollar access in emerging markets, where USDT helps in remittances and payments in developing countries. The stablecoin issuer has also maintained efforts for USDT grassroots adoption, engaging with communities to integrate the stablecoin into everyday financial activities. Tether plans to launch another dollar-backed stablecoin Bloomberg reported last month that Tether is planning to raise approximately $20 billion at a valuation of around $500 billion, representing about 3% of the company. The initiative would make the stablecoin issuer one of the most valuable private companies globally, alongside high-tech companies like OpenAI and SpaceX. On-chain data revealed that USDT’s stablecoin supply is at around $182 billion. Circle’s USDC follows with about $75 billion of stablecoin in circulation. “Programmable money is the ultimate social network. A peer-to-peer construct that transports both information and value.” – Paolo Ardoino , Founder and CEO of Tether. Cryptopolitan previously reported that Tether, based in El Salvador, plans to launch a dollar-backed stablecoin, USAT, designed for the U.S. market. Bo Hines, CEO of Tether’s newly-established U.S. arm, mentioned at a conference in Seoul that the company doesn’t plan to raise money for the initiative. Instead, the transaction would include new equity rather than existing investors selling their shares to raise capital. The El Salvador-based firm has faced scrutiny for not providing a full independent audit on its stablecoin balance sheet, but has released quarterly attestations signed by BDO Italia. Ardoino hinted that obtaining a review from the top audit firms, including Deloitte, EY, PwC, or KPMG, is a top priority for the company. Tether also reported a record quarterly net profit of $4.9 billion in Q2, surpassing its previous net profit record of $4.52 billion set during the first quarter of 2024. The stablecoin issuer maintained that it’s among the largest holders of U.S. government debt globally, and its milestone also followed the U.S.’s decisive steps to establish stablecoin rules through the introduction of the GENIUS Act. Stablecoin legislation expands USDT’s presence Ardoino was present as U.S. President Donald Trump was signing the stablecoin legislation, which creates a federal regulatory framework for fiat-pegged tokens. The bill requires stablecoins to be fully backed by U.S. dollars or similarly liquid assets, and it also mandates annual audits for issuers with a market capitalization exceeding $50 billion. The new stablecoin legislation has led more traditional banks to start planning the launch of their own dollar-backed digital assets. Financial institutions co-owned by JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are among the top traditional banks threatening Tether’s dominance in the stablecoin market. Ardonio told Bloomberg that those competitors might surpass Tether in the short term in the U.S., but he believes that the USDT issuer has better technology. He argued that Tether has a much better understanding of the stablecoin market than any other company. Tether’s CEO also maintained that the firm does not plan to go public like its competitor, Circle. Tether has had a different trajectory in Europe after the implementation of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The regulation instructed exchanges across the region to stop offering stablecoins that are not compliant with the new rules by April 2025. The rules affected Tether’s USDT since it doesn’t meet MiCA’s regulatory requirements. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) allowed stablecoin issuers to use their digital assets for a limited period until March 2025. The initiative led to major exchanges removing USDT pairs, causing its market share to drop from 70% in November 2024 to nearly 60% by October 2025.

According to Santiment data shared on October 21, investors acquired over 30 million XRP tokens, worth roughly $74 million, in the past 24 hours. XRP whale transaction chart. Source: Santiment Wallets holding between 100,000 and 10 million XRP saw increased accumulation even as prices remained subdued, suggesting potential front-running of a larger move. Historically, such whale activity has often preceded XRP rallies, fueling speculation that $3 could be the next target. XRP treasury fuels whales activity The move coincides with Ripple, XRP’s parent company, working to establish a treasury for the asset. Evernorth Holdings, a Ripple-backed firm, plans to merge with SPAC Armada Acquisition Corp. II to raise over $1 billion, primarily to purchase XRP on the open market and build an institutional-scale treasury. Key investors include SBI Holdings, Pantera Capital, Kraken, GSR Markets, and Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen . At current prices, the fund could acquire about 435 million XRP, or 0.75% of the circulating supply. Analysts note that this buying could represent nearly 20% of daily market liquidity if executed over 90 days, potentially boosting prices. However, the impact will depend on how quickly and transparently the funds are deployed. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.48, showing consolidation. On the daily chart, the asset is up almost 1%, with a similar gain on the weekly chart. XRP seven-day price chart.

Speaking at the American Bankers Association (ABA) Annual Convention in Charlotte on October 19, Gould told attendees that any large movement of deposits linked to stablecoins “would not happen in unnoticed fashion” and “would not happen overnight.” Happening this AM at #ABAAnnual in Charlotte: Opening remarks from @BankersPrez Welcome from NC Bankers CEO Peter Gwaltney Remarks from @NC_Governor @USOCC outlook from @USComptroller Gould Capitol Hill update from @SenTedBuddNC Watch https://t.co/90HYqMpgQ5 — American Bankers Association (@ABABankers) October 20, 2025 His comments come amid growing friction between federal regulators and traditional banking groups over the rise of stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar. The market has expanded sharply this year, rising from $205 billion in January to over $307 billion, according to DeFiLlama . Tether’s USDT controls roughly 59% of the market, followed by Circle’s USDC. Source: DeFiLlama The rapid expansion has intensified calls from the banking industry for tighter oversight. What “Loophole” in the GENIUS Act does the Banking Lobby Warn of? In August, the American Bankers Association and over 50 state banking groups urged Congress to close what they called “loopholes” in the GENIUS Act , the new federal stablecoin law signed in July by President Donald Trump . The groups warned that the law allows stablecoin issuers to indirectly pay yield through affiliates, which they claim could lead to massive deposit outflows from the banking system. US banks have warned that a gap in the GENIUS Act could allow stablecoin issuers to skirt restrictions on paying yield to holders. #Stablecoin #Crypto https://t.co/N7lSngpPof — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 13, 2025 In a joint letter, the Bank Policy Institute, Consumer Bankers Association, Independent Community Bankers of America, and Financial Services Forum said yield-bearing stablecoins could drain as much as $6.6 trillion from traditional banks, citing estimates from the U.S. Treasury. They argued that such outflows could push up interest rates, reduce loan availability, and raise borrowing costs for households and businesses. “Payment stablecoins should not pay interest the way highly regulated and supervised banks do,” the letter stated, emphasizing that stablecoin issuers do not lend or invest in securities to generate returns. Source: BPI OCC’s Gould Downplays Crisis Fears, Urges Smaller Banks to See Stablecoins as Opportunity, Not Threat However, Jonathan Gould dismissed the idea of an imminent threat, noting that stablecoin adoption could instead benefit smaller banks by providing new ways to compete in digital payments. He said the OCC closely monitors such activity and would act swiftly if necessary. “If there were to be a material flight from the banking system, I would be taking action,” Gould said, adding that highly placed officials and trade associations would also step in. He urged community banks to view stablecoins as a competitive tool, not a threat, suggesting they could help smaller institutions challenge the dominance of Wall Street giants in the payments market. He also added that the OCC is working on rulemakings tied to the GENIUS Act and is “very conscious of the statutory deadlines that Congress has given us.” “Payment stablecoin connectivity might be a possibility for community banks to break some of the dominance that exists right now among the very largest banks in the payment system in America,” Gould said, pledging to ensure there are “safe and sound” ways for banks to participate. Stablecoins Face Crossfire: Banks Warn, Regulators Reassure, Adoption Grows The OCC’s stance contrasts sharply with the warnings issued by major banking associations and foreign regulators. Earlier this month, the European Systemic Risk Board, chaired by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, cautioned that multi-issuer stablecoin models could destabilize the EU’s financial system , while the Bank of England announced plans for temporary caps on stablecoin holdings to protect credit availability. In the U.S., the debate has also drawn strong responses from crypto platforms. Coinbase recently published a detailed rebuttal to claims that stablecoins threaten financial stability, calling the “deposit erosion” narrative a myth designed to defend banks’ $187 billion annual payment processing revenues. The exchange argued that stablecoin usage actually strengthens the U.S. dollar’s global role and found “no meaningful correlation” between stablecoin adoption and deposit flight from community banks over the past five years. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered has warned that over $1 trillion could flow out of emerging-market banks into stablecoins by 2028 as adoption accelerates globally, accounting for up to 10% of the U.S. money supply. The bank said stablecoins are increasingly serving as dollar-based savings tools in countries facing high inflation and weak local currencies. Despite the ongoing debate, stablecoin integration into mainstream finance is accelerating. Coinbase , Circle , Ripple , and Paxos are all seeking federal banking charters to issue or manage stablecoins under OCC supervision. Japanese giant Sony also joined that list this month , applying to establish “Connectia Trust,” a U.S. national crypto bank that would issue a dollar-pegged token under OCC regulation. While banks continue to warn of risks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has taken a more optimistic stance , saying digital dollars could expand access to U.S. currency worldwide and boost demand for Treasuries.

With this move, the firm establishes itself as a dedicated $300 million crypto hedge fund , led by Joe Naggar, a veteran of the traditional finance world known for having deep crypto roots. Feynman goes independent, but nothing will change about its focus Joe Naggar’s deep crypto roots are no joke. He was a former partner at Steven Tananbaum’s GoldenTree Asset Management for 16 years, where he oversaw its $61 billion in credit assets; he started mining Bitcoin as far back as 2013 and was part of those who invested in projects like Stacks and Algorand, as well as Coinbase. He started assembling a dedicated digital assets team inside GoldenTree in 2022. However, following a wave of collapses—Celsius, Voyager Digital, FTX— and a regulatory crackdown, GoldenTree was sold to Republic, a New York-based investment firm, less than two years later. Now, Naggar and his team have decided to go independent as Feynman Point Asset Management, an investment firm with a focus on digital asset markets and frontier technologies. Naggar has reassured that despite the change, the firm will keep doing precisely what it was doing before and more. “The Feynman Point Special Opportunities Fund we’ve created to bring some of our best investment ideas to our LPs to co-participate is one example of that,” he said. Through transitions, the fund has performed well with its backers—including L1D, a $600 million Swiss fund, and New York-based Blockchain Investment Group— earning an annualized net return of over 42% since the fund’s inception in 2022. Some of its winning moves have included buying the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) at a 40% discount to its underlying assets, early exposure to breakout decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, and an equity investment in Ripple, developer of the XRP cryptocurrency. These investments have paid off well and have the potential to do even better in the future. Naggar has also expressed vested interest in the growing digital asset treasury (DAT) sector and has said the firm is “invested in 15 or 17 different DATs” including Tom Lee’s BitMine Immersion Technologies, Joe Lubin’s SharpLink Gaming, Cantor Fitzgerald-backed Twenty One Capital and Kyle Samani’s Forward Industries. “Some DATs are kind of money grabs and maybe don’t deserve the attention, but there are others that add some real value, either in the ecosystem or for investors, by doing smart stuff,” Naggar added. The hedge fund boom continues while private equity suffers The decision of Feynman Point Asset Management to spin out is proof of how much more mature the space has gotten. Its new independent status will let Feynman Point take bigger swings with fewer constraints, and it is further proof of the broader hedge fund boom. Over the past couple of months, a considerable number of traditional funds have dipped their toes into crypto, with heavyweight players like Brevan Howard and Pantera raising billions, highlighting how hedge funds and crypto strategies have been gaining momentum in the world of alternative investments. Meanwhile, fundraising for private equity and credit — once Wall Street’s most reliable cash magnets — continues to slow. In the past, those private markets absorbed vast sums of cash, with funds closing in record time and little debate over where the next dollar would go. According to reports, fundraising has now slumped to its weakest in years, hampered by clogged exits and investors who are waiting for liquidity to flow back. In fact, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co., private credit is on track to have its weakest year since 2018, with fundraising timelines stretching close to two years, the longest since the financial crisis.

Sign secured a $16 million investment from YZi Labs in January, marking the company's first investment since its rebranding. To date, Sign has raised over $55 million in total funding, including seed, Series A, and strategic rounds. The company's CEO, Xin Yan, stated that the new capital will be used to grow its technology team and expand its global operations. Yan said, “We are looking to add top talent to our team with expertise in Hyperledger Fabric, zero-knowledge proofs, and interoperability.

Both our investors and our team believe it is time to overcome this biggest hurdle by collaborating with countries,” Yan said. “Our goal is to develop innovative solutions that will benefit nations while respecting existing regulations.” The Sign team is currently collaborating with Thailand and South Korea, as well as leading technology countries in Central Asia and the Middle East. “While the concept of blockchain for nations is new, we believe the technology needs to be adopted progressively. Projects like Tempo share this vision. However, we aim to implement a national-level digital currency system before competitors like Ripple or Solana,” Yan added. *This is not investment advice.

Fed Governor Christopher Waller announced the proposal during the central bank’s inaugural Payments Innovation Conference on October 21, introducing what he termed “payment accounts” or “skinny master accounts” for legally eligible institutions. The move represents a major policy reversal from the Fed’s historically cautious stance toward crypto companies, several of which have spent years fighting for banking access. Companies like Custodia Bank and Kraken, which have pursued Fed master accounts through lengthy legal battles, could benefit immediately from the streamlined approval process. Governor Waller, during the Opening remarks at the payment innovation conference | Source: Federal Reserve Streamlined Fed Accounts Target Stablecoin and Fintech Providers The proposed payment accounts would provide direct connections to Federal Reserve payment rails while maintaining risk controls absent from full master accounts. “This payment account concept would be targeted to provide basic Federal Reserve payment services to legally eligible institutions that right now conduct payment services primarily through a third-party bank,” Waller stated in his opening remarks . BIG NEWS out of the @federalreserve Payments Innovation Conference this morning. Governor Chris Waller announced the central bank is proposing a new type of limited-access master account (or what he calls a “skinny master account”) for ALL legally eligible institutions to… https://t.co/lZh0I0Tj3a pic.twitter.com/Wg7ygjpvJj — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) October 21, 2025 Institutions receiving these accounts would face specific operational restrictions designed to limit Fed balance sheet exposure. Additionally, the accounts would not earn interest on deposited balances, and they might carry mandatory balance caps to control their size. Participants would lose access to daylight overdraft privileges, meaning transactions would be rejected once account balances reach zero. The accounts would also exclude discount window borrowing and certain Fed payment services where the central bank cannot adequately control overdraft risks. “The idea is to tailor the services of these new accounts to the needs of these firms and the risks they present to the Federal Reserve Banks and the payment system,” Waller explained during his speech. Waller also emphasized that every legally eligible entity could qualify for a payment account under existing legal frameworks, with no changes to eligibility requirements. “Payments innovation moves fast, and the Federal Reserve needs to keep up,” Waller told conference attendees. Ripple and Anchorage Digital, both of which filed master account applications in 2025, could see accelerated decisions under the proposed framework. Industry Leaders Gather as Fed Shifts Stance on Digital Assets The announcement drew immediate attention at a conference bringing together crypto executives, including Chainlink CEO Sergey Nazarov, Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas, and Circle President Heath Tarbert, alongside Fed officials. “The defi industry is not viewed with suspicion or scorn,” Waller told the approximately 100 private-sector innovators assembled at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. “Rather, today, you are welcomed to the conversation on the future of payments in the United States and on our home field—something that would have been unimaginable a few years ago,” he added. During panel discussions, Sergey Nazarov pointed out major interoperability challenges during the conference’s opening panel on bridging traditional finance with digital assets. “Nazarov expressed appreciation for regulators’ active role, noting the significance of having these important conversations at the Federal Reserve itself,” according to live conference coverage. Meanwhile, Michael Shaulov, CEO of Fireblocks, emphasized the advantages of blockchain custody during panel discussions on resilience and DeFi integration. “Improving regulations in the US are facilitating these discussions,” Shaulov stated, referencing difficulties traditional bank IT teams face in adopting blockchain infrastructure. Similarly, Jennifer Barker of BNY Mellon emphasized the need for collaboration between traditional finance and DeFi to allow seamless integration. “DeFi enables 24/7 dollar movements previously impossible for many banks,” Barker noted during the conference panels. While the Fed has not specified an implementation timeline for the payment account proposal, Gov. Waller indicated that Fed staff would engage with stakeholders to gather feedback on the benefits and drawbacks before finalizing the framework.

This announcement is a major win for XRP, as they will most likely make these purchases directly from the open market. Think of it as the BlackRock of XRP, a bridge between traditional finance and Ripple’s on-chain liquidity network. The firm plans to go public through a SPAC merger with Armada Acquisition Corp II and will trade under a creative ticker called XRPN. Ripple-backed Evernorth targets Nasdaq debut in Q1 2026 to expand XRP adoption pic.twitter.com/641iAZ3M6E — Blockworks (@Blockworks_) October 20, 2025 Since it was launched by Rippl e , the entire goal is to give institutions regulated access to XRP and build an active, professionally managed treasury around it. Why Evernorth Matters More for XRP Than Most People Realize Evernorth is not your typical crypto project. It is a regulated institutional setup built to buy, hold, and manage XRP for corporations and funds. The company is gunning for over $1 billion in proceeds to create the biggest public XRP treasury out there and push institutional adoption forward. Essentially, it provides Wall Street with a clean and compliant way to enter the crypto market through traditional channels. I’m proud to share that we’ve launched @evernorthxrp , a first-of-its-kind institutional vehicle built to accelerate XRP adoption. With over a decade of uptime and a rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem, XRP is well-positioned for adoption — and Evernorth is built to meet that moment.… pic.twitter.com/2YGgQsNWCd — Asheesh Birla | CEO at Evernorth (@ashgoblue) October 20, 2025 It is backed by prominent investors such as Ripple, SBI Holdings, Pantera Capital, Kraken, and GSR. That lineup positions Evernorth as a serious, regulated player running XRP market infrastructure for institutions. Instead of waiting for banks to gather XRP bit by bit, Evernorth consolidates capital into a single, regulated, and publicly listed vehicle. That makes institutional access to XRP easier, scalable, and mandate-friendly. Think deep liquidity, compliant access, and solid treasury management. By combining a public-market wrapper, transparent treasury policy, and top-tier backers, Evernorth opens the door for funds that cannot buy spot crypto directly but can buy into a listed vehicle instead. That is how real capital moves in at scale. “Open Market Purchase” means buying XRP straight off an exchange at the going price, which naturally pushes the price up as more buyers enter. Unlike private deals done at discounts, this kind of activity is fully transparent. For retail investors, that is exactly what you want to see happening. Ripple Price Prediction: Is XRP About to Explode Beyond $3? Source: XRPUSD / TradingView XRP price is holding strong above a solid demand zone around the 2.30s after that recent market crash. The next key level to watch is 2.60; if the price breaks and holds above that, it could easily run toward 2.80 and maybe even 3.00, where a lot of liquidity is sitting. RSI’s chilling around 60, showing light bullish momentum, but nowhere near overbought. The green path hints at a breakout if buyers keep stepping in, while the orange one shows a possible rejection and retest before any real move up. Overall, XRP’s looking bullish for now, but the real confirmation comes once it clears 2.60. MAXI DOGE: The Next Big Rotation After XRP? With all eyes on XRP’s comeback, institutions are warming up to on-chain assets, and MAXI DOGE is gaining momentum. Institutional money is pouring into crypto again, but retail communities still drive the narrative. Once big capital focuses on compliance and blue chips like XRP, it eventually flows into culture-driven assets that move faster and hit harder. That is where MAXI DOGE comes in. Maxi Doge brings back the original meme coin energy but with smarter tokenomics and real utility. It offers up to 82% APY in staking rewards. It is not just another meme; it is a liquidity magnet built for speed, volatility, and community conviction. The project has already raised over 3.70 million in its presale, proving that retail and whales are both paying attention. Early buyers are calling it Dogecoin 2.0. When profits rotate, MAXI DOGE will be the one catching the next wave of speculative capital.

Following the company's official announcement, the KDA price quickly dropped by nearly 40%. Chart showing the decline in KDA price. Kadena said in a statement: “It is no longer possible for us to continue our business operations. The Kadena organization will immediately cease all commercial activities and active maintenance of the Kadena blockchain.” The company stated that due to current market conditions, they will not be able to continue supporting the project and encouraging its adoption. The Kadena team stated that a small team will remain in place to manage the transition, while all other operations have been halted. However, the statement stated that the Kadena blockchain will not be completely shut down due to its decentralized nature: The Kadena blockchain is not owned or operated by the company. The network is run by independent miners, and the smart contracts and protocols on the chain are managed by its own developers. The company announced that it will release a new software version to ensure the network continues to operate without interruption and will encourage all node operators to upgrade to this version. Kadena also referenced the previous update on the token economy, stating that 566 million KDA will continue to be distributed as mining rewards until 2139, while 83.7 million KDA will be unlocked by 2029.

The deal is pending regulatory approvals and is expected to close in early December, merging Veeam’s backup and recovery with Securiti’s AI data governance. Veeam announced in a press release on Tuesday that merging the two systems will help organizations understand, recover, secure, and unlock the value of AI-driven data management. The cloud data firm’s team added that unifying both systems brings together data resilience with DSPM (Data Security Posture Management), governance, AI trust, and privacy across SaaS, hybrid, and multi-cloud platforms. Veeam explained that the partnership eliminates the challenges of managing fragmented data across SaaS , backups, applications, endpoints, and clouds. CDOs, CIOs, and CISOs will manage, understand, and secure their data from a unified dashboard. Veeam estimates that 80%-90% of AI projects fail due to data-related issues, including permissions, accuracy, identity, lineage, and privacy. Combining Veeam and Securiti will help mitigate these trade-offs from a single command center. Eswaran says it is a new era for data Veeam’s CEO, Anand Eswaran, said the partnership ushers in a new era for data. He believes it is no longer about protecting data from unforeseen disasters and cyber threats; it is also about identifying data to ensure transparent and trusted governance. The executive asserted that the above is the single most critical factor in failed AI projects, adding that combining Veeam and Securiti helps drive new business value. Meanwhile, Security AI’s CEO, Rehan Jalil, believes that enterprise AI is impossible without data security. He claimed that Securiti solves this and ensures safe AI and data usage. “If you want to apply enterprise AI, it is not possible without data security…You cannot if you cannot guarantee that the enterprise proprietary data is going to be safe with AI agents.” – Rehan Jalil , CEO of Securiti The former founder of Elastica also pointed out that Securiti AI is the pioneer of the Data Command Center, which unifies data security and intelligence controls across the hybrid multi-cloud platform. Its extensible built-in agentic framework automates critical functions for data intelligence, while its Gencore AI module powers safe enterprise AI search. Stringfellow claims the partnership bridges the security-compliance gap Paul Stringfellow, the Senior Analyst, Security & Risk at GigaOm, said integrating Veeam and Securiti represents a transformation in how organizations approach the protection and governance of their AI-driven data. He added that these platforms bridge the gap between security, resilience, and compliance. They enable organizations to achieve a context-rich and comprehensive understanding of their data. Stringfellow also believes that this collaboration enables the identification of important data, its utilization, and the users behind it, as well as the reasons for it. He pointed out that these are critical insights for applying effective and precise controls that defend against risks. The analyst also claimed that AI is only as reliable as the data upon which it is built. He emphasized that combining both solutions safeguards sensitive data and prevents unauthorized access to AI models. It also strengthens the ability to detect and mitigate risks while maintaining regulatory compliance and privacy. Stringfellow said unifying data resilience and security addresses the challenge of protecting data in intelligent environments. He added that this enables organizations to harness the power of AI confidently. Veeam also explained that it will continue to offer Securiti AI’s Data Command Center alongside its existing products and will announce the new upgraded capabilities soon. Securiti’s Jalil will join Veeam as President of Security and AI upon the deal’s closure in December. Jalil founded Elastica, which was acquired by Blue Coat for $280 million, before Symantec acquired the joint company for $4.7 billion. He previously founded WiChorus, which was acquired by Tellabs for $180 million.

However, while DOGE continues to capture short-term trader interest, seasoned investors are shifting their attention toward a new crypto coin that could outperform traditional meme tokens in the long run. That project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi-focused altcoin currently in Phase 6 of its presale, already over 70% sold out with more than $17.7 million raised. With projections targeting $3.50 by 2026, Mutuum Finance is being highlighted as the smarter crypto to buy now, offering real utility and early-stage potential reminiscent of some of the most explosive crypto success stories of the past cycle. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Forecast: Bulls Target $0.86 as Momentum Builds Dogecoin (DOGE) is once again on the rise, looking stronger after rebounding off solid levels of support. Analysts are taking notice as the meme token gains traction, with price predictions now at $0.29, $0.45, and even a full bullish breakdown to $0.86 in the event that the momentum keeps building. Market sentiment is becoming more and more bullish, and buyers are starting to begin reentering, so this long-hypothesized DOGE reversal may be close at hand. A decisive break above the $0.30 level could be the trigger that initiates this next leg higher, with traders salivating at the prospect of volatility. But as DOGE reclaims prominence on new hype, investors are surreptitiously piling in on the ground floor of crypto Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an emerging presale token that’s brewing serious buzz before 2026’s next market cycle. Mutuum Finance Unstoppable Rise Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making headlines in cryptocurrency news today with investor appetite growing for its Phase 6 presale. The token currently sits at $0.035, a 16.17% spike from the last phase, enticing traders seeking best crypto during a time of market fluctuation. That is as cheap as MUTM will ever be. Phase 7 will include a price jump to $0.04. To date, more than 17,330 investors have invested over $17.7 million. Over 70% of Phase 6 tokens are already sold out, which indicates high confidence by early birds waiting for the next significant milestone for the project, the launch of Mutuum Finance’s lending and borrowing protocol . Coming in Q4 2025 on the Sepolia Testnet, Version 1 (V1) will introduce fundamental DeFi infrastructure components like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the Liquidator bot. Top Buyers to Get Rewarded Mutuum Finance leaderboard has proven to be a major pull for the investors, bringing energy into the community through its reward for the daily challenge. The largest buyers acquired $12,538, $11,667, and $1,027 worth of MUTM tokens respectively in the past 24 hours alone. Its top leaderboard holder is rewarded with a $500 MUTM reward. The clients must process minimum one transaction within a 24-hour period for it to show up on the day’s board. Although Dogecoin (DOGE) claims to bounce back, savvy investors are keeping an eye on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a crypto coin selling for $0.035 in Phase 6 of presale, already 70% sold out. Experts estimate that it may be worth $3.50 by the year 2026. Mutuum’s Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract framework combined provides in-app DeFi functionality. V1 protocol launches on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with the advent of liquidity pools, mtTokens, and debt tokens. With exponential growth and investor excitement, MUTM may beat DOGE in the subsequent bull cycle, making it one of the most talked-about crypto projects of 2025.

The token currently trades around $1,060, marking its lowest level in nearly a month. The downturn comes as Binance co-founders Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and Yi He warn investors about a wave of phishing scams and fake memecoin airdrops spreading through social media. Related Reading: All It Took Was A Tweet: FLOKI Jumps 27% After Musk Mentions It In one of the most damaging incidents, the official X (formerly Twitter) account of BNB Chain, followed by nearly four million users, was hijacked to promote a fraudulent token campaign linked to a fake airdrop. CZ and Yi He Sound the Alarm CZ took to X to issue a direct warning, “Official accounts do not endorse any particular memecoin.” He cautioned users against interacting with suspicious contract addresses or promotional posts, noting that scammers increasingly exploit verified profiles to appear legitimate. Yi He echoed these concerns, reminding traders that responsibility also lies with users. “Please, while everyone is doing on-chain investments, also take responsibility for your own actions,” she stated. The recent “Sir Pancake” scam, a fake token that generated $20 million in volume before collapsing, shows the scale of the problem. Data suggests that roughly 2.5% of new tokens launched on BNB Chain since 2022 have exhibited scam-like behavior, often disappearing within hours of launch.

The latest wave of exploits shows that even platforms with strong security reputations remain vulnerable when hype outpaces due diligence. Tokens launched on the BNB Chain have produced massive gains, one trader converted $3,500 into nearly $7.9 million in just days. That frenzy has fueled ecosystem activity and attracted speculative capital, but it has also exposed Binance Coin (BNB) and its holders to heightened risk.

However, the euphoria has cooled as broader market conditions turned sour and infrastructure issues crept in. Binance Coin has slipped back toward $1,100 as the crypto market pulled back, and the BNB Chain faced multiple disruptions, including scam projects that have significantly exposed BNB investors.

This week, a post from popular X user Time Traveler reignited speculation across the XRP community after he shared a video featuring market analyst Jake Claver discussing possible XRP price projections for the coming years. But Time Traveler’s own remark that followed — “Just for the record, I only saw $73k XRP in my dream” — turned the entire conversation viral. Jake Claver’s XRP Price Prediction Explained In the video clip, Jake Claver shared a sequence of potential XRP price milestones tied to expected market catalysts. According to Claver, once exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other drivers enter play, XRP could see prices “between $10 and $50.” He went further to express a 95% certainty that such developments might unfold within the year. Claver also speculated that if adoption accelerates, XRP might reach three- or four-digit prices by the end of 2025. Looking ahead to 2026–2027, he projected that as tokenization of derivatives gains momentum, XRP could rise into five-digit territory. Just for the record, I only saw $73k XRP in my dream. pic.twitter.com/5YKsDUkdRo — 𝚃𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚃𝚛𝚊𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚛 (@Traveler2236) October 21, 2025 By 2030, assuming that 85% of global assets are tokenized on-chain, he envisioned XRP reaching six figures, and possibly even a million-dollar mark within a decade under full tokenization. Time Traveler’s Response and the Viral Post Time Traveler’s follow-up comment wasn’t a direct endorsement of those extreme predictions. Instead, his line about seeing “$73k XRP in my dream” seemed to inject humor into an otherwise intense discussion about XRP’s long-term valuation. The remark was both playful and provocative, blending humor with crypto speculation, a formula that quickly captured attention across X. Though many readers took the statement at face value, others understood it as Time Traveler’s way of acknowledging how outlandish such projections sound , even in an industry famous for ambitious forecasts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Market Reality and Ripple’s Position Currently, XRP trades near $2.40, maintaining its place among the world’s top digital assets. Ripple’s ecosystem continues to grow, with institutional partnerships, global payment integrations, and the launch of its stablecoin RLUSD reinforcing its position in the cross-border payments sector. However, while XRP’s fundamentals and adoption trends are strengthening, there is no verified evidence to suggest that price levels anywhere near Claver’s or Time Traveler’s figures are on the horizon. Given XRP’s large circulating supply of roughly 60 billion tokens, such valuations remain economically implausible under current market conditions. The Realistic Takeaway Time Traveler’s $73k claim belongs firmly in the “viral speculation” category, intriguing and entertaining. His post was clearly a tongue-in-cheek reaction to Claver’s bullish XRP forecast, not a formal prediction. While it has generated lively debate online, sound investing still depends on verifiable data, not dreams or social media commentary. Ultimately, Time Traveler’s post underscores how XRP price predictions can capture the imagination of the crypto community — reminding investors that in digital finance, optimism may be limitless, but reality remains the ultimate measure.

Speaking from the White House Rose Garden during a lunch with Republican lawmakers, Trump said he believes the meeting could result in a strong agreement on trade but admitted that “maybe it won’t happen.” “I have a great relationship with President Xi. I expect to be able to make a good deal with him,” Trump said, adding, “I want him to make a good deal for China — but it’s got to be fair.” He said he views the possible sit-down as “very successful” but didn’t rule out the chance of it falling apart completely. “Maybe somebody will say, ‘I don’t want to meet, it’s too nasty.’ But it’s really not nasty. It’s just business,” Trump added. Trump pushes for deal, but trade fight with China escalates Trump confirmed that the date and time for the meeting haven’t been finalized but said he expects it will happen “in about two weeks.”He also made it clear that the U.S. will continue pushing for changes in the trade relationship, regardless of whether or not the meeting with Xi takes place. The agenda for that potential conversation is expected to include fentanyl, soybean exports , Taiwan, and the current fight over rare earth materials, which has escalated sharply in recent weeks. Ahead of the expected Trump-Xi meeting, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to meet with Chinese counterparts this weekend. The plan is to work on reducing tensions after China rolled out new restrictions on rare earth exports and Trump responded by threatening more tariffs on Chinese products. This back-and-forth has added to the uncertainty around the summit and what could come out of it. On Monday, just a day before making the remarks about Xi, Trump met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the White House. Both leaders signed a new agreement to team up on developing supply chains for rare earths and critical minerals. That move directly challenges China, the world’s biggest supplier of rare earths, and came right after Beijing’s announcement that it would tighten controls on those materials. That decision by China was made earlier this month. China fires back after U.S.-Australia deal Following the U.S.-Australia agreement, the Chinese government issued a response. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, told FOX Business that “the global industrial and supply chains came into shape as a result of the choices of the market and businesses.” Liu said countries with mineral resources “need to play a positive role in keeping relevant industrial and supply chains safe and stable and to ensure normal trade and economic cooperation.” As the two governments throw punches over trade, minerals, and tech control, the numbers paint a clear picture of who holds the upper hand — and who’s trying to catch up. Data from the U.S. Geological Survey shows that in 2024, China produced 270,000 tons of rare earths and holds 44 million tons in reserves. The U.S. only produced 45,000 tons, with 1.9 million tons in reserves. Australia trails with 13,000 tons produced and 5.7 million tons of reserves. The reason this matters? Rare earths power everything from smartphones and electric vehicle batteries to military equipment like radars and cruise missiles. With Trump still unsure if he’ll meet Xi in South Korea, the weight of the global tech economy, and a whole lot of geopolitics, is now hanging on whether the two presidents can agree to talk.

The hunt for the best crypto to buy and hold for the long term never slows down, and every so often, a project comes along that changes how people see early adoption. Investors chase the best crypto to buy and hold for the long term, like it’s the ticket to their dream portfolio. Finding the next top performer isn’t about luck. It’s about spotting the right combination of transparency, tokenomics, and community trust. XRP and SUI have made strong moves with important updates and solid ecosystems, but MoonBull ($MOBU) has taken the spotlight with hype reminiscent of early Dogecoin. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Hottest Entry in the Best Crypto to Buy and Hold for Long Term List The best crypto to buy and hold for the long term must offer more than promises. It needs structure, sustainability, and a system that rewards holders. MoonBull ($MOBU), built on Ethereum, does exactly that. It’s a meme token built around fairness, transparency, and lasting value for regular traders. Whenever someone sells, a share of that transaction goes to liquidity, another to holders, and a final portion is burned. This ensures steady liquidity, consistent holder rewards, and a tightening supply that supports the price. MoonBull has already passed an audit and locked its liquidity. That means investors can trust that no backdoor tricks or rug pulls are hiding behind the hype. Another standout feature is its community voting system, which activates midway through the presale at Stage 12. Each holder gains a vote to influence decisions such as token burns, marketing pushes, and other initiatives. It’s a token that gives power back to the people holding it. MoonBull Presale: Numbers That Speak for Themselves MoonBull ($MOBU) is now in its 5th presale stage, priced at $0.00006584, with over $450,000 already raised and more than 1,400 holders participating. Early investors are already seeing strong returns, with gains reaching 163.36% up to this stage and a projected 9,256% ROI once the token lists at $0.00616. The next price increase of 27.40% is on the horizon, making this an ideal moment to get in early. If someone invests $20,000 in MoonBull ($MOBU) right now, they would receive approximately 303,766,707.17 MOBU tokens, which could be worth about $1,871,202.92 when the listing price hits. It’s the kind of opportunity that makes people say, “It’s like getting into Bitcoin when it still had training wheels.” With excitement growing each week, MoonBull is shaping up to be one of the best cryptos to buy and hold for the long term this year. XRP (XRP): A Veteran Option Among the Best Cryptos When it comes to established players, XRP continues to stand firm in discussions about the best crypto to buy and hold for the long term. Currently trading around $2.43, XRP is still one of the most recognized names in digital finance. Its focus on real-world utility for cross-border payments keeps it relevant among institutional players and financial networks. XRP’s use case remains clear: instant, low-cost transactions for global transfers. Despite market corrections, it maintains deep liquidity and a broad user base. Recent reports show that while investor sentiment has dipped due to macroeconomic uncertainty, upcoming regulatory clarity and potential ETF discussions could boost its outlook. XRP is less about hype and more about structure. For investors who value stability and steady progress over explosive speculation, XRP deserves a place in the conversation about the best crypto to buy and hold for long term. SUI (SUI): The Silent Builder with Layer-1 Potential SUI brings a different strength to the best crypto to buy and hold for long-term narrative. As a high-performance Layer-1 blockchain, it’s focused on scalability, speed, and user-friendly infrastructure. Recently, SUI has seen a notable increase in total value locked (TVL) and developer activity, driven by new yield-bearing DeFi tools. Trading around $2.67, SUI has attracted institutional inflows that have even surpassed XRP’s in some recent weeks. Developers are deploying regulated token solutions, and activity across decentralized apps is climbing. Investors who prefer substance over flash find SUI appealing. It offers real technological utility, a growing ecosystem, and a roadmap centered on scalability and adoption. That positions it as a solid choice for anyone looking for the best crypto to buy and hold for long term without chasing short-term hype. Final Thoughts Based on research and market trends, MoonBull ($MOBU) stands out as a leading pick for investors looking for the best crypto to buy and hold for the long term . With locked liquidity, an audit-passed system, community voting, staking rewards, and a presale model built around fairness, MoonBull blends excitement with real mechanics.

In March 2024, Fetch AI, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET came together to form the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI), a token merger designed to unify the three projects. It was going to have one ecosystem token, FET , which was projected to later become ASI. The alliance was conceived to pool resources to become leaders in the area of decentralized artificial intelligence. Holders of OCEAN and AGIX (SingularityNET’s token) were able to convert their holdings into FET easily as a result. The tokens at the center of the whole drama originate from the over 56% OCEAN tokens set aside by the Ocean protocol for community incentives. On-chain activity and the claims In its thread on X , on-chain analytics platform BubbleMaps pointed out that in July, an Ocean Protocol team wallet (0x4D9B76Df13DF257A674AEc7Ec7232741A6E73883) converted about 661 million OCEAN into roughly 286 million FET and sent 90 million FET to GSR Markets, an over-the-counter (OTC) trading firm. On August 31, the remaining 196 million FET was reportedly sent to 30 newly created addresses, and by mid-October, most of those funds had been sent to Binance or OTC providers. A total of 160 million FET was reportedly sent to Binance and 109 million FET to GSR Markets, bringing the combined amount to an estimated $120 million. Ocean Protocol and Fetch AI trade public accusations In an X post made on October 15, Fetch AI’s CEO, Humayun Sheikh recounted the token movements, including the July conversion and the subsequent transfers to Binance and GSR, and framed them as contradictory to the spirit of the ASI alliance. In that post, he said that, were the actions to have been taken by Ocean as a stand-alone project, they “would be classed as a rug pull,” and he urged Binance, GSR, and other entities to investigate and “do the right thing.” Sheikh, in a prior post, had hinted that legal steps were being taken and that Fetch AI would pursue remedies to protect its community after he called out Ocean Protocol and OceanDAO for their role in the conversion and transfer of FET tokens. Ocean Protocol’s CEO, Bruce Pon, responded to Sheikh on X by dismissing the accusations as “unfounded and baseless rumors” and saying the foundation was preparing a formal reply to address the claims. However, to date, a formal reply has not been made. Ocean Protocol announced on October 9 that it had withdrawn from the ASI alliance. However, that announcement did not mention the transfers. Following Bubblemap’s post, Sheikh announced a $250,000 “reward to anyone who can uncover the OceanDAO signatories and their connections to Ocean Foundation.” Stakes are high for the alliance and community trust The ASI Alliance was promoted as a blueprint for cross-chain collaboration in artificial intelligence. It reportedly had a combined value of $7.5 billion at the beginning. However, the recent events between Ocean Protocol and Fetch AI have exposed the fragility of such partnerships when governance structures and token ownership are not clearly defined. The lack of transparent reporting on token conversions on the part of Ocean Protocol raises eyebrows. However, its CEO has called on the parties of the partnership to “waive confidentiality on the adjudicator’s recent findings and let the community inspect and decide.” The recent events have left many token holders uncertain about the fate of their investments. Fetch AI is likely to go ahead with litigation, as it is planning to do so as a collective with users that suffered losses as a result of the event. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

However, these gains could be short-lived as Bitcoin resumed its crash, a sign that Monday’s surge was a dead-cat bounce. MSTR stock price technicals points to a steeper crash The daily chart reveals that the MicroStrategy stock price remains on edge despite falling by 36% from its highest point this year. It has moved from a high of $456 in June to $292 today. The MSTR stock price has moved below the important resistance level at $360, its lowest point in May. It initially dropped below that level in August and then retested it in September. A break-and-retest pattern is one of the most common bearish continuation signs. The Strategy stock price has remained below the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). It has also moved between the lower and middle sides of the Bollinger Bands pattern. Worse, the stock has formed a death cross pattern, which happens when the 50 and 200-day moving averages cross each other when facing downwards. The Trend Strength Index (TSI) has continued falling and is now nearing the oversold level. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the stock continues falling in the coming months. If this happens, there is a risk that the MSTR stock price will drop to the key support level at $200. The bearish MSTR stock price forecast will become invalid if it moves above the key resistance level at $360. MSTR stock price chart | Source: TradingView Why MicroStrategy stock is at risk There are a few reasons why the MSTR stock price is at risk of further downside. One of the key risks is that the premium that the company has long enjoyed is falling quickly. The mNAV multiple has dropped from 3.3 in November last year to 1.2 today. This falling mNAV is risky for the company as it means that it will struggle to raise capital in the near term. Historically, the company had a policy that barred it from selling shares when the multiple was below 2.5. Saylor changed this policy in August as the NAV figure continued falling. As a result, most of the Bitcoin purchases are now being funded by its ATM capital raising mechanism, that have led to a substantial dilution of its shareholders. Another key risk is that Bitcoin price is not doing well. As the chart below shows, the coin has formed a double-top pattern on the weekly and daily charts. This means that it may continue falling, potentially to $100,000 and below. Bitcoin price chart | Source: TradingView In line with the first point, there are signs that most companies in the Bitcoin treasury industry are losing their NAV multiples. Japan’s Metaplanet stock price has crashed, bringing its EV NAV multiple to below 1. There are also signs that demand for MSTR and other Bitcoin treasury companies is fading. A closer look at most of the companies in the industry are plunging. This includes popular names like Trump Media and GameStop. One reason for this is that most companies that have raised their treasuries were struggling and saw the approach as an easy way out. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the MSTR stock price continues falling this year and then rebounds as investors buy the dip.

Major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , and Ripple (XRP) , have struggled to regain momentum since last Friday’s flash crash. The cheer around “Uptober” has also faded, as traders remain wary of making large bets amid heightened volatility. Analysts have noted that sentiment remains subdued, with BTC down over 2% over the past 30 days. BTC started the week in positive territory, crossing the $111,000 mark and trading around $111,500. However, momentum faded as price action turned bearish. As a result, BTC slipped below $110,000, falling to a low of $107,550 before moving to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency is down over 3%, trading around $107,870. ETH has also fallen below $4,000, with the price down over 4% at $3,893. XRP is down nearly 2%, while Solana (SOL) is down almost 5% at $184. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 4% and Cardano (ADA) is down 5% at $0.642. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , Toncoin (TON) , and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered substantial declines over the past 24 hours. BitMine, Strategy Expand Crypto Portfolios The cryptocurrency market is back in the red as crypto assets struggle to regain momentum after the October 10 flash crash. Despite the market downturn, institutional confidence in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remains strong. Corporate giants, including Strategy and BitMine Immersion Technologies, bought the dip, expanding their crypto holdings. According to data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, Bitmine Immersion Technologies purchased $250 million worth of ETH. “Tom Lee just bought another $250 million in ETH. Three new addresses bought $250 million in ETH from Bitgo and Kraken. These accounts match Bitmine’s prior acquisition pattern.” BitMine revealed it has accumulated 203,826 ETH, valued at over $800 million, over the past week, taking its total stash past 3.3 million ETH, worth around $13 billion. Meanwhile, Strategy, the largest corporate holder of BTC, also used the dip as an opportunity to buy. According to a post by Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor, the firm purchased 168 BTC for $18.8 million at an average cost of $112,051 per coin. Strategy now holds 640,418 BTC, valued at over $69.3 billion. “Strategy has acquired 168 BTC for ~$18.8 million at ~$112,051 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 26.0% YTD 2025.” Next Crypto Bear Cycle Will Have A New Trigger Crypto analyst Willy Woo believes the next crypto bear market could be exceptionally brutal and be driven by a business cycle downturn not seen before. The analyst noted in a post on X, “We had two 4y cycles superimposed. Now it's only one: global M2 liquidity. Next bear IMO will be defined by another cycle, people forget about → the business cycle. The last biz cycle downturns that really took hold were 2008 and 2001, from before crypto markets were invented.” A business cycle downturn is a period of economic contraction that sees a drop in GDP and a jump in unemployment, a decline in consumer spending, and a general slowdown in business activity. The 2001 business cycle downturn saw rising unemployment and a 50% drop in US stock prices over two years. Meanwhile, the 2008 financial crisis saw a GDP contraction, a jump in unemployment rates, and a 56% drop in the S&P 500, triggered by a subprime mortgage crisis, credit freeze, and a banking system collapse. US Government Shutdown Likely To End This Week According to a White House economic advisor, the US government shutdown is likely to end sometime this week. Kevin Hassett stated during an interview, “I think the Schumer shutdown is likely to end sometime this week. The moderate Democrats will move forward and get us an open government, at which point we could negotiate whatever policies they want to negotiate with regular order.” Hassett added that if the shutdown does not end, the Trump administration could impose stronger measures to force the Democrats to cooperate. Hassett is President Trump’s top pick to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in May 2026. “Bitcoin Is Not Crypto” Twitter creator Jack Dorsey has reignited the debate around Bitcoin (BTC) after posting a brief message stating “Bitcoin is not crypto.” The message prompted a massive response from the community. Many argued that Satoshi Nakamoto described Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency on the BitcoinTalk forum in 2010, and Dorsey highlighted the word “currency” to indicate its monetary roots. Dorsey has long been rumored to play a role in BTC’s creation. Dorsey has denied being Nakamoto several times, stating in a 2020 interview, “No, and if I were, would I tell you?” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) slumped back into bearish territory as its recovery lost momentum after reaching an intraday high of $111,748 on Monday. The flagship cryptocurrency rebounded over the weekend, rising 0.70% on Saturday and 1.37% on Sunday to settle at $108,676. BTC started the week in positive territory despite volatility, rising nearly 2% to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,568. However, analysts' worries about a dead-cat bounce have come true, with BTC down almost 3% during the ongoing session, trading around $107,590. BTC has struggled to regain momentum after the October 10 flash crash. The crash dragged markets down from record levels, wiping around $500 billion in market capitalization. The crash heightened risk aversion as investors became wary of making large bets. The drop also wiped out optimism around “Uptober”, with BTC down over 2% on the monthly timeframe. Forex analysts stated, “So far this year, Uptober hasn’t gone to plan for Bitcoin bulls. Instead of seasonal strength, the price action has remained subdued with an early rally fizzling midway through the month, delivering an ugly reversal that may not be over yet.” The analysts also highlighted that BTC was rapidly breaking down correlations with broader risk-driven markets, primarily equities. BTC has also faltered over the past two weeks, even as Wall Street indexes hit record highs recently. While BTC’s price action has struggled in recent sessions, a report released by Coinbase Institutional and Coinglass revealed that most investors believe the bull market will continue for the next 3-6 months. David Duong, Coinbase Institutional’s head of research, stated that he expects favorable macroeconomic, regulatory, and policy conditions to persist. Additionally, digital asset treasury companies will continue to amplify demand for BTC and other assets, and more rate cuts by the end of the year could mobilize $7 trillion in idle funds. However, Duong also highlighted several challenges, including the ongoing government shutdown. The shutdown has delayed key economic data and stalled the growing momentum behind crypto ETFs. Duong also cast doubt on the long-term feasibility of the digital asset treasury business model. BTC trader Daan Crypto Trades believes there is more volatility to come, stating, “Volatility is definitely high here due to the thin books post this massive market flush. Books are thin. Especially after the massive liquidation event last week. This, combined with weekend price action and a lot of emotional traders, makes for relatively volatile moves on low timeframes.” BTC and the broader crypto market crashed last Friday (October 10), after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls for software. The announcement was made in retaliation for China imposing restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. As a result, BTC plunged to $102,000 on Binance before recovering and settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 2% to $110,768. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, markets recovered on Sunday as BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. The price faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday, ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $115,274. Source: TradingView Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $109,945.

Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday as BTC fell below $110,000 and settled at $108,198. The price plunged to $103,516 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $106,463, ultimately dropping 1.60%. BTC rose on Saturday, rising 0.70% to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,208.

Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is back in the red as its weekend bounce lost momentum on Monday. The altcoin rose 1.52% on Saturday and over 2% on Sunday to end the weekend at $3,985. ETH reached an intraday high of $4,085 on Monday, but lost momentum after reaching this level as volatility and bearish sentiment took center stage. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price fell below $4,000 and settled at $3,981, registering a marginal decline. Selling pressure has intensified during the ongoing session, with ETH down almost 3% at $3,867. Despite ETH’s price struggles, BitMine Immersion Technologies chairman Tom Lee remains bullish. Lee confirmed BitMine went on an ETH shopping spree after the crypto market saw one of the largest deleveraging events in history earlier this month. Lee stated that the price decline was an attractive risk/reward, making the current price attractive at which to buy the asset. Lee stated, “Open interest for ETH sits at the same levels as seen on June 30th of this year, when ETH was $2,500. Given the expected Supercycle for Ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward.” BitMine purchased $250 million in ETH on Monday. The company holds over 3.3 million ETH tokens worth over $13 billion. BitMine aims to increase its holdings to 5% of ETH’s total supply. Lee also believes ETH could hit $10,000 this year, despite the year ending in just over two months. Lee suggested that BTC and ETH could rise the same way the US dollar rose to dominance in 1971 after President Nixon made it fully synthetic and no longer backed by gold. “When that happened, the immediate beneficiary was demand and a market to own gold.” ETH plunged to an intraday low of $3,444 on Friday (October 10) after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese imports and export controls on key software.

SOL remains in a descending channel on the daily chart with lower highs and lows. If selling pressure persists, the price could drop below $180.

The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to regain momentum after the October 10 crash, which wiped out $500 billion in crypto market capitalization. Investor Outlook Cautiously Optimistic: Coinbase-Glassnode Survey A report by Coinbase Institutional and Glassnode has revealed that most investors believe Bitcoin’s bull market will continue for at least three to six months. David Duong, Coinbase Institutional’s Head of Research, stated in the report that he expects favorable macroeconomic, regulatory, and policy conditions to persist. He also believes digital asset treasury companies will amplify demand for crypto assets, including Bitcoin. However, Duong also highlighted several challenges, including the ongoing government shutdown. The shutdown has delayed key economic data and stalled the momentum behind several altcoin ETFs. Duong also questioned the long-term viability of the DAT business model. The survey also reveals that researchers are “cautiously optimistic” about Bitcoin’s prospects in Q4 2025. Jack Dorsey Reignites Bitcoin Debate Twitter creator Jack Dorsey has reignited the debate around Bitcoin after posting a brief message stating, “Bitcoin is not crypto.” The message prompted a massive response from the community. Many argued that Satoshi Nakamoto described Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency on the BitcoinTalk forum in 2010, and Dorsey highlighted the word “currency” to indicate its monetary roots. Dorsey has long been rumored to play a role in BTC’s creation. Dorsey has denied being Nakamoto several times, stating in a 2020 interview, “No, and if I were, would I tell you?” Dorsey stated in a separate post that “Bitcoin is money,” defending its status by highlighting progress with zero-fee BTC payments by his financial services company Block and its payments processing arm, Square. Dorsey has long advocated for Bitcoin to be a payment method and has encouraged social media apps to adopt it for payments. However, not everyone agreed with Dorsey. David Schwartz, chief technology officer at Ripple, stated, “I don’t really know what Jack was trying to communicate here. I think he’s somehow trying to say that bitcoin should be seen as a payment system rather than a speculative asset. But I don’t know.” Strategy Adds To Bitcoin Holdings The cryptocurrency market is back in the red as crypto assets struggle to regain momentum after the October 10 flash crash. Despite the market downturn, institutional confidence in Bitcoin (BTC) remains strong. Strategy, the largest corporate holder of BTC , bought the dip, expanding its crypto holdings. According to a post by Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor, the firm purchased 168 BTC for $18.8 million at an average cost of $112,051 per coin. Strategy now holds 640,418 BTC , valued at over $69.3 billion. “Strategy has acquired 168 BTC for ~$18.8 million at ~$112,051 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 26.0% YTD 2025.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) slumped to a low of $107,444 during the ongoing session as sentiment waned thanks to lingering macroeconomic risks related to the trade tensions between the US and China. BTC rebounded over the weekend and reclaimed $108,000, settling at $108,676. The price continued rising on Monday, reaching an intraday high of $111,748 before settling at $110,568. However, selling pressure returned during the ongoing session, with the flagship cryptocurrency down nearly 2% at $108,893. Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, believes Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market may continue to exhibit volatility in the near term. “We simply believe that macro concerns are driving day-to-day changes in the market. Volatility will continue as long as there are trade tensions between the U.S. and China.” Mei added that he believes the latest decline is driven by traders de-risking ahead of the upcoming meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The meeting is set to take place in South Korea at the end of October. “While it's possible that they may come to an agreement at the end of the month and cause markets to rally, it's unlikely that tensions will evaporate altogether.” Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs reported $40.5 million in net outflows, according to data from SoSoValue. The crypto market Fear & Greed Index is still in “Fear” territory, indicating investors remain wary of risk. “The biggest risk to crypto markets today is the fact that macro developments and trade discussions are unpredictable — markets can rise and fall at the whims of a single tweet. All investors can really do is diversify their assets and attempt to hedge against uncertainty.” The October 10 market crash also wiped out optimism around “Uptober”, with BTC down over 2% on the monthly timeframe. Forex analysts stated, “So far this year, Uptober hasn’t gone to plan for Bitcoin bulls. Instead of seasonal strength, the price action has remained subdued with an early rally fizzling midway through the month, delivering an ugly reversal that may not be over yet.” BTC and the broader crypto market crashed last Friday (October 10), after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls for software. The announcement was made in retaliation for China imposing restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. As a result, BTC plunged to $102,000 on Binance before recovering and settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 2% to $110,768. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, markets recovered on Sunday as BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. The price faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday, ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $115,274.

However, Atkins has promised to build a strong framework and turn the regulator into the “Securities and Innovation Commission.” US A Decade Behind In Crypto Regulation SEC Chair Paul Atkins believes the United States is years behind its rivals when it comes to regulating digital assets. However, Atkins has promised to make catching up with the SEC’s top priority. Atkins warned that regulatory uncertainty has eroded America’s competitiveness, with other regions racing ahead in terms of crypto regulations. The SEC Chair’s remarks indicate the growing acknowledgment within Washington that outdated and unclear regulatory frameworks have stifled innovation and pushed many crypto projects abroad. “The crypto aspect is our job one. We want a strong framework that attracts people who may have fled.” Atkins stated that a favorable regulatory environment will ensure that innovation can thrive in the US instead of moving offshore. “We’re building a structure that supports innovation while protecting investors, balancing growth with guardrails.” SEC Working Full-Time On Crypto Regulation Atkins stated that the SEC is working “full-time” on crypto regulation and coordinating with other policymakers to replace ad-hoc enforcement with a comprehensive rulebook that provides certainty to companies and guarantees consumer protection. At the center of Atkins’ plan is the SEC’s “Innovation Exemption”, a proposed regulatory sandbox for crypto products. Atkins revealed that the exemption will enable novel crypto ventures to enter the market without having to go through a full-blown securities registration process. The Innovation Exemption will allow startups and established companies to experiment under supervision, and allow the SEC to waive certain regulatory requirements for a limited time. According to Atkins, this would allow crypto projects to prove themselves in the market without facing undue delays. However, Atkins clarified that this flexibility will not come at the cost of investors, assuring that investor protections and safeguards would remain in place, and that the SEC will closely monitor exempted projects. “The goal is to balance investor protection with the need for innovation.” A Friendlier SEC The SEC Chair’s comments highlight the dramatic shift in the regulator’s approach to crypto under the Trump administration. Atkins has been a long-time advocate for crypto and market innovation, and succeeded Gary Gensler, whose term as SEC Chair was characterized by an aggressive “regulation-by-enforcement” approach towards crypto. However, Atkins plans to make the US a hub for crypto innovation and craft rules that encourage responsible innovation. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market is back in bearish territory after Monday’s bounce lost momentum. The cryptocurrency market cap is down almost 3% at $3.64 trillion. Husky Inu (HINU) Rises To $0.00021736 Husky Inu (HINU) completed the latest price jump of its per-launch phase over the weekend, rising from $0.00021673 to $0.00021736. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, and has seen regular price increases. It aims to empower the Husky Inu community and continue its fundraising efforts as the launch date approaches. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to increase the HINU token’s value every two days. This has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross key fundraising milestones. It has also helped Husky Inu raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community, rewarding early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth. Husky Inu has also crossed the $900,000 fundraising milestone and has raised $903,276 so far. The project remains on track to reach its fundraising goal of $1.2 million as its official launch date approaches. Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 earlier this month. Cryptocurrency Markets Back In The Red Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has lost momentum again after starting the week in positive territory, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens trading in the red. BTC traded above $111,000 on Monday but fell back in the red as momentum faded. The flagship cryptocurrency is down over 3%, trading around $107,616. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) lost the $4,000 mark, with the price down over 5% at $3,861. Ripple (XRP) is down nearly 2%, while Solana (SOL) failed to reclaim $200, and is down almost 5% at $183. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 4% and Cardano (ADA) is down over 4% at $0.641. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered a substantial decline. Official Launch Date Approaching Husky Inu has reported remarkable growth and interest during the presale and pre-launch phases. The project’s community has grown in strength and numbers, thanks to the dedication and enthusiasm of each member. The project’s official launch date, March 27, 2026, is just over six months away. Our goal has always been long-term growth and success, not short-term hype. However, the possibility of an earlier launch is open. The Husky Inu team will conduct a series of strategic meetings to assess market conditions and determine the optimal time to launch the project. The first two reviews were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025. The third review is scheduled for January 1, 2026.

This model, called the “limited-access master account,” or “skinny master account” for short, will give all legally compliant institutions, including fintech companies, stablecoin issuers, and payment institutions, direct access to the Fed’s payment infrastructure. The announcement was made at the Fed's Payments Innovation Conference, as reported by crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett. Waller emphasized that this account type won't include all the full-access “master account” services available to banks, such as borrowing authority from the Fed. However, he noted that any legally compliant institution can have this account, and existing legal compliance rules won't change. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Futures Decides to Delist Two Altcoins The new system is seen as a significant development for crypto-focused banks like Custodia Bank and Kraken, which have long struggled to obtain direct account access from the Fed. Custodia Bank even filed a lawsuit against the Fed during this process. It's also being reported that this move could expedite the process for companies like Ripple and Anchorage, which applied before 2025. According to experts, the “skinny master account” model demonstrates the Fed’s more open approach to financial innovation, while also potentially softening the boundaries between crypto finance and traditional finance. *This is not investment advice.

The announcement comes two months after a VanEck report highlighted the growth of Hyperliquid at the expense of Solana and other large blockchains. Solana Co-Founder Announces Plans For New DEX Anatoly Yakovenko has become the latest crypto founder to highlight plans for a decentralized exchange. Yakovenko uploaded plans outlining a sharded perpetual exchange protocol on the Solana blockchain, calling the new DEX ‘Percolator.’ A perpetual exchange is a decentralized protocol for perpetual futures contracts. These contracts allow traders to speculate on cryptocurrency prices without an expiration date. The plans for the new protocol come after the success of platforms like Hyperliquid and Astar. Yakovenko released the documentation for Percolator on GitHub, describing it as “implementation-ready.” Percolator will consist of two primary on-chain programs, a Router program and a Slab program. The Router program manages collateral, portfolio margins, and cross-slab routing. Meanwhile, the Slab program acts as a matching engine that is overseen by liquidity providers. Each Slab program operates independently, allowing what Yakovenko calls “fully self-contained matching and settlement.” “This design keeps each LP’s slab fully self-contained and innovable, while the Router guarantees atomic routing, portfolio netting, and capability-scoped safety.” Percolator’s GitHub repository already shows completed data structures for order books and memory pools. However, the development of the protocol’s liquidation systems is still in progress. Growing Competition The Solana Foundation has not stated whether Percolator will receive ecosystem support or will be a community-driven protocol. If the protocol is successful, it will add to the growing list of native financial primitives being developed on the Solana blockchain. The code for Percolator is currently under review on GitHub, with developers engaged with the repository stating that the project is “deep in testing.” This could mean that a launch is imminent once the protocol’s liquidation and governance protocols are finalized. Percolator joins an increasingly competitive derivatives-focused DEX space, with protocols like Hyperliquid expanding their footprint. Hyperliquid recently completed the implementation of permissionless, builder-deployed perpetual contracts through the HIP-3 upgrade. This allows users to stake a minimum of 500,000 HYPE tokens, worth $18 million, and launch their own perpetual markets with independent margin rules. Hyperliquid Attracting Solana Users Yakovenko published the code for the new protocol two months after VanEck stated in a report that Hyperliquid was attracting users from the Solana blockchain. Hyperliquid accounted for 35% of all blockchain revenue in July, with the growth coming at the expense of the Solana blockchain. Hyperliquid also ate into the revenue of Ethereum and BNB Chain. “Hyperliquid has poached high-value users from Solana and has retained them by offering users a simple, highly functional product.” Hyperliquid’s trading volume also jumped to a new monthly high of $319 million in July, indicating that more cryptocurrency traders are using decentralized exchanges instead of their centralized counterparts.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $23.39. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $38.01. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $3.15 Market Cap $1.70B Trading Volume $69.84M Circulating Supply 539.28M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $3.28 24-h Low $3.05 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 9.36% 14-Day RSI 38.97 50-Day SMA $4.61 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 38 (Fear) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $5.31 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP remains under bearish dominance but shows signs of oversold conditions near $3.18. Short-term consolidation suggests potential for a minor rebound if $3.10 holds. A break above $3.30 could confirm recovery. ICP 1-day price analysis As seen on the 1-day price chart for October 21, ICP continues its sluggish downward trajectory, trading around $3.18 after minor intraday losses. The coin is hovering just above the lower Bollinger Band ($2.45), indicating that bearish pressure persists but could be weakening. The upper band sits at $5.05, and the middle line at $3.75 acts as the next key resistance. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI at 34.8 signals oversold conditions, hinting at a potential reversal if buying momentum increases. The MACD histogram remains slightly negative, showing a narrowing gap between the signal and MACD lines, often a precursor to bullish crossover attempts. If ICP can hold above $3.00, a rebound toward $3.75 may unfold, though resistance will likely intensify around that region. A drop below $3.00 could push the token toward $2.45, its current lower support zone. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the shorter timeframe, ICP is consolidating tightly at $3.18 following a brief spike to $3.28. The Alligator indicator lines have begun to converge, indicating that volatility is decreasing and a directional breakout may occur soon. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD remains slightly bullish, reflecting mild upward momentum, while volume shows steady inflows around 13.27M, a sign of gradual accumulation. If the price can sustain above $3.15, ICP may attempt to retest the $3.30–$3.35 range. However, any breakdown below $3.10 could revive bearish sentiment, with $3.00 as the short-term safety net. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $3.71 SELL SMA 5 $3.50 SELL SMA 10 $3.52 SELL SMA 21 $3.99 SELL SMA 50 $4.37 SELL SMA 100 $4.87 SELL SMA 200 $5.24 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $3.89 SELL EMA 5 $4.16 SELL EMA 10 $4.49 SELL EMA 21 $4.81 SELL EMA 50 $5.08 SELL EMA 100 $5.26 SELL EMA 200 $5.83 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is attempting to stabilize after weeks of decline. If the current consolidation holds, expect a mild recovery toward $3.70 in the coming sessions. However, a failure to defend $3.00 could trigger another downward leg toward $2.45. Is Internet Computer a good investment?

The blockchain has been seeing robust activity lately, allowing it to gain notable traction in the financial sector. An example of its growing recognition in the financial landscape is the recent move by Exodus to tokenize its stock on the blockchain. Exodus Chooses Solana For Stock Tokenization As cryptocurrency gains traction, Solana is becoming an increasingly popular choice of blockchain among financial institutions . In a groundbreaking move that connects blockchain innovation with traditional finance, Exodus has declared its intention to use the Solana network to tokenize its common shares. The bold move was reported by MartyParty, a macro analyst and host of The Office Space, in a recent post on the X platform. Exodus’s integration with the SOL network represents a significant step toward on-chain equity ownership by allowing investors to exchange and manage shares with the speed, transparency, and efficiency of decentralized technology. According to the report, shareholders of the corporation have the option to hold their Exodus Class A shares on the blockchain using common stock tokens. Exodus is now the first publicly traded company to offer a common stock token, which currently exists on Solana and Algorand. This move to tokenize stock on the SOL blockchain will be enabled via the co-transfer agent Superstate issuance platform. Although they are not shares, these digital representations show a shareholder’s current ownership of shares in the books and records of the transfer agent. “Tokenization and, specifically, tokenized stocks on the blockchain are the future of the financial sector and capital markets. Therefore, bringing Exodus stock to large, significant blockchain communities is a priority for us,” JP Richardson, the CEO of Exodus, stated. Bridging To The SOL Blockchain Skyrockets Solana continues to demonstrate its dominance in the blockchain sector as large capital flows into the network. As revealed in a recent report from SolanaFloor , bridging activity to SOL is skyrocketing, reflecting the network’s growing appeal among investors and developers. Data shows that more than $135 million has been bridged from other major chains to Solana over the past 7 days. Interestingly, the largest portion of the capital inflows was observed coming from Ethereum and BNB Chain . The capital rotation to SOL is likely due to its lightning-fast throughput, low transaction costs, and a thriving DeFi ecosystem. Furthermore, it points to a larger shift in on-chain liquidity dynamics and highlights SOL’s growing position as a high-performance center in the multi-chain economy. With substantial capital flowing into SOL , the network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has now risen sharply to a 40-month high. A significant rise in TVL reflects a renewed wave of liquidity, which signals strong confidence among investors and growing on-chain activity.",Solana|Algorand|BNB Chain|Ethereum|Exodus|JP Richardson|MartyParty|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana Blockchain|Solana news|Solana price|SolanaFloor|solusd|SOLUSDT|Superstate Issuance Platform|The Office Space|Total Value Locked|TVL,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-21 21:00:25

Related Reading: Pattern That Led To Dogecoin Price 36,000% Surge In 2021 Has Emerged Again, Will History Repeat? Dogecoin’s chart setup indicates that the meme coin has completed the “Cup” phase, where prices gradually curved upwards after a long period of accumulation. Now, price action is in the “handle” stage, which, upon completion, usually precedes a breakout to higher levels. In Elite Crypto’s chart, the cup’s base extends from early 2022 through 2024, with Dogecoin consolidating steadily before beginning a rebound into 2025. The market analyst has indicated that if history repeats, the DOGE price could experience a strong rally toward the $0.50 mark, a potential gain of over 160% from its current levels around $0.19. The chart also illustrates a crucial accumulation zone highlighted in green, where the price has been coiling. According to Elite Crypto, this range represents an ideal accumulation area before a larger move unfolds. He emphasized that any price action below the $0.155 level should be considered a solid buying opportunity for spot investors. Reversal Structure Confirms New DOGE Buying Zone In a separate X analysis, crypto market expert Vexe also pointed out a key buying zone for the Dogecoin price. He highlighted that DOGE has cleared all downside liquidity and is not holding firmly above its weekly support range. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price: ‘$6.9 Is A Magnet’, Analyst Predicts The analyst’s chart shows that the Dogecoin price action recently rebounded from a key demand area after testing lower levels. The price has stabilized near $0.20, suggesting that sellers may be exhausted, and a potential reversal is taking shape. The green shaded area on the chart highlights the reversal zone, which Vexe calls an ideal buying zone. His chart also features a descending trendline connecting multiple swing highs from the previous cycle. Dogecoin has already tested the resistance line and shows early signs of breaking out. Above the resistance line, Vexe projects a price target of $0.49, representing a potential upside of roughly 327.67% from the lower support zone. Notably, this $0.49 target would also reflect a 157% increase from DOGE’s price of $0.19. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the meme coin is currently down by approximately 4% in just one day and 28% over the past month.",Dogecoin|CoinMarketCap|Descending Trendline|doge|DOGE news|Doge price|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Elite Crypto|Textbook Cup And Handle Pattern|Vexe,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-10-21 21:00:43

At first glance, this figure may suggest that typical holders maintain substantial positions. However, averages in heavily skewed datasets, such as cryptocurrency distributions, can be misleading without a broader context. The data underpinning this figure spans nearly 4.7 million XRP addresses, with a total of over 58 billion tokens accounted for. The average #XRP per wallet sits at 12,350.86 $XRP — and that’s not small bag! pic.twitter.com/Q9E9QymDkZ — Ripple Mother (@RippleMother) October 18, 2025 Concentration Among Large Holders The upper end of the distribution reveals the primary reason behind the elevated average. Only five accounts hold at least 1 billion XRP, representing over 7.4 billion XRP collectively. Just 22 accounts in the 500 million to 1 billion range control more than 12 billion XRP, and another 58 accounts with balances between 100 million and 500 million XRP hold over 12.25 billion XRP. These few wallets alone are responsible for a significant share of the total supply, disproportionately lifting the overall mean. Mid-range wallets remain sizable. But there are far fewer than those at the bottom of the distribution. For instance, 131 accounts holding 20 million to 100 million XRP collectively control over 5.19 billion XRP, while 168 accounts holding 5 million to 10 million XRP hold around 1.14 billion XRP. These levels remain substantial relative to the broader holder base. The Reality for Most Wallets In contrast, the vast majority of XRP addresses hold far smaller balances. Over 2.38 million addresses fall between 20 and 500 XRP, with a combined total of roughly 176.7 million XRP. More than 1.3 million accounts hold between 0 and 20 XRP, amounting to only 16.6 million XRP in all. When combined, over 3.7 million wallets sit below 500 XRP, reflecting holdings that are not close to the mean figure highlighted earlier. This extreme concentration at the top and dispersion at the bottom shows why relying solely on an average creates a distorted view of the typical XRP holder . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Median Perspective and Statistical Context In response to the discussion, some observers rightly pointed out that median values offer a clearer sense of what most holders possess. While the precise median cannot be calculated without individual wallet data, the midpoint of all accounts falls within the 20–500 XRP range, placing a more realistic central position near a few hundred XRP. An estimate places the median around 300 XRP, showing a stark contrast to the 12,350 XRP. The dataset reinforces a key analytical principle: large holders have an excessive impact on aggregate metrics. For those assessing distribution, adoption, or holder behavior, measures like the median or distribution bands provide a far more accurate reflection of the broader XRP community than averages alone.

The “post-liquidation stagnation” process that occurred in the market due to the effect of the approximately $20 billion selling wave became especially evident in altcoins. In this segment, where speculative investment is concentrated, the market-cap-weighted index tracking 50 small-cap altcoins is currently below even the level seen during the FTX crash of 2022. This group, which also includes memecoins like “PumpFun,” is typically held by individual investors and is seen as an early indicator of market risk appetite. The sharp decline suggests a renewed pullback in speculative capital. Bitcoin remains above the $100,000 level, but hasn't recovered from a few weeks ago. The largest cryptoasset has been experiencing volatility, fueled by forced liquidations triggered by exchanges like Binance following a sharp drop in collateral values. Related News: Solana (SOL) Makes Unexpected Early Announcement - May Upset Users Markets are generally considered to be entering a difficult period for both hedges and momentum assets. The sharp decline in gold and silver after breaking records reflects a general fatigue in the most heavily traded positions of 2025. Brett Munster, portfolio manager at Blockforce Capital, described the sell-off as reflecting “not the crypto’s fundamental value, but rather a shift by short-term investors in their positions against macroeconomic volatility.” However, according to Munster, the process also exposed the platforms’ structural vulnerabilities based on opaque risk engines. A similar cooling-off trend is also evident in the ETF market. BlackRock's $88 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust fund experienced a total outflow of $400 million in five trading days. Meanwhile, the Ethereum-based ETHA fund withdrew $260 million in two days. While these figures are modest compared to its asset size under management, they are a sign of declining interest from individual investors. Futures markets also remain weak. According to K33 Research data, funding rates for Bitcoin futures have been negative for the past week, suggesting investors are paying to maintain their short positions. While open interest remains low, volatility selling in options markets has increased, suggesting investors are anticipating sideways price action. Demand for $100,000 Bitcoin put options remains high, according to Coinbase's Deribit platform. This defensive positioning contrasts with the risk appetite in equities. Markets are now focused on Friday's US CPI data. A higher-than-expected inflation reading could put pressure on both digital and traditional hedge assets. According to Vetle Lunde, Research Director at K33 Research, “risk appetite has completely reversed since October 10th,” and this situation resembles “typical post-mass liquidation processes”: low volume, weak interest, and increased short positions. *This is not investment advice.

Crypto progress — in Washington and on Wall Street — continues. — Kristin Smith (@KMSmithDC) October 20, 2025 Although Smith acknowledges that the shutdown has “temporarily paused agency function” at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)—including IPO approvals and ETP reviews—the SPI head says the organization expects many of the pending applications will “move forward quickly.” “The next phase of crypto policy will define how—and where—innovation happens,” Smith added. “Washington will reopen. Momentum will return.” Crypto ETFs Delayed As SEC Wades Through Shutdown Crypto proponents have expressed concern over the U.S. government shutdown’s impact on the crypto sector , with several digital asset ETFs still awaiting approval amidst the political dysfunction. Shortly before the shutdown, the SEC asked candidates to rescind their 19-b filings in favor of generic listing standards that would effectively take over separate filings. Data this month from research and consultancy firm ETFGI shows that the U.S. ETF industry hit $12.70 trillion in assets by the end of September, with crypto-focused funds, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC US) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH US), bringing in $220 million alone. However, U.S. lawmakers are still unable to find a path forward when it comes to ending the federal shutdown after an 11th vote to fund the government failed again on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are slated to meet with top crypto executives in a roundtable on Wednesday in hopes of advancing crypto policy.

He said that the tariffs on Chinese imports will be “approximately 155%” as of November 1st. Trump said the move was aimed at protecting the US economy, arguing that high tariffs were “unsustainable” for the Chinese economy. The price of Bitcoin, which climbed to $114,000 during the day, dropped to $110,000 after these statements. Chart showing the decline in BTC price. He also stated that he would meet with Democratic leaders after the government reopens. In previous remarks, Trump, speaking at the White House during a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, announced plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month in South Korea or during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. “We're going to have a really fair and great trade deal with China,” he said. “It's going to be great for both of our countries and for the world.” In his subsequent statements, he added that a meeting with Xi might not take place.

Trump's comments come on the heels of a multibillion-dollar deal between Washington and Canberra on rare earths, aimed at reducing China's dominance of the minerals' global supply chain. Experts say Trump's statements indicate his intention to continue negotiations rather than escalate the trade war. “Both the US and China are willing to reach an agreement, but neither side is willing to make major concessions.

The company said it will combine public market access with an active treasury model to offer a unique bridge for institutional investors seeking regulated, scalable exposure to the crypto asset. Once the transaction closes, the combined company will operate under the Evernorth name and is expected to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “XRPN,” pending standard listing requirements. Evernorth’s XRP Treasury Vehicle According to the press release shared with CryptoPotato , the deal is projected to raise over $1 billion in gross proceeds. This includes $200 million from SBI and additional investments from Ripple Labs and Rippleworks, which is a charitable foundation supporting social impact ventures. Other prominent digital asset and fintech investors include Pantera Capital, Kraken, and GSR. Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen will also be participating. Net proceeds will mainly be used to purchase XRP in the open market to establish a large institutional treasury for the crypto asset. A portion of the funds will be allocated to working capital, corporate operations, and transaction-related expenses. Unlike a traditional passive ETF, Evernorth plans to increase XRP holdings per share over time by engaging in institutional lending, liquidity provisioning, and decentralized finance (DeFi) yield opportunities. In a statement, Evernorth CEO Asheesh Birla said. “Evernorth is built to provide investors more than just exposure to XRP’s price. As we capitalize on existing TradFi yield generation strategies and deploy into DeFi yield opportunities, we also contribute to the growth and maturity of that ecosystem. This approach is designed to generate returns for shareholders while supporting XRP’s utility and adoption. It’s a symbiotic model: our strategy is designed to align with the growth of the XRP ecosystem.” Bets on XRP Last week, London-based VivoPower International raised $19 million in fresh equity at $6.05 per share in a bid to expand its XRP treasury strategy. The funds will support debt reduction and boost the company’s long-term XRP holdings. Earlier, VivoPower partnered with Doppler Finance on a $30 million XRP deployment, which is part of a planned $200 million allocation. Additionally, the firm has been testing Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin for cross-border payments within its Tembo EV unit for faster settlement and lower costs.

A decade ago, crypto first appeared in housing deals, mostly as a novelty. People would buy homes in bitcoin, then quickly convert back to cash. But things have changed now, with companies like Propy now using crypto as collateral for both residential and commercial loans. That means buyers can borrow against their coins without selling them. Many prefer to keep their Bitcoin or Ether, which often appreciate faster than real estate itself. Commercial companies move toward full blockchain adoption Tony Giordano, founder of The Opulent Agency, said the commercial market is “right around the corner” from fully embracing the blockchain. “I don’t see how the entire real estate industry will not be on the blockchain within ten years,” Giordano said . “It’s already here, people are recording everything on it, and it’s the most secure platform and technology to do it.” He described the blockchain as a massive digital filing cabinet that can store billions of records permanently, from titles and deeds to mortgage bonds and transactions, without risk or loss. Deloitte’s analysis shows that blockchain-based smart contracts could overhaul property operations, including buying, selling, leasing, and financing, which execute automatically once conditions are met, cutting out piles of paperwork and delays. Deloitte also found that the same system could eventually connect with smart city services like energy billing, waste management, water use, and parking, integrating public utilities directly with real estate data. The rise of tokenization is one of the clearest signs that the commercial real estate world is taking blockchain seriously. Tokenization turns ownership rights of a property into digital tokens, allowing investors to buy fractional shares instead of entire buildings. This makes high-value properties accessible to smaller investors. But for now, U.S. investors can’t buy into U.S. tokenized real estate due to regulations, while international investors already can. Another Deloitte report published in April said tokenization could create “trillions of dollars of economic activity” for real estate within the next decade by widening access and boosting liquidity. The projection of $4 trillion by 2035 shows how quickly that market could expand once regulation catches up. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

On October 19, more than 54.47 million LINK were acquired, according to a cost basis heatmap shared by Ali Martinez. At press time, LINK was trading at $18, with a 24-hour decline of 5% and a weekly loss of 3%. Daily trading volume stands at $1.05 billion. $16 Identified as Heavy Accumulation Range The cost basis heatmap highlights a dense concentration of wallet activity at $16. This level now marks a key reference zone on the chart. The visual shows a strong horizontal cluster, which reflects a high number of tokens changing hands in that range. The accumulation suggests market participants see value at this level. A large volume of tokens held here may reduce selling pressure, especially if prices return to that zone. Ali Martinez described the area as a “ strong support zone ,” based on the size of the holdings. A separate chart from Ali shows a long-term triangle pattern with price squeezing between rising and falling trendlines. LINK is currently positioned around the middle of the formation. The analyst noted: “The next time Chainlink breaks $25, it could ignite a bull rally to $100.” Fibonacci projections on the chart show possible continuation levels at $32, $53, $74, and $99, if the price breaks out and holds above $25. Source: Ali Martinez/X Historical Price Action and Market Response Past market behavior shows how LINK responded to major downturns.

This data was shared by Michaël van de Poppe, who noted how sharp declines can become recovery zones. The COVID-19 crash was the lowest point in the previous cycle for many #Altcoins . $LINK went down 80% in a single night. It did make a 3,700% since then in 15 months. In hindsight, the largest crashes are the best financial opportunities. pic.twitter.com/eMb9AExWy9 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) October 20, 2025 After peaking in 2021, LINK trended lower and found a base between $5 and $8 by late 2022. Since then, the price has remained mostly stable, with recent moves pushing it back near $18. On-Chain Activity Supports Local Strength Recent on-chain data from Santiment adds another view . When average 30-day returns for LINK holders fall below -5%, price has often recovered shortly after. The firm noted this level was reached again on Friday, suggesting renewed accumulation. Earlier this month, wallets holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 LINK added 1.38 million tokens during a short pullback. The ongoing interest from larger holders adds weight to the current support zone.

The tiny rally comes after days of chop between $108K and $111K, with no direction and low conviction. On Tuesday, the world’s largest crypto asset bounced after a sluggish session, reclaiming some ground in what’s been a brutal two-week period for digital markets. Ether also inched higher, clearing $4,100 as buyers slowly returned. That violent October 10 dump, the largest single-day liquidation in crypto history, flushed out speculators across the board. Crypto hasn’t moved much since. Altcoins crash deeper as risk appetite vanishes A market cap-weighted index tracking the 50 smallest tokens, including meme names like Pump.fun, now trades at levels below 2022’s FTX-era lows. Thinly traded and largely held by retail, these digital assets act as early indicators of marginal risk appetite. These coins are mostly held by retail. They trade thin. And when they dump this hard, it shows no one’s willing to gamble anymore. Bitcoin has managed to hold above $100K, but that’s not saying much. It’s still far off its highs from a few weeks ago. The recent plunge wiped out leverage in perpetual futures, forcing liquidations across centralized platforms like Binance. Once the collateral dropped, the risk engines kicked in, and positions got torched. The entire structure cracked under the weight of its own leverage. Meanwhile, precious metals didn’t hold up either. Gold and silver, which had both been posting new all-time highs all year, dropped on Tuesday as well. And though the drivers may differ, the pain across asset classes hints at fatigue from the year’s most overcrowded trades. ETFs bleed, futures frozen, and options scream protection BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF , which holds $88 billion in assets as of press time, saw over $400 million in outflows over the past five sessions, breaking a 10-day inflow run. The Ethereum twin, ETHA, lost more than $260 million in two days. Meanwhile, perpetual futures, the most-used product for leveraged Bitcoin trading, have seen average funding rates stay negative for a full week, based on analysis by K33 Research. That means short sellers are paying to keep their bets alive. No one’s going long. Open interest is still low. And the options market is showing the same picture. Traders aren’t betting on big moves. Instead, they’re loading up on puts, especially at the $100K strike. Glassnode said :- “Long-term holder supply has declined by another 28K BTC since October 15th, meaning LTHs have spent more coins than what was aging into their cohort from short-term holders” And while crypto’s frozen, stocks are on fire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 218.16 points, closing at 46,924.74 on Tuesday. It briefly pushed past 47,000 during the day. The S&P 500 closed almost flat at 6,735.35, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.16% to end at 22,953.67. All eyes are now on Friday’s inflation report. A hotter-than-expected CPI print could trigger new selling across both crypto and traditional hedges. With leverage gone and retail skittish, any real move in Bitcoin might come from emotions, not conviction. “Broad bearish bias, risk appetite has done a complete 180 since Oct 10,” said Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33. “This harmonizes with typical post mass-liquidation reactions in BTC, i.e., anemic consolidations and low interest, then growing short interest.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News|BTC|ETH,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-21 21:41:59

A recent analysis by Barchart analyst Rob Isbitts highlights three significant signals suggesting that a deeper retreat in crypto prices may be on the horizon. Emerging Correlations Among Crypto Prices The report points to notable trends observed in April of last year, when a 50% increase followed the launch of several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs_. Specifically, BlackRock’s IBIT fund which boasts over $85 billion in assets under management, subsequently experienced a decline of approximately 25%. Related Reading: Bear Market Alert: Top Expert Claims Bitcoin Price Fate Hangs On $101,700 Support Level A similar pattern was evident in the early months of this year, where fluctuations were mirrored in the market as increased outflows in these investment vehicles began to rise. Currently, the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO)—a key indicator used by Isbitts—signals increasing chances of a decline in Bitcoin’s price as the weeks progress. Ethereum (ETH) appears to be following a comparable trajectory. Isbitts notes that while Bitcoin remains the leading cryptocurrency, the correlation among various coins is strengthening over time. This heightened correlation implies that Ethereum may also experience declines in tandem with Bitcoin. However, for cryptocurrencies that are further removed from the Bitcoin core, such as Solana (SOL), additional risks emerge. In these cases, not only does correlation impact prices, but a higher “beta” can lead to even steeper declines, reflecting increased volatility. For instance, when Bitcoin recently dropped about 15% from its peak, the futures -based Solana ETF (SOLZ), which has attracted over $220 million in assets in less than seven months, fell by double that percentage. Has Gold Regained Its Safe Haven Status Against Bitcoin? A common thread among the charts shared by Isbitts, is the recent formation of lower lows, indicating a pressing need for a rebound. If this does not occur soon, the expert highlights that the likelihood of further declines in crypto prices increases. The report also discusses a shift in the perception of gold, which has traditionally been viewed as an “anti-US dollar asset.” The expert asserts that as global central banks increase their gold reserves, the dynamics of the market may be changing. Related Reading: Solana Co-Founder Ventures Into Perpetual DEX Development: What You Should Know Recently, gold has exhibited price movements akin to those seen in cryptos, suggesting a potential resurgence in its role as a safe haven. This shift has impacted crypto stocks and ETFs, with certain funds showing signs of vulnerability as indicated by the PPO nearing a one-year high. A longer-term analysis of Bitcoin by Isbitts illustrates its inherent volatility, yet it has consistently managed to achieve higher highs over time. While this trend may continue, the current market conditions suggest that any future rallies are likely to start from lower price levels. As of this writing, however, Bitcoin, the market’s leading crypto, has regained the $112,900 mark, rising 3% in the last hour of Tuesday morning’s trading session.

According to a new CoinShares report, ETH, SOL, and XRP are seeing strong inflows as investors take advantage of price dips, even as BTC experiences one of the largest weekly outflows of the year. US Institutions Drive Largest Weekly Bitcoin Outflows The CoinShares report, published on October 20, shows that digital asset investment products faced a tough week following the liquidity shock on Friday , October 10. Net outflows from crypto Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) hit $513 million, marking one of the year’s largest weekly moves. This ultimately brought cumulative outflows since the liquidation event to $668 million, suggesting that ETP investors remained unfazed while on-chain investors turned more bearish. CoinShares reported that most of the selling pressure was heavily concentrated in the United States (US), which alone saw $621 million leave the market, as institutional investors offloaded Bitcoin positions in massive volumes. While the US experienced significant outflows, other countries like Germany recorded inflows of $54.2 million, Switzerland saw $48 million, and Canada added $42.4 million, as investors in those regions used the price drop to buy the dip. Bitcoin was hit the hardest during the liquidity cascade, recording $946 million in outflows, according to CoinShares data. The widespread sell-off came as confidence among US institutional investors weakened following the Binance liquidity incident and the US 100% tariff hike on Chinese imported goods . CoinShares also disclosed that Bitcoin’s Year-to-Date (YTD) inflows now stand at $29.3 billion, falling short of the $41.7 billion recorded in 2024. Despite the sell-off, trading activity across the market stayed strong. Weekly trading volumes for digital asset ETP hit $51 billion, nearly double this year’s weekly average. Investors Dump BTC For Ethereum, Solana, And XRP While institutions dumped Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP saw a wave of institutional buying . ETH led the inflows, pulling in $205 million as investors took the cryptocurrency’s weakness and price decline as a buying opportunity . A 2x leveraged Ethereum ETP also saw inflows totalling $457 million, marking the largest weekly inflow according to CoinShares. Solana and XRP followed closely, driven by growing anticipation over their potential ETP launches . CoinShares reported that SOL brought in $156 million, while XRP attracted $73.9 million in new inflows. These movements suggest that BTC is no longer dominating institutional portfolios and investors are growing increasingly bullish on the long-term potential of Ethereum, Solana, and XRP. According to the latest data from CoinMarketCap, the Bitcoin price has dropped over 3% and is currently at around $107,589. Ethereum has also declined by more than 4.8%, trading at $3,864, while Solana and XRP have fallen to $183 and $2.42, down by 4.78% and 1.23%, respectively.",Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinmarketcap|CoinShares|Ethereum|ETP|Exchange Traded Products|solana|XRP|Year-To-Date|YTD,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|SOL|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-21 22:00:36

SharpLink Gaming, one of the world’s largest corporate holders of Ether, reported a sharp increase in its treasury holdings this week, adding over 19,000 ETH amid a broader market downturn. According to the company’s latest disclosure, SharpLink’s total Ether holdings rose to 859,853 ETH as of October 19, 2025, valued at approximately $3.5 billion when combined with its cash reserves. As of press time, Ethereum was trading at $3,960, down 0.7% over the past 24 hours and 12% over the past month. Source: Cryptonews The token has been falling as a result of macroeconomics, and President Donald Trump’s tariff war with China has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 155% on Chinese goods starting on November 1. However, despite this, investors are using the opportunity to stack up their top token for when the market stabilizes, of which SharpLink is one lately, and BitMine recently too. Last week, BitMine Immersion Technologies purchased 379,271 ETH, worth about $1.5 billion , across several transactions following the crash, raising its total holdings to more than 3 million ETH, or roughly 2.5% of all Ether in circulation. BitMine @BitMNR added 104,336 ETH worth about $417M to its treasury through wallets linked to Kraken and BitGo, according to Lookonchain data. #BitMine #TomLee https://t.co/JSBCMREtGR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 16, 2025 Still, seasonal trends remain a concern, with CoinGlass data showing that the fourth quarter has historically been Ethereum’s second-weakest performing period on average. SharpLink Doubles Down on ETH After $76M Capital Boost SharpLink noted that it purchased 19,271 ETH during the week at an average cost of $3,892 per ETH, taking advantage of what it called “attractive market conditions” following a steep sell-off across the crypto market. Source: SharpLink The move comes just days after SharpLink completed a $76.5 million capital raise through a registered direct equity offering priced at $17 per share, representing a 12% premium to its closing price on October 15. The funds, raised from an institutional investor, were quickly deployed to expand the company’s Ethereum treasury. @SharpLinkGaming one of the world’s largest corporate holders of Ether, has raised $76.5M via an equity offering at $17/share. #Ethereum #Sharplink https://t.co/vijb8mtutY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 16, 2025 “Our top priority remains creating value for shareholders through disciplined execution and a relentless focus on accretive ETH accumulation,” said Joseph Chalom, SharpLink’s co-CEO. He added that the firm’s latest capital raise, conducted at a premium to net asset value, allowed SharpLink to buy ETH at lower market prices, making the purchase “immediately accretive to shareholders.” SharpLink’s updated balance sheet shows the company now holds 601,143 native ETH and an additional 258,710 ETH as if redeemed from LsETH, a liquid staking derivative. The firm has also accumulated 5,671 ETH in staking rewards since launching its treasury strategy in June 2025 . That includes 326 native staking rewards and 132 as-if redeemed LsETH rewards earned in the latest week alone. Source: SharpLink The company’s ETH concentration ratio, a proprietary transparency metric measuring ETH holdings per 1,000 diluted shares, has doubled since June to 4.0, reflecting a growing Ethereum-weighted balance sheet. SharpLink said it also maintains roughly $36.4 million in cash and equivalents. Additionally, market analysts suggest that this wave of corporate accumulation, led by firms like SharpLink and BitMine, could lay the groundwork for Ethereum’s next institutional growth phase. 95% of Corporate Ethereum Holdings Added This Quarter, Bitwise Data Shows Data from StrategicEthReserve.xyz shows 69 corporate entities now hold a combined 5.74 million ETH, worth around $23 billion, representing about 4.75% of Ethereum’s total supply. Source: Strategicethreserve.xyz SharpLink accounts for roughly 0.69% of the total, placing it among the top corporate holders alongside firms such as BitMine Immersion Technologies, Coinbase, and The Ether Machine. Industry momentum toward Ethereum treasuries has intensified in recent months. According to Bitwise data, 95% of all Ether held by public companies was purchased within the past quarter, with total holdings now exceeding 4.6 million ETH across corporate balance sheets. Source: Bitwise That buying spree coincided with SharpLink’s other major announcements this fall, including a plan to tokenize its SEC-registered common stock directly on the Ethereum blockchain. The initiative, launched in partnership with Superstate through its Opening Bell platform, seeks to demonstrate how regulated U.S. equities can be issued and held on-chain without losing their legal status. Chalom, who recently spoke at the Digital Assets Summit (DAS) 2025 in London alongside ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin, reinforced his belief that Ethereum remains central to the future of institutional finance . At #DAS2025 in London, @ethereum ’s Joseph Lubin and @SharpLinkGaming Joseph Chalom outlined what comes next for crypto after the recent crash. https://t.co/ODVncnhZ5Y — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 14, 2025 He described the current market as undergoing a “flight to quality,” where major institutions increasingly view Ethereum and Bitcoin as “high-quality growth assets that can stand the test of time.” “Institutions are here, they’re ready to go,” Chalom said during the panel. “But it’s going to be a flight to quality, not a flight to speculation.” Lubin echoed the sentiment, calling Ethereum’s next phase a key moment in a “multi-trillion-dollar adoption curve” driven by tokenization, staking yields, and on-chain infrastructure.
