Its upswing is being compared by market observers to that of Ethereum in 2017, which experienced a legendary period in terms of life-altering returns. As new capital comes into new blockchain projects, analysts say that MAGACOIN FINANCE is a reflection of initial Ethereum momentum, where community engagement has grown to spark one of the largest aspects of crypto growth. Should history repeat itself, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the next project to mark a new age of blockchain use and a new investment opportunity. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Hits $17 Million MAGACOIN FINANCE has already passed the mark of $17 million total presale funds, which is among the fastest-growing token sales of 2025. The milestone marks rising investor confidence in an anxious recovery in digital asset markets. Early adopters attribute the verified audits of the project and growing social presence as significant drivers of the explosion. Most retail investors and strategic participants have participated in the presale according to on-chain data because they want to gain early exposure before it is listed on the exchange. Analysts observe that the multi-stage presale of MAGACOIN FINANCE with tiered pricing and allocation is similar to the disciplined fundraise model of early blue-chip protocols such as Ethereum and Avalanche. The roadmap of the project has a comprehensive ecosystem that combines the interoperability of metaverses and decentralized finance (DeFi). This long-term plan will make MAGACOIN FINANCE a pillar in the new generation of financial products run by blockchain. With the rising belief that MAGACOIN FINANCE might dominate the next altseason, the $17 million mark suggests a resurgence in market optimism to buy into the investment. MAGACOIN FINANCE Compares to Ethereum’s Bull Cycle Investment critics are making comparisons between the presale performance of MAGACOIN FINANCE and the 2017 breakout of Ethereum. The initial world of Ethereum was founded on programmable money and decentralized programs that transformed the use of blockchain. More so, MAGACOIN FINANCE embraces a utility-based design and concept that is scalable and integrates into the real world, as well as user involvement. In 2017, the demand for Ethereum tokens was mostly speculative. Nowadays, projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are constructed using institutional-grade compliance, are audited, and have sustainable economics. This progress marks the development of presales since the ICO hype, and more investors are now looking at long-term fundamentals instead of short-term hype. Analysts indicate that MAGACOIN FINANCE is on the verge of an upsurge as it presents a combination of decentralization and transparent economics with verifiable integrity. With a presale that has already exceeded expectations, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the best cryptos to buy now as market liquidity shifts back to the emerging assets. Its initial popularity reflects the basis that helped Ethereum enter the mainstream. Ethereum Price Prediction: Elliott Wave Setup Targets $7,000–$8,000 Ethereum stays in the bullish predictions, as analysts signal an end to an Elliott Wave correction. Technical analysts said that ETH is in its fifth impulsive wave, which is usually the last and strongest rally wave, with end cost targets of between $7,000 and $8,000. Similarly, analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that the top altcoin is making a very important move towards the $4,100 mark. He said that breaking through this level would signal the end of the recent downtrend of Ethereum. ETHUSD Chart | Source: X Institutional involvement confirms this attitude. The amount of ETH held by BitMine Immersion Technologies exceeds 3 million, worth more than $12 billion, demonstrating that Ethereum is trusted by numerous people in the long-term prospects of the cryptocurrency. Tom Lee expects it to reach $10,000-$12,000 in late 2025, whereas Arthur Hayes believes it will go all the way up to $20,000 in a general rally. Provided that Fusaka upgrade by Ethereum is completed as scheduled in December, analysts think that market sentiment, especially throughput and scalability, will be further improved. This could establish an upward trend that will help propel the entire sector of altcoins, including new tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion With Ethereum preparing for a rally, the focus of investors has shifted to credible early-stage initiatives that can replicate that momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE $17 million presale, strong community development, and proven transparency make it one of the best altcoins to buy in this market cycle. When Ethereum’s fifth wave happens as expected, the effect of this wave throughout the altcoin space could make MAGACOIN FINANCE the most successful coin in 2025.

Despite last week’s market volatility and the subsequent devastating losses, long-term holders are relaxed and profitable. The same cannot be said for short-term traders who are eyeing Bitcoin’s rebound above $113K to breathe again. Bitcoin’s Profit Divide Widens According to Alphractal founder Joao Wedson, Bitcoin’s current market mood is split between two distinct tribes. The calm veterans and the nervous newcomers. Long-Term Holders (LTHs) remain unfazed, their unrealized profits still comfortably in the green. They have seen it all before, and for them, the real concern does not even begin unless BTC slips below $37,000. That threshold remains comfortably distant from current levels. Short-Term Holders (STHs), on the other hand, are nursing losses and praying for a revival above the $113,200 mark. Ironically, that same level could become a battleground as a breakout would return many STHs to profit, but it could also trigger waves of profit-taking, thereby muting further upside momentum. Structurally, Bitcoin’s NUPL metric validates the idea of this divide. This is because long-term conviction remains intact, while the LTH/STH SOPR Ratio paints a picture of changing behavior. LTHs appear to be easing off their selling pressure and are letting the market breathe, while STHs are still clawing for short-term gains. This setup is reminiscent of late 2021, when fresh all-time highs were forged. The latest market condition suggests that while the old guard is coasting on earlier wins, the restless crowd still has something to prove. “LTHs have already locked in a good share of their profits – in March 2024, December 2024, and more recently, near the last ATH. Now, they’re relaxed, probably enjoying some time on a yacht with their families. Meanwhile, STHs are anxiously watching the charts, hoping for Bitcoin to break above $113K so they can finally smile again.” Impact of Easing US-China Tensions Now that Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the key $109,000-$110,000 support zone, a level that had previously acted as a crucial pivot in recent market structure, crypto analyst Ted Pillows believes that the next major hurdle lies at $112,000, a breakout above which could open the path for renewed bullish momentum. Pillows believes that the current macro backdrop adds further tailwinds to BTC’s potential upside, especially as US–China trade tensions appear to be easing. The reduction in geopolitical strain could boost investor confidence across risk assets, including crypto, by softening the global risk-off sentiment that had previously dampened speculative appetite.

53429955,609817,1760999410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53429955.jpeg,Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Capitulate: Realized Loss Ratio Hits 6-Month Low,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-term-holders-capitulate-realized-loss/,"Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery after several days marked by selling pressure, volatility, and fear across the crypto market. Following the sharp flash crash on October 10, when BTC briefly plunged to around $103,000, the price has since rebounded and is now testing supply near the $111,000 level. This move has brought a temporary sense of relief to traders, but on-chain data suggests that the market is still under stress. According to CryptoQuant, Short-Term Holders (STHs) — investors who typically hold Bitcoin for less than 155 days — are now selling below their cost basis, a clear sign of capitulation. Historically, such capitulation events have often marked late stages of a correction, as weak hands exit the market while stronger players accumulate. While this could signal that Bitcoin is nearing a local bottom, uncertainty remains high. The coming days will determine whether this rebound has the strength to sustain — or if the market will face renewed downside pressure as global risk sentiment remains fragile. Short-Term Holders Signal Capitulation According to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, the Short-Term Holder (STH) Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has dropped to 0.98, marking its lowest level since April 2025. This reading supports the trend that STHs are now selling at a loss, a sign of capitulation within the most reactive segment of the market. Historically, such declines in STH SOPR have aligned with late-stage corrections or market bottoms, as weaker hands are flushed out and coins transfer to stronger holders. During similar phases in 2023, 2024, and early 2025, this metric has acted as a contrarian signal, often preceding major rebounds. However, Maartunn cautions that while capitulation is unfolding, confirmation of a recovery still depends on whether Bitcoin can hold above its realized price levels and key moving averages. The market now finds itself at a critical juncture. Bitcoin has rebounded from the $103,000 flash crash low to hover around $111,000, but momentum remains fragile. A sustained close above the $111,500–$113,000 zone could reinforce short-term bullish structure, while failure to hold current support may open the door to deeper corrections toward $100,000 or below. If the SOPR stabilizes and begins to rise again, it could confirm a shift from capitulation to re-accumulation — the early stage of a new upward trend. But if selling pressure persists and sentiment weakens further, the market risks entering a prolonged consolidation phase before the next bullish leg begins. For now, Bitcoin remains on edge, caught between recovery hopes and macro-driven uncertainty. Bitcoin Attempts Short-Term Recovery, But Resistance Looms Ahead Bitcoin is showing early signs of a short-term rebound, recovering from the October 10 crash that sent prices below $104,000. On the 4-hour chart, BTC is currently trading near $111,200, attempting to reclaim short-term moving averages (50 and 100 SMA) after several days of bearish momentum. This bounce reflects a shift in intraday sentiment, but the market remains cautious. The next key resistance lies around $113,000–$114,000, where the 200 SMA aligns with previous support turned resistance. A breakout above this zone could open the door to a test of $117,500, a major liquidity area that capped rallies earlier this month. However, if Bitcoin fails to clear this level, it risks falling back toward $107,000–$106,000, where strong demand previously emerged. Momentum indicators are improving but not yet convincing. Volume remains subdued, and funding rates continue to hover in negative territory — suggesting traders still lean bearish. This setup often precedes larger short squeezes, but confirmation is still lacking. Bitcoin’s short-term structure favors cautious optimism. Holding above $110,000 would support the recovery narrative, while rejection at higher levels could quickly trigger another retest of the recent lows. The next few sessions will be decisive for confirming trend direction.

Legendary Analyst Says It’s Time To Pay Attention,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-and-solana-price/,"A rare signal from a legendary market analyst has caught traders’ attention as the Ethereum and Solana price begins to show potential reversal signs. With the broader crypto market still in a slump, a subtle alert from the inventor of one of the most respected technical indicators has analysts wondering whether a major shift is about to unfold in ETH and SOL. Bollinger Inventor Signals Ethereum And Solana Price Explosion John Bollinger, technical analyst and inventor of the world-famous Bollinger Bands indicator, has shocked the broader crypto community after identifying potential “W” bottoms forming on the Ethereum and Solana charts. In his market commentary on X social media, Bollinger noted that while Bitcoin has yet to exhibit similar signals, the ETHUSD and SOLUSD pairs are shaping up in a way that demands attention. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Surge To $6,400 With New Bullish Wave, But There’s A Problem Notably, Bollinger’s cautious but bullish statement immediately drew attention from fellow market analysts. Satoshi Flipper, a well-known crypto expert, revealed that Bollinger typically makes only one such market call each year and has not issued one for Ethereum in three years. He disclosed that the last time the Bollinger Bands inventor made a similar statement was in September 2022, just before the ETH price surged from around $1,290 to nearly $4,000. Due to Bollinger’s selective and historically accurate calls, analysts see it as an early sign of a potential reversal of a downtrend or consolidation into an explosive breakout. If the inventors’ analysis proves accurate once again, both Ethereum and Solana could be sitting at the foundation of one of their strongest bull rallies Analysts Predict Bullish Targets For ETH And SOL Two separate technical analyses also highlight an optimistic outlook for the Ethereum and Solana prices. Crypto analyst Lark Davis highlighted that Solana’s chart structure appears “very constructive,” with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) approaching a momentum breakout and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) gearing up for a bullish cross. Related Reading: Solana Price At Risk Of 50% Crash To $104 After Forming This Larger Bearish Trend Davis noted that Solana’s price action is forming a clear Double Bottom, a classic reversal pattern. Should the neckline break, he projects a potential price target near $250, provided bulls can defend the 200-day EMA. With Solana trading around $192, a rally to that target would mark roughly a 30% gain. Ethereum’s technical outlook is even more dramatic. Analyst Merlijn the Trader stated on X that ETH has been developing the most explosive setup since the 2017 bull cycle, pointing to a textbook Bullish Pennant pattern on the monthly chart. Historically, such formations precede massive continuation once the price breaks above the upper boundary of the pattern. Merlijn’s chart analysis projects an eventual breakout target around $8,500, suggesting that Ethereum could set a new all-time high soon. Considering that the ETH price is sitting above $4,000, a surge to this bullish target would more than double its value, marking an impressive 110% increase.

Recent dips have been received with high-level purchases, especially in the blue-chip assets like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Chainlink. Presale projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are on a strong trend as investors seek high-potential projects. As Ethereum consolidates close to the $4,100 mark, analysts believe that the next bullish run is about to start, which may take pre-established and new altcoins to unprecedented heights, led by MAGACOIN FINANCE. Institutional Interest Builds Amid XRP ETF Anticipation After speculation once again scraped the surface last month about institutional entry into XRP through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the asset has been one of the most followed this month. Additionally, after breaking down to $2.19 earlier in the session, XRP bounced back up to $2.37, a sign of strong buying interest on the part of traders who are anticipating a near-term reversal. Analysts point out that this recovery amid uncertainty in the markets marks the fact of deep liquidity and long-term belief in the cross-border usefulness of XRP. Whale wallets have recorded consistent accumulation since early October, which means that there is a possibility of a potential breakout above the resistance level of $2.50. The market data points to the fact that after XRP breaks out above this level, the next leg of the rally could carry on towards the $2.80 – $3.00 level. Similarly, the continued relationships of Ripple with financial institutions in Africa and Asia are reinforcing the use case of the Ripple project as a global bridge. Provided that the ETF approval is realized in the upcoming quarters, XRP might witness an increase in institutional demand. Such a move would not only establish its regulatory position but also make XRP one of the best-performing assets going into 2026. Smart Money Returns to the Solana Blockchain Solana continues to see inflows, as major investors get exposed to the high-performing blockchain. Institutional participants have been drawn to the network due to its speed of transaction, scalability, and growing DeFi ecosystem. After a short correction to $170, Solana bounced back to trade near the $190-$200 level, indicating buyers are defending key liquidity zones. After asset managers like VanEck and 21Shares applied for Solana ETFs, the market has once again become bullish. The activity of developers is also increasing steadily, as indicated by network data, especially in NFT marketplaces and GameFi projects. When Solana breaks above the $200 level, technical models will suggest an upside target of $260 – $280. SOLUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: X Solana will also play a crucial role in the next market cycle as capital rotation becomes even more intense. It is a reference point to scalable blockchain ecosystems, and analysts observe that investors are diversifying into the presales, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, which replicates early Solana momentum. Accumulation Rises as LINK On-Chain Data Demand Surges Chainlink’s price action has strengthened amid a resurgence in oracle network demand. The project’s integrations across DeFi, gaming, and real-world asset (RWA) protocols continue to expand, positioning LINK as a foundational piece of blockchain infrastructure. Recently, 30 new wallets withdrew over 6.2 million LINK, valued at $116.7 million, from Binance—signaling large-scale accumulation by high-net-worth entities. LINK’s short-term outlook shows bullish momentum as the asset reclaims critical resistance near $17.50. Analysts expect a sustained move above this zone could trigger an advance toward $19.80 and $22.00. With more institutional players using Chainlink’s data feeds for tokenization and settlement systems, its long-term fundamentals remain robust. The growing integration of Chainlink in real-world applications strengthens confidence that the oracle sector could drive the next phase of blockchain adoption. Among traders diversifying portfolios, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a favored new entrant due to its transparent audits and early market traction. Avalanche Strengthening Fundamentals Support Momentum Avalanche (AVAX) is regaining market attention following renewed ecosystem growth and a surge in developer participation. The token has recovered from recent lows near $29, with strong buying pressure driving it back above $34. Analysts observe that Avalanche’s subnets are attracting enterprise-level interest, with partnerships expanding across Web3 gaming and decentralized identity sectors. Technical indicators reveal bullish divergence on the daily chart, suggesting potential continuation toward $40–$45 if momentum persists. AVAX’s scalability and interoperability continue to be defining features, making it a preferred choice for institutions seeking efficient blockchain solutions. As liquidity flows return to the altcoin market, Avalanche’s recovery aligns with the broader sentiment shift. However, analysts emphasize that new presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer high upside potential during early-stage accumulation phases. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Star of the 2025 Presale Market MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the fastest-growing presales of 2025, having raised over $17 million within weeks. The project’s structure includes verified audits from Hashex and Certik, a multi-stage presale with transparent pricing, and a roadmap that integrates DeFi and metaverse interoperability. These fundamentals have drawn both retail and institutional participants looking for credibility and long-term growth. Analysts are comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trajectory to Ethereum’s 2017 cycle, citing the combination of strong fundamentals and an expanding global community. The project’s focus on security, transparency, and real-world integration makes it stand out in a market saturated with speculative offerings. With sustained investor interest and growing social traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is viewed as one of the best altcoins to buy before the next major rally . Conclusion As Ethereum whales keep accumulating and market sentiment is turning positive, investors are gearing up for the next altseason. The existing assets, such as XRP, Solana, Chainlink, and Avalanche, are among the strongest competitors, however, the eruptive emergence of MAGACOIN FINANCE is the beginning of the era of credible presales. If current upward trends continue, MAGACOIN FINANCE could define the next successful 2025 breakout.

DOGE is currently worth over $29 billion in market cap, while BTC sits atop the pyramid with over $2.2 trillion. Both DOGE and BTC are fundamentally set up differently, but they also happen to share some history. The first takeaway that comes to mind on Dogecoin vs Bitcoin is that one is a memecoin while the other is a better store of value. But do you also know that Dogecoin is a derivative of Litecoin, which itself was created from Bitcoin’s codebase? Starting with a quick overview of Bitcoin and Dogecoin, in this article, you’ll see how both coins differ in speed, fees, supply, etc., and why DOGE may never flip BTC. Overview of Bitcoin vs Dogecoin Satoshi Nakamoto started it all when he/they created Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. Then came Litecoin, XRP, Dogecoin, and other cryptos years later. Bitcoin Satoshi introduced Bitcoin’s white paper in 2008, and it officially launched in 2009. The original idea in the white paper was for Bitcoin to serve as a decentralized digital currency for peer-to-peer online payments that works without relying on banks or governments. That narrative has somewhat shifted, with many now considering BTC as a store of value. Some even call it “digital gold” due to its fixed, finite supply. However, Bitcoin’s protocol remains true to its original trustless roots, no matter how investors choose to use it. Dogecoin Dogecoin was created from Litecoin’s codebase, and so they closely share some similarities. DOGE was launched by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in 2013 as a parody. But it turned out to become the first and largest “memecoin,” with a whole community of investors. The coin’s logo was inspired by Kabosu, a Shiba Inu dog from Japan, which died in May 2024. Since DOGE was only made as a joke, the founders stepped away from the project a few years after its inception, selling their coins and leaving its maintenance to the community and other developers. DOGE later went on to gain traction following the 2017-2018 bull run and Elon Musk’s influence. Shared History Dogecoin’s history can be traced back to Bitcoin. Its network structure is not original. For instance, DOGE shares the same decentralized model and Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism as BTC. That’s because of Litecoin. Charlie Lee forked Bitcoin’s codebase in October 2011, creating Litecoin to address perceived flaws. As a result, LTC inherited BTC’s PoW, although it uses a different algorithm than BTC. Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer then forked Litecoin’s codebase two years later to birth Dogecoin, creating a lineage with Litecoin and Bitcoin. Consensus Mechanism and Mining Dogecoin and Bitcoin both use the same Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, which requires mining. But their hashing algorithms are quite different. Bitcoin – Proof-of-Work Bitcoin uses the Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit or SHA-256 algorithm, which is more computationally demanding. SHA-256 requires specialized hardware to solve hash problems, which is why most miners today use advanced machines, especially ASIC miners, to mine new Bitcoin. The upside is that SHA-256 is much difficult to reverse-engineer or manipulate. But it’s very expensive to practice, which raises the entry barrier for small miners. Dogecoin – Proof-of-Work Dogecoin uses the Scrypt algorithm, which it inherited from Litecoin. Scrypt is a more lightweight algorithm that originally accommodated GPU/CPU users, but some Scrypt ASIC exists today. It is memory-hard, meaning it requires a large amount of fast RAM to compute hashes, allowing for faster processing and lower energy use. Dogecoin’s use of Scrypt made it possible for miners to mine DOGE and LTC coins at the same time, i.e., merge-mine. Energy Consumption and Mining Efficiency DOGE and BTC consume a considerable amount of energy, owing to their PoW mechanism. But the total energy used by Dogecoin is much lesser compared to Bitcoin. Reports put it that Dogecoin uses 1.4TWh to 4TWh of energy per year amid the merge-mining with Litecoin. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining consumes anywhere from 114 TWh to 220 TWh per year, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) estimate . Historical annualized electricity consumption of Bitcoin. Source: CBECI Block Time and Transaction Speed DOGE transactions are 10x faster than BTC transactions due to the block time. Bitcoin – 10-Minute Block Time Satoshi programmed the Bitcoin network to maintain an average block time of 10 minutes. The reason was to give new blocks enough time to propagate across the globe and also reduce the chance of orphan blocks, and stop spam/attacks. The 10-minute rule is enforced by the network’s “difficulty adjustment,” which happens every 2 weeks. It can take about 10 to 60 minutes for BTC payments to get confirmed, depending on the network’s traffic. Dogecoin – 1-Minute Block Time Dogecoin has a 1-minute block time, and because of that, DOGE transactions are usually faster. The shorter block time was deliberately chosen for near-instant micropayments, which suits the memecoin’s ethos for casual tipping. However, the quicker block time gives more chances for orphan blocks and front-running/spam transactions. Transaction Throughput and Confirmation Times Dogecoin accommodates more transactions than the Bitcoin network because of its shorter block time. It can process approximately 30 to 40 transactions per second. However, Bitcoin can only handle 3 to 7 transactions per second, which is one scalability issue that led to the launch of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which can handle 1 million transactions per second. Supply and Inflation Model Dogecoin and Bitcoin differ in their supply. DOGE has an inflationary model, while BTC is fixed. Bitcoin – Fixed Supply of 21 Million Coins BTC’s supply is fixed at 21 million, meaning only that much coin will ever be minted. The supply is hardcoded into the network and cannot be changed without forking the network, just like Litecoin, which changed its hard cap to 84 million. At the time of writing, there were a total of 19.93 million BTC in circulation. The issuance of new BTC is controlled by the process of mining and halving. New coins are minted to miners as a block reward, currently 3.125 BTC/block. The reward is halved every four years to control the issuance rate. The last halving event happened in April 2024, which reduced the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. It is projected that all 21 million BTC would have been mined around the year 2140. Dogecoin – No Supply Cap DOGE has an inflationary supply, meaning there will always be a continuous supply of new DOGE coins. There is simply no hard cap. Each year, a fixed number of 5 billion DOGE is issued and added to the circulating supply. At the time of writing, there were over 151 billion DOGE in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap data. Economic Implications: Scarcity vs Continuous Issuance Bitcoin’s fixed supply creates a sense of scarcity, which is why it’s generally considered a store of value and digital gold in today’s market. It’s also safe to say that the economics of scarcity, coupled with demand, are why many are predicting higher prices for Bitcoin in the years to come. But this is bad in a way, because it encourages people to hodl BTC rather than use it as a digital form of payment, just as Satoshi had intended. Dogecoin’s inflationary supply, on the other hand, dampens its scarcity, which dilutes the expectation of value growth or store of value from hodling. The model encourages quick spending, and so, the price of DOGE mostly rides on its utility, network adoption, and community engagement. Transaction Fees and Accessibility As you would have guessed, Dogecoin also beats Bitcoin in terms of transaction fees. It’s much cheaper to use DOGE than BTC. Bitcoin Fees – Network Congestion and Cost Volatility Data shows Bitcoin currently has an average transaction fee of 0.0000062 BTC ($0.679). Average Bitcoin transaction fee chart The fees are usually not fixed. But they can be influenced by the transaction size, or most likely, network congestion. The network can become unusable for small transactions when busy. In April 2024, the Bitcoin transaction fee spiked to as high as $128 due to congestion of the network. In 2023, the largest exchange, Binance, had to pause BTC withdrawals due to network congestion and exorbitant fees. Dogecoin Fees – Lower Fees for Microtransactions The average Dogecoin transaction fee is 0.402 DOGE ($0.079), according to BitInfoCharts. That’s almost 10x cheaper than Bitcoin. Due to the lower fees, Dogecoin is preferred for smaller payments and microtransactions. In a practical scenario, many would most likely spend DOGE as payment for $5 cup of coffee or tipping, rather than spending BTC, because it is cheaper. Ideal Use Cases The use cases for both Bitcoin and Dogecoin write themselves. People mostly use DOGE for tipping content creators, buying small digital goods, and everyday, small-scale transactions, simply because the transactions incur fewer fees, irrespective of the amount. Also, you don’t have to wait too long for an instant digital payment. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is scarce. Most people treat it as an investment, a store of value, and a hedge against inflation. It appeals to both institutional and retail investors around the world. Security and Network Strength Since Bitcoin and Dogecoin both use the PoW consensus mechanism, the strength of their networks is tied to their hash rates. Bitcoin’s Massive Hash Rate and Global Miner Network Bitcoin has a massive number of hash rates distributed around the world. Currently, the network sees an average hashrate of 1.13 Zhash per day, slightly below the 1.2667Zhash all-time high. Bitcoin hashrate historical chart The hash rate is just a measure of the combined computational power miners are contributing to the network. So, more hash rate means more strength and resilience in Bitcoin against attacks, particularly the 51% attack, where a single entity controls over half the network’s hashing power to manipulate the ledger. Another important thing to note is that the hashrate is not concentrated in one region. It’s spread around the world, which keeps the network decentralized. Dogecoin’s Reliance on Litecoin Merge Mining for Security Dogecoin currently has a hash rate of 3.41 PH/s, according to CoinWarz. Dogecoin hashrate historical chart On a normal ground, Dogecoin’s inflationary supply is not a great financial incentive for independent miners to continue securing the network in the long run. But it makes up for this with Litecoin. Since Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, it somewhat piggybacks off the Litecoin network’s substantial hash rate. That tie ensures that as long as Litecoin is secured, Dogecoin receives strong security too, against a 51% attack, than it would on its own. Long-Term Security Considerations For Bitcoin, the block reward is the key thing to watch. As the network is programmed to halve rewards every four years, it would get to a point where miners earn fewer BTC, which could affect profitability. Many could be forced to turn off their machine when the cost of mining exceeds the reward, which translates to lower hash rates and security for Bitcoin. For Dogecoin, the Litecoin network hash rate is the health factor to watch. Provided that the hash rate continues to increase, Dogecoin remains secure. Community and Use Cases The Bitcoin and Dogecoin communities contrast sharply, and they invest for different reasons. Bitcoin’s Role as Digital Gold As mentioned before, Bitcoin is perceived as the digital gold. So, the community around Bitcoin is all about investing for the long term as a store of value or hedge against inflation and devaluing local currencies. They believe that the engineered scarcity of Bitcoin will eventually lead to higher price appreciation. On-chain data shows that roughly 61% of the Bitcoin supply has not been moved for over a year. Up to 17% have not moved over the last 10 years. Dogecoin’s Community-Driven Adoption The Dogecoin community is all about memecoin. DOGE has inspired several other meme tokens that now form a $56 billion market. Other than its uses for micropayment, tipping, and regular day-to-day payment, DOGE continues to thrive on virality and largely the community’s effort. The power of the so-called “Doge Army,” social media hype, and cultural relevance have been the big drivers of DOGE price over the years. Not just DOGE. Most memecoins are driven by community efforts. Institutional Acceptance and Market Positioning Due to the economic models, Bitcoin appeals more to large corporations and institutional investors than Dogecoin, which is evident in the number of firms that hold BTC in their treasury today. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is the largest publicly traded Bitcoin firm in the world, with a total of 640,250 BTC, worth $71 billion. The company began investing in Bitcoin in 2020 primarily as a hedge against inflation. More than 145 publicly traded companies now hold BTC for similar reasons. In the same vein, Bitcoin also sees increased demand with ETFs. Institutional interest in Dogecoin is limited and mostly speculative. However, in September 2025, DOGE gained its first U.S. spot ETF , which opens the door for institutional investors to trade DOGE. Price Volatility and Market Perception Bitcoin is increasingly being perceived as a maturing asset, with the swings now influenced by macro factors. But as a memecoin, Dogecoin largely trades as a speculative bet. Bitcoin as a Macro Asset Some years back, Bitcoin was treated as an extremely volatile and speculative asset, which saw many regulators issue warnings against it. In recent times, however, Bitcoin’s price has been reflecting a maturing asset status, with institutional investors on board. The price is now largely influenced by global economics, behaving like a risk-on hedge, like tech stocks or gold during uncertainty. Dogecoin as a Speculative or Social Token The market perception of Dogecoin is mostly as a speculative social token or memecoin rather than a macro asset. In that category, it would be the go-to for many investors considering its dominance. However, Dogecoin’s price remains highly volatile. It’s often driven by market sentiment, social media trends, and community enthusiasm, rather than technical developments or macroeconomic factors. Influence of Public Figures The former CEO of Strategy, Michael Saylor, has been a big influencer, so to speak, for Bitcoin. Ever since he led the company into investing in Bitcoin, Saylor has been vocal about Bitcoin as a superior asset against inflation. He participated in several crypto conferences and continues to tweet about the largest crypto almost every day. For Dogecoin, it was Elon Musk who played a similar role. The price of DOGE soared on several occasions after the world’s richest man tweeted or praised the memecoin. DOGE also went on a massive rally after Musk acquired Twitter, in the hope that the social media app would incorporate DOGE as a tipping and payment coin. Technical Comparison Summary Table The table below summarizes the fundamental differences between Dogecoin and Bitcoin. Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Dogecoin (DOGE) Launch Year 2009 2013 Consensus Proof-of-Work (SHA-256) Proof-of-Work (Scrypt) Block Time 10 minutes 1 minute Supply Limit 21 million Infinite (5B/year inflation) Fees Higher Lower Mining Independent Merge-mined with Litecoin Use Case Store of value Peer-to-peer payments The Future of Bitcoin and Dogecoin As the crypto market continues to gain broader acceptance from institutions, with many firms declaring their digital asset treasuries, Bitcoin will become a more pronounced player in global finance, and we could see Dogecoin explore more utility-driven developments. Bitcoin’s Role in Institutional Finance The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs drew massive institutional flow to Bitcoin. The U.S. President is now pushing to allow 401(k)s to invest in Bitcoin. Major banks like JPMorgan are looking to allow clients to trade Bitcoin by next year. All these indicate that institutions are opening up to Bitcoin, and in the years ahead, the largest crypto will become more and more involved in Wall Street and global markets. Dogecoin’s Evolution Through Community and Developers Dogecoin could begin to see institutional inflows from the many ETFs in the pipeline and companies announcing their digital asset treasuries. We could also see the Dogecoin community and developers explore more utility projects, just like they did with the launch of Dogechain, a layer 2 network aimed at bringing smart contracts into the Dogecoin ecosystem. Potential Integration into Payments (e.g., X/Twitter) There is also a big possibility that Elon Musk will eventually add support for DOGE as a payment option on X (formerly Twitter). There have been rumors about this. Musk occasionally replied to comments referencing Dogecoin in a payment context on X, but there have not been any official statements to confirm that it will happen.",Learn Crypto: Beginner Guides,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|DOGE|LTC|MINING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-20 23:15:29

However, after several considerations, several of them have lowered their earlier predictions following new trade deals, which are lessening their exposure to these tariffs. Trump ignited a trade war which resulted in a significant increase in US tariffs to their highest rates ever recorded since the 1930s. Additionally, he has frequently threatened to impose even more taxes on US trading partners. Still, this uncertainty that previously held back many businesses is beginning to fade. This has enabled executives to better estimate expenses and establish effective business strategies such as some price hikes. Trump’s trade deals sparks hope for the stabilization of global firms Earlier, an analysis from a reliable source that analyzed various statements from companies, regulatory filings, and earnings calls from July 16 to September 30 revealed that firms had anticipated a total financial impact ranging from $21 billion to $22.9 billion for 2025. For 2026, they had estimated a total financial effect of around $15 billion. When global companies reported the overall amount exceeding $35 billion, reports highlighted that this figure was slightly above the $34 billion recorded in May after Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs in April which interfered with the international supply chain. However, it is worth noting that this increment primarily reflects Toyota’s estimate of $9.5 billion. Many other companies, on the other hand, have drastically reduced their previous pessimistic forecasts after Trump struck lower-rate trade deals with Japan and the EU. These prediction figures consist of both annual and partial-year estimates from a group of about 60 companies that had shared some of their data. Examples of companies that reduced their predictions include: French spirit producers Remy Cointreau and Pernod Ricard. Both arrived at the decision to lower their expectations for the effects of US tariffs after the EU agreement. Meanwhile, Sony reduced its forecast in August. Apart from striking trade deals with US trading partners, Trump also made some exceptions like only around a third of Brazil’s exports would encounter a 50% tariff. With this positive outlook, the Chief Executive Officer of Stellantis, Antonio Filosa acknowledged that tariffs are becoming clearer. He further highlighted that they believe these tariffs will just be another factor they need to run their business, asserting that they will be prepared for that during a mid-October interview. Afterwards, Filosa shared new details regarding a $13 billion investment over four years in US manufacturing. Interestingly, Stellantis had cautioned about a loss of 1.5 billion euros in July this year. Andrew Wilson raises concerns surrounding Trump’s tariff policies Andrew Wilson, Deputy Secretary General of the International Chamber of Commerce expressed his belief that there is a feeling that they have attained some sort of stable point with the existence of certain trade deals. However, Wilson raised concerns that there will still be a lot more complexity and substantial uncertainties. He gave an example of Trump’s recent shift in stance when he suggested the imposition of an additional 100% tariff on China, but later stated that these tariffs would not be sustainable and blamed Beijing for recent trade conflicts between the two nations. In the meantime, S&P 500 firms are predicted to encounter an earnings growth rate of about 9.3% from July through September. This percentage is lower than the 13.8% growth in the second quarter, according to LSEG data. This slowdown is primarily due to the US tech sector, which is being driven by major investments in AI. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index is expected to rise by a mere 0.5%, down from 4% last quarter. The biggest challenges are hitting companies that rely on trade with countries that lack trade agreements.

The estimate comes as discussions around Ripple’s rumored plan to raise $1 billion for an XRP treasury gain traction, reigniting debate about the potential for a supply squeeze in the market. Ripple’s Proposed $1B Buyback Sparks Renewed Interest According to a recent Bloomberg report, Ripple is said to be working on securing $1 billion in funding to establish an XRP-focused treasury initiative. The company reportedly intends to use a portion of the XRP held in its escrow to support this effort. The news has generated considerable attention within the XRP community, particularly among investors who believe a large-scale buyback could tighten supply and influence prices. The conversation was further amplified when a well-known community commentator, Baba Cugs, revisited his earlier theory suggesting that a major price breakout could only occur once retail investors have been largely bought out. Several other XRP advocates have echoed this idea, arguing that institutional participation has been steadily increasing while retail involvement continues to decline. 500M to 1.9B Retail XRP Remaining Gonna need more than Ripple's 1B At $5 XRP, $1B buys 200M XRP At $7.5….. 133.33M XRP $10…….100M $15…….66.6M $20….. 50M XRP Sample above $5B buys 550M XRP. If it's closer to 1.9B Retail will need $17.7B. And that's if all sell. https://t.co/V2pn279oSe — XRP_Liquidity (Larsen/Britto/Escrow/ODL/RLUSD) (@XRPwallets) October 19, 2025 Edoardo Farina, the founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has also remarked that small investors are being phased out of the market as larger financial entities acquire greater control over circulating supply. This sentiment reflects a growing belief that institutional demand could eventually dominate the XRP landscape. Estimating the Retail Supply and Buyout Cost Another community analyst, known by the pseudonym XRP Liquidity, regularly tracks wallet data to monitor holdings across different investor classes. His findings suggest that retail investors currently control between 500 million and 1.9 billion XRP. Based on this range, he argues that Ripple’s proposed $1 billion buyback would not be sufficient to absorb all remaining retail supply. At the current trading price of approximately $2.45, purchasing 500 million XRP would require around $1.2 billion, while acquiring 1.9 billion XRP would cost nearly $4.6 billion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, the analyst emphasized that this calculation assumes all tokens would be sold at the current market price, an unlikely scenario given that many holders would seek to sell only at higher valuations. Projected Selling Levels Among Retail Investors To account for differing selling preferences, the analyst modeled a tiered scenario. If some investors begin taking profits around the $5 mark, a $1 billion investment would acquire roughly 200 million XRP. At $7.50, the same capital would buy about 133 million XRP, and at $10, it would purchase 100 million. As prices climb, the available quantity continues to decrease. A $1 billion buy order at $15 would secure only about 66 million XRP, and at $20, it would capture around 50 million. Cumulatively, buying 550 million XRP across these tiers would require about $5 billion. Should retail investors collectively hold closer to 1.9 billion XRP, clearing them out completely would take an estimated $17.7 billion, assuming all tokens were sold at these higher levels. Community commentators such as Baba Cugsy have suggested that once institutional buyers absorb most of the remaining retail supply, XRP could experience an accelerated price movement due to reduced availability. XRP Liquidity has also speculated that institutions might intentionally drive the price toward $20 to encourage remaining retail investors to exit. These projections illustrate how supply concentration and institutional accumulation are shaping discussions within the XRP community.

This drop put the market in “extreme fear” for the first time since April, leading many observers to speculate on how long the bull cycle will last, with one warning that more losses are coming. A Critical Line in the Sand In his “Big Sunday Report,” crypto trader Dr. Profit told his over 439,000 followers on X that they should have used the 115–125k zone to build short positions, warning that the market is now “extremely bearish.” He wrote that he had been “flagging” that area “to add shorts and sell” since the end of August, noting that BTC reached “126k, 1k more than my max top scenario of 125k” before dropping on October 10, when it went as low as $101,000 on some trading platforms. The analyst singled out market psychology as central, writing plainly that: “Markets are driven by greed, currently I have rarely seen so much greed in the market as now, and I am speaking about both the bear and bullish side.” His setup hinges on a specific technical threshold: a decisive break below $101,700. “By breaking below $101,700 Bitcoin will break below its magic bull market line which would finally confirm a bear market and silence those bulls once for all!” wrote Dr. Profit. The post also talks about liquidity mechanics as a cause, saying that recent late-entering shorts, liquidations near $116,500, and the packed positioning of short-term holders have made the price structure weak. Furthermore, the analyst used the $112,500 short-term holder realized price to show that a lot of recent buyers had lost money and could put more pressure on the market if BTC drops another 5–10%. Sentiment, Macro Events and Market Structure This weekend’s price action echoed that caution. At the time of writing, CoinGecko data showed that the main cryptocurrency was trading around $110,700, which is up 3.5% in the last 24 hours but down the same amount over the past seven days. The 14-day drop is close to 10.6%, and the 30-day dip is smaller, at 4.1%. Doctor Profit’s warnings arrive as broader sentiment has turned sour. On October 17, reports indicated that the Fear & Greed Index was at its lowest point since April and that about $900 billion in market value had been lost in the past few days. Some analysts say that the medium-term uptrend is still going strong if key supports hold, while others say that liquidity operations linked to ETFs and leveraged positions make the market open to big directional moves.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.2779 Market Cap $449.07M Trading Volume $6.017M Circulating Supply 1.615B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.2823 24-hour Low $0.2725 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.64% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.3663 14-Day RSI 35.83 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 29 (Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $0.3878 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown FLOW’s 1-day chart shows tightening Bollinger Band. The 4-hour chart confirms sideways consolidation. FLOW’s support is present at $0.27. Flow coin 1-day price analysis On the 1-day chart for Oct 20, 2025, FLOW is sitting at $0.278, barely moving but showing a clear slowdown in selling. The Bollinger Bands are tightening between $0.226 (lower band) and $0.321 (upper band), with price hovering between the mid-band and the lower band. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains in negative territory, but the bars are shrinking, showing that bearish momentum is losing force. Volume remains light, around 586K, suggesting most participants are waiting for confirmation before acting. As long as the price holds above $0.27, FLOW looks to be in accumulation. A daily close above $0.285 would likely trigger a retest of $0.30, followed by $0.32 if buying interest strengthens. If $0.27 gives way, the $0.24 price level becomes the next likely support. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour chart paints a calmer, more neutral picture. FLOW trades around $0.277, with the Alligator lines (jaw $0.277, teeth $0.277, lips $0.276) now overlapping, meaning the market is directionless in the short term. This crossover phase often precedes a stronger move once new volume enters. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI at 47.8 is perfectly neutral, confirming the lack of momentum. The recent uptick stalled right below $0.28, showing mild resistance there. If FLOW can break through $0.28, it may push for a short-term climb toward $0.285–$0.29. If it slips under $0.275, traders can expect a quick drop back to $0.27 support. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3227 SELL SMA 5 $0.3019 SELL SMA 10 $0.2953 SELL SMA 21 $0.3313 SELL SMA 50 $0.3663 SELL SMA 100 $0.3796 SELL SMA 200 $0.3878 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3333 SELL EMA 5 $0.3528 SELL EMA 10 $0.3724 SELL EMA 21 $0.3819 SELL EMA 50 $0.3829 SELL EMA 100 $0.3870 SELL EMA 200 $0.4253 SELL What to expect from Flow? FLOW is clearly basing around $0.27 after a sharp decline, with sellers losing control and volatility drying up. Both timeframes suggest consolidation before the next impulse. If buyers reclaim $0.285, expect a short-term lift toward $0.30–$0.32; otherwise, the coin will likely keep ranging quietly between $0.27–$0.28 until momentum returns. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

The initiative rewards the early community members while generating new focus on the growing ecosystem of the project. The bonus comes as demand for new presale tokens has surged throughout the crypto market. By providing more rewards to first-phase participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE hopes to create momentum and investor confidence as it prepares its next phase of funding. MAGACOIN FINANCE Introduces Patriot50X Bonus for Early Supporters The Patriot50X bonus gives early buyers an instant 50% token boost for every purchase made before the end of each round. This limited-time reward is part of the project’s strategy to attract strong holders who believe in its long-term roadmap. Each presale phase runs with a tiered pricing structure, which means that prices increase as rounds close. This approach encourages early participation and offers transparency. The Patriot50X event maximizes this system by providing additional value at the earliest entry point, allowing investors to lock up more tokens before the next price increase. Project developers confirmed that the bonus will only be active for the initial stages to avoid oversupply and retain the scarcity of tokens. This design guarantees that value increases naturally as the demand increases. Growing Investor Interest in the Presale Investor activities around MAGACOIN FINANCE are still accelerating. The project’s presale rounds have been closing faster than expected as more participants have joined through its verified platform. Early traction is fueled by clear communication, secure smart contracts, and a strong commitment to transparency. Market watchers say that the structured rollout and open reporting of MAGACOIN FINANCE have built trust in a time when many presales struggle with credibility. Each stage has fixed token prices, allocation limits, and timeframes, which help buyers track their progress and verify results. This openness has brought in a mix of retail traders and long-term holders. Many view the project’s transparent model as a sign of maturity that is rarely seen with early-stage crypto launches. Why the 50% Bonus Matters for Long-Term Holders The Patriot50X bonus gives early investors a head start when it comes to potential returns. Those who purchase before future rounds pay a lower effective price per token, magnified by the 50% reward. Analysts say such incentives help to reduce short-term speculation and to encourage investors to hold through multiple phases. For long-term holders, initial accumulation can have a compounding effect once the token is listed on exchanges. The rising price model means that the tokens obtained under the Patriot50X bonus can already appreciate before trading starts. Moreover, the design is also advantageous to community development. To early adopters, a reward is visible, which builds loyalty, as the project seeks a listing and inclusion in the broader ecosystem. Community Response and Market Outlook The response of the community to the announcement has been overwhelmingly positive. There is a notable upsurge in social channels where new investors learn about the presale. Several users call the 50-percent bonus fair in contrast to other campaigns that water down the worth or have vague wording. According to analysts, the bonus shows that the MAGACOIN FINANCE team trusts its roadmap. The project indicates its long-term orientation with its community by giving more tokens to dedicated supporters, which is an essential quality of sustainability. Since the market is regaining its confidence after the recent volatility, presales with transparent mechanisms are taking a revitalized focus. MAGACOIN FINANCE seems to be in a good position in this trend, with verifiable smart-contract data and appealing rewards to investors. Final Outlook The Patriot50X bonus is another milestone in the history of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which supports its growth-first approach and model that is based on investors. The project will help build strength in community participation and market presence by giving early buyers additional tokens. Having transparent pricing, rapid rounding, and increasing investor reach, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains one of the most watched crypto projects to follow in 2025. To early participants, the 50% Patriot50X offer is not only a bonus, but also a good opportunity to settle on a stronger position before the next stage commences.

Federal and state traffic laws require all vehicles to stop and remain stationary when they see a school bus with red lights flashing, stop arm extended, and crossing control arm deployed while unloading students. However, video footage shows one of Waymo’s autonomous vehicles maneuvering around one such school bus. NHTSA scrutinizes Waymo’s robotaxis The probe is the latest scrutiny of self-driving systems by regulators reviewing how driverless technologies affect other road users. This episode comes after a video of an incident in Georgia involving a Waymo car and a stationary school bus that had its red lights flashing and stop arm deployed. According to a report , the Waymo vehicle initially paused, but then it maneuvered around the bus, passing the extended stop arm even though students were still disembarking. Waymo’s automated driving system is currently logging 2 million miles per week, according to the agency, and it has confirmed that the “likelihood of other prior similar incidents is high.” While the statement is concerning, some reassurance has come from the company as it claimed to be working hard to make improvements that will roll out with the next update. How Waymo has responded to the probe Given the novelty of what Waymo is trying to accomplish in the self-driving car sector, probes and occasions that encourage them are to be expected. However, the company is not relenting and a Waymo spokesperson has claimed it has “already developed and implemented improvements related to stopping for school buses and will land additional software updates in our next software release.” The company has also reiterated a commitment to creating products that prioritize child safety, explaining that it had “approached the school bus from an angle where the flashing lights and stop sign were not visible and drove slowly around the front of the bus before driving past it, keeping a safe distance from children.” It is crucial to note that the vehicle involved had been equipped with Waymo’s fifth-generation Automated Driving System and was operating without a human safety driver at the time of the incident. There were also no injuries reported in the incident, but it has highlighted the issues AV perception systems face in edge cases like those involving obscured signals. The company currently operates over 1,500 robotaxis in cities like Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin, and has plans to expand to Nashville in 2026 via a partnership with Lyft. Waymo has already logged over 100 million rider-only miles in 2025, but rare errors like this can amplify safety concerns for public trust and policy.

In a recent post, he remarked that maintaining a position in XRP through repeated market downturns takes either extraordinary conviction or, as he joked, “a touch of mental illness.” His comments shed light on how emotional endurance plays a major role in long-term crypto investing. The Psychological Test of Long-Term Holding According to Van Code, many investors like to believe they would remain patient through market turbulence to achieve massive gains. However, he noted that this belief rarely holds when faced with real volatility. Most traders tend to sell once profits appear substantial enough, even if larger gains may lie ahead. Every talks about ""oh if I bought BTC for $1 id because billionaire today"". What you fail to realize is 99% of people would sell even at $100. Or what about when it dumped from $10k down to $1k then back up again. You really have to almost be mentally unstable to hold from $1… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 19, 2025 He illustrated his point with Bitcoin’s historical trajectory. When Bitcoin was worth less than $1 in its early days, few could have imagined its rise above $110,000. Yet, Van Code argued that most people who claim they would have held it until now would likely have exited early, perhaps around $100, once they felt they had made enough profit. Evidence supports his claim. Several early Bitcoin holders who once owned large sums have sold after years of inactivity, cashing out millions or billions of dollars. Meanwhile, others famously exited too soon, such as the early user who spent 10,000 BTC on two pizzas. Van Code emphasized that maintaining a long-term position through dramatic market reversals, such as Bitcoin’s past crashes of over 80%, requires more than confidence. It demands psychological resilience that few investors possess. Could Investors Realistically Hold XRP to $1,000 or Beyond? Van Code applied the same reasoning to XRP holders who publicly claim they will not sell until the token reaches $1,000 or even $10,000 . He believes that, in reality, most would take profits much earlier if life-changing sums were on the line. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Predictions of XRP reaching $1,000 are not new. Some analysts, including projections from Changelly, suggest the token could potentially achieve that price by 2040 under ideal conditions. However, with XRP currently below $3, maintaining a position for over a decade would be mentally demanding, especially given crypto’s unpredictable price patterns. Van Code pointed to XRP’s 2018 collapse, when it lost over 95% of its value after reaching $3, as a reminder of how quickly optimism can turn into panic. The Challenge of Emotional Discipline Another long-term XRP investor, known as TheXFactor33, agreed with Van Code’s assessment. He stated that staying invested through multiple downturns requires “an unhealthy amount of stubbornness.” Having held XRP for more than eight years, he admitted that conviction is often tested during extended bear markets but insisted that emotional control is what separates long-term holders from short-term traders. In a follow-up discussion, Van Code revealed that he had already mentally detached from his XRP holdings. “The money no longer exists on my balance sheet,” he said, adding that he has no plans to sell even if XRP were to hit $10,000. Instead, his focus is on preserving the asset for long-term financial goals, such as securing property for his children. This perspective shows that achieving exceptional returns is not solely about market timing but also about emotional discipline. Van Code’s comments highlight how enduring extreme volatility over many years is a rare trait that only a small percentage of investors can sustain.

Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bull Run Over? Analyst Sees Echoes Of 2021 Price reclaimed the $190–$193 area after a sharp bounce from trendline support, with traders now eyeing a clean break over $200 to flip momentum. On the charts, Solana remains inside a descending channel of lower highs and lows, but a sustained move above $202–$211 (a confluence of the 20/50-day EMAs and key Fibonacci levels) would mark a structure shift and open upside targets at $221–$222, then $235 and $250. SOL's price records small gains on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Volume Pops, Open Interest Climbs, Institutions Accumulate Bullish undercurrents are building beneath the price. On-chain and market data show trading volumes surging to multi-month highs, while futures open interest has pushed above $8billion, signaling stronger participation and the potential for a larger directional move when volatility expands. Spot flows turned positive, with close to $31.7million in net inflows recently pointing to accumulation at mid-range levels. Institutional and corporate interest remains a durable pillar for Solana. A recent Grayscale analysis highlights the network’s high throughput, low fees, and expanding developer base. Meanwhile, ARK Invest reported $223 million in Q3 network revenue, ranking among the highest in the blockchain industry. Additionally, corporate treasuries across digital-asset firms collectively hold over 20 million SOL, underscoring long-term institutional commitment. Staking yields of around 7% annually continue to attract holders, while scaling initiatives like Firedancer aim to improve throughput and network resilience. Catalyst Watch: $200 Reclaim, Solana ETF Headlines, and Network Growth Near term, the market wants confirmation. A daily close above $202–$211 would validate a trend reversal and strengthen the case for a measured grind toward $235–$250. Analysts also flag ETF progress and regulatory headlines as potential catalysts, alongside macro risk appetite driven by rates and liquidity. Fundamentally, Solana’s momentum is buoyed by DeFi/NFT activity, rising DEX volumes, and enterprise experiments in payments and DePIN.

53432481,610077,1761004850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53432481.jpeg,"Bitcoin Bounces Back Over $110K After Massive ETF Outflows, Is the Next Bull Run Starting?",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bounces-back-over-110k-massive-etf-outflows/,"Bitcoin (BTC) jumped back above $110,000 on Monday, erasing part of last week’s slide even as U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs posted their second-largest weekly net outflows on record ($1.2 billion). The swift rebound, from lows near $103,700, has traders asking whether the market just completed a “controlled deleveraging” and is now basing for the next advance. Ether reclaimed $4,000 alongside broader crypto green shoots, aided by cooling trade-war headlines and growing odds of additional Fed rate cuts. Short term, BTC is attempting to hold the $107,000–$110,000 support band. A clean break and hold above $112,000–$115,500 would strengthen the bullish case and set sights on $120,000–$123,000. Institutions Still Bullish; Rare BTC–Gold Signals Flash “Bottom” Despite the outflows, institutional conviction looks resilient. A new Coinbase survey found 67% of institutions are bullish on Bitcoin over the next three to six months, citing improving liquidity, robust ETF infrastructure, and stablecoin usage near record highs. Macro tailwinds are supportive, with markets now pricing in further Fed easing, a trend that has historically redirected capital from cash and money-market funds toward risk assets. On-chain and cross-asset signals add weight. CryptoQuant’s Joao Wedson flagged rare bottom readings in the BTC-to-gold ratio oscillator, levels that previously preceded strong recoveries. Separately, JP Morgan’s framework values BTC materially higher versus gold, mapping to a potential $165,000 by 2025 if the relationship normalizes. Short-term holder MVRV Bollinger signals are also in “oversold” territory, seen earlier at $49,000 and $74,000 before subsequent rallies, supporting the notion that recent weakness was an accumulation phase, not a top. Bitcoin (BTC) Levels, Risks, and the Road to a New Leg Higher Technically, Bitcoin bulls want to defend $107,000–$110,000 and flip $112,000–$115,500 into support. Above there, momentum traders eye $120,000–$123,000 and the prior ATH zone near $126K. Funding and open interest have cooled, reducing the risk of another forced-liquidation cascade. Regardless, skeptics point to rising-wedge overhangs and headline risk (trade tensions, data shocks), while gold’s record run fuels the “digital-gold vs. gold” debate. The bounce above $110,000, despite heavy ETF redemptions, suggests strong dip-buying and improving liquidity. If macro conditions cooperate and BTC can reclaim the mid-$110,000s with volume, the market may be transitioning from “reset” to re-accumulation, laying groundwork for a fresh bull leg into late 2025.

The energy in Q4 2025 feels electric as altcoins keep outperforming predictions, and MoonBull ($MOBU) now joins the spotlight as the best crypto to buy this week . MoonBull ($MOBU) has entered the market with unmatched buzz. With Ripple and Hyperliquid pushing confidence back into altcoins, this project’s tokenomics, staking power, and community-driven design are shaping the crypto conversation this week and beyond. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Best Crypto to Buy This Week With Bold Potential MoonBull ($MOBU) is turning heads across Q4 2025 as the best crypto to buy this week . Its architecture, called “Mobunomics,” is built to reward both small and large holders. The tokenomics split drives value by allocating 50% to its stage-based launch, 20% to staking, and 11% to referral programs, maximizing scarcity and rewards simultaneously. Every trade enhances stability through 2% liquidity addition, 2% reflections to holders, and 1% token burn, ensuring long-term price appreciation. Built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, MoonBull ($MOBU) provides a secure and liquid ecosystem ready for DeFi integration. The governance system (launching at Stage 12) gives every holder equal voting rights, with 1 token = 1 vote. This community-first transparency, paired with its structured 23-stage rollout, is exactly why experts are calling it the best crypto to buy this week. MoonBull Presale Gains: Why the Best Crypto to Buy This Week Is Surging MoonBull’s presale performance has stunned the market. Currently in its 5th stage at $0.00006584, it has already raised over $450K with more than 1,400 holders. Early participants have seen an ROI of 163.36%, and the listing price of $0.00616 suggests a potential ROI of over 9,256% from Stage 5. With a 27.40% price increase per stage, momentum is undeniable. An example says it all: a $10,000 entry at Stage 5 equals 151,883,353.58 tokens, valued at $935,601.46 at listing. Combine this with 15% referral rewards and 95% APY staking (Stage 10 onwards), and MoonBull ($MOBU) stands as the best crypto to buy this week for those looking for both passive rewards and explosive growth. Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction: $1 Billion Buyback Sparks Optimism Ripple (XRP) is making history in October 2025 after announcing plans to raise at least $1 billion to buy back XRP through a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). This marks one of the largest corporate treasury fundraises in crypto history, signaling Ripple’s massive confidence in XRP’s future. The XRP token currently holds a market value of $13.8 billion, ranking it the fifth-largest cryptocurrency globally. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, confirmed the move as part of a strategy to enter the $120T corporate treasury payments market. This news strengthened market sentiment, pushing XRP price prediction models higher for Q4 2025. Many community members see the buyback as a bold attempt to stabilize XRP’s long-term price and assert its dominance in cross-border payments. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price News: HIP-3 Upgrade Ignites Trading Activity Hyperliquid (HYPE) is gaining major traction following its HIP-3 permissionless perpetuals upgrade, allowing users to create custom perpetual contracts without approvals. This update has significantly boosted on-chain volume and interest, turning the decentralized exchange into a top contender in DeFi this October 2025. The upgrade introduced new composability mechanics, meaning market participants can combine DeFi tools like lending, derivatives, and AMMs into a single custom setup. According to Sentora data, HYPE trading activity has reached multi-billion daily volumes. The HIP-3 model has made HYPE a standout performer, and current HYPE price news suggests the token could maintain strong momentum throughout Q4 2025. Final Thoughts: Ripple (XRP) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) Hold Steady While MoonBull ($MOBU) Leads the Race Ripple (XRP) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) have made powerful moves this October, restoring faith in DeFi projects and altcoin resilience. Yet, the best crypto to buy this week remains MoonBull ($MOBU) thanks to its structured growth and exceptional ROI potential. The MoonBull presale at $0.00006584 offers a limited-time entry for early buyers, promising a strong upside toward its listing price of $0.00616. With a 15% referral reward, a 95% APY staking system, and robust tokenomics, community members are positioning themselves now before the next price hike. It’s shaping up to be a defining month for MoonBull believers.

Announcing the plan at the inaugural Regional Investment Summit in Birmingham on Tuesday, Reeves will outline how she plans to end “pointless paperwork” and “unnecessary form-filling” faced by small businesses but committed to delivering transparency and certainty for businesses around mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The Treasury’s proposals are part of a wider drive to boost growth by cutting back on regulatory entanglements, according to the government. This development follows as the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) appeals to Reeves to seize the November budget and make substantial amendments on current tax law. In an October 13 news release, the think tank said this reform is significant in that it will allow Reeves to raise more money while mitigating the negative economic impacts. As for the IFS’s advice to the chancellor, officials at the London-based research institute cautioned Reeves against raising the current rate of tax in order to raise those extra funds (some 30 billion pounds, or about $40 billion) that she needs to meet her goals for boosting public finances. “What we really do not want in November is the encouragement of aimless changes and half-hearted solutions,” said Isaac Delestre, a senior research economist at the IFS. Delestre views November’s budget as a chance for real progress. Therefore, he urges the chancellor to use this budget to establish a more sensible tax system. CMA faces overhaul as Treasury pushes for faster, fairer M&A reviews Reeves will announce that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will undergo significant structural changes to improve efficiency and accountability. These are replacing its current panel-based decision-making with a board committee structure and carrying out detailed “phase 2” merger probes in-house rather than outsourcing them to independent experts. Any changes would have to undergo consultation and result in new legislation. The chancellor has made little secret of her impatience with regulators recently boasting that she had “got rid” of the chair of the CMA and plans to “take out” more as part of her pro-growth agenda. £10 billion investment drive unveiled at Birmingham summit The summit, described as last year’s overseas counterpart that attracted £63 billion of foreign investment into the country, is bringing around 350 business leaders, mayors and investors to Edgbaston cricket ground. Sponsored by Eon, HSBC, KPMG and Lloyds it will see bosses from British Land, Hammerson, Deutsche Bank, Kraft Heinz and Morgan Stanley attend alongside figures from West Bromwich Albion, Birmingham City FC as well as the Birmingham Royal Ballet. The government is expected to unveil £10 billion in new private investment, including a £6.5 billion injection from U.S. real estate firm Welltower into the care home sector. The Crown Estate will also announce a project expected to unlock £4.5 billion in value through land purchases at Harwell East science park, paving the way for new manufacturing spaces and 400 homes. Industry leaders have welcomed the Harwell East project, with CATCH UK, a chemical industry group, emphasizing the need for “urgent corrective action” to ensure domestic producers remain competitive. Meanwhile, the National Wealth Fund (NWF) will reveal £104 million in financing for clean energy projects, including onshore and offshore wind developments in Norfolk and Orkney and a heat network in Hull. The fund, which has already invested heavily in the Sizewell C nuclear project, will also deploy experts to help local authorities accelerate infrastructure projects in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, West Midlands, and Glasgow City Region amid criticism of limited local capacity and expertise.

While the SPAC listing that Blockchain.com is reportedly considering would provide the company with additional capital flexibility and exposure following its previous downturns, it would also place the firm under increased scrutiny from regulators and investors. Blockchain.com considers listing publicly through SPAC merger Blockchain.com, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers, is reportedly considering going public through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), according to sources cited in reports. Blockchain.com was founded in 2011 and has been one of the oldest players in the crypto ecosystem, offering trading, wallet, and custodial services to millions of users worldwide. Its early start allowed it to build a large customer base and survive multiple market cycles. The company has reportedly appointed an advisor and held discussions about a possible SPAC deal. Blockchain.com has not yet made a final decision and details such as timing or valuation have not been disclosed. Blockchain.com has long held the goal of becoming a publicly traded company. When the firm appointed Goldman Sachs veteran Justin Evans as chief financial officer (CFO) in February, Evans said Blockchain.com was “taking the necessary steps to be a public company, if and when the public markets are available.” In addition to Evans, the company recently hired Mike Wilcox, the former CFO at Velocity Global, as chief operating officer (COO). The company’s use of a SPAC would offer a quicker and less complex path to the public markets than a traditional initial public offering (IPO). SPACs are blank-check companies created specifically to acquire existing businesses and they have recently regained popularity among crypto and fintech firms. Crypto IPO wave grows despite market volatility Blockchain.com has experienced the market’s volatility with its valuation rising to $5.2B in March 2021, and then to $14B in the next year in 2022, only to have taken a nosedive to $7B by November of 2023 due to falling crypto prices, lower trading activity, and regulatory uncertainty. However, the crypto industry has rebounded in 2025, supported by regulatory clarity and the institutional adoption of blockchain-based financial services. This recovery has renewed the interest in public listing ambitions among major players. In September, the U.S.-based exchange Gemini completed its IPO, pricing shares at $28 and closing its first trading day up 14.3% at $32, valuing the firm at roughly $3.3B. Similarly, Bullish, another cryptocurrency exchange, made its market debut in August, pricing shares at $37 and seeing them soar 83% to $68 by day’s end giving the firm a $10B fully diluted market capitalization. Meanwhile, Kraken, one of the largest global exchanges, is reportedly preparing for a traditional IPO as early as the first quarter of 2026. In September, Kraken raised $500M in a funding round that valued the company at $15B.

Meanwhile, El Salvador quietly added eight BTC to its reserves, bringing its total holdings to 6,355.18 BTC. Exchange Flows Show Withdrawals Based on exchange records, major centralized platforms recorded a net outflow of roughly 21,000 BTC over the past week. Coinbase Pro and Binance were named among those with the biggest withdrawals, showing about 15,000 BTC and 12,000 BTC moved off exchanges, respectively. Traders interpret such flows in different ways: some see accumulation into private wallets, others see funds repositioned by large traders.

In addition to SOL recovery, recoveries in Cardano and Hyperliquid were also steady with each recovering important support levels. This recovery has come about with an accumulation trend that will make the market ready for a wider breakout phase in late 2025. Concurrently, the rally has also revived the excitement to the presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which still has a good number of early investors calling it the best crypto to buy. Solana Builds Strength as Bulls Defend Key Levels Solana price rose 4% in the past 24 hours, indicating a new strength in the rising channel. The SOL price has been trading in a steady range of $185-$210, and buyers have been protecting the support at $190. According to the analysts, every test of this area is being received with active accumulation. This steady purchasing demand is a positive indicator of increasing confidence in the market. Technical traders regard the $205 to $210 as a possible breakout area that can cause the prices to go up to $246 and even to $300. Source; X Provided that Solana keeps holding above $180, it might proceed with its long-term growth pattern. Solana recovery has also led to a wider optimism in the altcoin market. Cardano Prepares for a Potential Technical Breakout Cardano is also exhibiting some stability with the token maintaining levels above the key support levels of approximately $0.65. ADA market data indicate that ADA is approaching a resistance area at $0.74 to $0.77, where sellers have been active in the last several sessions. When the market breaks out of this point it may indicate the beginning of a new short-term rise. Analyst Lark Davis observed that ADA recently showed a daily MACD golden cross, a precursor of large upsurge. Cardano has already shot up 150% since bottoming in September 2023 and has stayed in a distinct trend of higher lows. In the next major run, ADA may carry gains to $2.96 as long as the buying pressure is sustained. Source: X According to many traders, Cardano is currently one of the best crypto to buy at less than $1, as it has been assisted by technical strength and network enhancements that still continue to attract developers. Hyperliquid Growth Supported by Buyback Program Hyperliquid has been making continuous token buybacks amounting to over $521 million. These buybacks have replaced more than 5.6% of the circulating supply, which demonstrates steady protocol revenue. The gradual withdrawal of liquid supply has acted as a buffer when corrections were made recently and has thus created good grounds of recovery. Source: Tokenomist Under the new HyperEVM integration and active involvement in its ecosystem, the on-chain data of HYPE are healthy. The price action indicates that the token is trading within the range of $34 to $37 support indicating a sign of buyers accumulating in the range. With the trend, analysts estimate a possible rebound to a range of $45. The combination of lower supply, ecosystem growth, and long-term investor confidence have positioned Hyperliquid as a one of the most promising projects during periods of market consolidation to be the best crypto to own. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Attracts Investor Momentum Although there are already existing tokens that possess major support, new competitors such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are rapidly taking off. The presale that has been going on in the project has been registered with good participation of the retail and institutional investors. Subsequently, thousands of wallets have become part of the event and continue to boost the inflows every day as well as surpassing a few initial funding milestones. The PATRIOT50X bonus program, offered by MAGACOIN FINANCE has been the key to this rush. The incentive will reward the first participants who will earn up to 50% additional tokens. Analysts on X call it the XRP killer which may come to outperform even cryptos like Dogecoin or even Shiba Inu. Consequently, the presale is one of the most talked-about campaigns in all online communities, which makes MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the key upcoming listing candidates. It is now being listed as one of the best crypto to buy before the year 2025, as many traders note its large community base and clear presale process. Market Outlook The general market remains exhibiting a positive trend and Solana, Cardano and Hyperliquid are stable at strategic support points. All of the assets exhibit indications of gradual building up as the sentiment is slowly getting better. According to market analysts, the continued inflow into presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE makes investors ready to participate in the next stage of expansion. With the rotation of capital to new opportunities, it will be likely to focus on the developments which have both good fundamentals and community developments. As Solana has recovered, ADA has been on the technical upward trend, and HYPE has decreased supply, MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently one of the best altcoin to buy in the current accumulation phase.

His updated forecast suggests moderate growth across the board and presents what he calls a more realistic outlook for the remainder of 2025. The latest analysis arrives amid heightened uncertainty in the broader cryptocurrency market. Most leading assets are struggling to regain momentum, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana all trading below their 30-day peaks. The decline has ranged from 4% to 18% across these tokens, while the Fear and Greed Index currently sits at 27, a level that indicates widespread caution among investors. Realistic end of 2025 crypto price predictions: Bitcoin – $250k Ethereum – $6k Solana – $350 BNB – $1.75k XRP – $5 What else? — Whale.Guru (@Whale_Guru) October 19, 2025 Bitcoin Expected to Regain Market Leadership Whale.Guru expects Bitcoin to remain the primary driver of the next bullish phase. In his projection, the world’s largest cryptocurrency could reach $250,000 before the end of 2025. Based on its current price of approximately $110,393, this would represent a gain of more than 126% and establish a new all-time high. Should this scenario unfold, Bitcoin’s market capitalization could approach $5 trillion, significantly improving overall sentiment in the crypto space. The analyst believes such a recovery would also create favorable conditions for large-cap altcoins, allowing them to follow Bitcoin’s trajectory with moderate gains of their own. According to his analysis, Ethereum could advance to around $6,000, Solana might rise to $350, and Binance Coin (BNB) could reach $1,750. These predictions indicate less than a 100% increase for each asset, a sign that Whale.Guru is focusing on steady market growth rather than speculative excesses. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Projection Revised to $5 In contrast to his earlier predictions of a supercycle that could propel XRP to $300, Whale.Guru has adjusted his expectations to a more measured $5 price target by the end of 2025. At its current price of $2.45 , this forecast implies a potential upside of roughly 103% over the next three months. While conservative compared to past estimates, this target would still mark a significant milestone for XRP, giving it a projected market capitalization of about $300 billion. Market observers note that factors such as institutional participation, potential ETF approvals, and Ripple’s expanding cross-border payment infrastructure could contribute to the token’s upward trajectory. Whale.Guru’s outlook aligns with projections from other market commentators, including Ash Crypto and Mario Nawfal , who have both placed XRP’s potential range between $5 and $10 if Bitcoin continues to strengthen. These overlapping forecasts suggest a growing consensus that XRP could deliver moderate, sustainable growth through 2025, rather than extreme price surges. The analyst’s revised tone reflects a more cautious but data-driven perspective compared to his previous predictions. Although a $5 XRP remains below earlier supercycle ambitions, achieving that level would still represent an unprecedented high for the token and a significant milestone in its long-term performance history.
