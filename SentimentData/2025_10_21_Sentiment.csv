Its upswing is being compared by market observers to that of Ethereum in 2017, which experienced a legendary period in terms of life-altering returns. As new capital comes into new blockchain projects, analysts say that MAGACOIN FINANCE is a reflection of initial Ethereum momentum, where community engagement has grown to spark one of the largest aspects of crypto growth. Should history repeat itself, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the next project to mark a new age of blockchain use and a new investment opportunity. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Hits $17 Million MAGACOIN FINANCE has already passed the mark of $17 million total presale funds, which is among the fastest-growing token sales of 2025. The milestone marks rising investor confidence in an anxious recovery in digital asset markets. Early adopters attribute the verified audits of the project and growing social presence as significant drivers of the explosion. Most retail investors and strategic participants have participated in the presale according to on-chain data because they want to gain early exposure before it is listed on the exchange. Analysts observe that the multi-stage presale of MAGACOIN FINANCE with tiered pricing and allocation is similar to the disciplined fundraise model of early blue-chip protocols such as Ethereum and Avalanche. The roadmap of the project has a comprehensive ecosystem that combines the interoperability of metaverses and decentralized finance (DeFi). This long-term plan will make MAGACOIN FINANCE a pillar in the new generation of financial products run by blockchain. With the rising belief that MAGACOIN FINANCE might dominate the next altseason, the $17 million mark suggests a resurgence in market optimism to buy into the investment. MAGACOIN FINANCE Compares to Ethereum’s Bull Cycle Investment critics are making comparisons between the presale performance of MAGACOIN FINANCE and the 2017 breakout of Ethereum. The initial world of Ethereum was founded on programmable money and decentralized programs that transformed the use of blockchain. More so, MAGACOIN FINANCE embraces a utility-based design and concept that is scalable and integrates into the real world, as well as user involvement. In 2017, the demand for Ethereum tokens was mostly speculative. Nowadays, projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are constructed using institutional-grade compliance, are audited, and have sustainable economics. This progress marks the development of presales since the ICO hype, and more investors are now looking at long-term fundamentals instead of short-term hype. Analysts indicate that MAGACOIN FINANCE is on the verge of an upsurge as it presents a combination of decentralization and transparent economics with verifiable integrity. With a presale that has already exceeded expectations, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the best cryptos to buy now as market liquidity shifts back to the emerging assets. Its initial popularity reflects the basis that helped Ethereum enter the mainstream. Ethereum Price Prediction: Elliott Wave Setup Targets $7,000–$8,000 Ethereum stays in the bullish predictions, as analysts signal an end to an Elliott Wave correction. Technical analysts said that ETH is in its fifth impulsive wave, which is usually the last and strongest rally wave, with end cost targets of between $7,000 and $8,000. Similarly, analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that the top altcoin is making a very important move towards the $4,100 mark. He said that breaking through this level would signal the end of the recent downtrend of Ethereum. ETHUSD Chart | Source: X Institutional involvement confirms this attitude. The amount of ETH held by BitMine Immersion Technologies exceeds 3 million, worth more than $12 billion, demonstrating that Ethereum is trusted by numerous people in the long-term prospects of the cryptocurrency. Tom Lee expects it to reach $10,000-$12,000 in late 2025, whereas Arthur Hayes believes it will go all the way up to $20,000 in a general rally. Provided that Fusaka upgrade by Ethereum is completed as scheduled in December, analysts think that market sentiment, especially throughput and scalability, will be further improved. This could establish an upward trend that will help propel the entire sector of altcoins, including new tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion With Ethereum preparing for a rally, the focus of investors has shifted to credible early-stage initiatives that can replicate that momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE $17 million presale, strong community development, and proven transparency make it one of the best altcoins to buy in this market cycle. When Ethereum’s fifth wave happens as expected, the effect of this wave throughout the altcoin space could make MAGACOIN FINANCE the most successful coin in 2025.

Despite last week’s market volatility and the subsequent devastating losses, long-term holders are relaxed and profitable. The same cannot be said for short-term traders who are eyeing Bitcoin’s rebound above $113K to breathe again. Bitcoin’s Profit Divide Widens According to Alphractal founder Joao Wedson, Bitcoin’s current market mood is split between two distinct tribes. The calm veterans and the nervous newcomers. Long-Term Holders (LTHs) remain unfazed, their unrealized profits still comfortably in the green. They have seen it all before, and for them, the real concern does not even begin unless BTC slips below $37,000. That threshold remains comfortably distant from current levels. Short-Term Holders (STHs), on the other hand, are nursing losses and praying for a revival above the $113,200 mark. Ironically, that same level could become a battleground as a breakout would return many STHs to profit, but it could also trigger waves of profit-taking, thereby muting further upside momentum. Structurally, Bitcoin’s NUPL metric validates the idea of this divide. This is because long-term conviction remains intact, while the LTH/STH SOPR Ratio paints a picture of changing behavior. LTHs appear to be easing off their selling pressure and are letting the market breathe, while STHs are still clawing for short-term gains. This setup is reminiscent of late 2021, when fresh all-time highs were forged. The latest market condition suggests that while the old guard is coasting on earlier wins, the restless crowd still has something to prove. “LTHs have already locked in a good share of their profits – in March 2024, December 2024, and more recently, near the last ATH. Now, they’re relaxed, probably enjoying some time on a yacht with their families. Meanwhile, STHs are anxiously watching the charts, hoping for Bitcoin to break above $113K so they can finally smile again.” Impact of Easing US-China Tensions Now that Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the key $109,000-$110,000 support zone, a level that had previously acted as a crucial pivot in recent market structure, crypto analyst Ted Pillows believes that the next major hurdle lies at $112,000, a breakout above which could open the path for renewed bullish momentum. Pillows believes that the current macro backdrop adds further tailwinds to BTC’s potential upside, especially as US–China trade tensions appear to be easing. The reduction in geopolitical strain could boost investor confidence across risk assets, including crypto, by softening the global risk-off sentiment that had previously dampened speculative appetite.

53429955,609817,1760999410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53429955.jpeg,Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Capitulate: Realized Loss Ratio Hits 6-Month Low,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-term-holders-capitulate-realized-loss/,"Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery after several days marked by selling pressure, volatility, and fear across the crypto market. Following the sharp flash crash on October 10, when BTC briefly plunged to around $103,000, the price has since rebounded and is now testing supply near the $111,000 level. This move has brought a temporary sense of relief to traders, but on-chain data suggests that the market is still under stress. According to CryptoQuant, Short-Term Holders (STHs) — investors who typically hold Bitcoin for less than 155 days — are now selling below their cost basis, a clear sign of capitulation. Historically, such capitulation events have often marked late stages of a correction, as weak hands exit the market while stronger players accumulate. While this could signal that Bitcoin is nearing a local bottom, uncertainty remains high. The coming days will determine whether this rebound has the strength to sustain — or if the market will face renewed downside pressure as global risk sentiment remains fragile. Short-Term Holders Signal Capitulation According to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, the Short-Term Holder (STH) Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has dropped to 0.98, marking its lowest level since April 2025. This reading supports the trend that STHs are now selling at a loss, a sign of capitulation within the most reactive segment of the market. Historically, such declines in STH SOPR have aligned with late-stage corrections or market bottoms, as weaker hands are flushed out and coins transfer to stronger holders. During similar phases in 2023, 2024, and early 2025, this metric has acted as a contrarian signal, often preceding major rebounds. However, Maartunn cautions that while capitulation is unfolding, confirmation of a recovery still depends on whether Bitcoin can hold above its realized price levels and key moving averages. The market now finds itself at a critical juncture. Bitcoin has rebounded from the $103,000 flash crash low to hover around $111,000, but momentum remains fragile. A sustained close above the $111,500–$113,000 zone could reinforce short-term bullish structure, while failure to hold current support may open the door to deeper corrections toward $100,000 or below. If the SOPR stabilizes and begins to rise again, it could confirm a shift from capitulation to re-accumulation — the early stage of a new upward trend. But if selling pressure persists and sentiment weakens further, the market risks entering a prolonged consolidation phase before the next bullish leg begins. For now, Bitcoin remains on edge, caught between recovery hopes and macro-driven uncertainty. Bitcoin Attempts Short-Term Recovery, But Resistance Looms Ahead Bitcoin is showing early signs of a short-term rebound, recovering from the October 10 crash that sent prices below $104,000. On the 4-hour chart, BTC is currently trading near $111,200, attempting to reclaim short-term moving averages (50 and 100 SMA) after several days of bearish momentum. This bounce reflects a shift in intraday sentiment, but the market remains cautious. The next key resistance lies around $113,000–$114,000, where the 200 SMA aligns with previous support turned resistance. A breakout above this zone could open the door to a test of $117,500, a major liquidity area that capped rallies earlier this month. However, if Bitcoin fails to clear this level, it risks falling back toward $107,000–$106,000, where strong demand previously emerged. Momentum indicators are improving but not yet convincing. Volume remains subdued, and funding rates continue to hover in negative territory — suggesting traders still lean bearish. This setup often precedes larger short squeezes, but confirmation is still lacking. Bitcoin’s short-term structure favors cautious optimism. Holding above $110,000 would support the recovery narrative, while rejection at higher levels could quickly trigger another retest of the recent lows. The next few sessions will be decisive for confirming trend direction.

Legendary Analyst Says It’s Time To Pay Attention,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-and-solana-price/,"A rare signal from a legendary market analyst has caught traders’ attention as the Ethereum and Solana price begins to show potential reversal signs. With the broader crypto market still in a slump, a subtle alert from the inventor of one of the most respected technical indicators has analysts wondering whether a major shift is about to unfold in ETH and SOL. Bollinger Inventor Signals Ethereum And Solana Price Explosion John Bollinger, technical analyst and inventor of the world-famous Bollinger Bands indicator, has shocked the broader crypto community after identifying potential “W” bottoms forming on the Ethereum and Solana charts. In his market commentary on X social media, Bollinger noted that while Bitcoin has yet to exhibit similar signals, the ETHUSD and SOLUSD pairs are shaping up in a way that demands attention. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Surge To $6,400 With New Bullish Wave, But There’s A Problem Notably, Bollinger’s cautious but bullish statement immediately drew attention from fellow market analysts. Satoshi Flipper, a well-known crypto expert, revealed that Bollinger typically makes only one such market call each year and has not issued one for Ethereum in three years. He disclosed that the last time the Bollinger Bands inventor made a similar statement was in September 2022, just before the ETH price surged from around $1,290 to nearly $4,000. Due to Bollinger’s selective and historically accurate calls, analysts see it as an early sign of a potential reversal of a downtrend or consolidation into an explosive breakout. If the inventors’ analysis proves accurate once again, both Ethereum and Solana could be sitting at the foundation of one of their strongest bull rallies Analysts Predict Bullish Targets For ETH And SOL Two separate technical analyses also highlight an optimistic outlook for the Ethereum and Solana prices. Crypto analyst Lark Davis highlighted that Solana’s chart structure appears “very constructive,” with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) approaching a momentum breakout and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) gearing up for a bullish cross. Related Reading: Solana Price At Risk Of 50% Crash To $104 After Forming This Larger Bearish Trend Davis noted that Solana’s price action is forming a clear Double Bottom, a classic reversal pattern. Should the neckline break, he projects a potential price target near $250, provided bulls can defend the 200-day EMA. With Solana trading around $192, a rally to that target would mark roughly a 30% gain. Ethereum’s technical outlook is even more dramatic. Analyst Merlijn the Trader stated on X that ETH has been developing the most explosive setup since the 2017 bull cycle, pointing to a textbook Bullish Pennant pattern on the monthly chart. Historically, such formations precede massive continuation once the price breaks above the upper boundary of the pattern. Merlijn’s chart analysis projects an eventual breakout target around $8,500, suggesting that Ethereum could set a new all-time high soon. Considering that the ETH price is sitting above $4,000, a surge to this bullish target would more than double its value, marking an impressive 110% increase.

Recent dips have been received with high-level purchases, especially in the blue-chip assets like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Chainlink. Presale projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are on a strong trend as investors seek high-potential projects. As Ethereum consolidates close to the $4,100 mark, analysts believe that the next bullish run is about to start, which may take pre-established and new altcoins to unprecedented heights, led by MAGACOIN FINANCE. Institutional Interest Builds Amid XRP ETF Anticipation After speculation once again scraped the surface last month about institutional entry into XRP through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the asset has been one of the most followed this month. Additionally, after breaking down to $2.19 earlier in the session, XRP bounced back up to $2.37, a sign of strong buying interest on the part of traders who are anticipating a near-term reversal. Analysts point out that this recovery amid uncertainty in the markets marks the fact of deep liquidity and long-term belief in the cross-border usefulness of XRP. Whale wallets have recorded consistent accumulation since early October, which means that there is a possibility of a potential breakout above the resistance level of $2.50. The market data points to the fact that after XRP breaks out above this level, the next leg of the rally could carry on towards the $2.80 – $3.00 level. Similarly, the continued relationships of Ripple with financial institutions in Africa and Asia are reinforcing the use case of the Ripple project as a global bridge. Provided that the ETF approval is realized in the upcoming quarters, XRP might witness an increase in institutional demand. Such a move would not only establish its regulatory position but also make XRP one of the best-performing assets going into 2026. Smart Money Returns to the Solana Blockchain Solana continues to see inflows, as major investors get exposed to the high-performing blockchain. Institutional participants have been drawn to the network due to its speed of transaction, scalability, and growing DeFi ecosystem. After a short correction to $170, Solana bounced back to trade near the $190-$200 level, indicating buyers are defending key liquidity zones. After asset managers like VanEck and 21Shares applied for Solana ETFs, the market has once again become bullish. The activity of developers is also increasing steadily, as indicated by network data, especially in NFT marketplaces and GameFi projects. When Solana breaks above the $200 level, technical models will suggest an upside target of $260 – $280. SOLUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: X Solana will also play a crucial role in the next market cycle as capital rotation becomes even more intense. It is a reference point to scalable blockchain ecosystems, and analysts observe that investors are diversifying into the presales, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, which replicates early Solana momentum. Accumulation Rises as LINK On-Chain Data Demand Surges Chainlink’s price action has strengthened amid a resurgence in oracle network demand. The project’s integrations across DeFi, gaming, and real-world asset (RWA) protocols continue to expand, positioning LINK as a foundational piece of blockchain infrastructure. Recently, 30 new wallets withdrew over 6.2 million LINK, valued at $116.7 million, from Binance—signaling large-scale accumulation by high-net-worth entities. LINK’s short-term outlook shows bullish momentum as the asset reclaims critical resistance near $17.50. Analysts expect a sustained move above this zone could trigger an advance toward $19.80 and $22.00. With more institutional players using Chainlink’s data feeds for tokenization and settlement systems, its long-term fundamentals remain robust. The growing integration of Chainlink in real-world applications strengthens confidence that the oracle sector could drive the next phase of blockchain adoption. Among traders diversifying portfolios, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a favored new entrant due to its transparent audits and early market traction. Avalanche Strengthening Fundamentals Support Momentum Avalanche (AVAX) is regaining market attention following renewed ecosystem growth and a surge in developer participation. The token has recovered from recent lows near $29, with strong buying pressure driving it back above $34. Analysts observe that Avalanche’s subnets are attracting enterprise-level interest, with partnerships expanding across Web3 gaming and decentralized identity sectors. Technical indicators reveal bullish divergence on the daily chart, suggesting potential continuation toward $40–$45 if momentum persists. AVAX’s scalability and interoperability continue to be defining features, making it a preferred choice for institutions seeking efficient blockchain solutions. As liquidity flows return to the altcoin market, Avalanche’s recovery aligns with the broader sentiment shift. However, analysts emphasize that new presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer high upside potential during early-stage accumulation phases. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Star of the 2025 Presale Market MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the fastest-growing presales of 2025, having raised over $17 million within weeks. The project’s structure includes verified audits from Hashex and Certik, a multi-stage presale with transparent pricing, and a roadmap that integrates DeFi and metaverse interoperability. These fundamentals have drawn both retail and institutional participants looking for credibility and long-term growth. Analysts are comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trajectory to Ethereum’s 2017 cycle, citing the combination of strong fundamentals and an expanding global community. The project’s focus on security, transparency, and real-world integration makes it stand out in a market saturated with speculative offerings. With sustained investor interest and growing social traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is viewed as one of the best altcoins to buy before the next major rally . Conclusion As Ethereum whales keep accumulating and market sentiment is turning positive, investors are gearing up for the next altseason. The existing assets, such as XRP, Solana, Chainlink, and Avalanche, are among the strongest competitors, however, the eruptive emergence of MAGACOIN FINANCE is the beginning of the era of credible presales. If current upward trends continue, MAGACOIN FINANCE could define the next successful 2025 breakout.

DOGE is currently worth over $29 billion in market cap, while BTC sits atop the pyramid with over $2.2 trillion. Both DOGE and BTC are fundamentally set up differently, but they also happen to share some history. The first takeaway that comes to mind on Dogecoin vs Bitcoin is that one is a memecoin while the other is a better store of value. But do you also know that Dogecoin is a derivative of Litecoin, which itself was created from Bitcoin’s codebase? Starting with a quick overview of Bitcoin and Dogecoin, in this article, you’ll see how both coins differ in speed, fees, supply, etc., and why DOGE may never flip BTC. Overview of Bitcoin vs Dogecoin Satoshi Nakamoto started it all when he/they created Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. Then came Litecoin, XRP, Dogecoin, and other cryptos years later. Bitcoin Satoshi introduced Bitcoin’s white paper in 2008, and it officially launched in 2009. The original idea in the white paper was for Bitcoin to serve as a decentralized digital currency for peer-to-peer online payments that works without relying on banks or governments. That narrative has somewhat shifted, with many now considering BTC as a store of value. Some even call it “digital gold” due to its fixed, finite supply. However, Bitcoin’s protocol remains true to its original trustless roots, no matter how investors choose to use it. Dogecoin Dogecoin was created from Litecoin’s codebase, and so they closely share some similarities. DOGE was launched by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in 2013 as a parody. But it turned out to become the first and largest “memecoin,” with a whole community of investors. The coin’s logo was inspired by Kabosu, a Shiba Inu dog from Japan, which died in May 2024. Since DOGE was only made as a joke, the founders stepped away from the project a few years after its inception, selling their coins and leaving its maintenance to the community and other developers. DOGE later went on to gain traction following the 2017-2018 bull run and Elon Musk’s influence. Shared History Dogecoin’s history can be traced back to Bitcoin. Its network structure is not original. For instance, DOGE shares the same decentralized model and Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism as BTC. That’s because of Litecoin. Charlie Lee forked Bitcoin’s codebase in October 2011, creating Litecoin to address perceived flaws. As a result, LTC inherited BTC’s PoW, although it uses a different algorithm than BTC. Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer then forked Litecoin’s codebase two years later to birth Dogecoin, creating a lineage with Litecoin and Bitcoin. Consensus Mechanism and Mining Dogecoin and Bitcoin both use the same Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, which requires mining. But their hashing algorithms are quite different. Bitcoin – Proof-of-Work Bitcoin uses the Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit or SHA-256 algorithm, which is more computationally demanding. SHA-256 requires specialized hardware to solve hash problems, which is why most miners today use advanced machines, especially ASIC miners, to mine new Bitcoin. The upside is that SHA-256 is much difficult to reverse-engineer or manipulate. But it’s very expensive to practice, which raises the entry barrier for small miners. Dogecoin – Proof-of-Work Dogecoin uses the Scrypt algorithm, which it inherited from Litecoin. Scrypt is a more lightweight algorithm that originally accommodated GPU/CPU users, but some Scrypt ASIC exists today. It is memory-hard, meaning it requires a large amount of fast RAM to compute hashes, allowing for faster processing and lower energy use. Dogecoin’s use of Scrypt made it possible for miners to mine DOGE and LTC coins at the same time, i.e., merge-mine. Energy Consumption and Mining Efficiency DOGE and BTC consume a considerable amount of energy, owing to their PoW mechanism. But the total energy used by Dogecoin is much lesser compared to Bitcoin. Reports put it that Dogecoin uses 1.4TWh to 4TWh of energy per year amid the merge-mining with Litecoin. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining consumes anywhere from 114 TWh to 220 TWh per year, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) estimate . Historical annualized electricity consumption of Bitcoin. Source: CBECI Block Time and Transaction Speed DOGE transactions are 10x faster than BTC transactions due to the block time. Bitcoin – 10-Minute Block Time Satoshi programmed the Bitcoin network to maintain an average block time of 10 minutes. The reason was to give new blocks enough time to propagate across the globe and also reduce the chance of orphan blocks, and stop spam/attacks. The 10-minute rule is enforced by the network’s “difficulty adjustment,” which happens every 2 weeks. It can take about 10 to 60 minutes for BTC payments to get confirmed, depending on the network’s traffic. Dogecoin – 1-Minute Block Time Dogecoin has a 1-minute block time, and because of that, DOGE transactions are usually faster. The shorter block time was deliberately chosen for near-instant micropayments, which suits the memecoin’s ethos for casual tipping. However, the quicker block time gives more chances for orphan blocks and front-running/spam transactions. Transaction Throughput and Confirmation Times Dogecoin accommodates more transactions than the Bitcoin network because of its shorter block time. It can process approximately 30 to 40 transactions per second. However, Bitcoin can only handle 3 to 7 transactions per second, which is one scalability issue that led to the launch of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which can handle 1 million transactions per second. Supply and Inflation Model Dogecoin and Bitcoin differ in their supply. DOGE has an inflationary model, while BTC is fixed. Bitcoin – Fixed Supply of 21 Million Coins BTC’s supply is fixed at 21 million, meaning only that much coin will ever be minted. The supply is hardcoded into the network and cannot be changed without forking the network, just like Litecoin, which changed its hard cap to 84 million. At the time of writing, there were a total of 19.93 million BTC in circulation. The issuance of new BTC is controlled by the process of mining and halving. New coins are minted to miners as a block reward, currently 3.125 BTC/block. The reward is halved every four years to control the issuance rate. The last halving event happened in April 2024, which reduced the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. It is projected that all 21 million BTC would have been mined around the year 2140. Dogecoin – No Supply Cap DOGE has an inflationary supply, meaning there will always be a continuous supply of new DOGE coins. There is simply no hard cap. Each year, a fixed number of 5 billion DOGE is issued and added to the circulating supply. At the time of writing, there were over 151 billion DOGE in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap data. Economic Implications: Scarcity vs Continuous Issuance Bitcoin’s fixed supply creates a sense of scarcity, which is why it’s generally considered a store of value and digital gold in today’s market. It’s also safe to say that the economics of scarcity, coupled with demand, are why many are predicting higher prices for Bitcoin in the years to come. But this is bad in a way, because it encourages people to hodl BTC rather than use it as a digital form of payment, just as Satoshi had intended. Dogecoin’s inflationary supply, on the other hand, dampens its scarcity, which dilutes the expectation of value growth or store of value from hodling. The model encourages quick spending, and so, the price of DOGE mostly rides on its utility, network adoption, and community engagement. Transaction Fees and Accessibility As you would have guessed, Dogecoin also beats Bitcoin in terms of transaction fees. It’s much cheaper to use DOGE than BTC. Bitcoin Fees – Network Congestion and Cost Volatility Data shows Bitcoin currently has an average transaction fee of 0.0000062 BTC ($0.679). Average Bitcoin transaction fee chart The fees are usually not fixed. But they can be influenced by the transaction size, or most likely, network congestion. The network can become unusable for small transactions when busy. In April 2024, the Bitcoin transaction fee spiked to as high as $128 due to congestion of the network. In 2023, the largest exchange, Binance, had to pause BTC withdrawals due to network congestion and exorbitant fees. Dogecoin Fees – Lower Fees for Microtransactions The average Dogecoin transaction fee is 0.402 DOGE ($0.079), according to BitInfoCharts. That’s almost 10x cheaper than Bitcoin. Due to the lower fees, Dogecoin is preferred for smaller payments and microtransactions. In a practical scenario, many would most likely spend DOGE as payment for $5 cup of coffee or tipping, rather than spending BTC, because it is cheaper. Ideal Use Cases The use cases for both Bitcoin and Dogecoin write themselves. People mostly use DOGE for tipping content creators, buying small digital goods, and everyday, small-scale transactions, simply because the transactions incur fewer fees, irrespective of the amount. Also, you don’t have to wait too long for an instant digital payment. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is scarce. Most people treat it as an investment, a store of value, and a hedge against inflation. It appeals to both institutional and retail investors around the world. Security and Network Strength Since Bitcoin and Dogecoin both use the PoW consensus mechanism, the strength of their networks is tied to their hash rates. Bitcoin’s Massive Hash Rate and Global Miner Network Bitcoin has a massive number of hash rates distributed around the world. Currently, the network sees an average hashrate of 1.13 Zhash per day, slightly below the 1.2667Zhash all-time high. Bitcoin hashrate historical chart The hash rate is just a measure of the combined computational power miners are contributing to the network. So, more hash rate means more strength and resilience in Bitcoin against attacks, particularly the 51% attack, where a single entity controls over half the network’s hashing power to manipulate the ledger. Another important thing to note is that the hashrate is not concentrated in one region. It’s spread around the world, which keeps the network decentralized. Dogecoin’s Reliance on Litecoin Merge Mining for Security Dogecoin currently has a hash rate of 3.41 PH/s, according to CoinWarz. Dogecoin hashrate historical chart On a normal ground, Dogecoin’s inflationary supply is not a great financial incentive for independent miners to continue securing the network in the long run. But it makes up for this with Litecoin. Since Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, it somewhat piggybacks off the Litecoin network’s substantial hash rate. That tie ensures that as long as Litecoin is secured, Dogecoin receives strong security too, against a 51% attack, than it would on its own. Long-Term Security Considerations For Bitcoin, the block reward is the key thing to watch. As the network is programmed to halve rewards every four years, it would get to a point where miners earn fewer BTC, which could affect profitability. Many could be forced to turn off their machine when the cost of mining exceeds the reward, which translates to lower hash rates and security for Bitcoin. For Dogecoin, the Litecoin network hash rate is the health factor to watch. Provided that the hash rate continues to increase, Dogecoin remains secure. Community and Use Cases The Bitcoin and Dogecoin communities contrast sharply, and they invest for different reasons. Bitcoin’s Role as Digital Gold As mentioned before, Bitcoin is perceived as the digital gold. So, the community around Bitcoin is all about investing for the long term as a store of value or hedge against inflation and devaluing local currencies. They believe that the engineered scarcity of Bitcoin will eventually lead to higher price appreciation. On-chain data shows that roughly 61% of the Bitcoin supply has not been moved for over a year. Up to 17% have not moved over the last 10 years. Dogecoin’s Community-Driven Adoption The Dogecoin community is all about memecoin. DOGE has inspired several other meme tokens that now form a $56 billion market. Other than its uses for micropayment, tipping, and regular day-to-day payment, DOGE continues to thrive on virality and largely the community’s effort. The power of the so-called “Doge Army,” social media hype, and cultural relevance have been the big drivers of DOGE price over the years. Not just DOGE. Most memecoins are driven by community efforts. Institutional Acceptance and Market Positioning Due to the economic models, Bitcoin appeals more to large corporations and institutional investors than Dogecoin, which is evident in the number of firms that hold BTC in their treasury today. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is the largest publicly traded Bitcoin firm in the world, with a total of 640,250 BTC, worth $71 billion. The company began investing in Bitcoin in 2020 primarily as a hedge against inflation. More than 145 publicly traded companies now hold BTC for similar reasons. In the same vein, Bitcoin also sees increased demand with ETFs. Institutional interest in Dogecoin is limited and mostly speculative. However, in September 2025, DOGE gained its first U.S. spot ETF , which opens the door for institutional investors to trade DOGE. Price Volatility and Market Perception Bitcoin is increasingly being perceived as a maturing asset, with the swings now influenced by macro factors. But as a memecoin, Dogecoin largely trades as a speculative bet. Bitcoin as a Macro Asset Some years back, Bitcoin was treated as an extremely volatile and speculative asset, which saw many regulators issue warnings against it. In recent times, however, Bitcoin’s price has been reflecting a maturing asset status, with institutional investors on board. The price is now largely influenced by global economics, behaving like a risk-on hedge, like tech stocks or gold during uncertainty. Dogecoin as a Speculative or Social Token The market perception of Dogecoin is mostly as a speculative social token or memecoin rather than a macro asset. In that category, it would be the go-to for many investors considering its dominance. However, Dogecoin’s price remains highly volatile. It’s often driven by market sentiment, social media trends, and community enthusiasm, rather than technical developments or macroeconomic factors. Influence of Public Figures The former CEO of Strategy, Michael Saylor, has been a big influencer, so to speak, for Bitcoin. Ever since he led the company into investing in Bitcoin, Saylor has been vocal about Bitcoin as a superior asset against inflation. He participated in several crypto conferences and continues to tweet about the largest crypto almost every day. For Dogecoin, it was Elon Musk who played a similar role. The price of DOGE soared on several occasions after the world’s richest man tweeted or praised the memecoin. DOGE also went on a massive rally after Musk acquired Twitter, in the hope that the social media app would incorporate DOGE as a tipping and payment coin. Technical Comparison Summary Table The table below summarizes the fundamental differences between Dogecoin and Bitcoin. Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Dogecoin (DOGE) Launch Year 2009 2013 Consensus Proof-of-Work (SHA-256) Proof-of-Work (Scrypt) Block Time 10 minutes 1 minute Supply Limit 21 million Infinite (5B/year inflation) Fees Higher Lower Mining Independent Merge-mined with Litecoin Use Case Store of value Peer-to-peer payments The Future of Bitcoin and Dogecoin As the crypto market continues to gain broader acceptance from institutions, with many firms declaring their digital asset treasuries, Bitcoin will become a more pronounced player in global finance, and we could see Dogecoin explore more utility-driven developments. Bitcoin’s Role in Institutional Finance The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs drew massive institutional flow to Bitcoin. The U.S. President is now pushing to allow 401(k)s to invest in Bitcoin. Major banks like JPMorgan are looking to allow clients to trade Bitcoin by next year. All these indicate that institutions are opening up to Bitcoin, and in the years ahead, the largest crypto will become more and more involved in Wall Street and global markets. Dogecoin’s Evolution Through Community and Developers Dogecoin could begin to see institutional inflows from the many ETFs in the pipeline and companies announcing their digital asset treasuries. We could also see the Dogecoin community and developers explore more utility projects, just like they did with the launch of Dogechain, a layer 2 network aimed at bringing smart contracts into the Dogecoin ecosystem. Potential Integration into Payments (e.g., X/Twitter) There is also a big possibility that Elon Musk will eventually add support for DOGE as a payment option on X (formerly Twitter). There have been rumors about this. Musk occasionally replied to comments referencing Dogecoin in a payment context on X, but there have not been any official statements to confirm that it will happen.",Learn Crypto: Beginner Guides,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|DOGE|LTC|MINING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-20 23:15:29

However, after several considerations, several of them have lowered their earlier predictions following new trade deals, which are lessening their exposure to these tariffs. Trump ignited a trade war which resulted in a significant increase in US tariffs to their highest rates ever recorded since the 1930s. Additionally, he has frequently threatened to impose even more taxes on US trading partners. Still, this uncertainty that previously held back many businesses is beginning to fade. This has enabled executives to better estimate expenses and establish effective business strategies such as some price hikes. Trump’s trade deals sparks hope for the stabilization of global firms Earlier, an analysis from a reliable source that analyzed various statements from companies, regulatory filings, and earnings calls from July 16 to September 30 revealed that firms had anticipated a total financial impact ranging from $21 billion to $22.9 billion for 2025. For 2026, they had estimated a total financial effect of around $15 billion. When global companies reported the overall amount exceeding $35 billion, reports highlighted that this figure was slightly above the $34 billion recorded in May after Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs in April which interfered with the international supply chain. However, it is worth noting that this increment primarily reflects Toyota’s estimate of $9.5 billion. Many other companies, on the other hand, have drastically reduced their previous pessimistic forecasts after Trump struck lower-rate trade deals with Japan and the EU. These prediction figures consist of both annual and partial-year estimates from a group of about 60 companies that had shared some of their data. Examples of companies that reduced their predictions include: French spirit producers Remy Cointreau and Pernod Ricard. Both arrived at the decision to lower their expectations for the effects of US tariffs after the EU agreement. Meanwhile, Sony reduced its forecast in August. Apart from striking trade deals with US trading partners, Trump also made some exceptions like only around a third of Brazil’s exports would encounter a 50% tariff. With this positive outlook, the Chief Executive Officer of Stellantis, Antonio Filosa acknowledged that tariffs are becoming clearer. He further highlighted that they believe these tariffs will just be another factor they need to run their business, asserting that they will be prepared for that during a mid-October interview. Afterwards, Filosa shared new details regarding a $13 billion investment over four years in US manufacturing. Interestingly, Stellantis had cautioned about a loss of 1.5 billion euros in July this year. Andrew Wilson raises concerns surrounding Trump’s tariff policies Andrew Wilson, Deputy Secretary General of the International Chamber of Commerce expressed his belief that there is a feeling that they have attained some sort of stable point with the existence of certain trade deals. However, Wilson raised concerns that there will still be a lot more complexity and substantial uncertainties. He gave an example of Trump’s recent shift in stance when he suggested the imposition of an additional 100% tariff on China, but later stated that these tariffs would not be sustainable and blamed Beijing for recent trade conflicts between the two nations. In the meantime, S&P 500 firms are predicted to encounter an earnings growth rate of about 9.3% from July through September. This percentage is lower than the 13.8% growth in the second quarter, according to LSEG data. This slowdown is primarily due to the US tech sector, which is being driven by major investments in AI. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index is expected to rise by a mere 0.5%, down from 4% last quarter. The biggest challenges are hitting companies that rely on trade with countries that lack trade agreements.

The estimate comes as discussions around Ripple’s rumored plan to raise $1 billion for an XRP treasury gain traction, reigniting debate about the potential for a supply squeeze in the market. Ripple’s Proposed $1B Buyback Sparks Renewed Interest According to a recent Bloomberg report, Ripple is said to be working on securing $1 billion in funding to establish an XRP-focused treasury initiative. The company reportedly intends to use a portion of the XRP held in its escrow to support this effort. The news has generated considerable attention within the XRP community, particularly among investors who believe a large-scale buyback could tighten supply and influence prices. The conversation was further amplified when a well-known community commentator, Baba Cugs, revisited his earlier theory suggesting that a major price breakout could only occur once retail investors have been largely bought out. Several other XRP advocates have echoed this idea, arguing that institutional participation has been steadily increasing while retail involvement continues to decline. 500M to 1.9B Retail XRP Remaining Gonna need more than Ripple's 1B At $5 XRP, $1B buys 200M XRP At $7.5….. 133.33M XRP $10…….100M $15…….66.6M $20….. 50M XRP Sample above $5B buys 550M XRP. If it's closer to 1.9B Retail will need $17.7B. And that's if all sell. https://t.co/V2pn279oSe — XRP_Liquidity (Larsen/Britto/Escrow/ODL/RLUSD) (@XRPwallets) October 19, 2025 Edoardo Farina, the founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has also remarked that small investors are being phased out of the market as larger financial entities acquire greater control over circulating supply. This sentiment reflects a growing belief that institutional demand could eventually dominate the XRP landscape. Estimating the Retail Supply and Buyout Cost Another community analyst, known by the pseudonym XRP Liquidity, regularly tracks wallet data to monitor holdings across different investor classes. His findings suggest that retail investors currently control between 500 million and 1.9 billion XRP. Based on this range, he argues that Ripple’s proposed $1 billion buyback would not be sufficient to absorb all remaining retail supply. At the current trading price of approximately $2.45, purchasing 500 million XRP would require around $1.2 billion, while acquiring 1.9 billion XRP would cost nearly $4.6 billion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, the analyst emphasized that this calculation assumes all tokens would be sold at the current market price, an unlikely scenario given that many holders would seek to sell only at higher valuations. Projected Selling Levels Among Retail Investors To account for differing selling preferences, the analyst modeled a tiered scenario. If some investors begin taking profits around the $5 mark, a $1 billion investment would acquire roughly 200 million XRP. At $7.50, the same capital would buy about 133 million XRP, and at $10, it would purchase 100 million. As prices climb, the available quantity continues to decrease. A $1 billion buy order at $15 would secure only about 66 million XRP, and at $20, it would capture around 50 million. Cumulatively, buying 550 million XRP across these tiers would require about $5 billion. Should retail investors collectively hold closer to 1.9 billion XRP, clearing them out completely would take an estimated $17.7 billion, assuming all tokens were sold at these higher levels. Community commentators such as Baba Cugsy have suggested that once institutional buyers absorb most of the remaining retail supply, XRP could experience an accelerated price movement due to reduced availability. XRP Liquidity has also speculated that institutions might intentionally drive the price toward $20 to encourage remaining retail investors to exit. These projections illustrate how supply concentration and institutional accumulation are shaping discussions within the XRP community.

This drop put the market in “extreme fear” for the first time since April, leading many observers to speculate on how long the bull cycle will last, with one warning that more losses are coming. A Critical Line in the Sand In his “Big Sunday Report,” crypto trader Dr. Profit told his over 439,000 followers on X that they should have used the 115–125k zone to build short positions, warning that the market is now “extremely bearish.” He wrote that he had been “flagging” that area “to add shorts and sell” since the end of August, noting that BTC reached “126k, 1k more than my max top scenario of 125k” before dropping on October 10, when it went as low as $101,000 on some trading platforms. The analyst singled out market psychology as central, writing plainly that: “Markets are driven by greed, currently I have rarely seen so much greed in the market as now, and I am speaking about both the bear and bullish side.” His setup hinges on a specific technical threshold: a decisive break below $101,700. “By breaking below $101,700 Bitcoin will break below its magic bull market line which would finally confirm a bear market and silence those bulls once for all!” wrote Dr. Profit. The post also talks about liquidity mechanics as a cause, saying that recent late-entering shorts, liquidations near $116,500, and the packed positioning of short-term holders have made the price structure weak. Furthermore, the analyst used the $112,500 short-term holder realized price to show that a lot of recent buyers had lost money and could put more pressure on the market if BTC drops another 5–10%. Sentiment, Macro Events and Market Structure This weekend’s price action echoed that caution. At the time of writing, CoinGecko data showed that the main cryptocurrency was trading around $110,700, which is up 3.5% in the last 24 hours but down the same amount over the past seven days. The 14-day drop is close to 10.6%, and the 30-day dip is smaller, at 4.1%. Doctor Profit’s warnings arrive as broader sentiment has turned sour. On October 17, reports indicated that the Fear & Greed Index was at its lowest point since April and that about $900 billion in market value had been lost in the past few days. Some analysts say that the medium-term uptrend is still going strong if key supports hold, while others say that liquidity operations linked to ETFs and leveraged positions make the market open to big directional moves.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.2779 Market Cap $449.07M Trading Volume $6.017M Circulating Supply 1.615B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.2823 24-hour Low $0.2725 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.64% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.3663 14-Day RSI 35.83 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 29 (Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $0.3878 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown FLOW’s 1-day chart shows tightening Bollinger Band. The 4-hour chart confirms sideways consolidation. FLOW’s support is present at $0.27. Flow coin 1-day price analysis On the 1-day chart for Oct 20, 2025, FLOW is sitting at $0.278, barely moving but showing a clear slowdown in selling. The Bollinger Bands are tightening between $0.226 (lower band) and $0.321 (upper band), with price hovering between the mid-band and the lower band. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains in negative territory, but the bars are shrinking, showing that bearish momentum is losing force. Volume remains light, around 586K, suggesting most participants are waiting for confirmation before acting. As long as the price holds above $0.27, FLOW looks to be in accumulation. A daily close above $0.285 would likely trigger a retest of $0.30, followed by $0.32 if buying interest strengthens. If $0.27 gives way, the $0.24 price level becomes the next likely support. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour chart paints a calmer, more neutral picture. FLOW trades around $0.277, with the Alligator lines (jaw $0.277, teeth $0.277, lips $0.276) now overlapping, meaning the market is directionless in the short term. This crossover phase often precedes a stronger move once new volume enters. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI at 47.8 is perfectly neutral, confirming the lack of momentum. The recent uptick stalled right below $0.28, showing mild resistance there. If FLOW can break through $0.28, it may push for a short-term climb toward $0.285–$0.29. If it slips under $0.275, traders can expect a quick drop back to $0.27 support. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3227 SELL SMA 5 $0.3019 SELL SMA 10 $0.2953 SELL SMA 21 $0.3313 SELL SMA 50 $0.3663 SELL SMA 100 $0.3796 SELL SMA 200 $0.3878 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3333 SELL EMA 5 $0.3528 SELL EMA 10 $0.3724 SELL EMA 21 $0.3819 SELL EMA 50 $0.3829 SELL EMA 100 $0.3870 SELL EMA 200 $0.4253 SELL What to expect from Flow? FLOW is clearly basing around $0.27 after a sharp decline, with sellers losing control and volatility drying up. Both timeframes suggest consolidation before the next impulse. If buyers reclaim $0.285, expect a short-term lift toward $0.30–$0.32; otherwise, the coin will likely keep ranging quietly between $0.27–$0.28 until momentum returns. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

The initiative rewards the early community members while generating new focus on the growing ecosystem of the project. The bonus comes as demand for new presale tokens has surged throughout the crypto market. By providing more rewards to first-phase participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE hopes to create momentum and investor confidence as it prepares its next phase of funding. MAGACOIN FINANCE Introduces Patriot50X Bonus for Early Supporters The Patriot50X bonus gives early buyers an instant 50% token boost for every purchase made before the end of each round. This limited-time reward is part of the project’s strategy to attract strong holders who believe in its long-term roadmap. Each presale phase runs with a tiered pricing structure, which means that prices increase as rounds close. This approach encourages early participation and offers transparency. The Patriot50X event maximizes this system by providing additional value at the earliest entry point, allowing investors to lock up more tokens before the next price increase. Project developers confirmed that the bonus will only be active for the initial stages to avoid oversupply and retain the scarcity of tokens. This design guarantees that value increases naturally as the demand increases. Growing Investor Interest in the Presale Investor activities around MAGACOIN FINANCE are still accelerating. The project’s presale rounds have been closing faster than expected as more participants have joined through its verified platform. Early traction is fueled by clear communication, secure smart contracts, and a strong commitment to transparency. Market watchers say that the structured rollout and open reporting of MAGACOIN FINANCE have built trust in a time when many presales struggle with credibility. Each stage has fixed token prices, allocation limits, and timeframes, which help buyers track their progress and verify results. This openness has brought in a mix of retail traders and long-term holders. Many view the project’s transparent model as a sign of maturity that is rarely seen with early-stage crypto launches. Why the 50% Bonus Matters for Long-Term Holders The Patriot50X bonus gives early investors a head start when it comes to potential returns. Those who purchase before future rounds pay a lower effective price per token, magnified by the 50% reward. Analysts say such incentives help to reduce short-term speculation and to encourage investors to hold through multiple phases. For long-term holders, initial accumulation can have a compounding effect once the token is listed on exchanges. The rising price model means that the tokens obtained under the Patriot50X bonus can already appreciate before trading starts. Moreover, the design is also advantageous to community development. To early adopters, a reward is visible, which builds loyalty, as the project seeks a listing and inclusion in the broader ecosystem. Community Response and Market Outlook The response of the community to the announcement has been overwhelmingly positive. There is a notable upsurge in social channels where new investors learn about the presale. Several users call the 50-percent bonus fair in contrast to other campaigns that water down the worth or have vague wording. According to analysts, the bonus shows that the MAGACOIN FINANCE team trusts its roadmap. The project indicates its long-term orientation with its community by giving more tokens to dedicated supporters, which is an essential quality of sustainability. Since the market is regaining its confidence after the recent volatility, presales with transparent mechanisms are taking a revitalized focus. MAGACOIN FINANCE seems to be in a good position in this trend, with verifiable smart-contract data and appealing rewards to investors. Final Outlook The Patriot50X bonus is another milestone in the history of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which supports its growth-first approach and model that is based on investors. The project will help build strength in community participation and market presence by giving early buyers additional tokens. Having transparent pricing, rapid rounding, and increasing investor reach, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains one of the most watched crypto projects to follow in 2025. To early participants, the 50% Patriot50X offer is not only a bonus, but also a good opportunity to settle on a stronger position before the next stage commences.

Federal and state traffic laws require all vehicles to stop and remain stationary when they see a school bus with red lights flashing, stop arm extended, and crossing control arm deployed while unloading students. However, video footage shows one of Waymo’s autonomous vehicles maneuvering around one such school bus. NHTSA scrutinizes Waymo’s robotaxis The probe is the latest scrutiny of self-driving systems by regulators reviewing how driverless technologies affect other road users. This episode comes after a video of an incident in Georgia involving a Waymo car and a stationary school bus that had its red lights flashing and stop arm deployed. According to a report , the Waymo vehicle initially paused, but then it maneuvered around the bus, passing the extended stop arm even though students were still disembarking. Waymo’s automated driving system is currently logging 2 million miles per week, according to the agency, and it has confirmed that the “likelihood of other prior similar incidents is high.” While the statement is concerning, some reassurance has come from the company as it claimed to be working hard to make improvements that will roll out with the next update. How Waymo has responded to the probe Given the novelty of what Waymo is trying to accomplish in the self-driving car sector, probes and occasions that encourage them are to be expected. However, the company is not relenting and a Waymo spokesperson has claimed it has “already developed and implemented improvements related to stopping for school buses and will land additional software updates in our next software release.” The company has also reiterated a commitment to creating products that prioritize child safety, explaining that it had “approached the school bus from an angle where the flashing lights and stop sign were not visible and drove slowly around the front of the bus before driving past it, keeping a safe distance from children.” It is crucial to note that the vehicle involved had been equipped with Waymo’s fifth-generation Automated Driving System and was operating without a human safety driver at the time of the incident. There were also no injuries reported in the incident, but it has highlighted the issues AV perception systems face in edge cases like those involving obscured signals. The company currently operates over 1,500 robotaxis in cities like Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin, and has plans to expand to Nashville in 2026 via a partnership with Lyft. Waymo has already logged over 100 million rider-only miles in 2025, but rare errors like this can amplify safety concerns for public trust and policy.

In a recent post, he remarked that maintaining a position in XRP through repeated market downturns takes either extraordinary conviction or, as he joked, “a touch of mental illness.” His comments shed light on how emotional endurance plays a major role in long-term crypto investing. The Psychological Test of Long-Term Holding According to Van Code, many investors like to believe they would remain patient through market turbulence to achieve massive gains. However, he noted that this belief rarely holds when faced with real volatility. Most traders tend to sell once profits appear substantial enough, even if larger gains may lie ahead. Every talks about ""oh if I bought BTC for $1 id because billionaire today"". What you fail to realize is 99% of people would sell even at $100. Or what about when it dumped from $10k down to $1k then back up again. You really have to almost be mentally unstable to hold from $1… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 19, 2025 He illustrated his point with Bitcoin’s historical trajectory. When Bitcoin was worth less than $1 in its early days, few could have imagined its rise above $110,000. Yet, Van Code argued that most people who claim they would have held it until now would likely have exited early, perhaps around $100, once they felt they had made enough profit. Evidence supports his claim. Several early Bitcoin holders who once owned large sums have sold after years of inactivity, cashing out millions or billions of dollars. Meanwhile, others famously exited too soon, such as the early user who spent 10,000 BTC on two pizzas. Van Code emphasized that maintaining a long-term position through dramatic market reversals, such as Bitcoin’s past crashes of over 80%, requires more than confidence. It demands psychological resilience that few investors possess. Could Investors Realistically Hold XRP to $1,000 or Beyond? Van Code applied the same reasoning to XRP holders who publicly claim they will not sell until the token reaches $1,000 or even $10,000 . He believes that, in reality, most would take profits much earlier if life-changing sums were on the line. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Predictions of XRP reaching $1,000 are not new. Some analysts, including projections from Changelly, suggest the token could potentially achieve that price by 2040 under ideal conditions. However, with XRP currently below $3, maintaining a position for over a decade would be mentally demanding, especially given crypto’s unpredictable price patterns. Van Code pointed to XRP’s 2018 collapse, when it lost over 95% of its value after reaching $3, as a reminder of how quickly optimism can turn into panic. The Challenge of Emotional Discipline Another long-term XRP investor, known as TheXFactor33, agreed with Van Code’s assessment. He stated that staying invested through multiple downturns requires “an unhealthy amount of stubbornness.” Having held XRP for more than eight years, he admitted that conviction is often tested during extended bear markets but insisted that emotional control is what separates long-term holders from short-term traders. In a follow-up discussion, Van Code revealed that he had already mentally detached from his XRP holdings. “The money no longer exists on my balance sheet,” he said, adding that he has no plans to sell even if XRP were to hit $10,000. Instead, his focus is on preserving the asset for long-term financial goals, such as securing property for his children. This perspective shows that achieving exceptional returns is not solely about market timing but also about emotional discipline. Van Code’s comments highlight how enduring extreme volatility over many years is a rare trait that only a small percentage of investors can sustain.

Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bull Run Over? Analyst Sees Echoes Of 2021 Price reclaimed the $190–$193 area after a sharp bounce from trendline support, with traders now eyeing a clean break over $200 to flip momentum. On the charts, Solana remains inside a descending channel of lower highs and lows, but a sustained move above $202–$211 (a confluence of the 20/50-day EMAs and key Fibonacci levels) would mark a structure shift and open upside targets at $221–$222, then $235 and $250. SOL's price records small gains on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Volume Pops, Open Interest Climbs, Institutions Accumulate Bullish undercurrents are building beneath the price. On-chain and market data show trading volumes surging to multi-month highs, while futures open interest has pushed above $8billion, signaling stronger participation and the potential for a larger directional move when volatility expands. Spot flows turned positive, with close to $31.7million in net inflows recently pointing to accumulation at mid-range levels. Institutional and corporate interest remains a durable pillar for Solana. A recent Grayscale analysis highlights the network’s high throughput, low fees, and expanding developer base. Meanwhile, ARK Invest reported $223 million in Q3 network revenue, ranking among the highest in the blockchain industry. Additionally, corporate treasuries across digital-asset firms collectively hold over 20 million SOL, underscoring long-term institutional commitment. Staking yields of around 7% annually continue to attract holders, while scaling initiatives like Firedancer aim to improve throughput and network resilience. Catalyst Watch: $200 Reclaim, Solana ETF Headlines, and Network Growth Near term, the market wants confirmation. A daily close above $202–$211 would validate a trend reversal and strengthen the case for a measured grind toward $235–$250. Analysts also flag ETF progress and regulatory headlines as potential catalysts, alongside macro risk appetite driven by rates and liquidity. Fundamentally, Solana’s momentum is buoyed by DeFi/NFT activity, rising DEX volumes, and enterprise experiments in payments and DePIN.

53432481,610077,1761004850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53432481.jpeg,"Bitcoin Bounces Back Over $110K After Massive ETF Outflows, Is the Next Bull Run Starting?",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bounces-back-over-110k-massive-etf-outflows/,"Bitcoin (BTC) jumped back above $110,000 on Monday, erasing part of last week’s slide even as U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs posted their second-largest weekly net outflows on record ($1.2 billion). The swift rebound, from lows near $103,700, has traders asking whether the market just completed a “controlled deleveraging” and is now basing for the next advance. Ether reclaimed $4,000 alongside broader crypto green shoots, aided by cooling trade-war headlines and growing odds of additional Fed rate cuts. Short term, BTC is attempting to hold the $107,000–$110,000 support band. A clean break and hold above $112,000–$115,500 would strengthen the bullish case and set sights on $120,000–$123,000. Institutions Still Bullish; Rare BTC–Gold Signals Flash “Bottom” Despite the outflows, institutional conviction looks resilient. A new Coinbase survey found 67% of institutions are bullish on Bitcoin over the next three to six months, citing improving liquidity, robust ETF infrastructure, and stablecoin usage near record highs. Macro tailwinds are supportive, with markets now pricing in further Fed easing, a trend that has historically redirected capital from cash and money-market funds toward risk assets. On-chain and cross-asset signals add weight. CryptoQuant’s Joao Wedson flagged rare bottom readings in the BTC-to-gold ratio oscillator, levels that previously preceded strong recoveries. Separately, JP Morgan’s framework values BTC materially higher versus gold, mapping to a potential $165,000 by 2025 if the relationship normalizes. Short-term holder MVRV Bollinger signals are also in “oversold” territory, seen earlier at $49,000 and $74,000 before subsequent rallies, supporting the notion that recent weakness was an accumulation phase, not a top. Bitcoin (BTC) Levels, Risks, and the Road to a New Leg Higher Technically, Bitcoin bulls want to defend $107,000–$110,000 and flip $112,000–$115,500 into support. Above there, momentum traders eye $120,000–$123,000 and the prior ATH zone near $126K. Funding and open interest have cooled, reducing the risk of another forced-liquidation cascade. Regardless, skeptics point to rising-wedge overhangs and headline risk (trade tensions, data shocks), while gold’s record run fuels the “digital-gold vs. gold” debate. The bounce above $110,000, despite heavy ETF redemptions, suggests strong dip-buying and improving liquidity. If macro conditions cooperate and BTC can reclaim the mid-$110,000s with volume, the market may be transitioning from “reset” to re-accumulation, laying groundwork for a fresh bull leg into late 2025.

The energy in Q4 2025 feels electric as altcoins keep outperforming predictions, and MoonBull ($MOBU) now joins the spotlight as the best crypto to buy this week . MoonBull ($MOBU) has entered the market with unmatched buzz. With Ripple and Hyperliquid pushing confidence back into altcoins, this project’s tokenomics, staking power, and community-driven design are shaping the crypto conversation this week and beyond. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Best Crypto to Buy This Week With Bold Potential MoonBull ($MOBU) is turning heads across Q4 2025 as the best crypto to buy this week . Its architecture, called “Mobunomics,” is built to reward both small and large holders. The tokenomics split drives value by allocating 50% to its stage-based launch, 20% to staking, and 11% to referral programs, maximizing scarcity and rewards simultaneously. Every trade enhances stability through 2% liquidity addition, 2% reflections to holders, and 1% token burn, ensuring long-term price appreciation. Built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, MoonBull ($MOBU) provides a secure and liquid ecosystem ready for DeFi integration. The governance system (launching at Stage 12) gives every holder equal voting rights, with 1 token = 1 vote. This community-first transparency, paired with its structured 23-stage rollout, is exactly why experts are calling it the best crypto to buy this week. MoonBull Presale Gains: Why the Best Crypto to Buy This Week Is Surging MoonBull’s presale performance has stunned the market. Currently in its 5th stage at $0.00006584, it has already raised over $450K with more than 1,400 holders. Early participants have seen an ROI of 163.36%, and the listing price of $0.00616 suggests a potential ROI of over 9,256% from Stage 5. With a 27.40% price increase per stage, momentum is undeniable. An example says it all: a $10,000 entry at Stage 5 equals 151,883,353.58 tokens, valued at $935,601.46 at listing. Combine this with 15% referral rewards and 95% APY staking (Stage 10 onwards), and MoonBull ($MOBU) stands as the best crypto to buy this week for those looking for both passive rewards and explosive growth. Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction: $1 Billion Buyback Sparks Optimism Ripple (XRP) is making history in October 2025 after announcing plans to raise at least $1 billion to buy back XRP through a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). This marks one of the largest corporate treasury fundraises in crypto history, signaling Ripple’s massive confidence in XRP’s future. The XRP token currently holds a market value of $13.8 billion, ranking it the fifth-largest cryptocurrency globally. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, confirmed the move as part of a strategy to enter the $120T corporate treasury payments market. This news strengthened market sentiment, pushing XRP price prediction models higher for Q4 2025. Many community members see the buyback as a bold attempt to stabilize XRP’s long-term price and assert its dominance in cross-border payments. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price News: HIP-3 Upgrade Ignites Trading Activity Hyperliquid (HYPE) is gaining major traction following its HIP-3 permissionless perpetuals upgrade, allowing users to create custom perpetual contracts without approvals. This update has significantly boosted on-chain volume and interest, turning the decentralized exchange into a top contender in DeFi this October 2025. The upgrade introduced new composability mechanics, meaning market participants can combine DeFi tools like lending, derivatives, and AMMs into a single custom setup. According to Sentora data, HYPE trading activity has reached multi-billion daily volumes. The HIP-3 model has made HYPE a standout performer, and current HYPE price news suggests the token could maintain strong momentum throughout Q4 2025. Final Thoughts: Ripple (XRP) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) Hold Steady While MoonBull ($MOBU) Leads the Race Ripple (XRP) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) have made powerful moves this October, restoring faith in DeFi projects and altcoin resilience. Yet, the best crypto to buy this week remains MoonBull ($MOBU) thanks to its structured growth and exceptional ROI potential. The MoonBull presale at $0.00006584 offers a limited-time entry for early buyers, promising a strong upside toward its listing price of $0.00616. With a 15% referral reward, a 95% APY staking system, and robust tokenomics, community members are positioning themselves now before the next price hike. It’s shaping up to be a defining month for MoonBull believers.

Announcing the plan at the inaugural Regional Investment Summit in Birmingham on Tuesday, Reeves will outline how she plans to end “pointless paperwork” and “unnecessary form-filling” faced by small businesses but committed to delivering transparency and certainty for businesses around mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The Treasury’s proposals are part of a wider drive to boost growth by cutting back on regulatory entanglements, according to the government. This development follows as the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) appeals to Reeves to seize the November budget and make substantial amendments on current tax law. In an October 13 news release, the think tank said this reform is significant in that it will allow Reeves to raise more money while mitigating the negative economic impacts. As for the IFS’s advice to the chancellor, officials at the London-based research institute cautioned Reeves against raising the current rate of tax in order to raise those extra funds (some 30 billion pounds, or about $40 billion) that she needs to meet her goals for boosting public finances. “What we really do not want in November is the encouragement of aimless changes and half-hearted solutions,” said Isaac Delestre, a senior research economist at the IFS. Delestre views November’s budget as a chance for real progress. Therefore, he urges the chancellor to use this budget to establish a more sensible tax system. CMA faces overhaul as Treasury pushes for faster, fairer M&A reviews Reeves will announce that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will undergo significant structural changes to improve efficiency and accountability. These are replacing its current panel-based decision-making with a board committee structure and carrying out detailed “phase 2” merger probes in-house rather than outsourcing them to independent experts. Any changes would have to undergo consultation and result in new legislation. The chancellor has made little secret of her impatience with regulators recently boasting that she had “got rid” of the chair of the CMA and plans to “take out” more as part of her pro-growth agenda. £10 billion investment drive unveiled at Birmingham summit The summit, described as last year’s overseas counterpart that attracted £63 billion of foreign investment into the country, is bringing around 350 business leaders, mayors and investors to Edgbaston cricket ground. Sponsored by Eon, HSBC, KPMG and Lloyds it will see bosses from British Land, Hammerson, Deutsche Bank, Kraft Heinz and Morgan Stanley attend alongside figures from West Bromwich Albion, Birmingham City FC as well as the Birmingham Royal Ballet. The government is expected to unveil £10 billion in new private investment, including a £6.5 billion injection from U.S. real estate firm Welltower into the care home sector. The Crown Estate will also announce a project expected to unlock £4.5 billion in value through land purchases at Harwell East science park, paving the way for new manufacturing spaces and 400 homes. Industry leaders have welcomed the Harwell East project, with CATCH UK, a chemical industry group, emphasizing the need for “urgent corrective action” to ensure domestic producers remain competitive. Meanwhile, the National Wealth Fund (NWF) will reveal £104 million in financing for clean energy projects, including onshore and offshore wind developments in Norfolk and Orkney and a heat network in Hull.

While the SPAC listing that Blockchain.com is reportedly considering would provide the company with additional capital flexibility and exposure following its previous downturns, it would also place the firm under increased scrutiny from regulators and investors. Blockchain.com considers listing publicly through SPAC merger Blockchain.com, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers, is reportedly considering going public through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), according to sources cited in reports. Blockchain.com was founded in 2011 and has been one of the oldest players in the crypto ecosystem, offering trading, wallet, and custodial services to millions of users worldwide. Its early start allowed it to build a large customer base and survive multiple market cycles. The company has reportedly appointed an advisor and held discussions about a possible SPAC deal. Blockchain.com has not yet made a final decision and details such as timing or valuation have not been disclosed. Blockchain.com has long held the goal of becoming a publicly traded company. When the firm appointed Goldman Sachs veteran Justin Evans as chief financial officer (CFO) in February, Evans said Blockchain.com was “taking the necessary steps to be a public company, if and when the public markets are available.” In addition to Evans, the company recently hired Mike Wilcox, the former CFO at Velocity Global, as chief operating officer (COO). The company’s use of a SPAC would offer a quicker and less complex path to the public markets than a traditional initial public offering (IPO). SPACs are blank-check companies created specifically to acquire existing businesses and they have recently regained popularity among crypto and fintech firms. Crypto IPO wave grows despite market volatility Blockchain.com has experienced the market’s volatility with its valuation rising to $5.2B in March 2021, and then to $14B in the next year in 2022, only to have taken a nosedive to $7B by November of 2023 due to falling crypto prices, lower trading activity, and regulatory uncertainty. However, the crypto industry has rebounded in 2025, supported by regulatory clarity and the institutional adoption of blockchain-based financial services. This recovery has renewed the interest in public listing ambitions among major players. In September, the U.S.-based exchange Gemini completed its IPO, pricing shares at $28 and closing its first trading day up 14.3% at $32, valuing the firm at roughly $3.3B. Similarly, Bullish, another cryptocurrency exchange, made its market debut in August, pricing shares at $37 and seeing them soar 83% to $68 by day’s end giving the firm a $10B fully diluted market capitalization. Meanwhile, Kraken, one of the largest global exchanges, is reportedly preparing for a traditional IPO as early as the first quarter of 2026. In September, Kraken raised $500M in a funding round that valued the company at $15B. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

According to him, independent and trustworthy statistics are crucial particularly for central banks, referring to them as “the backbone of sound monetary policy.” This comes as Nagel said that Europe must stop acting timidly in its trade relationship with China and start defending its own economic interests “in a more offensive way” during a financial gathering in Washington, Nagel said, “China needs Europe more than Europe needs China. We are a strong economy. We are four hundred fifty million people… So we should play the European card in a more offensive way.” According to the economist the continent should not rely on others to protect its markets. “The most important market for the European is Europe itself,” the ECB member said. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Trump’s on-and-off-again tariffs on China this year have led to a new wave of retaliation from Beijing, forcing Chinese exporters to redirect goods to markets such as Europe, where they are often sold under local production costs. Nagel points out the risks associated with central banks failing to function independently Nagel noted that trustworthy statistics were facing challenges lately. This happens when elected officials begin to openly question the reliability of key economic data that does not match the government’s view. Following these claims, the ECB member acknowledged that such allegations are powerful and replacing individuals who share unwanted information brings about even greater consequences. His remarks were made at an event in New York, following US president Donald Trump’s dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner due to disappointing job numbers and significant changes to previous data. Moreover, reports from sources highlighted that Trump frequently criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and tried to get rid of Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Regarding this report, Nagel cautioned against making decisions about monetary policy based on “political convenience” instead of careful economic analysis. He also mentioned that history clearly illustrates risks such as loss of public trust, financial chaos, and rampant inflation when central banks fail to function independently. Nagel expresses satisfaction with the ECB’s current monetary policy When the ECB developed their current monetary policy, Nagel expressed his satisfaction with the decision . He stated that he believed there was no need to make adjustments unless new data indicate a shift in the economic outlook. Regarding the situation, the president of the Bundesbank pointed out that he was very confident that the central bank is closing to its 2% price target. He added that he was not too worried about the bank missing this goal for a long time. “I feel quite comfortable with our current position,” Nagel stated during the IMF’s annual meetings in Washington. He further highlighted that if new information comes in that changes his view, then he will be open to adjusting his thoughts. However, for now, Nagel mentioned that he thinks they are in a good spot. Meanwhile, with inflation nearing the target and the economy proving resilience against challenges such as trade-related problems and wars, most policy makers are comfortable with current interest rates. Earlier this month, investors and economists anticipated that it is unlikely there will be another rate cut this year, despite eight cuts already in this cycle. This prediction was made after Nagel remarked that it would require a lot to shift his view that the ECB’s approach is suitable. On the other hand, some policy makers, such as Francois Villeroy de Galhau of France, have suggested that the bank should not rule out further cuts. They think the risks to growth and inflation are still greater.

While DOGE remains one of crypto’s most recognized names, its momentum is fading as investors search for what crypto to buy next with higher growth potential. That growing curiosity has brought Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into the spotlight, a DeFi project currently in Phase 6 of its presale, where over 70% of tokens have already sold out at $0.035, raising more than $17.65 million. With its dual-lending model that merges Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract systems, Mutuum Finance is being hailed by traders as the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2025.

The meme-coin now trades around $0.184, which is a critical support level that will be the deciding factor in its future direction. As long as bulls hold this level, a short-term rally towards $0.22–$0.25 is to be expected; but a clean breakdown of support will continue the bear trend and welcome deeper correction. As DOGE’s price action remains uncertain, investor attention is already starting to flow into newer opportunities in the market, with soon-to-be-listed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) flying under the radar, capturing more attention before the next big crypto cycle. For traders evaluating what crypto to buy, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming a standout option amid growing DeFi innovation.

Exchange Flows Show Withdrawals Based on exchange records, major centralized platforms recorded a net outflow of roughly 21,000 BTC over the past week. Coinbase Pro and Binance were named among those with the biggest withdrawals, showing about 15,000 BTC and 12,000 BTC moved off exchanges, respectively. Traders interpret such flows in different ways: some see accumulation into private wallets, others see funds repositioned by large traders.

In addition to SOL recovery, recoveries in Cardano and Hyperliquid were also steady with each recovering important support levels. This recovery has come about with an accumulation trend that will make the market ready for a wider breakout phase in late 2025. Concurrently, the rally has also revived the excitement to the presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which still has a good number of early investors calling it the best crypto to buy. Solana Builds Strength as Bulls Defend Key Levels Solana price rose 4% in the past 24 hours, indicating a new strength in the rising channel. The SOL price has been trading in a steady range of $185-$210, and buyers have been protecting the support at $190. According to the analysts, every test of this area is being received with active accumulation. This steady purchasing demand is a positive indicator of increasing confidence in the market. Technical traders regard the $205 to $210 as a possible breakout area that can cause the prices to go up to $246 and even to $300. Source; X Provided that Solana keeps holding above $180, it might proceed with its long-term growth pattern. Solana recovery has also led to a wider optimism in the altcoin market. Cardano Prepares for a Potential Technical Breakout Cardano is also exhibiting some stability with the token maintaining levels above the key support levels of approximately $0.65. ADA market data indicate that ADA is approaching a resistance area at $0.74 to $0.77, where sellers have been active in the last several sessions. When the market breaks out of this point it may indicate the beginning of a new short-term rise. Analyst Lark Davis observed that ADA recently showed a daily MACD golden cross, a precursor of large upsurge. Cardano has already shot up 150% since bottoming in September 2023 and has stayed in a distinct trend of higher lows. In the next major run, ADA may carry gains to $2.96 as long as the buying pressure is sustained. Source: X According to many traders, Cardano is currently one of the best crypto to buy at less than $1, as it has been assisted by technical strength and network enhancements that still continue to attract developers. Hyperliquid Growth Supported by Buyback Program Hyperliquid has been making continuous token buybacks amounting to over $521 million. These buybacks have replaced more than 5.6% of the circulating supply, which demonstrates steady protocol revenue. The gradual withdrawal of liquid supply has acted as a buffer when corrections were made recently and has thus created good grounds of recovery. Source: Tokenomist Under the new HyperEVM integration and active involvement in its ecosystem, the on-chain data of HYPE are healthy. The price action indicates that the token is trading within the range of $34 to $37 support indicating a sign of buyers accumulating in the range. With the trend, analysts estimate a possible rebound to a range of $45. The combination of lower supply, ecosystem growth, and long-term investor confidence have positioned Hyperliquid as a one of the most promising projects during periods of market consolidation to be the best crypto to own. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Attracts Investor Momentum Although there are already existing tokens that possess major support, new competitors such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are rapidly taking off. The presale that has been going on in the project has been registered with good participation of the retail and institutional investors. Subsequently, thousands of wallets have become part of the event and continue to boost the inflows every day as well as surpassing a few initial funding milestones. The PATRIOT50X bonus program, offered by MAGACOIN FINANCE has been the key to this rush. The incentive will reward the first participants who will earn up to 50% additional tokens. Analysts on X call it the XRP killer which may come to outperform even cryptos like Dogecoin or even Shiba Inu. Consequently, the presale is one of the most talked-about campaigns in all online communities, which makes MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the key upcoming listing candidates. It is now being listed as one of the best crypto to buy before the year 2025, as many traders note its large community base and clear presale process. Market Outlook The general market remains exhibiting a positive trend and Solana, Cardano and Hyperliquid are stable at strategic support points. All of the assets exhibit indications of gradual building up as the sentiment is slowly getting better. According to market analysts, the continued inflow into presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE makes investors ready to participate in the next stage of expansion. With the rotation of capital to new opportunities, it will be likely to focus on the developments which have both good fundamentals and community developments. As Solana has recovered, ADA has been on the technical upward trend, and HYPE has decreased supply, MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently one of the best altcoin to buy in the current accumulation phase.

53434188,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87075,1761008448,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Sets XRP Price For End of 2025,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-sets-xrp-price-for-end-of-2025/,"Crypto market analyst Whale.Guru, popularly known in the community as the “100x Gem Hunter,” has shared new price projections for major digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP. His updated forecast suggests moderate growth across the board and presents what he calls a more realistic outlook for the remainder of 2025. The latest analysis arrives amid heightened uncertainty in the broader cryptocurrency market. Most leading assets are struggling to regain momentum, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana all trading below their 30-day peaks. The decline has ranged from 4% to 18% across these tokens, while the Fear and Greed Index currently sits at 27, a level that indicates widespread caution among investors. Realistic end of 2025 crypto price predictions: Bitcoin – $250k Ethereum – $6k Solana – $350 BNB – $1.75k XRP – $5 What else? — Whale.Guru (@Whale_Guru) October 19, 2025 Bitcoin Expected to Regain Market Leadership Whale.Guru expects Bitcoin to remain the primary driver of the next bullish phase. In his projection, the world’s largest cryptocurrency could reach $250,000 before the end of 2025. Based on its current price of approximately $110,393, this would represent a gain of more than 126% and establish a new all-time high. Should this scenario unfold, Bitcoin’s market capitalization could approach $5 trillion, significantly improving overall sentiment in the crypto space. The analyst believes such a recovery would also create favorable conditions for large-cap altcoins, allowing them to follow Bitcoin’s trajectory with moderate gains of their own. According to his analysis, Ethereum could advance to around $6,000, Solana might rise to $350, and Binance Coin (BNB) could reach $1,750. These predictions indicate less than a 100% increase for each asset, a sign that Whale.Guru is focusing on steady market growth rather than speculative excesses. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Projection Revised to $5 In contrast to his earlier predictions of a supercycle that could propel XRP to $300, Whale.Guru has adjusted his expectations to a more measured $5 price target by the end of 2025. At its current price of $2.45 , this forecast implies a potential upside of roughly 103% over the next three months. While conservative compared to past estimates, this target would still mark a significant milestone for XRP, giving it a projected market capitalization of about $300 billion. Market observers note that factors such as institutional participation, potential ETF approvals, and Ripple’s expanding cross-border payment infrastructure could contribute to the token’s upward trajectory. Whale.Guru’s outlook aligns with projections from other market commentators, including Ash Crypto and Mario Nawfal , who have both placed XRP’s potential range between $5 and $10 if Bitcoin continues to strengthen. These overlapping forecasts suggest a growing consensus that XRP could deliver moderate, sustainable growth through 2025, rather than extreme price surges. The analyst’s revised tone reflects a more cautious but data-driven perspective compared to his previous predictions. Although a $5 XRP remains below earlier supercycle ambitions, achieving that level would still represent an unprecedented high for the token and a significant milestone in its long-term performance history.

53435067,609928,1761008458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53435067.jpeg,Grayscale Crowns Solana As Crypto’s New Powerhouse,https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-solana-crypto-new-powerhouse/,"Grayscale’s research team has delivered one of its most bullish assessments yet of Solana’s fundamentals, framing the network as the dominant venue for on-chain activity and a rare combination of scale, speed, and breadth. In a 17-minute read, the firm characterizes Solana as “crypto’s financial bazaar,” arguing that its “depth and diversity of on-chain activity” now set the pace for smart-contract platforms across core metrics: users, transaction volume, and transaction fees. “Solana is crypto’s financial bazaar,” Grayscale writes, adding that the network “stands out for the depth and diversity of its on-chain activity” and is “the category leader in terms of users, transaction volume, and transaction fees.” The report positions those three indicators as the most telling markers of real blockchain demand, concluding that the “diverse on-chain economy creates a strong foundation for SOL’s valuation and the necessary conditions for future growth.” Solana Is The Leading Blockchain By Activity At the token level, Grayscale places SOL squarely in large-cap territory, noting an implied network valuation of roughly $119 billion and ranking SOL as the fifth-largest crypto asset by market capitalization when excluding stablecoins, and the third-most liquid by average daily trading volume. The firm frames SOL as a “digital commodity that helps operate the network and provides investment access to growth in the Solana ecosystem,” positioning future price performance as a function of the network’s user base, throughput, and fee capture rather than narrative alone. The activity picture is central to the thesis. Grayscale highlights that Solana’s application layer now spans decentralized finance, consumer and social apps, and physical infrastructure networks, with standout traction in each. On the DeFi side, Solana’s DEXs have cleared more than $1.2 trillion in year-to-date volume, the highest tally across any blockchain ecosystem, while aggregator Jupiter is described as the industry’s largest by volume. In consumer crypto, memecoin launchpad and social venue Pump.fun is cited at roughly two million monthly active users and around $1.2 million in daily revenue. In the DePIN category, Helium’s migration and expansion on Solana anchors a real-world footprint Grayscale finds notable: “1.5 million daily users, 112,000 hotspots, and partnerships with major telecom companies like AT&T and Telefonica.” Beyond those flagships, Grayscale points to a long tail of more than 500 unique applications and a breadth of use cases that now includes brisk NFT trading (third among networks), significant stablecoin settlement (fifth), and a foothold in tokenized assets (seventh). The cumulative effect shows up in fees. “Although there’s variation over time,” the report states, “the Solana ecosystem earns about $425 million in fees per month — or more than $5 billion annualized,” which Grayscale calls “the most direct measure of total demand for a blockchain and its applications.” Performance characteristics remain a defining pillar of the analysis. Blocks arrive “every 400 milliseconds,” with transactions reaching probabilistic finality “in about 12–13 seconds.” Critically, low fees have persisted at scale. Users have paid an average transaction fee “of just $0.02 year to date,” while a local-fee-market design keeps congestion effects contained to hotspots of demand; Grayscale says median daily fees this year averaged “just $0.001.” The roadmap aims to compress latencies further. “A forthcoming upgrade to Solana called Alpenglow is expected to reduce finality time to 100–150 milliseconds,” the researchers note. User experience and architecture are framed as strategic differentiators. Grayscale calls Solana “a fast and cheap blockchain for everyone” that also “offers arguably one of the best new-user experiences in crypto.” The “monolithic” design, in contrast to layered rollup stacks, avoids bridging between execution domains, while wallet infrastructure — led by Phantom — is credited with smoothing onboarding and everyday use. SOL Tokenomics And Developer Momentum On the supply side, the tokenomics section emphasizes both dilution and offsetting staking yield . SOL’s issuance currently expands supply by about 4%–4.5% per year, which Grayscale calls a headwind “all else equal.” But with nominal staking rewards “around 7%,” the “real (inflation-adjusted) reward rate” lands in the “roughly 2.5%–3%” range, depending on conditions. “Currently around two-thirds of outstanding SOL tokens are staked,” the report adds. Developer momentum and potential “moats” are discussed in the context of the Solana Virtual Machine. Where EVM compatibility lets applications port across many chains with relatively low friction, Solana’s SVM “can’t be easily transferred to non-SVM blockchains,” a dynamic Grayscale says “potentially [contributes] to sticky demand.” The report tallies “more than 1,000 full-time developers working on Solana and SVM-based applications,” and finds that “the number of Solana-focused developers has grown faster than any other smart contract platform over the last two years.” That developer concentration, alongside escalating user activity and fee capture, is presented as reinforcing flywheels for the ecosystem. Competitive risks remain front and center. Grayscale underscores that some rival chains can be “even faster and/or cheaper,” often by “operating a more centralized network,” a trade-off users may accept depending on the application. Permissioned chains, while limiting openness, can be optimal in specific institutional contexts.At the monetary-asset end of the spectrum, the report is explicit that SOL “may be less suitable as a long-term ‘store of value’” relative to Bitcoin or Ether, citing higher nominal inflation and, more importantly, questions of resilience. “Solana’s efficiency comes at the cost of comparatively high hardware and bandwidth requirements, such that many of the network’s nodes operate in data centers,” Grayscale writes, warning that this “could become a source of centralization over time and a vector for third-party interference.” These are “complex and unsettled issues,” the report cautions, and investor perceptions may evolve. By Grayscale’s framework — users, transactions, and fees — Solana presently “is the leading network for on-chain activity.” The firm’s base case is that the scale and variety of Solana’s economy provide a “strong foundation for SOL valuation,” while acknowledging formidable competition and architectural trade-offs. The implicit investment lens is straightforward: if Solana continues to add users, process more transactions, and expand its fee base, “investors can anticipate a rising SOL price,” while accepting that price will not map one-for-one to fundamentals in the short run.

With no centralized oversight, ETH has become a stage where builders and grifters coexist, each leveraging the same tools of decentralization to vastly different ends. Can Ethereum Evolve Beyond Its Culture Of Exploitation? Ethereum has always been more than just a cryptocurrency. It’s a programmable, open finance framework that allows anyone to build and exploit ETH. According to AdrianoFeria’s post on X, this openness has enabled innovation and also allowed countless grifters to accumulate vast amounts of ETH by selling low-quality tokens and NFTs to retail investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Has A Fundamental Problem, Warns Cyberpunk Nick Szabo The mechanism of extraction was simple yet profound, so that retail investors, ironically seeking to gain more ETH exposure through higher beta plays, ended up parting with the very asset they sought to accumulate. These grifters effectively extracted ETH that might have otherwise remained in the hands of long-term holders. However, one of the earliest and most glaring examples was EOS. At its peak, it held about 7.2 million ETH, which is roughly 6% of the total supply, marking the largest single treasury in existence. A subsequent wave of Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and NFTs is believed to have extracted more ETH from the hands of long-term retail holders. This continuous speculative excess transferred wealth, creating selling pressure that ultimately slowed down ETH’s long-term appreciation. Furthermore, Adriano Feria asserts that ETH has finally moved beyond that phase and will be reflected in price action (PA) with steadier growth and much stronger relative strength during market corrections. Institutions are actively embracing ETH, and even hardcore BTC maximalists have been forced to acknowledge ETH’s technological strengths and the undeniable institutional traction it has attracted. These expectations are for a boring supercycle, and with crypto commentators (CT folks) still trying to call the top. Still, this very stability and institutional foundation is precisely what the ETH supercycle is meant to look like. Why Ethereum Legacy Belongs To Everyone A digital artist, ArtvisionNFT, from Ukraine, who specializes in NFTs, has revealed that in the fast-moving world of blockchain, history is at risk of being forgotten. As a result, the Covalent_HQ Ethereum Wayback Machine (EWM) was built to ensure the full history remains intact and accessible to everyone, anywhere, to access the verified blockchain data. Related Reading: Ethereum On-Chain Bloodbath: Rugs And Scams Erode Retail Confidence, What To Know However, EWM acts as a digital time capture, collecting, verifying, and storing old block using a decentralized system. Those process ensures that developers can use EWM to audit smart contracts, build analytics, and trace blockchain activity. EWM protects the transparency, accountability, and innovation in the broader Web3 ecosystem. At its core, Covalent_HQ’s mission is to make sure ETH’s story is never lost.

The altcoin has now secured over $16.5 million in funding , drawing thousands of new investors who see it as the next big breakout before major exchange listings. With the price still under $0.0006 and climbing hourly, early buyers are locking in fast, using the exclusive 50% bonus code: PATRIOTS100X before it expires. Funding Milestone Sparks FOMO Across the Market The latest figures confirm that MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the fastest-moving assets in the crypto market today. The project’s funding surge past $16.5 million has created a wave of urgency as the price automatically adjusts upward every hour, leaving latecomers paying more with each refresh. To celebrate the milestone, the MAGACOIN team announced a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using the code PATRIOTS100X , marking one of the most generous incentives seen this quarter. Thousands of wallets have already joined in just the past 48 hours, signaling the kind of network momentum usually seen before major exchange debuts. Experts tracking presale patterns predict up to a 75x ROI before listings go live, comparing the current setup to early-stage phases of meme-decentralized projects that later canceled zeros after listing. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Gaining Fast Traction Beyond the hype, investors are calling MAGACOIN FINANCE a safe haven amid ongoing market turbulence. While many assets remain down from their highs, this project stands out for its security-first framework, full audits, and transparent structure . It’s not just about gains; it’s about safety and smart positioning. With no venture capital influence and full verification on leading audit platforms, MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned trust in a space where few projects do. Traders are also using it as a hedge and diversification play, a move that balances exposure to both high-growth and secure assets as the broader market remains unpredictable. The token’s rise has been steady with no dips so far , giving holders confidence that early entry can still deliver explosive upside. Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead, but New Money Hunts Undervalued Altcoins While Bitcoin hovers near $110,000 and Ethereum sees heavy whale accumulation above $4,000 , the focus among new investors is shifting toward undervalued altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE . Bitcoin whales stacked coins below $107K, signaling confidence ahead of a possible push toward $123K. Ethereum, meanwhile, has seen large institutional buying — including BitMine’s $1.5B ETH purchase following the recent market dip. However, the price per Bitcoin or Ether leaves limited room for exponential growth compared to smaller caps. This rotation of capital into lower-priced assets has made MAGACOIN FINANCE a top choice for investors seeking the next high-upside play before the Q4 breakout cycle. Experts Predict a 75x ROI Before Listing Market analysts reviewing MAGACOIN’s structure suggest that if the current growth continues, the token could cancel two zeros in its next major cycle — transforming under-$0.0006 entries into prices closer to $0.05 or even $0.1 during the next bull run. That projection translates to more than 75x upside , making it one of the most talked-about early opportunities this quarter. The coin’s confirmed listings on both DEX and CEX platforms are expected to drive further demand once live, and many believe prices could reprice instantly once trading opens publicly. Final Call: Timing Is Everything With the price ticking higher every hour, timing is everything for those looking to position early. Thousands have already secured their holdings before the next increase, and bonus codes are running low. Use code: PATRIOTS100X on the official site to claim 50% extra tokens — available only for a short window. Once listings go live, this early phase closes for good.

Why It Matters for Banks, Investors, and Japan’s Economy The reform could normalize crypto inside Japan’s mainstream financial system, opening the door to bank-grade custody, trading, risk management, and compliance. Expect requirements such as capital charges, exposure caps relative to Tier 1 capital, market-surveillance, AML/CFT controls, Travel Rule adherence, and segregation of client assets. With over 12 million registered crypto accounts (a 3.5x jump in five years), Japanese demand is already deepening, and bank participation could accelerate that trend by improving trust, convenience, and liquidity. At the macro level, Japan’s 240% debt-to-GDP backdrop is pushing policymakers to balance innovation with stability. By enabling regulated access to Bitcoin and other digital assets,alongside the country’s push on yen-pegged stablecoins from Mitsubishi UFJ , Sumitomo Mitsui, and Mizuho, Japan signals a pragmatic path, which is to foster digital-finance growth while keeping systemic risks ring-fenced. Timeline, Safeguards, and What to Watch Next Implementation speed will hinge on whether the FSA proceeds via supervisory guideline updates (faster, narrower scope) or Diet legislation (broader, slower). Either way, expect tight exposure limits, stress-testing, and operational-risk standards for custody and exchange functions. Banks that enter the exchange business will need matching engines, institutional-grade custody, real-time monitoring, and robust KYC/AML tooling, likely catalyzing demand for regtech and market-infra vendors. Key catalysts: Final FSA guidance on capital treatment and exposure caps. Bank exchange registrations and first movers announcing BTC custody/trading. Progress on crypto’s reclassification as “financial products” (potentially smoothing the path for ETFs and broader securities-law oversight). Stablecoin rollouts (JPYC, bank-issued yen coins) driving on-chain settlement for corporates. If enacted, Japan’s plan could make it one of the most bank-integrated crypto markets in the world, providing institutional adoption while embedding crypto inside the country’s well-supervised financial rails.

This warning follows Beijing’s recent action of imposing sanctions on the US divisions of a South Korean shipping company because it eyes the US maritime industry for expansion with investment plans. In a statement dated Monday October 20, an American government official, who is serving as the US trade representative in the Trump administration, Jamieson Greer pointed out that China’s recent moves against private firms globally illustrate a worldwide trend of economic pressure focused on influencing American politics and managing the global supply chain. Greer further explained that the Asian country aims at discouraging foreign investment in America’s shipbuilding and other key industries. US-China maritime conflicts escalates raising tension in the industry Greer’s warning demonstrates an ongoing series of US-China maritime conflicts . Notably, China manages more than half of the world’s shipbuilding capacity and has been attempting to reinforce its control over the crucial South China Sea in recent years. This battle has significantly impacted the global economy as ship transport handles over 80% of international trade. Meanwhile, reliable sources have highlighted that even though the US is ranked as the country with the strongest navy globally, its shipbuilding capabilities are moderately low. To address this, the Trump administration has encouraged investments from South Korea, which is grouped as the second-largest shipbuilder in the world. China’s recent decision to implement sanctions on the US branches of a South Korean shipping company directly affected these efforts. To illustrate this, it prohibited individuals or organizations in China from conducting business operations with the US branches of South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean Co. Furthermore, China has warned that it will take further actions in response against the industry. Responding to China’s threat, Greer stated that attempts to scare them will not prevent the US from rebuilding its shipbuilding industry and fighting back against China’s efforts to dominate important industrial sectors. Greer’s statement is an example of the ongoing tensions. Sources have also noted that both countries have levied special port dues on each other’s commercial vessels, a measure that went into effect last week. To retaliate against China’s actions, the US intends to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports of key port equipment and could introduce a 150% import tax on other cargo handling gear. Trump plans to discuss about Taiwan with Xi Jinping Trump has been trying to diminish Chinese firms’ influence in strategic global ports, including ones lining the Panama Canal. With the severe actions from both the US and China, analysts have pointed out shipping as one of many issues creating tension between China and the US. This has raised concerns among investors around the world in recent years. To demonstrate these practices, Beijing has tightened export restrictions on rare earth materials and taken other steps. On the other hand, the US has stepped up restrictions on China’s access to chips and threatened the possibility of 100% tariffs. This week, Trump announced that he plans to discuss China’s territorial ambitions related to Taiwan, a self-governing island, when he meets with Xi Jinping, the President of the People’s Republic of China next week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. When reporters requested the president to answer questions on whether he thought China would ask for trade benefits in return for a discussion about Taiwan, Trump declined to respond.

Lubin posted on X and said Paradigm and other venture capitalists (VCs) want to to take as much value as they can from Ethereum and the wider ecosystem. He explained that their role is normal and only temporary as the industry keeps growing. His comments came as the community discussed the growing influence of big investment funds on the governance and research of Ethereum. Lubin says VCs help connect global capital to the growth of Ethereum Joseph Lubin said VCs take ideas and projects that begin in decentralized communities and make them ready for the traditional investors who control large amounts of global capital. He explained that many global investors do not yet fully understand crypto or trust it enough to invest directly, so VCs offer them familiar systems for managing money, checking projects, and protecting investments. This effort allows more capital to enter the crypto industry and reduces the feature that comes with new and unfamiliar technology. “We need VCs for now because they represent a comfortable bridge for the world’s capital to flow into our ecosystem.” the Ethereum co-founder said. Some people believe the influence of VCs is a risk to decentralization, but he sees it as a temporary phase. Lubin said Ethereum needs to work with the current financial system while building tools that will one day replace it. The co-founder of Ethereum also said new and fair “onchain investment platforms” will allow anyone, anywhere in the world, to invest in projects using tokens and smart contracts instead of going through large investment firms. “Very soon better, fairer, more broadly accessible onchain investment platforms with healthy tokenomics will mature sufficiently so that VCs will have no choice but to set up shop on these platforms,” Lubin said. The few large investors or organizations will slowly lose lose that power and ownership to people who actually use, build, and support these new systems. He believes Ethereum’s greatest strength lies in its openness, transparency, and neutrality. These values make it possible for people from every part of the world to connect, trade, and build together without depending on old financial institutions. Paradigm’s new hires spark debate over its growing role in Ethereum There has been intense debate in the cryptocurrency community about the growing influence of Paradigm in the Ethereum ecosystem. People voiced their concerns after two of the most respected researchers on the network took roles in projects backed by the venture capital firm. One of the researchers is Dankrad Feist, a long-time and highly respected member of the Ethereum Foundation. Feist announced that he was leaving the Ethereum Foundation to join Tempo , a new layer-1 blockchain that focuses on payments and stablecoins. The project aims to build a faster and more efficient blockchain system for global payments that can compete with both traditional payment rails and existing crypto networks. Mallesh Pai, who had previously worked with Consensys, joined Paradigm earlier in the year as a research adviser. He will guide the company’s growing research operations before moving to Tempo full-time in September. This information is according to his LinkedIn page. People say Paradigm could get too much control over the people and ideas that influence the long-term development of Ethereum, especially after Pai joined the firm immediately after Feist. Some users on social media say the growing number of corporate-backed blockchains like Tempo will slowly pull resources, talent, and energy away from the public networks of decentralized systems. However, some developers and analysts said the support from Paradigm will give scientists like Feist and Pai more freedom, funding, and infrastructure to experiment with new ideas that could later benefit the entire industry. Lubin responded to these debates and said he does not see Paradigm’s involvement as a threat to the independence that Ethereum has worked so hard to build. He explained that these movements are a natural and even healthy part of the evolution of any growing technology ecosystem. The Ethereum eco-founder added that more people now see this technology as a big part of the global economy because big companies and venture firms have shown a lot of interest in building new blockchains.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.5362 Market cap $538.71M Trading volume $177.38M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.5582 24-hour low $0.5227 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 16.62% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.7747 14-Day RSI 35.50 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 34 (Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $0.7754 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF is consolidating around $0.53 with low momentum and muted volume. The daily structure is still bearish but with signs of stabilization above $0.52. A breakout above $0.58 would confirm a short-term trend reversal. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart As of October 21, WIF is trading at $0.536, slightly below the green Alligator line at $0.548, signaling that the price remains under moderate bearish control. The daily candles have shown small-bodied formations, confirming a phase of consolidation after the sharp drop earlier this week. The Alligator lines are still fanned downward, suggesting that the overall market trend remains bearish despite the short-term stability. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The MACD is hovering around the neutral line, indicating that selling pressure has softened but there’s not enough buying strength to reverse the trend yet. Volume remains subdued, confirming a lack of strong participation from bulls. Immediate resistance stands near $0.548–$0.579, and a close above $0.58 would signal the first true bullish shift. On the downside, $0.52 acts as short-term support, while a break below $0.50 could open the door to $0.47. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, WIF has started to retrace after failing to sustain above $0.561, with candles now testing the $0.535 level. The pattern reflects mild profit-taking after a modest intra-day recovery. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview The MACD remains slightly positive but flattening, hinting that bullish momentum is fading. The support levels at $0.518 and $0.506 are critical; holding above these could allow another bounce toward $0.56, while losing them could drag price back toward $0.47. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.6219 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.5889 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.5800 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.6770 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.7747 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.8698 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.7754 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6697 SELL EMA 5 $0.7172 SELL EMA 10 $0.7674 SELL EMA 21 $0.8181 SELL EMA 50 $0.8750 SELL EMA 100 $0.8917 SELL EMA 200 $0.9919 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF is entering a stabilization phase after its selloff, showing weak but recovering momentum. Traders can expect sideways movement between $0.51–$0.57 in the short term, with a potential breakout forming only if volume returns and $0.58 is reclaimed with conviction. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Japan Considers Allowing Banks to Hold and Trade Bitcoin Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is weighing new rules that could let domestic banks store and exchange Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, marking a notable shift from its 2020 policy that barred direct crypto holdings due to volatility risks. Under the proposal, banks would be allowed to treat cryptocurrencies much like traditional financial assets such as stocks or bonds, provided they adhere to strict risk management and capital requirements. The Financial System Council, which advises the prime minister, is expected to review the proposal in the coming weeks.

Bolivia’s New President Plans to Use Blockchain to Fight Corruption Bolivia’s president-elect Rodrigo Paz plans to use blockchain technology to curb corruption and stabilize the economy as he prepares to take office on November 8, after winning with 54.5% of the vote. Paz’s administration aims to improve transparency in public spending by integrating smart contracts into government systems, ensuring that funds are traceable and harder to misuse. The initiative is part of a broader digital reform strategy focused on rebuilding trust in public institutions. He also intends to create a foreign exchange stability fund, where citizens can voluntarily report and deposit their cryptocurrency holdings to help support Bolivia’s reserves.

The move signaled Bolivia’s gradual transition toward a more open and blockchain-friendly economy. Paz’s blockchain agenda reinforces the global momentum toward digital transparency and crypto adoption, positioning Bitcoin and other decentralized assets as tools for accountability. As optimism for institutional crypto integration grows, investors may see renewed confidence reflected in Bitcoin’s market outlook. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Ascending Channel Hints at $115K Target Bitcoin is trading near $109,550, up 1.48% in the past 24 hours, holding firm inside an ascending channel on the 2-hour chart. The pattern reflects a controlled recovery after the mid-October dip, with the 20-EMA crossing above the 50-EMA, an early sign of renewed momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Buyers are defending higher lows since $105,500, showing steady accumulation. Resistance sits at $111,681, where a breakout could drive BTC toward $115,960 and possibly $119,800 if volume builds. A drop below $109,000 could trigger a short-term pullback to $107,455 or $104,430, both recent demand areas. The RSI around 63 points to sustained buying pressure without overheating, leaving room for further upside. As long as the structure holds, Bitcoin appears on track to test the $115K–$120K range, supported by improving liquidity and institutional inflows, hinting at a potential year-end rally if sentiment continues to stabilize.

The move comes as Beijing reasserts control over who can issue money-like tokens, even as Hong Kong builds a legal path for licensed stablecoin firms. Beijing Steps In People’s Bank of China and the Cyberspace Administration of China asked the companies not to go ahead with their projects, people familiar with the matter told reporters. Ant had said in June it planned to take part in Hong Kong’s pilot for fiat-referenced stablecoins, and JD.com had signalled similar interest. Hong Kong’s legislature passed a stablecoin bill in May that created a licensing regime for issuers, aiming to bring rules and clarity to the market after years of uncertainty. Under that law, anyone issuing stablecoins tied to Hong Kong dollars must hold a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. According to FT, Alibaba’s Ant Group and JD com have paused their plans to issue stablecoins in Hong Kong after receiving instructions from Chinese regulators, including the PBOC and CAC, to halt the projects. Hong Kong passed a Stablecoin Bill in May establishing a licensing… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 19, 2025 Industry Reaction And Risk Concerns Regulators in Beijing have warned that privately run stablecoins could threaten monetary control if large tech groups or brokerages were allowed to act like currency issuers. Reports have disclosed that PBoC officials were particularly uneasy about letting non-state firms issue tokens that might operate like money. Stablecoins are usually pegged to a fiat currency such as the US dollar and are widely used by traders to move funds between crypto assets, which is why officials worry about the scale and reach such tokens could achieve. The concern is less about the technology and more about who controls the payments and reserves that back these tokens. Hong Kong’s Timeline And What Might Happen Next Hong Kong has said it expects to begin issuing licenses under its stablecoin regime in the near term, with regulators signaling that only a limited number of licenses would be granted at first. Market watchers see the city as a testing ground for regulated, fiat-backed tokens — but mainland guidance can change the plans of Chinese firms that want to participate. The pause follows broader signals from Beijing about offshore digital asset activity. In recent months, regulators have also asked some brokerages to slow or stop tokenization and other real-world asset work tied to Hong Kong, reflecting wider caution about rapid growth of crypto-linked products across borders.

Ethereum MVRV Ratio Has Formed A Death Cross In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a signal that has appeared for Ethereum in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. This on-chain indicator measures the ratio between the ETH Market Cap and Realized Cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes To $105,000, Sentiment Sinks Into Extreme Fear The Realized Cap here is a capitalization model for the cryptocurrency that calculates its total value by assuming the ‘real’ value of each token in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Since the last transaction of any token is likely to represent the last time it changed hands, the price at its time would denote its current cost basis. As such, the Realized Cap is a measure of the total cost basis of the ETH circulating supply. In other words, the model represents the amount of capital the investors as a whole have put into the asset. The Market Cap, on the other hand, signifies the value that the investors are carrying in the present. Thus, its comparison with the Realized Cap in the MVRV Ratio tells us about the profit-loss situation of the holders. When the value of the indicator is greater than 1, it means the investors are holding more value than they put in. On the other hand, it being under the cutoff suggests the overall market is underwater. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Ethereum MVRV Ratio and its 160-day moving average (MA) over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum MVRV Ratio has witnessed a decline recently as ETH’s price has gone down, implying holder profitability has been dropping. With the latest drawdown, the indicator’s daily value has plunged below the 160-day MA. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted the previous instances of this crossover taking place. It would appear that the MVRV Ratio’s fall under this line in February led into a significant decrease in the ETH price from $3,300 to $1,400, a swing of almost 60%. Other instances of the crossover, however, didn’t mean much for Ethereum. It should be noted, though, that in these instances, including the one from earlier in the month, the metric was swift to recover back above the line, essentially canceling out the death cross.

The steady performance is indicative of growing investor confidence as traders adjust to the current mid-cycle phase, a period of often quiet accumulation ahead of the next big rally. Analysts pointed out that this is an environment that favors disciplined buyers. Both Cardano (ADA) and MAGACOIN FINANCE are shaping up as the best accumulation plays for investors who are looking for long-term exposure. Their stability, strategic development, and growing interest by both investors suggest that they can outperform when market momentum returns. Bitcoin Consolidates Above Key Support Bitcoin has solidly rallied in recent days, which improves its mid-term case. After hitting a low of $104,000, the top cryptocurrency has regained the $111,000 level and continues to show signs of resilience. Market data suggests that this range is now a good accumulation range for both the retail and institutional participants. Source: CoinMarketCap Analysts say that Bitcoin’s historical mid-cycle stance events are often accompanied by long periods of consolidation. During these times, traders take positions slowly in preparation for the next surge. The $100,000 support continues to be crucial as a breakout above $125,000 could signal renewed bullish momentum. The wider market sentiment has been boosted by a reduction in geopolitical risk as well as new optimism around trade negotiations. With the macro risks stabilized, the market is moving from short-term volatility to long-term positioning and fundamentals. ADA Attracts Long-Term Buyers Cardano (ADA) continues to draw attention from patient investors who are focused on the long-term. For weeks, the asset has been going sideways, without moving away from support near familiar levels. Analysts point out that ADA’s steady activity among long-term holders is indicative of confidence in its network growth. Its steady updates with development and an active community, along with its growing DeFi ecosystem, strengthen the argument to amass during this quieter phase of the market. ADA has rallied strongly in the late stages of previous cycles. Traders consider its current range of $0.65 to $0.70 a healthy base. If Bitcoin holds, ADA may be one of the first major altcoins to break higher as the next wave of capital rotation starts. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Recognition in Mid-Cycle Strategy MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting more attention from large investors quietly buying up as the market is stabilized. These whales are often early movers in new cycles, and so it looks like they are positioning for the next phase of expansion. Their steady purchasing reflects confidence in the long-term potential of the project and confidence in the market’s ability to withstand. To add to the excitement, the project recently introduced the Patriot50X bonus , offering early participants 50% additional tokens during the presale. The bonus has boosted investor sentiment, offering a tangible reward for those who jump on early while reinforcing allegiance to existing supporters. Analysts say this combination of high whale interest, combined with the structured rewards, is rare in early-stage projects. It is a disciplined approach that focuses more on sustainable growth and less on short-term hype. Many consider MAGACOIN FINANCE a middle-of-cycle standout – a project operating well during a consolidation period when others are stagnant. As the markets increase in stability, its verified transparency and early demand made it one of the best crypto opportunities lined up with Bitcoin’s wider recovery phase. Final Outlook Bitcoin’s ability to trade above $111,000 demonstrates growing confidence in the crypto market at large. This calm period, also often referred to as the mid-cycle accumulation zone, allows investors to prepare for the next uptrend. Within this landscape, ADA and MAGACOIN FINANCE are emerging as leaders. ADA appeals to those looking for network strength and gradual growth, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining recognition for those investors who see the value in ‘early’ entry, known transparency, and smart reward systems. Together, they are the sort of assets you define to the mid-cycle accumulation that matters, profitable-patient plays based on conviction, not hype.

The 50-week Simple Moving Average (SMA), often called the bull market baseline by traders, has acted as a reliable support zone since early 2023. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at around $111,200, showing a modest daily gain while still down over the past week. Bitcoin Retests Long-Term Support The chart shared by Merlijn The Trader shows that each time Bitcoin has retested the 50-week SMA since 2023, it has gone on to make new highs. The moving average has become a key level for identifying changes in trend. In early 2022, Bitcoin broke below it, marking the start of a broader correction. Since then, however, the price has repeatedly returned to this line before continuing higher. The most recent touch of the SMA has once again attracted attention from traders watching for signs of a new upward move. Merlijn stated: BITCOIN JUST RETESTED THE BULL MARKET BASELINE. The 50-week SMA marked every major liftoff since 2023. Smart money buys the retest. Retail buys the breakout. This chart separates traders from tourists. pic.twitter.com/hw8hWmOKPJ — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) October 20, 2025 Sentiment Still Unsettled After Liquidation Market confidence remains low following a large liquidation event on October 10. Funding rates, which reflect the cost of holding long or short positions in the futures market, dropped into negative territory on October 17. This suggests that many traders were leaning toward short positions, betting on further declines. Source: CryptoQuant Since then, funding rates have recovered and are now back above 0.005. Although this shift shows some return of buying interest, the caution in the derivatives market shows that traders are not yet fully convinced by the rebound. This kind of hesitation is common after a strong pullback, especially when losses were sudden. Key Price Levels in Play Bitcoin is currently trading near a resistance area at $111,440. This level marked the start of a previous decline that took the price below $108,600. According to analyst Lennaert Snyder, breaking and holding above $111,440 could open the way for a move toward $115,800. If that level is also cleared, price may revisit $120,800, where a fast selloff occurred earlier. Bitcoinsensus reported that the weekly candle closed above the $107,200 low, a move that could support a continued push higher. They also noted that the Bitcoin liquidity index has started to rise for the first time since July, a possible sign that new capital is entering the market. Broader Trends and External Pressure EGRAG CRYPTO noted that Bitcoin appears to be following a recurring pattern. The analyst suggested that the market may be entering the final stage of an upward cycle. Suggesting that a sharp reversal could follow after retail participation increases, EGRAG added, “Everyone will think we’re finally safe… but that’s where the real twist comes.” Notably, the recent correction was partly driven by political news, as we reported . A drop at the end of last week followed comments from former US President Donald Trump about new tariffs on China. This created uncertainty across financial markets and added pressure on crypto assets. As reported by CryptoPotato, data from prediction platform Polymarket showed some skepticism in the retail space. Their latest odds gave a 6% chance of aliens being confirmed this year, compared to just 5% for Bitcoin reaching $200,000. While meant to entertain, it reflects how cautious traders have become in setting near-term expectations.

After bouncing from $3,800 support, ETH is now touching the $4,100 resistance area that will determine the outcome, either reversing the trend bullishly or continuing with the correction. Despite the market fear index plunging to 30, analysts remain bullish on the $4,500 Ethereum target, noting good on-chain fundamentals and a growing network participation. Besides ETH, a Layer 2 project built on the Ethereum network called MAGACOIN FINANCE is set to capitalize on the same wave as investors look to get early access to scalable projects before the next rally. Fear Index Falls to 30 as Traders Turn Defensive The Crypto Fear Index dipping to 30 signals growing caution among market participants. This level reflects widespread unease, but also reflects conditions that have been followed in the past by large accumulation phases. Analysts point out that fear usually coincides with periods of opportunity to buy, when long-term investors come in quietly. Institutional traders seem to be taking advantage of this sentiment gap to add exposure. On-chain indicators show steady inflows of crypto into Ethereum staking contracts, hinting at continued confidence from major holders despite a lack of retail enthusiasm. Analysts believe such behavior indicates conviction in Ethereum’s medium-term outlook despite the short-term volatility that still exists. Volatility has compressed across leading assets, signaling that a decisive move could emerge soon. Traders now eye Ethereum’s key resistance zone as a potential trigger for renewed momentum before the end of October. Ethereum Tests $4,100 Resistance as Bulls Target a Breakout Toward $4,500 Ethereum price is again retesting $4,100 resistance, which has defined the market structure since late August. Trader Ted emphasizes this area as an important battleground where bulls and bears are fighting for control over a short-term period. Source: X A daily close above $4100 would be a technical change and confirm that buyers are regaining dominance. From there, ETH could progress towards $4,265, followed by a secondary target near $4,800, the upper boundary of its current range. Analysts consider these levels to be important checkpoints before the wider market can try to make a full recovery. Momentum indicators like RSI and MACD signal slow improvement with growing trading volume, adding further weight to the bullish case. A successful breakout would probably inspire broader confidence for altcoins, as Ethereum has historically led altcoin recoveries in similar phases. Conversely, rejection at this level would send ETH back towards $3,815, or even into the $3,575-$3,350 accumulation range. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rides Ethereum’s Path to $4,500 As Ethereum consolidates, MAGACOIN FINANCE, a Layer-2 project built on its blockchain, is drawing growing attention from analysts and early investors. The project benefits directly from Ethereum’s network activity and scaling upgrades, which continue to strengthen demand for Layer-2 infrastructure. Experts see striking similarities between MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early trajectory and Ethereum’s initial expansion in 2016. However, they note that MAGACOIN FINANCE entered the market with stronger security architecture and refined scalability mechanisms, providing a robust foundation for long-term growth. Some analyst projections suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 400x returns before Ethereum reaches its $4,500 target . The reasoning lies in its close alignment with Ethereum’s ecosystem, where every wave of adoption increases transaction flow across connected Layer-2 networks. Institutional investors have started positioning early, treating MAGACOIN FINANCE as a leveraged bet on Ethereum’s continued dominance in smart-contract markets. Final Outlook Ethereum’s battle near $4,100 represents a critical technical crossroads for the market. A clear breakout could validate a renewed uptrend toward $4,500, while rejection may trigger another short-term correction toward deeper support. Either outcome will shape November’s trading structure and influence altcoin sentiment. Despite the fear-driven environment, analysts maintain that Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong. ETF-related interest, network upgrades, and increasing transaction volumes continue to underpin the asset’s long-term strength. At the same time, attention is shifting toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say stands to benefit most from Ethereum’s rally. Both assets highlight how institutional capital is quietly preparing for the next recovery phase, reinforcing the narrative that the crypto market is setting up for a powerful rebound heading into 2025.

According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin appears to be entering the disbelief phase, which increases the possibility of a rebound to the upside. The contributor emphasized the slightly negative funding rate to support their analysis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Score Turns Negative With Trend Below $106,780 – When Will The Correction End? For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin disbelief phase occurs when a new uptrend begins, but most investors remain skeptical after a recent correction, doubting that the recovery is real. During this phase, lingering bearish sentiment and short positions often act as fuel for a stronger rally once confidence returns. Darkfost stated that investors’ skepticism toward BTC returning to bullish mode can be gauged through BTC funding rates in the derivatives market. Funding rates remained negative at -0.004% on the exchange for six out of seven days over the past week, indicating traders are still slightly bearish. The likely reason behind traders’ short bias is the October 10 crypto market crash that led to a liquidation worth $19 billion. Since then, traders have consistently chosen to short the market instead of getting trapped in another price pullback. However, the longer BTC remains in the disbelief phase, the stronger the potential for an explosive upside move becomes. Darkfost added: If the current uptrend continues to establish itself, the growing pile of short positions against it could become a powerful fuel for the next leg higher. As these shorts get liquidated, it would drive prices upward, triggering a short squeeze. If a short squeeze happens, then BTC could quickly rally to major liquidity zones around $113,000 level, and even as high as $126,000 region, where significant short orders liquidations are clustered. The analyst shared two previous instance where such a pattern played out. In September 2024, BTC fell to $54,000 before surging to a new all-time high beyond $100,000. Similarly, in April 2025, the flagship digital asset rallied from $85,000 to $111,000, before climbing even higher to $123,000. To conclude, the Bitcoin market may be on the verge of another short squeeze, fueled by investors’ skepticism. BTC Investors Need To Be Cautious Although BTC is giving hints of a looming short squeeze, investors should still exercise some caution before entering the market in hopes of an instant turnaround in sentiment. For example, Bitcoin activity recently slumped below its 365-day average, raising fears of a loss of momentum.

That said, some crypto analysts forecast that BTC is likely done with the price correction and is set to surge in the coming days. At press time, BTC trades at $110,814, up 2.8% in the past 24 hours.

According to Glassnode, last week’s sharp drop from $115,000 to $104,000 flushed out weak hands and triggered a defensive market rotation. Futures open interest and funding rates have declined, and demand for downside protection has surged, signaling a shift toward risk aversion.

The province’s energy ministry said on Monday that BC Hydro, a government-owned utility, will no longer accept new grid connection requests for crypto mining. The move comes after a two-year moratorium introduced in 2022, which officials say will now become a long-term policy aimed at protecting energy supplies and avoiding grid strain. Move Aims To Protect Electricity Supply For Job-Intensive And Revenue-Generating Projects BC, a global exporter of natural resources such as lumber, minerals and hydropower, plans to redirect available electricity toward industries that create more jobs and revenue for local communities. Future grid connections will be prioritized for sectors like natural gas processing, hydrogen production and manufacturing. According to Bloomberg, the Canadian province of British Columbia plans to limit power use by AI data centers and permanently ban new crypto mining projects. The province’s Energy Ministry said it will prioritize grid access for mining and natural gas industries to create more… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 21, 2025 The government said cryptocurrency mining consumes a large amount of energy. However, it provides little economic benefit to the province. Officials believe that redirecting electricity to industries with higher employment and investment potential will create greater public value. In comparison, pending crypto projects would have demanded more than 11,700 gigawatt-hours of power each year. That is enough electricity to supply hundreds of thousands of homes across British Columbia. Province Targets Balanced Grid Expansion Linking Energy Supply To Job Creation The permanent restriction is part of a broader set of energy policy reforms planned for late 2025. These reforms will determine how industrial electricity is distributed across the province. They will also set rules for fast-growing, high-consumption sectors such as data centers and artificial intelligence. In early 2026, BC Hydro will begin a competitive bidding process to allocate 400 megawatts of power. Of this, 300 megawatts will go to AI projects and 100 to general data centers. The process will run over two years. Meanwhile, traditional sectors such as mining, oil and gas, forestry and manufacturing will continue to have unrestricted access to industrial power, the ministry said. By 2026, construction on new transmission lines is expected to start. The expansion will continue through 2034 to strengthen BC’s grid and meet rising industrial demand. Officials said this long-term approach will help link power development with the province’s goals of job creation and economic diversification. BC’s Move Reflects Global Shift Toward Powering AI Over Energy-Hungry Crypto Mining The moratorium introduced in 2022 followed a sharp rise in crypto mining activity across British Columbia. Many companies were drawn to the province by its low-cost and renewable hydroelectric power. Soon after, BC joined other provinces such as Manitoba and Quebec in restricting crypto-related electricity use. The decision came amid growing environmental concerns and the instability of digital asset markets. At the time, policymakers warned that crypto mining consumed vast amounts of energy. They feared it could divert clean power away from households, hospitals and critical industries. Moreover, they questioned whether the largely automated mining operations brought any real employment or economic value to local communities. Since then, the government’s priorities have evolved. Officials now see greater long-term benefits in supporting AI and industrial projects that rely on stable electricity and generate stronger tax and job contributions. They say the move aligns with BC’s broader climate objectives and its transition toward a more resilient economy.

This uptick follows two consecutive Fridays of major drops, igniting fears and uncertainty among investors. These concerns have been compounded by predictions from experts about a potential bear market on the horizon. Looming Bear Market Threat Market analyst Doctor Profit, known for his accurate forecasts regarding the recent Bitcoin price trajectory, has recently cast doubt on whether market makers will allow both retail and institutional investors to exit at more favorable prices after incurring losses. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Moves: Can It Repeat The 36,000% Rally ‘Anomaly’ From Last Cycle? In a social media post on X (previously Twitter), he suggested that the maximum bullish scenario for the Bitcoin price in the near-term could reach around $116,500, representing a 9% increase from its current levels. However, he emphasizes that a drop below $101,700 would breach what he terms the “magic bull market line,” effectively confirming a bear market. Profit advises caution, predicting a significant move that could push the Bitcoin price below this critical threshold, signaling the end of the bull run. Adding to the bearish sentiment, the Bitcoin price is currently hovering below the short-term holder realized price of $112,500. This figure represents the average entry point for short-term traders and buyers, many of whom are now facing losses. On-chain data compiled by the expert also indicates that these traders are likely to sell off their positions if the Bitcoin price dips between 5% and 10%, potentially intensifying short-term selling pressure. Challenging Times Ahead For Bitcoin Price Profit further elaborates on the market conditions, pointing out that current price movements are indicative of market makers liquidating both bullish and bearish positions. “Nothing goes down in a straight line,” he notes, suggesting that while the market could be in a bear market, it is essential to remain aware of short-term fluctuations. He argues that high-leverage traders must be wiped out on both sides before the market experiences its next significant downward movement. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bull Run Over? Analyst Sees Echoes Of 2021 The expert also warns that every brief rally is designed to mislead bullish traders and liquidate late bearish positions. The market makers’ strategy appears to involve pushing Bitcoin toward the $116,500 region to eliminate late bears and generate sufficient liquidity for another downward price adjustment, potentially leading to new local lows. Looking ahead, Doctor Profit predicts that such price movements will continue to recur in the coming weeks and months, creating a challenging environment for investors in the volatile digital asset market.

Rodrigo Paz Pereira , who won the runoff that ended nearly two decades of rule by the Movement for Socialism, has made clean government a clear promise. He says modern ledgers can make money flows harder to hide. Blockchain Plan For Transparency Paz’s team is proposing the use of distributed ledgers for key public processes, including procurement and the tracking of public funds. Based on reports, the Central Bank of Bolivia relaxed a previous ban on cryptocurrencies in June 2024, a move that has opened the door for banks and fintechs to work with digital assets while keeping the boliviano as the official currency. Crypto activity in the country has grown sharply. Reported figures show crypto transactions rising from about $46.5 million in the first half of 2024 to roughly $294 million in the same period of 2025, a more than 500% jump in volume that has grabbed the attention of regulators and lawmakers. Why The Push Matters Supporters say blockchain will add a public, tamper-resistant record to budgets and contracts, which could make it harder for officials to hide graft. Critics warn that technology alone won’t fix weak institutions. They argue that audits, strong oversight and clear rules are still needed for any system to work. Reports have disclosed that the new administration is exploring pilot projects and international cooperation to build capacity, including ties with other countries that already use blockchain tools in some government functions. International Links And Local Caveats Bolivia has been seeking outside help. Based on reports, officials signed a memorandum of understanding with partners abroad to share regulatory ideas and technical know-how. That exchange could speed up implementation. At the same time, analysts note that rapid growth in crypto use raises its own challenges, such as consumer protection and money-laundering risks that must be managed. The Central Bank’s move to allow crypto interactions through formal banking channels was intended to reduce informal activity, but regulators now face new work in supervision and enforcement. Implementation details remain thin. Reports say pilot programs are likely to come first, focusing on a few government services before broader rollout. Success will depend on how public agencies adopt the tools, how clearly rules are written, and whether independent audits are used to check results. If the pilots expose gaps, they will be revised. If they work, the government could expand the approach to more areas.

The case has led to renewed attention on wallet configurations and user security practices after an image shared by a community member highlighted a key distinction between “cold” and “hot” wallets within the Ellipal app. James Rule (@RuleXRP), a prominent figure in the XRP community, posted a warning that included a screenshot from the Ellipal mobile interface. The post featured an arrow pointing to the option labeled “Add Hot Wallet,” showing how users can switch between connecting a cold wallet and creating a hot wallet in the same application. He cautioned users by writing, “DO NOT create a HOT WALLET in the @ellipalwallet APP with SEED/RECOVERY Phrases.” He also referred to the man who claimed the loss, alleging that the individual was “shilling a new YouTube Channel focusing on gold and silver.” DO NOT create a HOT WALLET in the @ellipalwallet APP with SEED/RECOVERY Phrases, etc etc. The guy that claims he lost $3 Million XRP is ""shilling"" a new YouTube Channel focusing on gold and silver. Be careful out there. pic.twitter.com/95sCX0RsWS — James Rule XRP (@RuleXRP) October 18, 2025 Ellipal’s Response Within hours, the post circulated widely among XRP holders, many of whom questioned how such a large amount could be stolen from a supposedly air-gapped device. Ellipal responded publicly to the growing concern, clarifying that its hardware wallets “are 100% air-gapped and never connect to the internet.” While Brandon, the man who lost the $3 million initially stated that the cold wallet on the app functions as a hot wallet , the company explained that the reported issue “came from a hot wallet setup, not from the cold wallet itself.” Its message concluded with a reminder to users to “stay safe and always keep your keys offline.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Lessons for Crypto Holders The distinction between wallet types is central to understanding the situation. A cold wallet is designed to remain isolated from any network connection, which prevents online attacks, and crypto experts have consistently advocated that XRP holders store their tokens in cold wallets . However, once a recovery seed is imported into a mobile or internet-connected app, it no longer functions as cold storage. This transition effectively converts it into a hot wallet, exposing private keys to potential compromise if the device is infected or insecure. Brandon allegedly imported his seed phrase into the mobile app before the theft occurred, allowing attackers to access the funds remotely. The case remains under investigation, but many market participants believe that the reported vulnerability lies not in the Ellipal device itself but in the configuration choices made during setup.

The price is now trading above $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.420 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

The bulls were able to push the price above $2.50, and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.647 swing high to the $2.190 low. However, the bears remained active near the $2.5350 level and prevented more gains.

Meanwhile, the Dogecoin Foundation’s commercial arm, House of Doge, made headlines by acquiring a majority stake in Italy’s historic football club US Triestina Calcio 1918. The move was made to integrate Dogecoin payments into match-day operations and to expand the coin’s real-world utility. Playful X Post Sends FLOKI Higher Elon Musk once again sent shockwaves through the meme coin market this week after a lighthearted post on his social media platform X triggered a sharp price rally. On Monday, Musk shared an AI-generated video featuring his Shiba Inu dog, Floki, declaring that the pup was “back on the job” as CEO of X. In the short clip, Floki is dressed in a tie and glasses, and playfully mutters, “Numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers? Is this working? Yay.” Almost instantly after the post, the price of the Floki ( FLOKI ) meme coin surged by almost 29%. The token climbed from a daily low of $0.00006572 to a high of $0.00008469 before correcting slightly to around $0.00007625. The move certainly proved that Musk still has influence over speculative corners of the crypto market, especially meme coins, which often trade more on hype and community enthusiasm than on fundamentals. FLOKI’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) This latest episode adds to Musk’s long history of causing volatility in the meme coin space. His past tweets, jokes, and even temporary changes to X’s logo previously fueled massive rallies in Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme-inspired cryptocurrency. Musk’s close association with Dogecoin even led to a 2022 class-action lawsuit that accused him of manipulating its price through media appearances and social media activity. That case was ultimately withdrawn in November of 2024, but it shed some light on just how powerful his market influence can be. The timing of Musk’s latest post also happened as the meme coin market struggled to recover from a series of sharp sell-offs earlier this month. Data from CoinMarketCap showed that on Oct. 11, the sector’s total value plunged by close to 40%, from $72 billion to $44 billion due to a wider crypto market crash. Although meme coins briefly rebounded, another wave of selling hit on Friday. Nearly $230 billion in overall crypto value was wiped out that day, but Musk’s viral post appears to have temporarily reignited optimism by reminding traders that even one tweet from him can still move markets. Dogecoin Buys Stake in Football Club In other meme coin-related news, the Dogecoin Foundation’s commercial branch, the House of Doge, took a major step into European sports by acquiring a majority stake in US Triestina Calcio 1918, one of Italy’s oldest football clubs. The move was announced Monday, and is Dogecoin’s boldest venture into professional football. Partnering with Brag House Holdings, Inc., the House of Doge became the “largest equity holder” in Triestina and plans to inject fresh capital into the struggling team to help fund football operations and community programs. According to the announcement , the investment was made to introduce modern crypto integrations into the club’s operations, including enabling Dogecoin payments for tickets, concessions, and merchandise during home matches. The House of Doge said the initiative will also help create a “modern payments structure” that enhances the match-day experience, supports the club’s financial stability, and expands the real-world use of Dogecoin. If successful, the partnership could give the meme coin more visibility among millions of football fans who watch Italy’s top-tier Serie A matches each week. Triestina was a founding member of Serie A in 1929, and spent decades in the lower divisions. In fact, it has not played in the top flight since 1958. The team currently sits at the bottom of Serie C and faces the risk of relegation to Serie C2, which is just one level above semi-professional football. The capital infusion from the House of Doge could therefore be vital in reviving the club’s fortunes both on and off the pitch. US Triestina Calcio 1918 The acquisition forms part of a growing trend of crypto firms investing in traditional sports to build brand recognition and utility. Solana-based Brera Holdings owns several clubs across Europe and beyond. For Dogecoin, this partnership is the latest in a series of efforts to expand its ecosystem. Earlier this year, the House of Doge collaborated with IndyCar driver Devlin DeFrancesco and Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing during the Indianapolis 500. DeFrancesco received part of his salary in DOGE and made a charitable donation in the same token.

The risk-on mood was established overnight by a robust finish on Wall Street, where concerns over U.S. regional banks eased and strong corporate earnings reports fueled buying. Meanwhile, Japanese shares hit new record highs amid expectations that Sanae Takaichi would become the next Prime Minister, signaling continued fiscal stimulus. Gold dipped to around $4,340 per ounce on Tuesday but remained close to the fresh record set in the previous session.

The Japanese yen weakened toward 151 per dollar on Tuesday, falling for the third straight session, as investors awaited a parliamentary vote expected to confirm Sanae Takaichi as Japan’s next prime minister. Sanae Takaichi won the lower house vote on Tuesday, officially becoming Japan’s first female prime minister. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 1.24% to above 3,880 while the Shenzhen Component gained 1.2% to 12,980 on Tuesday, with mainland stocks rising for the second straight session as easing Sino-US trade tensions continued to support market sentiment, and the offshore yuan inched up around 7.12 per dollar on Tuesday, nearing a four-week-high, supported by continued firm central bank guidance and signs of easing US-China trade tensions. Adding to the upbeat mood, President Donald Trump said he expects to reach a “fair deal” with China’s President Xi Jinping during their upcoming meeting in South Korea, tempering trade tensions. Meanwhile, Foxconn Industrial jumped 4% after Apple announced strong iPhone 17 sales in both the US and China. Foxconn is a major manufacturing partner for Apple.

India's net foreign direct investment turned negative in August 2025, marking the first time in the current fiscal year (2025/26), due to a moderation in gross inflows and a rise in repatriation. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.70% to 9,093 on Tuesday, extending gains from the previous session, as market sentiment remained buoyant amid progress on a key US-Australia trade agreement. The Australian dollar slipped to around $0.650 on Tuesday, breaking a two-day winning streak. U.S. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a USD 8.5 billion critical-minerals deal at the White House on Monday, aiming to secure access to Australia’s rich rare-earth resources as China tightens export rules. Domestically, investors now await flash PMI data, alongside speeches from RBA officials later this week. In the U.S. on Monday, all three major indexes ended higher on optimism over incoming earnings reports and fresh support from banks, while markets continued to assess the outlook of fewer trade barriers between the US and China. Investors now await Friday’s September CPI report for further insight, which was delayed due to the shutdown. U.S. stock futures were little changed on Tuesday as investors awaited a wave of major earnings reports, with Netflix, Coca-Cola, and General Motors set to release results later in the day: Dow +0.04% ; S&P 500 +0.04% ; Nasdaq +0.02% .

UpOnly NFT originated from the podcast show “UpOnly” hosted by Cobie, along with Ledger. The show invites top traders, project founders, fund managers, to discuss crypto trends. However, the program stalled roughly three years ago, following the FTX collapse in 2022 and the subsequent crypto winter. ‘When NFT is Burnt, Podcast Will Restart’: Cobie In May 2025, Cobie created a challenge that if someone burns the NFT, the program would return for another season. “OK I am no longer the decision maker on if UpOnly returns,” Cobie wrote in May. “The power is now stored within this NFT that I just minted. When the NFT is burned, the podcast will restart. Until then, please leave me alone.” OK I am no longer the decision maker on if Up Only returns. The power is now stored within this NFT that I just minted. When the NFT is burned, the podcast will restart. Until then, please leave me alone. https://t.co/5Mar75ifw6 — Cobie (@cobie) May 7, 2025 The offer however limited sponsorship rights or editorial control. Given the high dollar-amount set on the NFT, Cobie said at the time, “You couldn’t set a dollar amount on OpenSea so I just kept adding 0s till the number seemed too big for anyone to buy even as a joke.” On Tuesday, not only did Coinbase purchase UpOnly’s NFT, but it apparently overpaid the asking price of the non-fungible token . Soon after the Coinbase’s purchase, Jordan Fish, aka Cobie, conveyed his disbelief quite concisely . UpOnly Podcast Returns With ‘Eight Episodes’ According to the NFT fine print , the holder of the token “can compel Cobie and Ledger Status into performing, like monkeys, 8 episodes of UpOnlyTV.” “We are allowed to call you idiots for buying it, or ignore you completely with zero mentions of your existence during our 8-episode season,” the NFT description read. In a separate post on X, Cobie joked, “Im too old to have a crypto podcast imma be out here looking like Gary V.” “It has been 3 years since up only ended. I was in my 20s when it started, now I have grey hair. We will rename it Unc Only and I will spend $25m on cosmetic surgery. See ya soon.” It has been 3 years since up only ended.

Takaichi-san secured 237 votes out of 465 seats in the Lower House, a clean win that removed the need for any runoff. The victory followed a coalition agreement between the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Japan Innovation Party (JIP), finalized over the weekend. Under the deal, Takaichi will support several JIP-backed policies, including cutting the number of parliamentary seats, introducing free high school education, and enforcing a two-year suspension on the food consumption tax, according to a report from Reuters. Asian markets react to Takaichi’s leadership win The reaction on Tuesday morning was immediate. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.5% to reach a new all-time high, while the Topix index added 0.73%, both recording fresh records after Monday’s historic close. Market optimism spread quickly through the Asia-Pacific region, where traders followed the upward cues from Wall Street overnight. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index climbed by 1.17%, and the Hang Seng Tech Index advanced by 1.84%. Mainland China’s CSI 300 also surged by 0.3%, extending gains from the previous session. The U.S. tech rally, led by Apple’s stock surge, helped set the tone for the region’s trading day. In South Korea, markets stayed on an upward streak after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that Washington was “about to finish up” trade talks with Seoul. “The devil’s in the details, but we are ironing out the details,” Scott said during his interview. The comment lifted confidence across South Korean equities, with the Kospi index up roughly 61% year-to-date. Hyundai Motor shares climbed 6.45%, Kia Corp gained 4.28%, and Samsung Electronics added 1.73% by the end of trading. BOJ stance, global commodities, and U.S. earnings in focus A known conservative, Takaichi has often been described as a follower of Abenomics, the late Shinzo Abe’s signature economic model focused on easy money policies, fiscal expansion, and structural reforms. During the 2024 LDP leadership race, Takaichi-san criticized the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) plan to raise interest rates. Meanwhile, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda maintained that monetary policy would continue to be decided “without any preconceptions.” The yen got a slight boost, but it was mostly after BOJ board member Hajime Takata, who voted against keeping rates steady in September, reiterated his support for resuming hikes. The US dollar strengthened 0.08% to 150.710 yen, while the euro slipped 0.06% to $1.164. On the commodities front, spot gold dipped by 0.3% to $4,340.99 per ounce by 04:56 GMT, after touching a record $4,381.21 the day before. U.S. gold futures stayed flat at $4,357.80, while silver fell 1.2% to $51.83, platinum eased by 0.7% to $1,627.53, and palladium ticked up by 0.1% to $1,497.62. In the United States, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 33 points, less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures stayed slightly positive. Investors were preparing for a heavy week of corporate earnings, with Netflix and Coca-Cola set to release results on Tuesday, followed by Tesla on Wednesday. Analysts at Bank of America have said that around 75% of S&P 500 firms reporting so far had beaten earnings forecasts. The AI-driven momentum remained strong, with the “Magnificent 7” tech giants — including Apple , Microsoft, and others — expected to post 14.9% year-over-year profit growth, compared to 6.7% for the rest of the index, according to FactSet.

SOL price is now consolidating losses below $200 and might decline further below $182. SOL price started a fresh decline below $212 and $200 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a key rising channel with support at $188 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start another increase if the bulls defend $182 or $175. Solana Price Dips Again Solana price extended gains above $200 and $202, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL even surpassed $210 before the bears appeared. A high was formed near $208 and the price dropped. There was a move below $200 and $182. A low was formed at $174, and the price recently attempted a minor recovery wave. It climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $208 swing high to the $174 low. However, the bears remained active below $195. They protected the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $208 swing high to the $174 low. SOL is again moving below $190. Besides, there was a break below a key rising channel with support at $188 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading below $188 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $188 level. The next major resistance is near the $195 level. The main resistance could be $200. A successful close above the $200 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $208. Any more gains might send the price toward the $215 level. Downside Continuation In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $195 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $182 zone. The first major support is near the $175 level. A break below the $175 level might send the price toward the $165 support zone. If there is a close below the $165 support, the price could decline toward the $150 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is below the 50 level.

This uptick is part of its ongoing pre-launch activities that started on April 1, aiming at ramping up community support and securing adequate funds before its official launch. The Ascend of Husky Inu HINU's pricing strategy seems to be effectively engaging early investors, with the token's price being adjusted upwards every two days. This dynamic approach towards pricing has been crucial in reaching significant fundraising milestones, with the project successfully accumulating $903,126 towards a goal of $1.2 million. Significant Milestones and Future Plans Building up to its anticipated launch, Husky Inu has been setting funding milestones, each a testament to its growing investor confidence and community support. Notable milestones such as the $750,000 mark on May 16 and the $900,000 level earlier this month highlight the project's progressive financial backing. The continual financial achievements underscore the community's trust and the developers' dedication. With the official launch projected for March 27, 2026, the project team is also open to potentially moving the date forward, contingent on forthcoming strategic reviews and market conditions. These reviews aim to optimize the launch timing, ensuring it aligns with market readiness and investor interest. The upcoming review on January 1, 2026, will be particularly crucial in this planning phase. Wider Cryptocurrency Market Trends The broader cryptocurrency market has mirrored the enthusiasm around Husky Inu, with major currencies posting gains. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, has seen a nearly 3% increase, trading around $110,291. Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL) have also seen upward movements, contributing to a bullish market environment this week.

Japan Considering Allowing Banks To Offer Crypto-Related Services As reported by Japanese newspaper Yomiuri, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is considering allowing banks to acquire and hold digital assets like Bitcoin for investment purposes. This reform, if enacted, would change the banking landscape in the East Asian nation. Currently, banks are prohibited from making cryptocurrency acquisitions for the purpose of investments under FSA guidelines introduced in 2020. Under the new regulation, banks would be able to trade Bitcoin and other digital assets in a similar way to stocks and government bonds. There would also be certain safeguards to ensure the institutions’ financial stability. This isn’t the only rule change the FSA is looking at. According to the report, the regulator is also discussing permitting banking groups to register as “crypto exchange operators.” As these exchange operators, they will be able to offer digital asset trading and exchange services directly to customers. The intent behind the move is to make it easier for retail investors to participate in the cryptocurrency sector through institutions that are well-regulated and highly credible. The reform will be taken up in the next working group meeting of the Financial System Council, a government advisory panel under the Prime Minister. Whether the rule change will ultimately come to pass remains to be seen. In some other news, Beijing has put a roadblock on Hong Kong’s stablecoin plans, according to the Financial Times . Hong Kong launched its stablecoin legislature earlier this year, making it so that institutions seeking to issue fiat-tied cryptocurrencies in the region have to obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Several high profile names like Ant Group and JD.com had lined up to register with HKMA, with the first batch of licenses expected to arrive next year. It seems, however, that the tech giants have now put their plans on ice after Chinese regulators urged them not to move ahead, raising concerns about the rise of currencies controlled by the private sector. While China continues to be cautious about stablecoins, the rest of the world has been moving forward in adoption of these digital assets, including other Asian countries. According to a Friday report , three major Japanese banks are preparing to issue a yen-backed token before the end of the year. Separately, an earlier report from August noted that four major South Korean financial institutions were in talks with Tether and Circle, the issuers of the two largest stablecoins, USDT and USDC. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin has seen a jump of around 3% over the past day, recovering back above the $110,600 mark.

However, some analysts have advised caution as BTC’s next leg up could be delayed until December. Related Reading: XRP DEX Volumes Surge As Price Plunges: Smart Money Accumulating? Bitcoin To Move Sideways Until December? After the end-of-week market downturn, Bitcoin has bounced to the $110,000 level and is attempting to turn this area into support again. Notably, the flagship crypto has been trading within the $108,000-$120,000 price range since July. Last week, BTC recorded its second drop below the range lows, falling to the $103,500 mark on Friday. Over the weekend, the cryptocurrency’s price stabilized and reclaimed the $106,000-$108,000 area. Now, Bitcoin has recovered 6.2% from the recent lows and could potentially target higher levels in the short term. Analyst Crypto Kaleo pointed out that BTC’s multi-year ascending trendline has held as support despite the recent retest and overall sentiment turning bearish, suggesting that investors should “be more bullish.” Similarly, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted that despite the current market sentiment, which shows the Fear and Greed index remains at fear levels, the flagship crypto is “still perfectly holding that flipped resistance level,” around $108,000, and is holding it as support. “Not sure if this is the place to turn bearish. Support is support, until it is not,” the analyst affirmed. Altcoin Sherpa also shared a positive outlook, emphasizing that BTC’s chart doesn’t look “that bad when you zoom out,” as it remains in the same multi-month price range and could challenge the $114,000-$115,000 area. Nonetheless, the analyst cautioned that it may be “too early to really call any sort of bullish reversal,” forecasting that the cryptocurrency will likely see “a ton of chop over the next 6-8 weeks, and we range between 100k-115k and hopefully have a nice December.” $114,000-$116,000 Area Remains Key Rekt Capital stated that as long as the price holds the current levels, it could move to the $114,000 area for a key trend continuation across its range and potentially revisit the highs. To achieve this, the analyst explained that Bitcoin must reclaim its 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as support, which was lost after Sunday’s close below the $110,000 mark. The 21-week EMA has served as support during pullbacks since late Q2. He explained that the cycle has been one of downside deviations, with price weekly closing below key levels and positioning for a bearish retest before successfully reclaiming these levels as support and rallying higher. Based on this, “it’s not a given that price will reject from the 21-week EMA.” The analyst also shared an outlook for BTC’s range in the monthly timeframe, where it has been consolidating while upside wicking beyond the range high and downside wicking below the range low since July. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Moves: Can It Repeat The 36,000% Rally ‘Anomaly’ From Last Cycle? “As part of this consolidation, there is a potential Lower High developing which isn’t yet solidified; the upcoming Monthly Close will inform more about whether that indeed will become a resistance,” he detailed Rekt Capital concluded that a monthly close above the Lower High would invalidate the potential setup, and a close above the range high resistance would position Bitcoin for a range breakout, “especially if a November post-breakout retest of $116k into new support takes place.” As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $110,850, a 2% increase in the daily timeframe.

The company scooped up $250 million in ETH from Bitgo and Kraken on Monday, according to Arkham Intelligence which said “These accounts match Bitmine’s prior acquisition pattern.” “Will Tom Lee ever stop buying?” 3.2 Million ETH Holdings The wallets purchased 63,538 ETH this week and a whopping 379,271 ETH last week. This brings the total to 442,809 ETH worth around $1.74 billion at current prices purchased since the market crash. This aggressive dip buying , which Bitcoin treasurys have not replicated, has pushed BitMine’s total to around 3.17 million ETH, but the company has yet to confirm the most recent purchases officially. This would give it around 2.6% of the entire supply of the asset, and over 50% towards its target of 5%. From 163,000 ETH to 3.24 MILLION ETH in just 3 months. Bitmine’s accumulation is historic, week after week, they’ve been loading the bags nonstop: July 14 — 163K Aug 10 — 1.15M Sept 14 — 2.15M Oct 19 — 3.24M At this pace, they’re on track to control 5% of all $ETH in… pic.twitter.com/skfLh9vQAi — BMNR Bullz (@BMNRBullz) October 20, 2025 BitMine chairman Tom Lee is confident that this is not the top of the crypto cycle. “So I think we’re at the basement and working our way back up,” he told CNBC on Friday. Lee has also recently stated that BitMine is preparing to roll out its own Ethereum staking solution very soon. Coinbase is also bullish about fourth quarter momentum for crypto markets and the influence of digital asset treasurys (DATs). “Looking at the supply/demand picture, it’s hard to overstate the impact that digital asset treasury companies have had on markets this year,” wrote David Duong, head of research at Coinbase Institutional, in a recent research paper. Ether Prices Retreat The same crypto market pattern has playing out daily: Asia pumps markets with buying, and America dumps with selling, preventing any sustained upward momentum. As a result, Ether prices have fallen back below $4,000 again. ETH hit an intraday high of $4,080 in early trading on Monday, but sustained selling pressure on the US timezone pushed it back down to $3,940 where it currently trades. The asset has only seen a marginal recovery from its double dip in October and needs to clear $4,000, and stay above it, to see any real progress. Ethereum’s weekly chart is “loading a monster move” with a double retest of the exponential moving average, observed analyst ‘Merlijn the Trader” who added that it pumped 70% last time this was seen.

Here’s the Destination,https://timestabloid.com/chris-larsen-stuns-xrp-army-with-50m-xrp-transfer-heres-the-destination/,"A sudden transfer of 50 million XRP, valued at roughly $123.8 million, from Ripple executive Chris Larsen to an unidentified wallet prompted strong reactions within the XRP community. While such wallet movements are not uncommon in the digital asset space, this particular transaction led to fresh speculation about potential coordination between Ripple and U.S. regulatory entities. Crypto Expert Weighs In Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX), a well-known community commentator, shared his perspective shortly after Whale Alert reported the whopping transaction. He suggested that the transfer might signal deeper activity behind the scenes, outlining two main possibilities. One involved the idea that Ripple and the U.S. government could be working together during the shutdown period to finalize certain projects. The other centered on the belief that spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to XRP might be approved unexpectedly through procedural “loopholes.” He linked the timing of the movement to what he described as a potential effort between Ripple and government entities, suggesting that the shutdown could be a strategic window for progress on regulatory or market initiatives. Why Did Larsen Transfer 50 Million XRP? Shortly afterward, Larsen provided context for the wallet movement. In a post on X, he congratulated the Evernorth team on its launch and revealed that he invested 50 million XRP in the firm. He described Evernorth as filling “the missing link in XRP capital markets” and expanding the token’s use in decentralized finance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Evernorth positions itself as a platform dedicated to building infrastructure that connects XRP liquidity with decentralized finance applications. The firm, designed to operate as a public XRP treasury, has announced plans to go public through a merger expected to raise over $1 billion in gross proceeds . It aims to develop products that make it easier for institutions and developers to integrate XRP into lending, trading, and other DeFi mechanisms. Larsen’s 50 million XRP investment represents one of the largest individual contributions toward that goal, reflecting Ripple leadership’s continued commitment to expanding XRP’s role within decentralized finance . Remi Relief later released an update confirming that the tokens had been sent to Evernorth. However, he maintained that his earlier statements about potential government cooperation and ETF approvals still stood. He argued that even though the funds went toward a legitimate investment, the timing and conditions surrounding the movement kept his original theories relevant.

The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has started the week in positive territory, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and other cryptocurrencies trading in the green. Husky Inu (HINU) Rises To $0.00021673 Husky Inu (HINU) completed the latest price jump of its per-launch phase over the weekend, rising from $0.00021610 to $0.00021673. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, and has seen regular price increases. It aims to empower the Husky Inu community and continue its fundraising efforts as the launch date approaches. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to increase the HINU token’s value every two days. This has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross key fundraising milestones. It has also helped Husky Inu raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community, rewarding early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth. Husky Inu has also crossed the $900,000 fundraising milestone and has raised $903,126 so far. The project remains on track to reach its fundraising goal of $1.2 million as its official launch date approaches. Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 earlier this month. Official Launch Date Husky Inu has experienced remarkable growth and interest over its presale and pre-launch phases. The community has grown in strength and numbers, thanks to the dedication and enthusiasm of each member. The project’s official launch date, March 27, 2026, is just over six months away. Our goal has always been long-term growth and success, not short-term hype. However, the possibility of an earlier launch is open. The Husky Inu team will conduct a series of strategic meetings to assess market conditions and determine the optimal time to launch the project. The first two reviews were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025. The third review is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Cryptocurrency Market Starts New Week In Positive Territory Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has started the week positively. Bitcoin (BTC) is up almost 3%, trading around $110,291, while Ethereum (ETH) has reclaimed the $4,000 mark, trading around $4,038. Ripple (XRP) is up over 3%, and Solana (SOL) is up 2.57%, trading around $191. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 5%, while Cardano (ADA) is up 4.54%, trading around $0.663.

Andrew Cuomo Promises Crypto Reforms If Elected To Office New York City mayoral hopeful Andrew Cuomo plans to win over residents by promising to make the city the “global hub of the future.” Cuomo also plans to appoint a chief innovation officer (CIO) to lead efforts if elected as mayor. The mayoral hopeful outlined several emerging technologies, including cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and biotech, as key pillars for his run. Cuomo stated, “The next Mayor must make sure we’re also leading in the technologies that will define the next century — AI, blockchain, and biotech. That’s what this position is about: Keeping New York City not just competitive, but dominant in the global innovation economy.” Cuomo also plans to form an “innovation council” that will advise the CIO on policy development, industry standards, and consumer protection. The council will consist of three advisory committees, one for each of the focus areas. The crypto and blockchain advisory council will replace outdated regulations with an up-to-date framework promoting innovation while protecting consumer interests. Arthur Hayes Looking To Raise $250M For New Fund Maelstrom, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes’ family office, is seeking $250 million for a new fund that will look to acquire buyouts of distressed or undervalued crypto infrastructure and services companies. The fund will look to acquire equity stakes in trading and data analytics platforms, and will complete the deals through special purpose vehicles. According to sources, Maelstrom will assign between $40 million and $75 million towards each acquisition. Akshat Vaidya, Maelstrom’s co-founder and managing partner, stated that the fund will acquire crypto platforms that have strong fundamentals, clear valuations, and income-generating models. Strategy Can Convert Capital Into Bitcoin (BTC) In Hours: Michael Saylor Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has said that Bitcoin treasury companies like Strategy can turn fresh capital into BTC almost instantly. Saylor also posted a fresh teaser about another BTC purchase on Sunday. The Strategy executive chairman stated during an interview, “The investment cycle is a thousand times faster than technology, real estate, oil and gas, or anything else you’ve ever seen before in your life. Sometimes we’re literally selling 50 million an hour or 100 million an hour and buying the $100 million of Bitcoin the same hour. Like we could do a billion dollars of capital raising in a day, and we might have 20 million of exposure at 4 pm, and by 5 pm, 6 pm, we’re fully done.” Strategy is preparing to buy more BTC even as treasury companies face growing pressure after a sharp drop in net asset value (NAV). Strategy’s BTC purchases are often viewed as a bullish catalyst for the asset. Strategy is the largest corporate holder of BTC, with 640,250 BTC after its latest purchase on October 13. According to Saylor, Strategy can accumulate BTC and provide a return for investors far quicker than other avenues. “You can essentially sell it before you build. We’re literally building it in real time. We’re open for business every day with four credit ATMs. If someone hit the bid and wanted to buy $500 million in a minute, we could build a building in a minute. In 60 seconds. Trade is done. Cash changes hands. We create the collateral. We bought the Bitcoin underlying that day.” President Trump Confirms Meeting With Xi Jinping US President Donald Trump has confirmed he will be meeting Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Seoul, South Korea. Trump had previously stated he would not be meeting the Chinese president following a dramatic escalation in trade tensions between the US and China. “We're going to meet in a couple of weeks. We're going to meet in South Korea, with President Xi and other people, too. [Xi Jinping] is a very strong leader, a very amazing man. You can look at what he's done, where he is in his life. It is an amazing story. It's a story for a great movie. I think we're gonna be fine with China, but we have to have a fair deal. It's going to be fair.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week on a bullish note, up over 2%. The flagship cryptocurrency has reclaimed the $111,000 level and is trading around $111,088. BTC steadied itself over the weekend after enduring almost two weeks of selling pressure, rising 0.70% on Saturday and 1.37% on Sunday to settle at 108,676. However, the Crypto Fear& Greed index remains in “fear” territory. Data from Coinglass revealed that one of the biggest reasons behind the market rebound is confirmation that senior Chinese officials will be meeting with representatives from the US to resolve trade issues ahead of the APEC summit in South Korea. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the developments. The news comes as a relief for traders and investors. The US and China witnessed a dramatic escalation in trade tensions, sparking fears of another round of trade tariffs. China recently stated it would restrict exports of rare earth minerals to the US, a move that could potentially disrupt key sectors. It also hinted at retaliation against any new tariffs, adding that it no longer relies on American chips. Analysts believe several near-term catalysts are driving the recovery. The Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting is set for October 28-29, with investors anticipating a 25 bps rate cut. Lower interest rates typically weaken the dollar and support risk assets like BTC. New spot ETF filings have also buoyed investor sentiment, helping price recovery. Analysts believe approval of the ETF proposals of the XRP and Solana ETFs could boost institutional capital and further strengthen the market. However, some analysts fear the rally could be a dead-cat bounce, where prices bounce back temporarily before resuming the downtrend. BTC trader Daan Crypto Trades believes there is more volatility to come, stating, “Volatility is definitely high here due to the thin books post this massive market flush. Books are thin. Especially after the massive liquidation event last week. This, combined with weekend price action and a lot of emotional traders, makes for relatively volatile moves on low timeframes.” BTC and the broader crypto market crashed last Friday (October 10), after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls for software. The announcement was made in retaliation for China's imposition of restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. As a result, BTC plunged to $102,000 on Binance before recovering and settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 2% to $110,768. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, markets recovered on Sunday as BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. Source: TradingView The price faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday, ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $115,274. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $109,945. It recovered from this level to reclaim $113,000 and settle at $113,068, ultimately dropping 1.91%. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 2% to $110,804. Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday as BTC fell below $110,000 and settled at $108,198. The price plunged to a low of $103,516 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $106,463, ultimately dropping 1.60%. BTC rose on Saturday, rising 0.70% to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,208. Buyers retained control on Sunday as the price rose over 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,676. BTC has reclaimed $111,000 during the ongoing session and is trading around $111,060, up over 2%. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has started the week in bullish territory and has reclaimed the $4,000 level. The altcoin steadied itself over the weekend, rising 1.52% on Saturday and settling at 3,892. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rose over 2% and settled at $3,985. ETH is up 1.42% during the ongoing session, trading around $4,041. ETH’s recovery wave began on Saturday after the altcoin plunged to a low of $3,680 on Friday, forming a low around this level. The altcoin is facing resistance around $4,050, with the first major resistance sitting around $4,200. A clean break above these levels could send the price towards $4,500. On the other hand, if ETH fails to clear this level, it could begin a fresh downtrend that could drive the price towards $3,800 or lower. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs registered sharp outflows for the week ending Friday. Despite ETH’s price struggles last week, Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies, remains bullish about the asset. BitMine has accumulated a staggering $1.5 billion in ETH since the crash. The accumulation indicates BitMine and Lee’s conviction about ETH, despite Lee recently warning that the hype around digital asset treasuries (DAT) may be coming to an end. BitMine has made three major purchases since last Friday’s market crash, although the acquisitions are yet to be officially confirmed by the company. BitMine has established itself as the largest Ether treasury company, holding more than 3 million ETH, worth $11.7 billion. The company intends to hold 5% of ETH’s supply. Lee stated in a recent discussion with ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, “Ethereum could flip Bitcoin, similar to how Wall Street and equities flipped gold post 71.” Lee suggested that BTC and ETH could rise the same way the US Dollar rose to dominance in 1971 after President Nixon made it fully synthetic and no longer backed by gold. “When that happened, the immediate beneficiary was demand and a market to own gold. However, in response, Wall Street created products that made the dollar dominant, and the market cap of equities today is 40 trillion compared to 2 trillion for gold. Dollar dominance by the end of that period went from 27% in GDP terms to 57% of central bank reserves, and 80% of financial transactions, quotes. Dollar dominance is going to be the opportunity for Ethereum.” ETH plunged to an intraday low of $3,444 on Friday (October 10) after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese imports and export controls on key software. It recovered from this level to settle at $3,836, ultimately dropping over 12%. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the fell 2.21% to $3,752. ETH recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 11% to reclaim $4,000 and settle at $4,158. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose over 2% and settled at $4,224. ETH plunged to an intraday low of $3,895 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $4,000 and settle at $4,129, ultimately dropping $4,129.

ETH has reclaimed the $4,000 mark during the ongoing session and is trading around $4,051. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) recovered over the weekend and is looking to reclaim the $200 mark after starting the week in positive territory. SOL is trading in an ascending channel, with steady accumulation around the $190 mark. According to analysts, the setup shows that each retest of the price’s lower levels is being met with strong buyer reaction, indicating that bulls are defending key support levels. The weekend recovery suggests that momentum could be returning, and a possible breakout towards $220 is possible if SOL reclaims $200. Analysts also pointed out that SOL’s current structure aligns with previous accumulation phases, generally seen before major rallies. They also point out that as long as SOL maintains its position above $180, the setup favors a continuation within the rising channel. “Everyone’s watching Bitcoin, but Solana might be the next big breakout story. It’s coiling inside a tight ascending channel, now absorbing supply near $190. Each retest of the lower trendline has found buyers faster, not slower. If this is an accumulation pattern, the next leg could be 50% higher.” SOL started the previous weekend deep in bearish territory as markets crashed. As a result, the price tanked to an intraday low of $170 before settling at $188, ultimately dropping over 14%. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell almost 6% to $177. SOL made a strong recovery on Sunday, rising nearly 11% and settling at $197. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, rising almost 6% to reclaim $200 and settle at $208.

SOL is up over 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $191 despite volatility and selling pressure.

This resurgence is led by major players in the space, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) , both showing robust performances over the weekend. Market Dynamics and Major Cryptocurrencies' Performance Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, trading between $107,000 and $108,000 over the weekend, finally closing at a strong $108,676 on Sunday. The premier cryptocurrency has continued its upward trajectory, currently trading around $110,731. This represents a more than 4% increase during the ongoing session. Ethereum, on the other hand, has successfully reclaimed the $4,000 mark, registering nearly a 5% increase with its current price hovering around $4,058. Other cryptocurrencies like Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) have also posted gains of 5% and 4%, respectively. Notably, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) have seen an increase of over 7%, while other altcoins like Chainlink (LINK) and Stellar (XLM) are not far behind, recording 11% and 6% increases respectively.

However, market sentiment remains cautious, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index still in “Fear” territory at 30. Bitcoin Profit Taking Keeping Prices Subdued Analysts believe Bitcoin’s price action will remain subdued until long-term holders take profits. According to analyst James Check, the crypto market’s failure to recover was due to selling pressure, not manipulation, paper Bitcoin, or suppression. According to Check, the volume of sell-side pressure from Bitcoin holders is the source of resistance at the moment. According to crypto investor Will Clemente, the last year of relative weakness for the flagship cryptocurrency has largely been due to a supply transfer from Bitcoin OGs to traditional finance. “This dynamic will be mostly irrelevant in the coming years, just as everyone is focused on BTC’s relative weakness.” Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz echoed the same sentiment in an interview with Raoul Pal, stating, “There are a lot of people in the Bitcoin world who had rode this so long and finally decided, ‘I wanna buy something. People trimming because they’ve had a great run and we’re just digesting that turnover.” Meanwhile, BTC held on to a key level between $108,000 and $109,000, with analyst Rekt Capital stating, “Continued holding here could see the price rally to $120k+ over time. Stability here is absolutely key.” Strategy Can Convert Capital Into Bitcoin (BTC) In Hours: Michael Saylor Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has said that Bitcoin treasury companies like Strategy can turn fresh capital into BTC almost instantly. Saylor also posted a fresh teaser about another BTC purchase on Sunday. The Strategy executive chairman stated during an interview, “The investment cycle is a thousand times faster than technology, real estate, oil and gas, or anything else you’ve ever seen before in your life. Sometimes we’re literally selling 50 million an hour or 100 million an hour and buying the $100 million of Bitcoin the same hour. Like we could do a billion dollars of capital raising in a day, and we might have 20 million of exposure at 4 pm, and by 5 pm, 6 pm, we’re fully done.” Strategy is preparing to buy more BTC even as treasury companies face growing pressure after a sharp drop in net asset value (NAV). Strategy’s BTC purchases are often viewed as a bullish catalyst for the asset. Strategy is the largest corporate holder of BTC , with 640,250 BTC after its latest purchase on October 13. According to Saylor, Strategy can accumulate BTC and provide a return for investors far quicker than other avenues. “You can essentially sell it before you build. We’re literally building it in real time. We’re open for business every day with four credit ATMs. If someone hit the bid and wanted to buy $500 million in a minute, we could build a building in a minute. In 60 seconds. Trade is done. Cash changes hands. We create the collateral. We bought the Bitcoin underlying that day.” Most Institutions Retain Positive Bitcoin Outlook A survey by Coinbase has revealed that almost two-thirds of institutional investors retain a positive outlook for Bitcoin. David Duong, head of research at Coinbase Institutional, stated in a research report that most respondents are bullish about Bitcoin over the next few months. The institutional investor survey had 124 respondents, with 67% reporting a positive outlook. Duong also added that Bitcoin treasury companies were buying the dip, stating, “Looking at the supply/demand picture, it’s hard to overstate the impact that digital asset treasury companies have had on markets this year.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has made a strong start to the week and has reclaimed the $110,000 level. The flagship cryptocurrency fell to an intraday low of $103,516 on Friday but recovered over the weekend, rising 0.70% on Saturday and 1.37% on Sunday to settle at $108,676. The price is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $110,697. Selling pressure eased over the weekend, allowing BTC to recover. However, analysts expect markets to remain volatile, and investors will be cautious ahead of the FOMC meeting. Daan Crypto Trades stated in a post on X, “Volatility is definitely high here due to the thin books post this massive market flush. Books are thin. Especially after the massive liquidation event last week. This combined with weekend price action and a lot of emotional traders makes for relatively volatile moves on low timeframes.” Meanwhile, data from CoinGlass put liquidations over the past 24 hours at over $200 million. One of the biggest reasons behind the market rebound is confirmation that senior Chinese officials will be meeting with representatives from the US to resolve trade issues ahead of the APEC summit in South Korea. Analysts believe several near-term catalysts are driving the recovery. The Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting is set for October 28-29, with investors anticipating a 25 bps rate cut. Lower interest rates typically weaken the dollar and support risk assets like BTC . New spot ETF filings have also buoyed investor sentiment, helping price recovery. Analysts believe approval of the ETF proposals of the XRP and Solana ETFs could boost institutional capital and further strengthen the market. BTC and the broader crypto market crashed last Friday (October 10), after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls for software. The announcement was made in retaliation for China's imposition of restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. As a result, BTC plunged to $102,000 on Binance before recovering and settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 2% to $110,768. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, markets recovered on Sunday as BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067.

Data from Onchain Lens , which cited Hyperbot, shows the trader now holds 900 BTC in short positions valued at roughly $99.6m. The trade, placed with 10x leverage, is currently showing an unrealized or “floating” loss of about $1.1m.

Earlier this week, he deposited $30m in USDC to Hyperliquid before opening a Bitcoin short worth $76m . Just days earlier, he expanded his exposure again as Bitcoin attempted to recover from last week’s crash. Blockchain data suggests the same wallet entered around $115,783, bringing his total short exposure to 3,440 BTC valued at $392.6m at the time. Those positions briefly yielded about $5.7m in unrealized profit before prices rebounded. His latest $22m expansion signals that the trader expects further downside despite the recent stabilization in Bitcoin markets. The timing has drawn attention across crypto circles, with many traders speculating that the investor is positioning for another market correction. Reputation Built On Sharp Timing As Whale Profited From Bitcoin Downturns Linked To News Events The wallet first gained fame after reportedly earning $160m by shorting Bitcoin shortly before US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement triggered a sell-off. That timing led online communities to label the account the “Trump insider,” a name that has stuck through several high-profile trades. While the trader’s strategy has so far proved opportunistic, it remains uncertain whether this new bearish bet will pay off. Bitcoin’s funding rates have turned negative in recent sessions, suggesting growing caution in futures markets. Two Expected Fed Rate Cuts Could Unlock Trillions In Cash Sitting On The Sidelines At the same time, sentiment among institutional investors is turning more optimistic. A recent Coinbase Institutional report found that 67% of professional investors expect a major Bitcoin rally in the next three to six months. That optimism comes as central banks are widely expected to ease monetary policy. Coinbase forecasts two more rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve this quarter, a move that could release some of the $7 trillion currently parked in money market funds. However, uncertainty remains. Both institutional and retail investors view the macroeconomic environment as the biggest near-term risk for digital assets. Market observers say this mix of optimism and caution could fuel higher volatility as Bitcoin hovers near key technical levels. For now, the “Trump insider” appears to be betting that the next major move will be down, and that the market has yet to price in the pressure ahead fully.

53444213,https://nulltx.com/?p=152421,1761029046,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,HumidiFi Overtakes Solana DEX Leaders in Silent $34B Breakout,https://nulltx.com/humidifi-overtakes-solana-dex-leaders-in-silent-34b-breakout/,"Solana’s DeFi landscape has a new heavyweight. @HumidiFi_ has quietly surged to the top, overtaking every major decentralized exchange on the network. According to data from @DefiLlama, the platform logged $1.1 billion in 24-hour volume, $9.7 billion over the past week, and a massive $34 billion in 30 days, surpassing established giants like Meteora, Raydium, and Pump. That makes HumidiFi not just a rising player, but the largest DEX on Solana. The Silent Giant of Solana DeFi HumidiFi operates differently. It has no public frontend. Trades are executed privately through aggregators using a quoting model that conceals order details. In other words, it runs as a “dark pool”, a private liquidity venue where large orders can be executed without revealing size, price, or direction. While this structure keeps it largely out of public sight, it has made HumidiFi the preferred choice for whales, market makers, and professional traders who value execution quality and privacy over transparency. This quiet dominance has shifted the narrative of Solana DeFi. It’s no longer just about open liquidity pools, it’s about efficient execution behind the curtain. Dark Pools: Solana’s New Trend A new wave is forming across Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. Dark pool AMMs, or “private automated market makers”, are capturing an increasing share of the chain’s total trading activity. Data from Blockworks Research shows that last week alone, Solana’s dark AMMs processed over $6 billion, accounting for nearly 30% of all on-chain trading. HumidiFi led the charge, handling $3 billion of that total, roughly 15% of all Solana trading volume. This marks a major cultural shift: from full transparency to trade efficiency and privacy. For traders, that’s a significant evolution. In traditional AMMs, every order is public, visible to bots and front-runners, exposing traders to slippage and copy-trading risks. Dark pools solve that by hiding trade details until execution, giving large traders an edge. What Makes HumidiFi Different HumidiFi isn’t your typical DEX. It’s a proprietary AMM (prop AMM), meaning it operates with its own liquidity model and execution logic. Rather than listing tokens on an open interface, it routes liquidity through aggregators like Jupiter and Meteora’s vaults. Users may not even realize they’re executing through HumidiFi when swapping tokens, yet it’s often HumidiFi handling the trade in the background. This stealth-like model gives the platform an edge in speed, liquidity depth, and anonymity. By removing a public-facing interface, HumidiFi avoids the pitfalls of heavy traffic, front-end exploits, and MEV (miner extractable value) attacks that plague public DEXs. Instead, it serves as the invisible engine behind Solana’s largest trades. Why Traders Are Moving to the Dark Side Traders are not just chasing hype, they’re chasing results. Large players, or “whales,” often face slippage when executing million-dollar orders on public DEXs. Their transactions can move the market before they’re even complete. HumidiFi fixes this by executing orders privately, protecting them from copycats and frontrunners. For professional trading firms, that’s gold. It ensures better execution quality, lower price impact, and greater control over strategy visibility. It’s not just whales either. Even mid-level DeFi users are starting to favor private AMMs for their smoother experience and lower volatility exposure. The Numbers Tell the Story The growth curve is steep. From zero visibility six months ago to $34 billion in monthly trading volume, HumidiFi’s rise is unprecedented. According to @DefiLlama, that’s higher than Raydium’s $29B, Meteora’s $22B, and Pump’s $16B during the same period. Meanwhile, HumidiFi’s daily average exceeds $1B, a level that places it not only ahead on Solana but competitive with smaller Ethereum-based DEXs. For context, major DEXs like Sushiswap and PancakeSwap fluctuate around similar daily volumes, proof that Solana’s dark liquidity model is maturing fast. The Trade-Off: Privacy vs Transparency But this new model comes with trade-offs. While dark pools improve efficiency, they reduce visibility. Without a public order book, there’s less insight into where liquidity sits or how trades are being routed. That raises questions about centralization and oversight. Who controls these private AMMs? Who verifies fair pricing? Aggregators like Jupiter have attempted to balance this with audits and integration frameworks. Still, not all players are known. Anonymous operators like ZeroFi and GoonFi remain unverified, sparking concerns within the Solana community about hidden influence and potential manipulation. Transparency is the cost of performance, and Solana’s DeFi scene is now testing where that balance lies. Community Reaction and On-Chain Buzz The reaction on X (formerly Twitter) has been loud, despite HumidiFi’s quiet approach. As noted by @SolanaFloor, HumidiFi’s dominance marks a defining moment for Solana’s DeFi market, where invisible protocols are driving visible volume.

HumidiFi’s success is more than a leaderboard milestone. It reflects a deeper change in how DeFi participants think about trading. Solana’s speed and low fees already made it attractive to retail users. Now, with dark AMMs like HumidiFi, it’s becoming a magnet for sophisticated capital, the kind that once lived exclusively on centralized exchanges. As volumes rise and privacy tools expand, Solana could become the first blockchain to normalize private liquidity as a standard. Whether that’s a step forward or a compromise depends on what traders value more, visibility or results. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

53444103,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=841002,1761029153,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53444103.jpeg,Reid Hoffman defends Anthropic amid feud with David Sacks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/reid-hoffman-anthropic-david-sacks/,"Two original members of the PayPal mafia, Reid Hoffman and David Sacks, are dragging their decades-old relationship into a public AI brawl. The dispute, which exploded on X on Monday, centers on Anthropic, a San Francisco-based AI company backed by Reid. David, who now serves as President Donald Trump’s handpicked AI and crypto czar, attacked the startup last week for what he described as regulatory fear tactics. Reid, who helped co-found LinkedIn and sits on Microsoft’s board, fired back hard. “Anthropic, along with some others (incl Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI) are trying to deploy AI the right way, thoughtfully, safely, and enormously beneficial for society,” Reid posted. “That’s why I am intensely rooting for their success.” Reid confirms stake in Anthropic and backs their AI approach Reid revealed that Greylock, the firm where he’s a partner, has also invested in Anthropic. That came on top of his previous early stake in OpenAI, making him one of the few tech insiders with money in both AI rivals. He said he usually avoids public commentary about the two companies but made an exception this time. “In all industries, especially in AI, it’s important to back the good guys,” Reid wrote in the same X thread. Reid has been sitting on Microsoft’s board since 2017, shortly after selling LinkedIn to the company for $26 billion. That same Microsoft now stands as OpenAI’s primary partner and funder, with its Azure infrastructure powering GPT models across sectors. Despite the conflict of interest, Reid still went out of his way to defend Anthropic, which was founded in 2021 by several OpenAI defectors who left over safety disagreements. The original rift between Reid and David has nothing to do with AI. It’s political. Both men were part of PayPal’s founding team back in 1999, along with Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Max Levchin, but have since landed on opposite ends of the political universe. Reid is one of the top Democratic donors in Silicon Valley. He gave millions to Kamala Harris’s failed presidential campaign. David, meanwhile, went full MAGA, hosted a Trump fundraiser at his San Francisco home, and now runs federal tech policy from inside the White House. Sacks accuses Anthropic of regulatory fear-mongering The flashpoint came last week, when Jack Clark, Anthropic’s policy chief and co-founder, published an essay titled “Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear.” The post argued for thoughtful guardrails in AI development. That’s when Sacks lashed out, saying Anthropic was “running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering.” He added that the company was “principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem.” Anthropic has opposed efforts by the Trump administration to block states from setting their own AI rules for 10 years. They’ve argued that state-level regulation is crucial for keeping AI systems safe and accountable. Sacks isn’t having it. On Monday, after Reid went public, Sacks responded: “The leading funder of lawfare and dirty tricks against President Trump wants you to know that ‘Anthropic is one of the good guys.’ Thanks for clarifying that. All we needed to know.” Elon Musk, who now runs his own AI firm, xAI, chimed in minutes later with one word: “Indeed.” Reid didn’t let that slide. “Shows you didn’t read the post (not shocked),” he wrote back. “When you are ready to have a professional conversation about AI’s impact on America, I’m here to chat.” Then Jason Calacanis, co-host of the All-In podcast with Sacks, invited Reid to come back on the show this week, writing, “Come on the pod.” Reid had been on before by the way, in August, right before the 2024 election. He replied that he was “open to coming back on” but “this week is packed.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Tech|Anthropic|Google|Greylock|LinkedIn|Microsoft|OpenAI|xAI,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-21 06:45:53

Schon gestern warnte er vor dem Widerstandsbereich um 112.000 US-Dollar und genau dort prallte Bitcoin jetzt erneut ab. Die Folge: eine deutliche rote Kerze nach unten. Der Trader sieht darin die Bestätigung, dass der aktuelle Abwärtstrend noch nicht vorbei ist. Während sich viele über den Rückschlag ärgern, bleibt Rover gelassen. Er hat seine Kaufzonen längst vorbereitet und wartet darauf, dass Bitcoin noch etwas tiefer fällt. Nach eigenen Angaben liegen rund 50 Millionen US-Dollar an Kauforders bereit, nicht nur für Bitcoin, sondern auch für Ethereum. Auch Blackrock ist am Verkaufen, Quelle: https://farside.co.uk/btc/ Auf dem Chart zeigt sich ein klassisches Muster: tiefere Hochs auf der Oberseite, höhere Tiefs auf der Unterseite, eine Phase der Kompression, wie sie typisch ist, bevor es zu einem großen Ausbruch kommt. Für Rover ist entscheidend, ob Bitcoin die Marke um 106.000 US-Dollar hält. Fällt der Kurs darunter, rechnet er mit einem deutlichen Rücksetzer in Richtung 100.000 US-Dollar. Sollte diese Zone halten, wäre ein erneuter Anstieg bis 112.000 US-Dollar denkbar. Zyklus schon am Ende? Er beobachtet außerdem die Liquiditätszonen im Markt. Viele Short-Positionen liegen offen, während oberhalb des Kurses noch ungenutzte Liquidität wartet. Das könnte kurzfristig zu einem Short Squeeze führen, wenn größere Player ihre Positionen absichern. Dennoch bleibt der Analyst vorsichtig. Auf Wochenbasis verliert der Markt an Momentum, und der MACD zeigt erste bärische Signale. Für Rover ein Hinweis, dass sich Bitcoin dem Ende seines Zyklus nähert. Der sogenannte „Bitcoin High-Cycle-Profit-Indikator“ deute ebenfalls darauf hin, dass die Rallye langsam ausläuft. Seine Einschätzung: kein sofortiger Crash, aber ein mögliches Ende der aktuellen Haussephase. Bitcoin könne in eine längere Seitwärtsphase oder sogar in eine mehrmonatige Korrektur übergehen. Trotzdem sieht Rover Chancen für einen letzten Anstieg, eine „Blow-off-Top“-Bewegung, bei der der Kurs ein letztes Hoch erreicht, bevor der Markt endgültig abkühlt. BITCOIN SHORT SQUEEZE INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/79FqIZiEOL — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) October 21, 2025 In dieser Phase plant er, aktiv zu werden. Sollte Bitcoin noch einmal in die Zone um 100.000 US-Dollar fallen, will Rover massiv kaufen. Erst wenn Panik den Markt erfasst, sieht er den idealen Zeitpunkt für neue Long-Positionen. Für ihn bleibt Geduld entscheidend. Auf kurzfristiger Basis ist er weiter neutral bis leicht bärisch, auf mittlere Sicht aber bereit für die nächste große Bewegung. Sein Fazit: Die Party ist noch nicht vorbei, aber das Licht wird langsam gedimmt. Trader sollten sich auf eine volatile Phase einstellen, in der schnelle Richtungswechsel die Regel sind. Ein Durchbruch unter die 100.000 US-Dollar-Marke könnte den Markt kurzfristig erschüttern, langfristig aber eine attraktive Kaufchance eröffnen. Als Alternative zu Bitcoin investieren derzeit aber schon viele in den Vorverkauf von Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). Schon über 24,4 Millionen US-Dollar wurden investiert, einer der größten Presale des Jahres 2025. Immer neue Updates, Quelle: https://bitcoinhyper.com/de/news Bitcoin Hyper als Alternative mit Zukunft Das Timing für die neue Layer 2 Blockchain könnte kaum besser sein: Am heutigen Dienstag hält die US-Notenbank ihre Konferenz zu Zahlungssystemen, bei der erstmals auch führende Köpfe der Kryptobranche teilnehmen, darunter Vertreter von Chainlink, Fireblocks, Coinbase und BlackRock. Viele Analysten sehen darin einen wichtigen Schritt hin zu einer engeren Verbindung zwischen klassischem Finanzsystem und Krypto-Sektor, was Bitcoin Hyper in die Karten spielen könnte. Das Projekt baut das erste High-Performance-Layer-2-Netzwerk für Bitcoin auf Basis der Solana Virtual Machine. Ziel ist es, Bitcoin nicht nur als Wertspeicher zu nutzen, sondern als aktiv einsetzbares Asset für DeFi-Anwendungen, Gaming und reale Vermögenswerte. Mit Transaktionsgeschwindigkeiten auf Solana-Niveau könnte Bitcoin Hyper eine völlig neue Nutzungsdimension eröffnen. Jeder übertragene BTC ist dabei durch echtes Bitcoin im Hauptnetz abgesichert, die Geschwindigkeit steigt, die Sicherheit bleibt. Der native Token HYPER treibt das Netzwerk an, deckt Gebühren, dient als Governance-Coin und kann mit einer dynamischen APY von 49 Prozent gestakt werden. Angesichts der aktuellen Marktunsicherheit sehen viele Investoren in HYPER eine Chance, indirekt von Bitcoin zu profitieren, über ein Projekt, das den Nutzen der größten Kryptowährung massiv erweitern will. Natürlich sind auch hier die Risiken eines Memecoins zu kalkulieren, schnell Anstiege bieten auch immer die Möglichkeit für schnelle Kursstürze. Wer früh dabei ist, kann dennoch günstiger als zum Listingpreis einkaufen. Die laufende Presale-Phase endet in Kürze, der Preis liegt aktuell bei 0,013145 US-Dollar pro Token. Wer an die Zukunft von Bitcoin im Anwendungsbereich glaubt, dürfte Bitcoin Hyper genau beobachten. Hier noch Bitcoin Hyper Presale Token kaufen. Hinweis: Investieren ist spekulativ.

The company said Travel Wallet will be its main card-issuing partner in South Korea and the two companies will launch a joint prepaid card for users to spend cash and crypto anywhere in the world. Crypto.com strengthens its reach in South Korea through Travel Wallet deal More than 8 million customers hold, exchange, and spend over 40 different currencies through Travel Wallet’s mobile app and card. Crypto.com will use this large user base and trusted payment network with its secure financial systems to create a smooth experience for users to exchange cash, crypto, and digital currencies on one platform. President and Chief Operating Officer of Crypto.com, Eric Anziani, said people in South Korea already use digital payments and are willing to try new financial technologies that make their lives easier. According to him, the country is the perfect place for Crypto.com to expand its services and build stronger connections with local users. The Chief Operating Officer said working with Travel Wallet will help his company make crypto payments faster, simpler, and more rewarding. He added that everyone should be able to access cryptocurrencies and joining forces with Travel Wallet will create a world where people can spend digital assets as freely as they spend regular money. Travel Wallet adds crypto features and stablecoin support for global users Travel Wallet will use the crypto-as-a-service (CaaS) technology by Crypto.com, so that users can trade digital assets directly on its mobile app. The company will also use its KRW-based stablecoin on both platforms to support cheaper and faster international transfers. Travel Wallet’s Chief Executive Officer, Kim Hyung-woo, said the partnership with crypto.com marks “the beginning of a new payment era where fintech finance meets blockchain finance.” He explained that the company wants to build one system that can hold and trade foreign currencies, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins at the same time. Kim said South Korea will benefit more from the partnership and his company will be able to create a more open and efficient financial space for millions of users worldwide. The CEO said his company wants people to use crypto for shopping, travel, or sending money to family abroad, just as easily as they do with cash. Crypto.com has been gaining popularity in South Korea apart from Travel Wallet. The company in fact said this month that it will serve as the APEC CEO Summit Korea 2025’s official crypto payments partner. The event is scheduled to be held in Gyeongju from Oct. 28-31, 2025, and the participation of global CEOs and top experts will be invited to share big ideas for AI, digital innovation and global economic growth. Crypto.com will sell tickets for the event through its Crypto.com Pay platform. The company also rolled out an improved user rewards program, called Level Up in September 2025.

Following its latest purchase, the firm’s total ETH holdings now stand 3.24 million tokens. BitMine Continues To Stack Ethereum Despite Crash According to a press release issued earlier today, BitMine Immersion Technologies, a leading Ethereum treasury firm has further increased its ETH holdings. The firm added another 203,800 ETH over the last week, worth approximately $820 million. Last week’s purchase has increased BitMine’s total ETH holdings to 3.24 million ETH, representing roughly 2.7% of the active circulating supply. In addition, the company holds 192 Bitcoin (BTC) and $219 in cash. The firm has $1.34 billion in combined crypto and cash holdings. BitMine’s frequent ETH purchases have propelled it as the leading public company in terms of ETH held on its balance sheet. Earlier this month, the firm had reported that its total ETH holdings had surpassed 3 million tokens. Commenting, Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine said: The crypto market saw one of its largest deleveraging events ever last week and this put downward pressure on ETH prices. Open interest for ETH sits at the same levels as seen on June 30th of this year. Given the expected Supercycle for ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward. We acquired 203,826 ETH tokens over the past week pushing our ETH holdings to 3.24 million, or 2.7% of the supply of ETH. We are now more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH. Lee added that he sees Ethereum as a “truly neutral” blockchain which is likely to witness growing institutional adoption. He added that BitMine remains committed to accumulating 5% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. Following today’s announcement, the NYSE-listed firm’s stock BMNR surged an impressive 7.76%, trading at $53.72 at the time of writing. The stock is up an astonishing 640.87% over the past six months. Is ETH Destined For A New High? As institutional adoption of Ethereum grows, analysts are predicting new all-time highs (ATH) for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. According to crypto analyst HAMED_AZ, ETH can surge to $6,400 on the back of a new bullish wave. Recent trends show that some institutional investors are even replacing BTC with ETH, due to the latter’s greater flexibility and wider variety of uses. Major asset manager, BlackRock recently shifted some of its BTC holdings to ETH. That said, some analysts are cautious of the trend of Ethereum treasury firms adding ETH on their balance sheets. At press time, ETH trades at $4,019, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|bitcoin|BitMine|blockchain|btc|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ethereum Adoption|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-21 07:00:44

The platform aims to provide a self-custodial and high-speed solution for perpetual futures trading, allowing crypto traders to speculate on price movements without the limitation of expiry dates. Solana’s Percolator Documentation Released The documentation for Percolator was released on GitHub, where it is described as “implementation-ready.” It introduces two primary components: a Router and a Slab program. The Router manages collateral, portfolio margins, and cross-slab routing, while the Slab program functions as a matching engine overseen by liquidity providers (LPs). Each slab operates independently, enabling what Yakovenko refers to as “fully self-contained matching and settlement.” Related Reading: Analyst Uses AI To Show How The XRP Price Could Rally To $1,700 This design ensures that any issues arising from a particular slab do not affect users who have not interacted with it. Yakovenko emphasized the advantages of this architecture, stating: This design keeps each LP’s slab fully self-contained and innovable, while the Router guarantees atomic routing, portfolio netting, and capability-scoped safety. The project’s GitHub repository already shows completed data structures for order books and memory pools, although the development of liquidation systems is still in progress. However, no official launch date has been announced. Competition In Derivatives Market Intensifies Currently, the Solana Foundation has not disclosed whether Percolator will receive formal ecosystem support or if it will emerge as a community-driven protocol. Should it succeed, Percolator would add to the expanding repertoire of native financial primitives being developed on the Solana blockchain, which already includes decentralized options, lending protocols, and tokenized asset platforms. At present, the code for Percolator remains under review on GitHub, and developers engaged with the repository indicate that the project is “deep in testing.” This suggests that a launch could be imminent, provided that the liquidation and governance components are finalized. The introduction of Percolator comes at a critical time, as competitors like Hyperliquid (HYPE) are expanding their presence in the derivatives-focused DEX space. Related Reading: ‘Buy Of The Century’: Cardano Could Be The 2026 Game-Changer Under $0.20 — Analyst Hyperliquid recently implemented permissionless, builder-deployed perpetual contracts through its HIP-3 upgrade, allowing users to stake a minimum of 500,000 HYPE tokens—approximately $18 million—to launch their own perpetual markets with independent margin rules. Hyperliquid accounted for 35% of all blockchain revenue in July, attracting users away from platforms like Solana, Ethereum (ETH), and BNB Chain. Asset manager VanEck recently noted that Hyperliquid has successfully retained high-value users, thanks in part to its “simple, highly functional product.” As of press time, SOL is trading at $187.70, marking a 20% loss over the past fourteen and thirty days. This puts SOL 35% below its all-time high of $293, which was reached earlier this year.

His message, which originally marked a turning point in Washington’s approach to digital assets, continues to resonate with the XRP community as it marked a turning point for the perception of digital assets in the U.S. Trump’s post stated that the reserve would help “elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration.” He explained that his Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward with the reserve, naming “XRP, SOL, and ADA” as part of the initiative. At the time, the announcement was seen as a significant validation of XRP’s role in the digital asset space and a clear signal of government-level support for its utility. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! Mr. President named #XRP as the first Crypto Strategic Reserve Currency. Remember this! pic.twitter.com/RQmiQXzfZ2 — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 18, 2025 Renewed Confidence in XRP’s Future Since Trump’s return to office, XRP has benefited from a series of policy moves that have strengthened the digital asset market in the U.S. His administration’s stance has helped restore confidence among institutional investors and positioned XRP as a key player in the evolving digital economy. Trump’s administration ended the SEC’s war on crypto , and market optimism surrounding his pro-crypto stance and policies contributed to XRP achieving a record price this year , driven in part by speculation that the asset remains an important element of the government’s digital strategy. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The original executive order, which established a framework for a national crypto reserve, emphasized that the U.S. would safeguard key digital assets rather than sell them. While the Bitcoin reserve became the first component to be formalized, the creation of the broader Digital Asset Stockpile was seen as a foundation for integrating other cryptocurrencies such as XRP. The Continuing Relevance of Trump’s Crypto Vision Even though official documentation later focused on Bitcoin as the primary reserve asset, Trump’s public endorsement of XRP continues to hold symbolic and strategic weight. His post is frequently referenced by analysts who view it as an early indicator of how XRP could play a long-term role in U.S. digital asset policy. JackTheRippler’s recent post brought that vision back into focus, reminding the community of the moment when Trump named XRP among the assets shaping the U.S.’s strategic financial future .

While open interest was halved, most crypto exchanges continued operating with minimal disruption,” the analysts wrote. Earlier this month, the overall cryptocurrency market plunged by more than 10% after US President Donald Trump announced he would impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. Initially totaling $10 billion, liquidations quickly swelled to nearly $20 billion.

According to analysts, “While less reputable tokens virtually disappeared, Bitcoin only fell 15% to its bottom and closed the day down 8%.” Company analysts also maintained their optimistic expectations for Bitcoin, predicting that the price could reach $141,000 by December. Furthermore, the TD Cowen report noted that Bitcoin's global adoption continues unabated. For example, in Japan, the number of digital asset account holders has quadrupled to over 7.9 million. *This is not investment advice.

SNX is the native token for the Synthetix Network and is used for governance. It is listed on top exchanges like Binance, Uniswap, Coinbase, OKX, and Bybit. Synthetic is a decentralized protocol that allows you to create and transact synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Is SNX a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in five years?

Cryptocurrency loses 13.69% of its value. SNX coin may find support around $1.39. As of October 21, 2025, Synthetix price analysis reveals a bearish trend. The altcoin’s price decreased to $1.50 over the past 24 hours. Overall, the cryptocurrency lost a massive 13.69% in value as it corrects following a sharp spike to $1.87$. No buyer support was observed up until the time of writing, as the altcoin continues to fall. SNX/USD 1-day chart: SNX faces strong accumulation The one-day price chart of the Synthetix coin confirmed a downward market trend following a high spike as investors divest. The cryptocurrency price has decreased to $1.50 over the day. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify the presence of selling pressure. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance is wide, leading to high volatility for the coming days. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the resistance, has shifted to $2.06. Meanwhile, its lower limit, serving as support, has moved to $0.727. SNX/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator curve is trending in the neutral area, currently at 54.69. This situation suggests that sellers have control of the SNX price, and further instability in the market can be expected if the bears sustain their momentum. SNX/USD 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of Synthetix Coin also signals selling pressure on the coin at the current price level. The SNX/USD price decreased to $1.51 in the past few hours. The high volatility levels suggest an increased probability of an upcoming reversal or more price oscillation. The upper Bollinger band has shifted to $2.74, marking the resistance level. The lower Bollinger band has moved to $1.28, showing the support level. SNX/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Its value decreased to 46.44 over the past four hours. The downward curve on the RSI graph reflects an imbalanced trading environment. The bears have been dominating the price chart for the past few hours and are still trying to maintain their lead. This trend has also resulted in a relatively unbalanced trading setup for intraday traders.

Synthetix Coin price analysis shows a downward trend regarding the ongoing market events. The coin price has decreased to $1.50 in the last 24 hours. If the bearish momentum continues, the SNX price might retest support at the $1.39 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $7.36 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is in a bearish mode, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting negative sentiment as the SNX price decreased to $1.50, losing 13.69% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.95 for the current year, which is still quite higher than the current Synthetix price. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2028. However, this is not investment advice, and anyone willing to purchase SNX tokens should seek independent professional consultation. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level after 2029. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years, considering the long term Synthetix price forecast. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $8.45, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $8.45 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Source: Coinmarketcap Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3, as per historical SNX market data. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The highest price of the SNX token was 2.27 in January, but it corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and in July, the token peaked at $0.781, showing significant growth. From August to September, SNX’s average price remained around $0.65 to $0.67, and in October 2025, SNX is trading above $1, as the current sentiment is bullish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SNX|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-21 07:11:42

Key Takeaways: Coinbase is urging the US Treasury to update outdated AML rules, arguing that current frameworks fail to address risks. The company recommends using AI, APIs, and blockchain analytics to detect illicit activity more effectively. Coinbase proposes regulatory sandboxes and safe harbors to encourage innovation. Instead of relying on stricter enforcement, the company argues that innovation through blockchain analytics and artificial intelligence should form the foundation of future financial crime prevention. “When bad guys innovate in financial crime, good guys need innovation to keep pace,” said Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, in an X post accompanying the exchange’s 30-page response to Treasury’s request for comment on “Innovative Methods to Detect Illicit Activity Involving Digital Assets.” Coinbase Calls US AML Rules Outdated Coinbase’s filing describes the current AML system as outdated and inefficient, noting that it often floods regulators with low-value reports while forcing firms to store excessive amounts of customer data. The company claims this approach both compromises privacy and fails to deter sophisticated criminal operations. Instead, Coinbase proposes a results-driven approach that leverages modern technologies to improve monitoring and enforcement. Among its key recommendations, Coinbase urged Treasury to establish regulatory “safe harbors” for companies using AI and API-driven compliance tools, recognize decentralized IDs and zero-knowledge proofs as legitimate forms of customer verification, and promote know-your-transaction (KYT) blockchain analytics as a superior alternative to traditional reporting. Third: Amend the Bank Secrecy Act’s customer identification requirements to include decentralized identification and zero-knowledge proofs as part of an approved identification verification process. 4/6 — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) October 20, 2025 “Blockchain and other innovative technologies can counter these emerging risks,” Grewal wrote, adding that Treasury should actively promote the adoption of digital tools to identify and deter illicit activity. He said this would align with the objectives of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, which sought to modernize the BSA. Coinbase also called for regulatory sandboxes to allow exchanges and agencies to jointly test compliance innovations before formal implementation. The company believes public–private collaboration could accelerate progress and provide clearer guidance for firms seeking to deploy AI or blockchain-based tools in AML systems. Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer, echoed this sentiment, writing that the government should “follow in the footsteps of crypto exchanges” by embracing innovation rather than resisting it. “Modernize AML with proven digital tools like AI, APIs, digital IDs, and blockchain analytics,” he urged. At @coinbase , we’re constantly modernizing our defense systems to protect our customers and national security. The government’s approach to combating financial crime should be no different. That’s why policymakers should embrace innovation to modernize AML with proven digital… https://t.co/82GfJSzRDs — Faryar Shirzad (@faryarshirzad) October 20, 2025 Top Crypto CEOs to Meet Senate Democrats as Crypto Bill Talks Stall As reported, a high-profile meeting between leading crypto executives and Senate Democrats is set for Wednesday, led by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, in an effort to revive progress on long-delayed U.S. crypto market structure legislation. Gillibrand, one of the few Democrats vocal about providing regulatory clarity for digital assets, co-sponsored the Responsible Financial Innovation Act with Senator Cynthia Lummis and has remained a central figure in bipartisan crypto policy efforts. Executives from Coinbase, Chainlink, Ripple, Galaxy Digital, Uniswap, Circle, Kraken, a16z Crypto, Jito, and the Solana Policy Institute are expected to attend the closed-door roundtable, according to journalist Eleanor Terrett.

53444727,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=841041,1761030910,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53444727.jpeg,ISS opposes $9 billion CoreWeave merger with Core Scientific,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/iss-coreweave-deal-for-core-scientific/,"Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) on Monday told investors to vote against the $9 billion acquisition of Core Scientific by CoreWeave, saying the data-center operator has done well enough on its own and doesn’t need to be absorbed. The recommendation came ahead of the October 30 vote, and the ISS is warning that Core Scientific has “achieved considerable success as a standalone company” and can keep growing independently, according to Reuters . The proposed CoreWeave takeover, first announced in early July, was an all-stock offer valued at $20.40 per share, which placed Core Scientific’s worth at about $9 billion. At that time, the deal looked generous, a 66% premium above the company’s market price. But since then, CoreWeave’s stock has fallen while Core Scientific’s price has climbed, flipping the math and leaving shareholders questioning why they should trade up for less. Investors question CoreWeave’s structure and value Opposition started building almost immediately. Two Seas Capital said it would vote no, citing “concerns with the sale process, deal structure, and valuation.” The firm argued that the fixed exchange ratio left Core Scientific investors exposed to CoreWeave’s price swings, a risk that’s already materialized. As the trading floor punished CoreWeave’s stock, the total offer value sank. Then Trip Miller, head of Gullane Capital in Memphis, added his voice. His firm, which owns $200 million in Core Scientific shares and is the third-largest holder behind Vanguard and BlackRock, said he couldn’t support the deal. “Under the math of the deal today, I would have to vote no,” Miller said. He called the merger “a flawed structure” that values his shares below their current market price. Investors seem to agree. After ISS’s call to reject the deal, Core Scientific’s stock rose more than 5% in post-market trading, closing at $18.81, while the conversion deal now values those same shares at just $17, a 10% discount, which proves that markets favor independence. CoreWeave’s rapid expansion is increasing its debt massively Since its March IPO, CoreWeave’s market cap has soared to $70 billion, tripling within months as it raced to dominate the AI infrastructure scene. The company has struck major deals with OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia , all of which depend on massive computing power. But behind that success is an aggressive expansion financed by heavy borrowing. In its second-quarter earnings, CEO Michael Intrator said customer demand was so high that the firm needed to build data centers “on a planetary scale.” He said CoreWeave was “aggressively expanding its footprint” to keep up with orders. The company reported revenue of $1.2 billion, more than double from a year earlier, and a revenue backlog of $30.1 billion, also twice what it was at the start of the year. But its operating margin dropped from 20% to 2%, showing how costs are eating into profits. The company also revealed that its debt hit $11.2 billion by the end of Q2, a 40% jump since January, with borrowing costs between 7% and 15%. It’s currently running 470 megawatts of data-center capacity and aims to exceed 900 megawatts by late 2025, enough to power about one-fifth of New York City. If the Core Scientific acquisition went through, that figure would more than double its operational output and push future contracted power above 3 gigawatts.

Among the top cryptocurrencies under $1, three stand out for their strong fundamentals, active communities, and long-term growth setup, Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . DOGE continues to thrive on massive community engagement, ADA remains a cornerstone of blockchain innovation with expanding DeFi integration, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a serious coin in decentralized finance with its dual-lending protocol that merges Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract systems. Currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 70% sold, MUTM is quickly gaining traction among analysts debating what crypto to invest in before the next major rally. With a mix of established resilience and breakout innovation, these three tokens could be the next big movers aiming for the coveted $5 milestone this market cycle. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis: Clean Reclaim Setup Points Towards Bullish Continuation Cardano (ADA) is exhibiting a clean reclaim setup after the latest correction, wherein price finds firm support around $0.624 and trades very close. The major level to keep an eye on is $0.631, provided ADA remains above this area, the technical direction tips in favor of bullish continuation towards $0.641–$0.645 in the short term. In the long run, Cardano could cross $3.10 ATH to hit $5. Its near-term trend is a sign of increasing market optimism following a sharp drop, which is a signal that ADA can be setting up for its next bull cycle if momentum persists. As traders monitor these short-term breakdown levels, most investors are now expanding their scope towards promising DeFi prospects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a project that many are considering among the best cryptos to buy now before the next big boom. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Prediction: Accumulation Suggests Potential Breakout Dogecoin (DOGE) still maintains its all-important $0.185 support level firmly after a steep correction, and this level again continues to be an all-important accumulation base. Bidders now seem to be clearly holding the line at this level as the momentum starts to unwind and trading volume accelerates at the lows. A solid reclamation of the $0.20 level could be the springboard to an even more powerful push higher into $0.25–$0.30, validating the larger bullish setup. With the assumption that DOGE is supported above $0.185, the setup is good technically, a recipe that usually spells serious breakouts after episodes of quiet accumulation. While DOGE could rally further, $5 remains far out. While investors wait to see if DOGE can spark its next boom, others are already directing attention to fledgling DeFi upstarts such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is being recognized as a top crypto to invest in and gaining strong interest ahead of 2025’s subsequent big cycle. Mutuum Finance Rockets Past $17.7M in Presale Mutuum Finance is sending shockwaves minute by minute as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Its presale goes on uninterrupted, with more than 17,330 buyers investing over $17.7 million thus far in the project. The token is now at its lowest possible price, $0.035 at presale stage 6. Mutuum Finance is causing ripples with its action-packed leaderboard rewards, designed to attract its investment community around the clock. Its largest clients have bought $12,538, $11,667, $1,027 worth of MUTM tokens over the past 24 hours, a healthy sign of growing demand and confidence in the project. The most invested earns a $500 MUTM bonus every day in the challenge and commitment culture from investors. Members must buy at least once every 24 hours, to win a ticket. Lending and Borrowing Protocol Soon Mutuum Finance will release its lending and borrowing protocol as a world-class DeFi project. Version 1 (V1) launches on the Sepolia Testnet this year with fundamental features like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the liquidator bot. The fast presale expansion has made it an ideal benchmark for investors seeking the best cryptos to buy now during a changing market scenario. As DOGE and ADA bounce back, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking over the spotlight. At $0.035 in Phase 6, with a raised amount of $17.7 million and 70% sold out, it’s one of the best cryptos to buy now. Join the Mutuum Finance presale to position yourself in MUTM, a crypto to invest in with strong potential, at its lowest price. This project continues to be highlighted as the top crypto to invest in for forward-looking investors.

Recently, a new record was set for ZEC locked in shielded pools. ZCash (ZEC) is extending its trend of locking more coins in shielded pools. In the past day, the supply of shielded coins expanded to a new all-time high, following more retail deposits. Another 959 ZEC were shielded, adding to the more rapid trend of adoption for privacy coins. The creator of ZCash noted the new record and the potential for locking even more ZEC in shielded pools. Another day, another ATH. 959 more ZEC shielded. https://t.co/n7u2XZNofS — zooko🛡🦓🦓🦓 ⓩ (@zooko) October 21, 2025 Shielding more ZEC also means the buyers may not sell, instead using their coins for storage. ZEC is seen as a long-term proposition, an anonymous coin usable in the DeFi space. The depositors to shielded pools will most probably avoid selling their ZEC on centralized markets, instead using the coins on Solana in their bridged and shielded version. More ZEC coins are being added to shielded pools, suggesting accumulation instead of selling for profit. | Source: ZEC Dashboard . In the past three weeks, around 1M ZEC entered shielded pools, and has not been dumped on exchanges. Retail is also still shielding coins , instead of taking short-term profits. ZEC retains its price range The recent interest in the ZCash project and its bridging to Solana is the main factor behind the ZEC price action. ZEC stayed solidly above $250, recently reclaiming the $270 level. The most bullish predictions is for the coin to attempt a recovery to $500. The coin has positioned itself as unique, despite the creation of more recent anonymous coins and tokens. ZEC is also one of the few assets to grow in BTC terms. In the past year, ZEC grew by 337% against BTC, going as high as 0.002 BTC. ZCash retains a track record of one decade, and has claims to fulfilling one of the predictions of Satoshi Nakamoto for an anonymous version of Bitcoin. Additionally, the ZEC community boasts the millions of ZEC coins locked in the shielded pools as one of its positive trends. ZCash gets a boost from retail, whale buying ZEC open interest remains relatively low compared to other older altcoins. On Binance, open interest is over $91M, out of a total of $210M. However, the most notable activity of ZEC is on the Near Protocol. ZCash is boosting new ways of using ZEC, as the coin has been recently removed from the Keystone wallet. The Zashi app is currently the main access point for trading and shielding ZEC. Near Protocol swaps and access to the Zashi wallet means retail traders have a wider access to ZEC. Additionally, data shows a whale has swapped up to 50 BTC per day for ZEC coins. The rise of ZEC also showed not all privacy coins were the same. Most of the privacy assets, including new coins, took a hit during the latest market correction. Monero (XMR) still traded around $305, as its social media mindshare is still high. Railgun (RAIL) stalled its rally at around $2.51, as most other privacy coins took a downturn following the end of the altcoin market.

The meme coin sector momentarily slowed down, hinting at a potential rally if the broader market stabilizes after its recent downturn. Specifically, PEPE coin prices display a bullish pattern, presenting an opportunity for a breakout based on the daily chart analysis.

The hourly price chart confirms that Pepe attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a further recovery rally in the coming hours. If Pepe’s price holds momentum above $0.00000726, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.0000797. Pepeusd Chart By TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000635, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000461. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price faced strong selling around recent highs. This pushed the price of PEPE toward the intra day low of $0.0000069. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.000008 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news A significant regulatory development occurred with PEPE’s inclusion in Indonesia’s approved cryptocurrency list on September 1, 2025. PT Central Finansial X (CFX), Indonesia’s first crypto exchange licensed by the Financial Services Authority (OJK), officially designated 1,444 crypto assets as legally tradable in Indonesia, including popular meme coins like PEPE, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Floki (FLOKI). PEPE Price Prediction October 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000008 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000011. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) October 2025 0.000008 0.000011 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is enhancing tools and libraries that facilitate the integration of $DOGE as a payment option for businesses. According to predictions and technical analysis, Pepe could achieve a minimum price of $0.0048 in 2026. The price may rise to a maximum of $0.0058, with an average expected trading price of $0.0050. Pepe Price Prediction 2027 The forecast for 2027 suggests that Pepe will have a minimum price of $0.0071. The maximum price is projected to be $0.0084, with an average price of $0.0073 throughout the year. Pepe price prediction 2028 By 2028, the lowest predicted price for Pepe is $0.0102. It might reach a maximum price of $0.0122, with the average price expected to be around $0.0105. Pepe price prediction 2029 Based on forecasts and technical analysis, the price of Pepe in 2029 is expected to start at a minimum of $0.0149. It could reach a maximum of $0.0179, with an average trading value of $0.0154. Pepe price prediction 2030 Drawing from deep technical analysis of past PEPE data, the price in 2030 is projected to have a minimum value of $0.0204. The maximum price could reach $0.0258, with an average value of $0.0211 throughout the year. Pepe price prediction 2031 By 2031, the lowest predicted price for Pepe is $0.0246.

53445638,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=841057,1761032841,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53445638.jpeg,Germany’s banks democratize private equity for retail clients,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/german-banks-open-private-equity-to-all/,"German retail banks are increasingly offering private equity funds to the country’s growing pool of small-scale investors, with lenders from Deutsche Bank to fintech star Trade Republic looking to tap into the expanding asset class. The push comes as private capital groups hunt for new sources of funding, with institutional investors reluctant to commit more until prior investments return cash. “German retail investors represent one of the world’s largest untapped pools of wealth and private equity firms are eager to gain access,” said Claudio de Sanctis, head of retail banking at Deutsche Bank, which recently established a private markets product with Switzerland’s Partners Group. Similar efforts are underway internationally. In the US, Donald Trump signed an executive order opening the $9 trillion retirement savings market to a broader range of assets, while UK wealth managers are increasingly offering private market products to retail clients. Fintech platforms lower barriers, opening private markets to smaller investors Investment thresholds vary. Deutsche Bank requires a €10,000 minimum and at least €200,000 in client assets, while Trade Republic partnered with EQT and Apollo to offer exposure from just €1. BlackRock has also teamed up with UniCredit’s German arm HVB and online broker Scalable Capital to give clients access to private equity with a €10,000 minimum. Germany has traditionally taken a wary view of private equity. Back in 2004, Social Democratic chair Franz Müntefering had spoken of buyout investors being harmful across companies. Nonetheless Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a former head of the board of managers for BlackRock Germany, points to a more welcoming environment in the country for alternative asset managers. German households have some €9 trillion in financial assets, more than a third of which is sitting in cash or low return deposits according to Bundesbank data. Private equity is also a significant growth opportunity, according to Christian Hecker, co-founder of Trade Republic. Hecker noted robust early demand for Trade Republic’s private markets launch and believes that asset class to be a core component in the portfolios of retail investors over the next five years despite general German skepticism around capital markets, as Germans are eager to invest in private companies. Industry experts warn that private equity offers opportunity but comes with risks German investors have lagged behind their US and UK peers. Steffen Pauls, CEO of Berlin-based Moonfare, said, “In investor behavior and understanding of private equity, Germany is about 10 years behind.” But momentum is building: Bundesbank data analyzed by Lemon.markets and Smartbroker show securities accounts grew by almost 50% over the past decade, adding nearly 12 million since 2015. About one in five Germans now participate in capital markets , driven largely by digital platforms and regulatory changes supporting semi-liquid listed funds, or Eltifs. German savers are still showing some caution, after incurred heavy losses during the 2008 financial crisis on gated open-ended real-estate funds. The private-equity upswing is fueled mainly by supply rather than demand, noted Ali Masarwah, who runs wealth adviser Envestor. In such slightly frosty conditions, at Moonfare the company recently liquidated a closed-end private equity fund for lack of investor demand. Industry leaders also caution against expecting too much, too soon. Steffen Meister, chairman of Partners Group, said products that promise high returns and liquidity often rely on leverage and lofty fees, adding that many will disappear over the next 10 years. De Sanctis at Deutsche Bank echoed the concerns. “It is important that clients understand what they invest in,” he said, but added there was also an opportunity: “If we introduce this critical asset class to affluent and retail investors properly, we’ll have done a real service to our community.” In private equity, veterans’ perspectives are changing perception over time. Meister said that attitudes in Germany have dramatically transformed from 10 or 20 years ago and the industry is no longer tainted with the same stigma.

Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal stressed modern tools must counter advanced crypto crimes. AI and Blockchain Solutions Coinbase seeks BSA safe harbors for AI and API-based compliance systems. These focus on governance, cut false positives, and protect privacy. Zero-knowledge proofs and decentralized IDs streamline user verification. “Criminals innovate; we must too,” Grewal posted on X.

Evernorth’s $1 Billion Merger And XRP Treasury Launch This strategic initiative comes in the wake of a significant legal victory for Ripple, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concluded a high-profile lawsuit that accused the company of selling unregistered securities to institutional investors. Under the current administration the regulatory agency has taken a new crypto-friendly approach, also dropping lawsuits against other key players in the industry. Evernorth has stated that the anticipated merger, expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2026, will establish it as the largest publicly traded XRP treasury company. On the matter, Evernorth’s CEO Asheesh Birla stated: Evernorth is built to provide investors more than just exposure to XRP’s price. As we capitalize on existing TradFi yield generation strategies and deploy into DeFi yield opportunities, we also contribute to the growth and maturity of that ecosystem. This approach is designed to generate returns for shareholders while supporting XRP’s utility and adoption. It’s a symbiotic model: our strategy is designed to align with the growth of the XRP ecosystem. Ripple Co-Founder And Major Firms Join The Venture The fundraising effort also includes a substantial $200 million investment from Japanese firm SBI , which has historical ties to SoftBank, in exchange for equity in the venture. Birla emphasized Evernorth’s intent to explore acquisition opportunities, stating that the company plans to build out its investment team as it grows. The deal has garnered the participation of Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, as well as notable digital asset firms like venture capital firm Pantera Capital, and cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. This announcement follows Ripple’s recent acquisition of GTreasury, which was heralded as a significant advancement in its growth strategy. Ripple aims to provide solutions that allow corporations to unlock idle capital, leveraging the multi-trillion-dollar global repo market through partnerships, such as the one with prime broker Hidden Road. As Bitcoinist reported , this acquisition marks the blockchain payment company’s third major transaction in 2025, following its earlier procurements of prime broker Hidden Road and stablecoin platform Rail. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.47, up nearly 3% over the past 24 hours as the broader crypto market sees a slight recovery from last week’s crash, which brought fear and uncertainty back to the industry.

Here’s What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/finance-strategist-majority-of-xrp-on-exchanges-is-already-gone-heres-what-is-coming/,"Concerns over XRP’s dwindling availability on exchanges have grown recently, and Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, has shared his view on the current market structure. He remarked that “the majority of XRP on exchanges is already gone,” a statement that reflects what data has shown for months. XRP reserves on trading platforms continue to fall as more tokens move into private wallets. The steady outflow signals that holders are securing their assets for the long term, reducing the liquidity available for traders. This movement indicates that circulating liquidity for XRP is becoming increasingly limited. When the available supply diminishes while long-term interest remains, market dynamics can change rapidly. Investors have often viewed low exchange reserves as a signal of accumulation, especially when supply metrics continue trending downward. Aljarrah’s statement therefore points to a structural tightening of XRP’s available supply, which could eventually force its price upward once demand rises. The majority of XRP on exchanges is already gone. With so little liquidity left, any significant demand will force the market to absorb the remaining supply instantly. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 19, 2025 Potential for a Supply Shock If Aljarrah’s assessment proves accurate, XRP could be approaching a point where normal trading demand overwhelms the remaining market liquidity, leading to a supply shock . A supply shock occurs when demand surges while available tokens are insufficient to meet that buying pressure. In such situations, price adjustments can happen swiftly as traders compete to obtain scarce assets. In the case of XRP, this potential supply shock would be amplified by how concentrated holdings have become outside exchanges. Many holders are reportedly positioning their tokens for long-term use within institutional payment systems or storing them securely in offline wallets. That trend reduces the number of XRP tokens readily available for short-term trading and creates a supply bottleneck that could heighten volatility when new demand appears. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What Will Happen to XRP’s Price? When supply constraints coincide with renewed buying activity, market conditions typically favor price appreciation. XRP has already seen increased institutional and retail attention, and moderate demand could have a pronounced multiplier effect . With the token’s liquidity pool shrinking, any large-scale accumulation could move prices quickly. Aljarrah highlights an important distinction between price speculation and actual market structure. If exchanges indeed hold significantly fewer tokens , market makers and traders would need to adjust to thinner order books. This would reduce the ability of the market to absorb large buy orders smoothly, creating an environment where small waves of buying could push prices higher than expected.

Muto explained that this is because replacing Russian supply could take time and come with a side of financial crisis for Japan, as the Asian LNG market remains tight and that rising procurement costs could drive up electricity prices for homes and industries. Muto didn’t offer a timeline or specific details on when shipments could end, but did say that gas from Russia’s Sakhalin‑2 project currently supplies about 10% of Japan’s total LNG imports, describing it as an important lifeline for the country’s power sector. Japan’s trading houses own a stake in the Russian Sakhalin-2 plant, the closest LNG export terminal to the country. Furthermore, much of the fuel bought from the project is supplied under long-term purchase agreements, some of which don’t expire until the 2030s. Japan is the only G7 country without a set deadline to end Russian gas purchases. Muto pointed out that Japan’s strategy focuses on reducing exposure without risking blackouts or price spikes. Washington presses Tokyo to halt Russian energy imports The comments came just as the United States ramped up efforts to cut off Russia’s energy revenue streams. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato during talks in Washington last week that the Trump administration expects Japan to stop importing energy from Russia altogether. The push is part of the White House’s broader strategy to choke Moscow’s war financing and isolate it from global trade partners. At the same time, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters on Monday that the U.S. Senate will delay voting on new sanctions legislation targeting Russia until after President Donald Trump’s planned meeting with Vladimir Putin. “At the moment we’re kind of hitting the pause button,” Thune said. The proposed bill would allow Trump to impose tariffs of up to 500% on imports from countries that continue buying Russian energy while not providing active support to Ukraine, a list that includes China, India, and Japan. Thune previously said the Senate would hold a vote within about 30 days, but the bill has stalled for months despite backing from 85 senators. Trump has yet to give the green light, saying he wants to wait for his one‑on‑one with Putin before locking in new penalties. Meanwhile, oil prices slipped for the second straight day on Tuesday as traders grew nervous about weak demand and a looming supply surplus. Brent crude futures fell 17 cents, or 0.28%, to $60.84 per barrel at 0343 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for November delivery dropped 0.52% to $57.22. The more active December contract slid 0.33% to $56.83. Prices reached their lowest since early May after rising concerns that the U.S.–China trade dispute could hurt global growth and reduce oil consumption. Both Brent and WTI have moved into contango, a market condition where near‑term prices are cheaper than future contracts, suggesting ample supply and softening demand. Analysts said the decline reflects both economic tensions between Washington and Beijing and the ongoing production policy of OPEC+, the alliance of oil‑producing countries led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, according to Reuters . Despite weakening prices, OPEC+ is still pushing ahead with its plan to add more oil to the market, a decision that could extend the global glut through next year. Analysts expect the oversupply to grow, and the International Energy Agency last week projected a surplus of nearly 4 million barrels per day by 2026.

Bears think $126,000 was the top, and BTC will fall below $100,000, and 2026 will be a bear market mainly because of the four-year cycle, he observed before adding: “IMO that is a BIG misunderstanding.” There have been four-year cycles that revolve around the Bitcoin halving, “But three cycles are not enough for a reliable pattern,” he said. It is also “absolutely not guaranteed” that the top is again 18 months after the previous halving, which is now in October. This Cycle Is Different … Or Is It? The analyst then suggested that the cycle top could very well be in 2026, or 2027, or 2028. “Actually, I am much more interested in the average price level than the top (or the bottom),” he said. “What I do know is: there has not been a fundamental Bitcoin phase transition yet in this cycle,” he continued. “Either the big jump has yet to come, or we have transitioned into a more stable price regime, dominated by institutions, fund mandates, and rebalancing … Both scenarios are very bullish for Bitcoin.” Bears think $126k was the top, and btc will fall below $100k, and 2026 will be a bear market mainly because … the 4 year cycle!? IMO that is a BIG misunderstanding.

Willy Woo observed that the liquidity driving the cycle top of the last bull market came from from paper derivative markets, which is a short term instrument. “This cycle is shaping up differently. Paper has already started dropping away, while longer term spot liquidity is holding up for now.” When Bitcoin dropped below $104,000 last week, many feared a bear market had just begun and were wishing for the price to go up a bit more so that they could just exit at a decent level, said analyst ‘Rekt Capital.’ They added that “people feel differently about price now,” after the recovery, but that was posted before today’s slump. Bitcoin Price Tanks Again Bitcoin has tanked more than 3% over the past few hours, crashing back to $107,700 during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session. It appears to have hit support around the critical $108,000 level and the plunge had stopped there at the time of writing. What remains clear is that crypto markets are still very jittery and need some solid fundamentals to get the boost that analysts are looking for.
