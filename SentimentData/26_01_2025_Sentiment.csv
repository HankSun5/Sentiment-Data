These Metrics Show Why It Might Never Happen,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/an-altcoin-season-in-sight/,"Bitcoin has yet to relinquish its dominance in this market cycle, leaving many investors still holding onto hopes for the arrival of an altcoin season. Still, there remains a possibility that an altcoin rally might never come to fruition this season, given the recent market trends this cycle. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez echoed this perspective in a recent post on X, claiming that an altcoin season may never return. His observation sheds light on the change in market dynamics and the significant shifts that have occurred since previous alt seasons. Why AltSeason Might Never Happen An altcoin season is defined by a period of rapid price surges across a wide range of altcoins. Furthermore, an altcoin season is characterized by investors cashing out their Bitcoin profits and pouring them into altcoins. This period is always accompanied by social media hype and FOMO from crypto investors as they rush in to get in on the action. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 However, current market conditions have seen the crypto industry grow from its early days into a new market with a close relationship with investors in the traditional finance sector. Additionally, the altcoin market has expanded dramatically since the last major bull run in 2021, and you could argue that it has become somewhat oversaturated. Martinez highlighted a startling statistic: over 36.4 million altcoins are now in circulation. This is a dramatic increase compared to fewer than 3,000 altcoins during the 2017-2018 altcoin season and an even smaller pool of fewer than 500 in the 2013-2014 bull market cycle. The sheer scale of this supply explosion has fundamentally altered the cryptocurrency landscape, diluting attention and capital among an overwhelming number of assets. This oversaturation means that achieving widespread price surges across altcoins has become a far more challenging proposition than in previous market cycles. Furthermore, many of these altcoins have unclear use cases or poor fundamentals and only divert attention from specific altcoins with strong utility. Could The Era Of Altcoin Seasons Be Over? The concept of an altcoin season may be a relic of a less crowded market. Ethereum, the largest altcoin, has largely failed to perform up to expectations this cycle. Known as the primary driver of past altcoin seasons, Ethereum has struggled to gain momentum for over a year, even as other altcoins like Solana, XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin continue to push to multi-year highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dominance And Altcoin Season: What The Sudden Volatility Means For The Market If Ethereum, with its established dominance and utility, cannot deliver, it raises serious questions about the potential of other altcoins to rally. Instead, individual altcoins with strong fundamentals or unique propositions could continue to thrive while the rest of the market remains stagnant. At the time of writing, Coinmarketcap’s dominance data shows that Bitcoin commands 57.9% of the total crypto market cap, increasing by 0.69% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum is steadily losing ground, with its dominance dropping by 1.07% over the same period, now accounting for just 11.1% of the overall market.

BlockDAG , a pioneering blockchain initiative that integrates Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with conventional blockchain traits, stands out as one of the key projects to watch by 2025. As its presale nears the impressive $200 million milestone, the enthusiasm for this transformative venture is clearly justified. Could BlockDAG Climb from $0.0248 to $1? Exploring the Potential for a 3932% Return BDAG coins are currently priced at a mere $0.0248 in the ongoing 27th presale batch. Market analysts anticipate that by 2025, BlockDAG’s valuation might reach $1, presenting an opportunity for a remarkable 3932% ROI. Initial holders have already enjoyed significant profits, with gains up to 2380% from the first batch. For those yet to participate, this is a critical time to get involved before this chance passes. BlockDAG is more than just promising numbers; it represents a bold vision for the future of blockchain technology. Its advanced hybrid framework offers unmatched speed, scalability, and security, appealing to both developers and corporate sectors. Equipped to support Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), BlockDAG enables a robust platform for innovative decentralized applications (dApps). Significant CEX Listings Scheduled for 2025: Key to BDAG’s Valuation Surge A distinct aspect of BlockDAG’s strategy is its detailed roadmap for 2025. Alongside the highly anticipated mainnet debut, there are plans for significant listings on prominent centralized exchanges (CEXs). These listings are poised to greatly boost BDAG’s liquidity and visibility, potentially elevating its market value substantially. Traditionally, tokens that launch on major CEXs see notable increases in value as they attract heightened buyer interest. BlockDAG is strategically positioned to capitalize on this trend, offering early adopters a unique opportunity to be part of a groundbreaking endeavor. The presale itself reflects the project’s expanding influence, with nearly $200 million already secured. This early funding from institutional traders, tech developers, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts signals strong market confidence in BlockDAG’s ability to innovate within the industry. For potential traders, the current presale batch presents a prime buying opportunity. As the presale progresses, prices are expected to rise, making the present the optimal moment to buy at a favorable rate. With the mainnet launch and upcoming CEX listings, BDAG’s price trajectory is set for significant growth. Seize the Opportunity: BDAG Poised for Substantial Growth BlockDAG’s trajectory is defined not just by its ambitions but also by its proven commitment to scalability, speed, and developer friendliness, ensuring its continued relevance in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. As it plans to introduce several hackathons and integrate over 200 Web3 projects, BlockDAG is reinforcing its reputation as a forward-looking platform. In a market where opportunities can disappear as quickly as they emerge, BlockDAG represents a fleeting chance for considerable returns. With the presale almost reaching $200 million and major exchange launches planned for 2025, the window for early buying is narrowing. Don’t miss out on being part of one of the most significant cryptocurrency success stories of the decade—secure your BDAG coins today.

In a recent post, Kiyosaki shared his positive view regarding the crypto and emphasized Gresham’s Law and Metcalfe’s Law as the core principles that support his view. Robert Kiyosaki Explains Why Bitcoin Outshines The US Dollar in Today’s Economy Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the Rich Dad Poor Dad, recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) about Bitcoin becoming bigger than the US dollar. He said that according to Gresham’s Law bad money chases good money out of circulation. Kiyosaki noted that fiat currencies, including the US dollar, have lost credibility due to inflation and excessive money printing. He said that in this case, Bitcoin, gold and silver are the “good money.” According to Kiyosaki, such assets are turning into the safest places for investing, given that people no longer trust paper currencies. He also pointed out that people have been using physical metals like gold and silver as a means of accepting value for a long time, and now digital currency has been accepted. Robert Kiyosaki added, “Good money gold and silver have been hiding from FAKE US dollars for years. Today, Gold, silver, and Bitcoin are forcing the fake US dollar into hiding.” Notably, Binance founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao and “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki have encouraged buying Bitcoin during dips amid rising FOMO. CZ advised responsible investing due to Bitcoin’s volatility, while Kiyosaki emphasized BTC potential for wealth creation, urging individuals to buy for long-term gains. BTC Network Power Using Metcalfe’s Law Kiyosaki also highlighted Metcalfe’s Law, which states that the value of a network grows exponentially with its number of users. He explained that Bitcoin’s expanding network of users and global adoption contributes to its increasing value and influence. This principle has been a key driver in Bitcoin rise as a decentralized asset. He compared Bitcoin’s network growth to established systems like franchise networks and large corporations, which gain power from their scale. Kiyosaki emphasized that BTC decentralized nature allows individuals and businesses to leverage its growing network for transactions and value storage. However, recently, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon reiterated his belief in the US dollar’s dominance, dismissing Bitcoin as a speculative asset and not a threat to global financial stability. While the bank explores blockchain technology for operational efficiency, it remains restricted from directly owning Bitcoin due to regulations. Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver Are Emerging as Alternatives to the US Dollar As the US dollar faces declining global trust, Kiyosaki pointed out that Bitcoin, gold, and silver are challenging its dominance. He noted that the over-reliance on fiat currencies has led to economic instability, prompting individuals to seek alternatives. Bitcoin network, with its limited supply and decentralized nature, is increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation. Kiyosaki emphasized that the transition to these assets is a natural response to the erosion of purchasing power in fiat currencies. He reiterated his belief that tangible assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin network offer a more reliable store of value during uncertain times. Rich Dad Poor Dad author also warned of an ongoing giant market crash fueled by reckless monetary policies and financial mismanagement. He attributed this economic downturn to government decisions to print excessive amounts of money, which devalues fiat currencies. The author reaffirmed his bullish outlook on Bitcoin, gold, and silver, urging individuals to focus on accumulating these assets. According to Kiyosaki, they represent the best tools for preserving wealth and stability during the current economic climate.

The protocol focused on what Ethereum could achieve if the developers and the broader community shunned some ideologies. The research discussed ways to accelerate Ethereum’s development to maximize its resources. Paradigm on Ethereum Shipping Issues According to the firm, the network ships updates slowly, at one yearly upgrade. It is noted that this is not ideal and is masked by two major concepts it identified as “inertia” and “the need to ossify.” He emphasized the latter reason as the belief that Ethereum may only maintain its decentralization if changes to the core chain are slow. Paradigm pointed out that Ethereum is often torn between the need to balance values and innovation. However, the investment giant noted that Ethereum has yet to maximize its technical capabilities to start placing so much emphasis on values. “We think ossification is too risky for Ethereum. It prevents Ethereum from staying competitive as a platform, as applications and users move toward more centralized alternatives. Ossification also poses its own centralization risks to Ethereum.” As Paradigm also noted, there are ways Ethereum can overcome these challenges. One is encouraging client teams to have a say, not a veto, in development affairs. In addition, the firm said it would allocate more resources to R&D and improve the All Core Devs process. Paradigm’s Role In Improving Ethereum According to the firm, it contributes to Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), drawing on its status as researchers and engineers. Beyond this, it also assists the ETH growth with data analysis and code, focusing on EIP-7862. This EIP, as noted, does not conflict with the rest of the protocol’s roadmap. Beyond this, the research firm said it developed Reth as an SDK to help with Ethereum’s experimentation. It said it is building and supporting foundational tooling to cap its role within the ecosystem. These include but are not limited to Foundary, Alloy, and Solar. To summarize its latest take, Paradigm believes the protocol can perform better if it ships faster. Expected Upgrades and Price Outlook Based on its recent call from all core developers, key stakeholders agreed on a mid-March launch timeline for the Pectra upgrade . This upgrade has been in the works for months and will enhance usability for both developers and ushers. Ultimately, experts believe the changes within the ecosystem will positively impact prices. At the time of writing, ETH was changing hands for $3,341.89, up by 0.48% in 24 hours. Per the long-term projection offered by Bitwise, the ETH price could hit $7,000 this year.

The past year has seen many crypto enthusiasts make a fortune. Bitcoin has soared over 220% from its 2024 price of $46,000 to all-time highs of $109,000, and many new cryptocurrencies have followed suit. Cardano and Ripple holders have been on the favorable end of the crypto market in recent years, with the latter benefiting from a favorable verdict in its battle with the SEC. With the hype in the market reaching record highs, investors are seeking better opportunities to maximize their investments. 1Fuel, which has delivered a 1,700% return for its Stage 1 presale investors , has become a major name on the radar. XRP’s 2025 started on a high note XRP’s success story has been nothing short of spectacular. A victory against the SEC, new all-time highs, and talks of an XRP ETF have all put Ripple in the spotlight this year. Its unique proposition as a one-stop shop for low-cost cross-border payments may be debated, but its momentum and positive market sentiment cannot be denied. The question on everyone’s mind is: After this SEC victory, what’s next for Ripple? With the price approaching overbought territory, investors are carefully weighing their options for the next big coin to buy. 1Fuel has already emerged as a clear option. With no multi-wallet concerns, seamless cross-chain interoperability, and a strong, unified community, it stands out as a top contender. What next after Cardano hits $1 Soaring to $1.30 was a landmark achievement for Cardano. The almost three-year wait to reach $1 was worth it, but the question on everyone's mind is: What’s next? Cardano seems to need a catalyst to push higher, and the lack of one is evident in its price chart, which suggests a drop to the $0.55 zone is more likely. While chatter about a potential Cardano ETF is growing, it is unlikely to significantly move the needle. With nearly 10 other cryptocurrencies vying for an ETF, and Bitcoin and Ethereum firmly cementing their status as the leading cryptocurrencies, Cardano faces stiff competition. Cardano holders are now turning their attention to a cryptocurrency that doesn’t rely on an ETF, boasts cutting-edge technology, and prioritizes security and privacy 1Fuel ($OFT). Why the hype on 1Fuel 1Fuel is positioning itself as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency industry. With its disposable wallets and inbuilt mixers, privacy and ease of use are brought to the forefront as key focuses of the technology. However, privacy and ease are just the beginning. The 1Fuel platform integrates a wide range of features into one cohesive ecosystem. The goal isn’t simply to be another name in the crypto market but to redefine what cryptocurrencies stand for and drive global adoption. The hype surrounding 1Fuel is already evident in its presales. From a Stage 1 presale price of $0.01 to its current presale price of $0.17, investors are seeing significant gains. Many cryptocurrency analysts predict that 1Fuel could soar by as much as 50x after it lists on exchanges. The presale is underway, offering you the opportunity to secure 1Fuel ($OFT) at the lowest possible price.

Meow, Jupiter’s founder, shared the acquisition update with the community in a post on X. Notably, Moonshot is an app that enables the purchase of memecoins via Apple Pay. Strategic Acquisition to Enhance Memecoin Engagement According to Meow’s announcement, Jupiter has become the primary owner of Moonshot. Users can, therefore, look forward to Moonshot benefitting from the resources of Jupiter and an alignment of goals going forward. The acquisition could result in a unique blend of both entities, as Meow lauded and complimented the Moonshot team. The team is amongst the most innovative, driven group of people I have ever met,” he wrote in his post. This highlights that Moonshot’s team could add significant expertise and value to Jupiter. Industry stakeholders have suggested that the collaboration focuses on memes, digital culture, or humor-based projects. Moonshot’s Amazing Performance Notably, memecoins remain a viable way of engaging users in the crypto space. A clear example was the surprise launch of Donald Trump’s Official Trump (TRUMP) on January 18, 2025. The token immediately gained traction in crypto and beyond, with many raking in huge profits from the project. Interestingly, Moonshot’s popularity soared after the launch of TRUMP. Although it was launched in July 2024, Moonshot did not make much of a splash, remaining in the 309th position on the U.S. App Store ranking as of January 1, 2025. However, following the launch of TRUMP memecoin, Moonshot jumped to the top spot, buoyed by the sentiments. This saw Moonshot’s trading volume leap by approximately $400 million. This positive effect also rubbed off on Solana and pushed it to a new all-time high (ATH) of $294.33 on January 19. Jupiter’s Planned Airdrops and Ecosystem Growth Meanwhile, Jupiter has plans to carry out a major token airdrop worth $580 million this January. According to the announcement last month, it would distribute about 700 million tokens to stakers, users, and contributors in the community. Aside from using it as a loyalty reward program, the airdrop could also attract new users to the platform.

Why Crypto Traders are Crypto dumping Dogecoin (DOGE) at $0.40 Dogecoin (DOGE) price tumbled towards $0.35 on Saturday, January 25, down 20% within the 7-day timeframe. Market data analysis reveals key reasons DOGE traders are taking on a bearish outlook this week. Profit-Taking Following Trump’s Inauguration Leading up to President Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025, DOGE saw a significant rally, surging from $0.10 to $0.40—a 300% increase. This surge was largely driven by market optimism surrounding Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency stance and the appointment of Elon Musk to lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). The inauguration served as a catalyst for profit-taking, with many investors liquidating their positions to realize gains, contributing to the recent price decline. Dogecoin Price Action DOGE price has experienced a 20% decline over the past week, trading around $0.35 as of January 25, 2025. This downturn coincides with the introduction of new memecoins associated with President Donald Trump on the Solana blockchain.2. 2. Emergence of Trump’s Memecoins on Solana On January 18, 2025, President Trump announced the launch of the $TRUMP token on the Solana blockchain. The token quickly gained traction, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $10 billion shortly after its release. Trump Launches Official Memecoins, January 20 | Source: X.com The rapid ascent of $TRUMP and similar tokens has diverted investor attention and capital away from DOGE, leading to decreased demand and downward price pressure on Dogecoin. 3. Concerns Over Political Associations The establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) and its association with Dogecoin has introduced political considerations for investors. Some market participants are cautious about potential regulatory scrutiny or reputational risks stemming from the cryptocurrency’s perceived alignment with the current administration. Speculators hint Elon Musk could deploy Dogecoin for D.O.GE | Source: X.com Emphasizing this stance, after talks of Dogecoin logo on the official D.O.G.E website, speculations have emerged that Elon Musk might be considering untilzing the Dogecoin blockchain for some of the agency’s activity. This apprehension has led certain investors to reduce or exit their DOGE holdings, further contributing to the recent price decline. In summary, the combination of profit-taking post-inauguration, the rise of competing memecoins like $TRUMP, and concerns over political affiliations has collectively influenced Dogecoin’s recent market performance. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Forecast: Potential Drop to $0.31 Support Dogecoin price forecast chart show that the memecoin currently trades at $0.359, posting modest 2.53% intraday gain. However, the technical indicators suggest a potential bearish shift in the near term. The Keltner Channel highlights DOGE’s price struggling to reclaim the median band at $0.36, with the upper resistance at $0.42 remaining untested since the recent rejection. The Parabolic SAR indicators remain above the price action, signaling bearish momentum dominance. The recent 19.55% price drop over seven days reflects weakening buyer strength, as evidenced by declining volumes post-recovery. Dogecoin Price Forecast | DOGEUSD In a bullish scenario, DOGE would need to reclaim and sustain levels above $0.36 while breaking the upper Keltner Channel resistance near $0.42. A rise in RSI above 55.00 could signal renewed bullish momentum, driven by increased market interest. However, in a bearish case, DOGE risks breaking below immediate support at $0.35, with a potential drop toward the critical $0.31 support. A further RSI dip below 50.00 would confirm overselling pressure, while decreasing trading volumes support this outlook.

Currently in its presale, Remittix has seen close to 3 million token sales, generating about $6.2 million in total. Set to revolutionize crypto-to-fiat PayFi protocol, this token’s appeal keeps investors increasing their holdings. Dogecoin's Price Rally Using advanced AI models, analysts forecast Dogecoin's price could reach $1 this year. According to CoinCodex’s prediction, the popular crypto prediction platform, Dogecoin, could hit the $1 milestone by the end of March 2025. The platform forecasts DOGE could attain the $1.04 milestone by the end of the first quarter and even reach $1.11 by April — an over 215% surge from its current price. As of this press, Dogecoin is trading at 0.3558, a 1.0% rise in the past day. However, its price has been far from impressive in recent days, down by 8.2% in the past week. Dogecoin's loss came at the time Shiba Inu’s image was removed from the newly launched D.O.G.E. website —created by the Department Of Government Efficiency. Interestingly, the website is unrelated to Dogecoin but its name garnered attention within the crypto community due to similarity to DOGE. This removal also marked a sharp decline in Dogecoin's trading volume, falling by 75%. If this bearish trend continues, RTX could overcome DOGE in no time. Bonk Loses First Place To TRUMP Meanwhile, Bonk, a Solana memecoin has seen a better price rally in the past few days, with 7.8% and 11.2% rise in the past week and 14 days respectively. However, its price is still down by 7.2% in the past one month. Meanwhile, Bonk had a beautiful run late last year, reaching a new all-time high at $0.00005916 in November 2024. Bonk currently trades at $0.00003114, marking a year-to-date growth of 196%. Bonk’s market cap currently stands at $2.3 billion, with 24 hours trading volume of $389k. As such, a new entrant in the crypto scene $TRUMP has now flipped Bonk in market cap, tripling Bonk’s as it reaches $6.92 Billion. Meanwhile, analysts project RTX to have even a better run when launch, which could see it also flip Bonk's market cap within a week. Can RTX Obliterate Dogecoin and Bonk? With mixed signals dominating Dogecoin's price and $Trump token flipping Bonk, analysts are overly bullish on RTX’s price prediction, a crypto token that could be the hallmark of this bull run. Citing numerous use cases with patterns mirroring the early days of Solana, analysts predict this token could obliterate Dogecoin and Bonk, giving investors monumental returns on their investment. Remittix, the platform behind the RTX token, is transforming international payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions. Supporting about 50 cryptocurrencies, Remittix enables seamless conversion to fiat currencies like USD and EUR. It offers a faster and more cost-effective alternative to traditional systems such as SWIFT. With a transparent flat-fee model, Remittix ensures recipients receive the exact amount sent without hidden charges. Additionally, businesses can utilize the platform’s API for efficient international payroll, converting crypto payments into fiat and directly depositing funds into employees’ bank accounts, streamlining global operations and reducing costs. For transparency, remittix prioritizes user autonomy and security, eliminating third-party involvement in transactions. With audits from Solidproof and BlockSAFU, Remittix also offers a reliable and trusted infrastructure, and Remittix’s locked team tokens for three years eliminates the chance for insider sell-offs and reinforces investor confidence. Priced at $0.0311 during its presale the RTX token offers a promising investment opportunity for any ambitious investors; with a capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens and forecasts of up to 100x returns in 2025, Remittix is well-positioned to transform the cross-border payments sector, obliterating Dogecoin and Bonk in profit potential. What makes Remittix particularly impressive is the way investors are rallying around the token. The Remittix presale has already raised $6.2 million, selling over 320 million tokens in total. Participants who keyed into the project have seen 100% rise in their holdings with analysts expecting the price to surge by 800% as the presale unfolds.

Currently in presale, Remittix has sold nearly 3 million tokens, bringing in approximately $6.2 million in total. Positioned to transform the crypto-to-fiat PayFi protocol, this token's growing appeal continues to attract more investors. Dogecoin's Price Surge Utilizing sophisticated AI models, analysts predict Dogecoin's price could reach $1 this year. CoinCodex, a well-known crypto prediction platform, anticipates that Dogecoin could achieve the $1 mark by the end of March 2025. The platform projects that DOGE could hit $1.04 by the end of the first quarter and reach $1.11 by April — a leap of over 215% from its current value. At this press time, Dogecoin is trading at 0.3558, reflecting a 1.0% increase in the past day. However, its performance in recent days has been underwhelming, with an 8.2% decline over the past week. Dogecoin's downturn coincided with the removal of Shiba Inu’s image from the newly launched D.O.G.E. website, created by the Department Of Government Efficiency. Although the site is unrelated to Dogecoin, its name caught the crypto community's attention due to its resemblance to DOGE. This removal also coincided with a significant drop in Dogecoin's trading volume, which decreased by 75%. If this bearish trend persists, RTX could quickly overtake DOGE. Bonk Overtaken by TRUMP Meanwhile, Bonk, a memecoin on the Solana blockchain, has experienced a more favorable price rally recently, with increases of 7.8% and 11.2% over the past week and 14 days respectively. However, its price remains down by 7.2% over the last month. Bonk enjoyed a remarkable surge late last year, reaching a new all-time high of $0.00005916 in November 2024. Bonk is currently trading at $0.00003114, showing a year-to-date growth of 196%. Its market cap stands at $2.3 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $389k. In the meantime, a newcomer in the crypto space, $TRUMP, has surpassed Bonk in market cap, tripling Bonk's figure as it reaches $6.92 billion. Analysts predict that RTX could perform even better upon launch, potentially overtaking Bonk's market cap within a week. Will RTX Surpass Dogecoin and Bonk? With mixed signals affecting Dogecoin's price and the $Trump token overtaking Bonk, analysts are very optimistic about RTX’s price outlook, seeing it as a potential standout in this bull run. Drawing parallels with the early success of Solana, experts believe this token could surpass Dogecoin and Bonk, providing investors with substantial returns.

What makes Remittix particularly notable is the strong investor support for the token. The Remittix presale has already raised $6.2 million, selling over 320 million tokens in total.

This portends a 90-day restructuring plan into which the protocol appears to be entering. Those familiar with the situation say it has been catalyzed by fears of insolvency. While trading on the platform remains active, the associated token, $RUNE, has not been able to make headway and is down 30%. THORChain halts THORFi lending over insolvency fears, kicking off a 90-day restructuring plan. Trading stays active, but $RUNE is down 30%. This pause feels like a ‘bankruptcy freeze’ to avoid a liquidity crisis. Will they pull through? pic.twitter.com/GvDL01HGEn — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) January 24, 2025 THORFi Lending Halted: A Bankruptcy Freeze in Disguise? Numerous commentators have analogized the decision to stop THORFi lending with a “bankruptcy freeze,” a precautionary measure often taken to prevent a liquidity crisis. THORChain states that the pause allows it to deal with “some structural issues” within its THORFi lending services while it recalibrates the entirety of that operation. The lending service will not be available for three months, according to announcements made by THORChain and on the THORFi website. The financial health of the protocol has come under fire with the sudden suspension. Critics have even gone so far as to accuse it of insolvency. They have raised serious doubts about whether THORChain is able to meet its obligations and, if not, what that means for the growing number of users that rely on it. The situation is putting immense pressure on $RUNE, which has already lost nearly a third of its value over the past few days. Financial Troubles Cast a Shadow Over THORChain A decentralized liquidity protocol that enables cross-chain swaps, THORChain has for some time occupied a vital position within the DeFi sector. Recently, however, it has experienced some financial difficulties that have made some observers raise doubt about its future. A primary concern is whether the platform’s reserves are even sufficient to cover its obligations. Critics point to possible mismatches between the assets that the protocol holds and the liabilities tied to its lending services. If these gaps exist, they’re a ticking time bomb that could lead to significant, not to say catastrophic, liquidity issues. Compounding the problems is the steep drop in the value of $RUNE. As the protocol’s native token, $RUNE has a critical role in the THORChain ecosystem. It serves as a medium of exchange and collateral, underpinning the whole system. When a native token drops significantly in price, it impacts confidence in the system and the ability to attract and retain users. The trending cryptocurrencies getting the highest increases in discussion Friday include: Bitcoin $BTC : US President Trump has made an executive order regarding a national digital asset stockpile, which affects Bitcoin custody by banks. The order rescinds prior… pic.twitter.com/riWOR4400L — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 24, 2025 Market Reaction: $RUNE Takes a Hit The reaction of the market to the news has been quick and intense. The $RUNE price falling 30% clearly shows that investors are deeply concerned about THORChain’s financial stability. There is a clear decrease in both trading volume and confidence in the platform. When something like this happens, what we usually do in the writing community is pull back and look at the facts available to us before moving forward in the narrative. Even in this time of turmoil, THORChain trading proceeds apace. The platform has assured users that it will continue to operate core functions while it restructures. Increased activity on the RUNE token suggests that users are betting on RUNE’s replacement of asset pool balances to keep THORChain itself from stalling. Still, assurances and RUNE token activity haven’t quashed fears that pausing the lending feature signals deeper problems within the protocol. The 90-Day Restructuring Plan: A Path to Recovery? THORChain has announced a 90-day restructuring plan, and it’s a doozy. It’s probably the most significant step that THORChain could take for its platform and its users. Not much is known about the plan yet, but looking at the few details that are available—along with what we know about the impending hard fork—offers some insight into just what might be happening over the next three months. Although some see the restructuring as a necessary step toward recovery, others are skeptical. The platform’s financial position is so unclear that people are speculating up and down about the true extent of its problems. The next three months are going to be critical for THORChain—either it will establish itself as a functioning, sustainable platform, or it won’t. Implications for the Broader DeFi Ecosystem The problems that THORChain has encountered shine a light on the vulnerabilities that still exist in the DeFi ecosystem. Even though decentralized platforms are offering some new and innovative solutions to the kinds of problems that we face in the financial transaction space, they are not risk-free, particularly when it comes to liquidity management and other issues that are related to, or that fall under the umbrella of, market fluctuations. DeFi protocols should heed THORChain’s cautionary tale. They need to be well-planned and financially sound. They also need to be transparent so that users and investors—in this case, daring participants in decentralized finance—can make responsible decisions about the use of and investment in DeFi protocols. DeFi finance is real finance, with a real need for responsible participants. Conclusion: Uncertainty Ahead for THORChain The THORChain lending protocol has had to hit the brakes. It’s now not lending, but THORFi, in recent days, has been too uncertain for the team to go on with lending. And that’s obviously a turbulent situation for the team. It’s a challenge for the protocol and the team to navigate through allegations of insolvency. And when you walk into the allegations of insolvency, it certainly walks directly through user confidence and into the user experience. At this point, the main concentration is on $RUNE, which keeps taking the hits from the market’s uncertainty. As the plan to restructure the whole thing plays out, every set of eyes that can will be watching THORChain to see if it can pull off a restoration of trust and come up with a reaffirmation of its position as a key player in the DeFi space. Until then, the caution that it may have urged in the past is now, plainly, its better part. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While these big names have seen steady growth, this rising star promises even bigger gains, thanks to its innovative features and growing community. If you're looking for the best coin to invest today, this altcoin might just be your best bet for success! Solana (SOL) Shows Strength Despite Challenges Rising 34% already this year, Solana's native token, SOL, has been performing nicely in 2025. Though it still challenges to keep above the $260 support level, the token's price rose by 7% on January 22 to reach $263.54. Excitement about meme coin trading, particularly following the release of the Official Trump (Trump) token on January 18, accounts for a great portion of this increase. Although SOL might rise further, breaking beyond $280 could take some time. The token peaked at $295 on January 19, but certain signs point to difficulties for it currently. For instance, from $35.5 million on January 19 to $11.7 million on January 21 Solana's network fees dropped by 67%. Usually, lower fees translate into less trading activity on dispersed exchanges (DEXs) such as Raydium, Pump.fun, and Orca. Solana's general activity stays better than last week even with these declines, indicating that the network is still robust. SOL's performance is under intense observation by analysts as it can potentially make another step toward record highs. For now, it reminds us that although Solana is developing, market conditions change fast. Cardano’s Journey to $4, What’s Next for ADA? With its price down 3.56% over the previous 24 hours and 7.65% over the past week, Cardano (ADA) is now trading at $0.9711. Still, it's not all bad news; ADA's last month's rise of 7.69% indicates that it is maintaining support at crucial levels. This might indicate, according to analysts, a future possible price breakout. Expert in cryptocurrencies Ali Martinez has seen a rise in daily active addresses of Cardano throughout January. More individuals are utilizing the network, a clear sign of expansion. Historically, when network activity rises like this, prices usually follow with rising motions. ADA might be laying the groundwork for a rise here. Still, there is not perfect sailing. On hourly charts, a ""death cross"" pattern points to ADA maybe suffering further temporary losses. This is the situation when two moving averages cross in typically declining fashion. Furthermore, a lot of futures market traders are predicting that ADA would decline much more, which would have further negative influence. Cardano's rapid expansion and high user engagement suggest better days ahead despite these obstacles. Is ADA still on course for $4? Time will prove. Remittix (RTX) Is The Best Coin to Invest Today Remittix (RTX) is grabbing attention as the best coin to invest today, standing out as a revolutionary project in the world of cryptocurrencies.

While these established cryptocurrencies have experienced consistent growth, this emerging contender promises even more impressive returns, driven by its cutting-edge features and expanding user base. If you're searching for the top cryptocurrency investment today, this altcoin could be your ideal choice for achieving financial success! Solana (SOL) Displays Resilience Amidst Obstacles Solana's native token, SOL, has already increased by 34% this year, showing solid performance in 2025. Although maintaining a position above the $260 support level remains challenging, the token's price saw a 7% rise on January 22, reaching $263.54. The surge in meme coin trading, especially after the launch of the Official Trump (Trump) token on January 18, significantly contributed to this growth. While SOL may continue to ascend, surpassing the $280 mark might require more time. The token hit a high of $295 on January 19, but several indicators suggest difficulties ahead. For example, Solana's network fees plummeted by 67%, from $35.5 million on January 19 to $11.7 million on January 21. Typically, lower fees indicate reduced trading activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Raydium, Pump.fun, and Orca. Despite these declines, Solana's overall activity remains stronger than the previous week, reflecting the network's resilience. Analysts are closely monitoring SOL's progress as it could potentially break new records. For now, it serves as a reminder that while Solana is evolving, market dynamics can shift rapidly. Cardano's Path to $4: What Lies Ahead for ADA? Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.9711, with a decrease of 3.56% over the past 24 hours and 7.65% over the last week. However, there is a silver lining; ADA's 7.69% increase over the past month shows that it is maintaining its position at critical support levels. Analysts believe this could signal a potential price breakout in the future. Cryptocurrency expert Ali Martinez has observed an increase in daily active addresses on Cardano's network throughout January. This uptick in user activity is a positive sign of growth. Historically, when network engagement rises, prices often follow suit. ADA might be setting the stage for an upward trend here. Nonetheless, the journey isn’t entirely smooth. A ""death cross"" pattern on hourly charts suggests ADA could face more short-term losses. This occurs when two moving averages cross in a typical downward pattern. Additionally, many futures market traders are betting on a further decline in ADA, which could exert additional downward pressure. Despite these hurdles, Cardano's rapid growth and high user engagement point to promising times ahead. Will ADA reach the $4 mark? Only time will tell.

39501712,https://nulltx.com/?p=141044,1737845619,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Analyzing TRUMP and MELANIA Token Metrics: Diverging Trends and Unique Behaviors,https://nulltx.com/analyzing-trump-and-melania-token-metrics-diverging-trends-and-unique-behaviors/,"The on-chain activity linked to the TRUMP ($TRUMP) and MELANIA ($MELANIA) tokens has piqued the interest of the crypto community. Named after two of today’s most visible public figures, these tokens have revealed some extremely distinct holder behaviors, with real and potential PNL (profit and loss) that have marked them as something of an asset. And while the world was watching last week, both the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens were making primetime headlines, with some developments that are horning in on the usually low-profile space of crypto asset custody. Wallet Creation Patterns: A Shared Origin A truly remarkable statistic is the considerable crossover between the creation of wallets and the acquisition of tokens. Almost half of the holders of $TRUMP and $MELANIA created their wallets on the same day they bought these tokens. This strange behavior indicates that a lot of really interested people were making their first purchases of crypto. We are clearly in the midst of a meme token moment, with these two tokens virally attracting a lot of new entrants to the ecosystem. Profitability Metrics: TRUMP Outpaces MELANIA In terms of profitability, $TRUMP traders appear to have done better than their $MELANIA counterparts. Most $TRUMP traders are at a net loss, but the number of traders making profits between $10,000 and $10 million exceeds the number of traders reporting losses of that same magnitude. This signals that while many $TRUMP traders have not succeeded in making profitable trades, a handful of them has managed to steer the token in a direction that allowed for some “cash in hand.” By contrast, reported $MELANIA traders had a significantly greater percentage of negative PNL outcomes. This difference highlights trading dynamics and market sentiment discrepancies between the two tokens. $MELANIA trading activities seem to have been more concentrated among a few participants, which may explain the heightened loss likelihood. Trading Behavior: A Tale of Two Sell-Offs The patterns of selling for $TRUMP and $MELANIA reveal further differences in trader behavior. For $TRUMP, the largest sell-offs seem to have happened on January 19, when the price was over $60. On this day alone, traders who sold $TRUMP (and only $TRUMP) sold tokens worth approximately $78 million. And this was on a day when the token was surging. So what were these traders up to? Well, if you ask the tokenomics team, they’ll say it was a wave of profit-taking among sellers who seemingly sought to capitalize on the surge. In contrast, $MELANIA’s sell-off was concentrated in time. The majority of $MELANIA tokens were sold within the first four hours after the token’s launch, with a total sell volume of around $98 million. This rapid liquidation suggests that many early buyers saw $MELANIA as an opportunity with a very short window for making gains, leading to quick profit-taking and a trading activity level that fell off a cliff after those first four hours. Token Distribution: A Concentration of Small Holders Another important factor is the distribution of token ownership among $TRUMP and $MELANIA holders. More than 80% of holders for both tokens own less than $1,000 worth of assets on Solana. This distribution highlights the pixels of these tokens, and it shows in really bold letters that the buy button is being pushed by main street—by retail investors, that is. And that’s not a bad thing; in fact, it’s seemingly a good thing for these Solana-based meme tokens. And it is certainly a much, much better thing than if these tokens were being owned and controlled by a handful of big players. TRUMP & MELANIA Onchain Metrics 1/6 Nearly half of $TRUMP and $MELANIA holders created their wallets on the same day they purchased the tokens. pic.twitter.com/7wtEOIM1W4 — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) January 24, 2025 What These Metrics Tell Us On-chain data for $TRUMP and $MELANIA reveals the unique dynamics of meme-token markets. Both tokens drew much interest from newcomers to the space, as evidenced by a ton of new wallets created to trade the assets. But what happened after the wallets were created didn’t look too similar for $TRUMP and $MELANIA, with their trading patterns and profitability outcomes diverging significantly in a very short amount of time. The data for $TRUMP indicates a kind of activity that is a mix of speculation and strategic profit-taking. Some traders have been trying to catch $TRUMP’s volatility and have done so quite successfully to secure them some very nice gains. $MELANIA, however, is showing us an entirely different picture. The concentrated sell-off occurring in $MELANIA alongside a pretty pronounced negative PNL outcome trend has us believing that $MELANIA isn’t giving its traders the kinds of favorable long-term holding conditions that we occasionally see in $TRUMP. Looking Ahead The crypto market is still developing, and the tokens that are created in its meme image, like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, are sure to remain a hot-button issue. While the viral nature of these assets can easily generate huge levels of interest and trading volumes, their speculative nature makes them risky investments. Meme tokens are held mostly by small-scale holders, and because these tokens are so volatile, caution is warranted. If you’re contemplating trading in or investing in meme tokens, attempting to understand the metrics and behind-the-scene workings of the market can yield useful insights into the nature of the potential risks and rewards that are part and parcel of this very speculative asset class. In the end, both $TRUMP and $MELANIA, through their rise and downfall, remind us of the speculative charm of meme tokens and their almost child-like appeal to the crypto community. They may not last or hold any real value, but if they can get people talking, thinking, and imagining, then they’ve done what all good tokens are supposed to do.

39501882,https://nulltx.com/?p=141048,1737845914,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Fresh Wallet 0x977 Makes Major $OM Moves: A Whale is on the Hunt?,https://nulltx.com/fresh-wallet-0x977-makes-major-om-moves-a-whale-is-on-the-hunt/,"In a development that has caught the attention of the crypto community, an active cryptocurrency wallet , 0x977, is making a name for itself in the market. Just 15 hours ago, it withdrew a staggering amount of over 616,610 $OM tokens (worth $2.23 million) from the cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. This withdrawal, mind you, was not an isolated event. In the past 36 hours, the wallet has amassed an aggressive total of $OM tokens, withdrawing a total of 1.859 million tokens from Binance. The average price for these tokens (according to the crypto news site Blockworks) was $3.627. That means the wallet has invested an estimated $6.74 million in those tokens. And as you might expect, lots of folks in the crypto community are now rightfully asking questions. A Coordinated Accumulation of $OM: Whale Behavior or a Bigger Play? The attention the crypto community has given the wallet’s latest activity is perhaps understandable. It is not every day, after all, that a newly active wallet makes such large-scale and obviously orchestrated withdrawals of such an obviously valuable asset—especially with the amount of $OM tokens involved. In fact, the sheer scale of these operations is more than enough to prompt a discussion about whether we are just looking at a single whale making a very profitable move or a part of some larger, whale-led scheme to depress token prices. What makes this specific whale behavior captivating is that it seems not to be a single occurrence. Other wallets have been seen not just being, well, wallet-ish, but also showing heightened activity and accumulating $OM tokens. Could this be a sign of something larger looming? Are these several wallets working together in some sort of financial choreography to raise the token’s price or, just maybe, to set the stage for a big, coordinated sell-off? This conduct is frequently observed among big market players who try to amass a position prior to making a significant move—usually either an upward price shift triggered by new developments or, conversely, a large-scale dumping operation. The fact that a single digital wallet has moved over $6 million worth of tokens in such a short time span is an ominous sign for the token’s price and could indicate that the price is about to go down. This activity has an outsized impact on the price of tokens. If other investors begin to note the substantial positions these wallets are establishing, we could see a real uptrend in interest and an uptick in buying pressure. Conversely, if the wallets doing all this aren’t doing it for fun and are looking to cash out, we could see a large sell-off that would have a dramatic effect on the price of $OM in the very near future. A Closer Look at $OM’s Recent Performance To completely grasp the influence of these latest whale moves, it’s necessary to assess the recent performance of $OM itself. This token has captured the attention of a lot of investors, and for a good reason. It has shown some serious price movement of late. Right now, the price of $OM sits at $3.627 per token, but the volume of those recent withdrawals suggests that a lot of people believe $OM has a lot more room to run. 0x977’s actions could indicate a belief in $OM’s possible upside. With $OM trading at about $3.627, this wallet’s buying signifies a heavy bet on the token. “Whales” like 0x977 usually don’t accumulate without a good reason. Given the kind of price volatility that $OM has already seen, not to mention the speculative nature of many meme coins and altcoins, these large-scale purchases could be setting up for a massive price movement in one direction or the other. Fresh Wallet 0x977 Goes Big on $OM A newly active wallet, 0x977, just made another significant move, withdrawing 616,610 #OM ($2.23M) from Binance 15 hours ago. pic.twitter.com/v8rfKLJQeM — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) January 25, 2025 Although no conclusive proof indicates that $OM will tread the same way as some of the more famous altcoins that have seen their prices explode, the recent attention and enthusiasm around it have traders watching closely. In recent days, and alongside the broader market uptick, $OM has seen a dramatic uptick in withdrawals and wallet activity. If this keeps up, pulls the price up with it, and fills back into the exchanges, it could trigger a nice little price rally. What’s Next for $OM? The main issue at hand is what’s next for $OM and the wallets that have been implicated. Historically, large holders, or whales, have bought up lots of crypto, made some big moves, and then our favorite tokens have moved in some kind of phase. Whether $OM and its wallets are going to make some kind of price phase next week remains a mystery. Investors in cryptocurrency will be observing attentively to determine if larger wallets enter the market and whether the price of $OM sees a remarkable uptick in the next few days. Given the level of activity around this token, it seems certain that $OM is poised to make a significant move in the near future—upwards, if demand continues to swell, and downwards, if the increased activity turns out to be the prelude to a substantial sell-off. To conclude, the activities of wallet 0x977 and others have infused fresh vigor into the $OM market. Although, whether this will amount to any significant price action or not will depend largely on the state of the macro markets, right now, with the macro being what it is, all eyes are on $OM and the whales playing a pivotal role in its price trajectory.

This new AI altcoin is generating whispers of unparalleled potential, and experts predict it could deliver a staggering 40,000% market edge. This coin’s unique integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology positions it as a game-changer, and its disruptive potential is drawing the attention of seasoned Ripple whales seeking the next exponential growth opportunity. What sets this AI altcoin, PCHAIN apart is its innovative use of AI, the Metaverse, and smart contracts to redefine the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. As Ripple whales quietly accumulate positions, their movements suggest confidence in this coin’s ability to redefine market dynamics. PCHAIN: The AI Altcoin In Question PCHAIN is the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-powered real estate tokenization platform. The token gives investors early access to the future of the multi-trillion-dollar real estate market. Unlike most traditional crypto assets that thrive on market sentiment, this innovative AI altcoin is backed by the number one asset class in the world. According to leading market experts, PCHAIN is positioned for a massive 40,000% rally, making it a potential top-gainer in the crypto space. Although an emerging AI altcoin, Ripple whales see huge potential in the asset, which is why these seasoned investors are quietly joining the ongoing PCHAIN presale. Why Ripple Whales Are Paying Attention Ripple whales , known for their strategic investments, are very good at spotting opportunities before they hit the mainstream. Their recent interest in this AI altcoin, PCHAIN, is based on several compelling factors: Unmatched Growth Potential A 40,000% market edge is not a figure to ignore.

Digitalization of Real World Assets This is a great revolution in the real estate sector As PropiChain plans to digitalize all real estate assets and transactions, ensuring trades on a secure blockchain network eradicating the need for physical documentations. In addition this further stretches to the fractional ownership of assets allowing small scale investors to buy, sell, own and manage properties in fractions rather than as a whole. Through this process, homeowners can access financing at lower interest rates, similar to traditional HELOCs, thereby providing a more accessible and affordable financing option for property owners. 3D Metaverse Property Exploration Metaverse implementation allows international investors to explore properties virtually from anywhere in the world creating more customized options of home, offices, and commercial spaces. Its immersive 3D environment creates a more dynamic and interactive experience that far surpasses traditional methods reducing uncertainty and enhancing confidence in purchase decisions. Its AR/VR capabilities also eradicate a geographical barrier that might be an hindrance during property exploration making real estate transactions more accessible and convenient, whether it’s discussing terms or even finalizing a deal.

This is a noticeable trend as the amount of BTC available on centralized exchanges (CEXs) continues to drop. HODLers are still HODLing, and we are seeing a shift to an even more favorable supply-and-demand picture for BTC, with long-term holders clearly becoming more and more reluctant to sell their coins. BTC recorded $800M in net outflows from exchanges this week, showing demand is still strong as supply available on CEXs continues to decrease pic.twitter.com/6raOgFV0Q1 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 25, 2025 Hodler Selling and the Rise of Bitcoin Dominance A large part of this story is the long-term holders of Bitcoin selling, especially after Donald Trump was elected in November 2024. Since then, they have moved an estimated 500,000 BTC, worth around $50 billion, from their addresses. The good part of this trend is that it seems to indicate a slowdown in selling activity. And what’s good about that is that it aligns with a growing sentiment that Bitcoin is once again primed for further upward momentum. Hodler selling accelerated since Trump's election, with 500k BTC (~$50B) leaving long-term holders' addresses since November pic.twitter.com/xcpmBFwSHe — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 24, 2025 The metric that tracks BTC’s share of the total cryptocurrency market, called Bitcoin dominance, is again on the upswing. After hitting an approximate low of 54% in December 2024, BTC dominance has surged back above 57% in January 2025, signaling a renewed interest in what is still the leading cryptocurrency. This behavior, in which BTC dominance casts a shadow well over $1 trillion, echoes what happened in the 2020 cycle, in which Bitcoin’s price also saw a wall-to-wall significant rally. Back then, BTC dominance bottomed out at around 60% in November 2020 before rallying to 69% in January 2021. #Bitcoin dominance is climbing again. After bottoming in December 2024 at ~54%, #BTC dominance has surged past 57% in January 2025. This mirrors the 2020 cycle, where $BTC dominance bottomed in Nov '20 (~60%), then rallied to 69% in Jan '21 before its decline:… pic.twitter.com/ekqfdoIach — glassnode (@glassnode) January 24, 2025 The current market dynamics are best understood in relation to the dominance of Bitcoin and its price. In the last cycle, as the price of BTC began to increase, dominance began to decrease. This decrease signaled not just a shift in the price of Bitcoin but also a shift in what investors were interested in purchasing. After the price of Bitcoin had reached new highs, investors appeared to have resumed moving toward riskier assets—the next-high-altcoin or whatever else promises strong returns when the market is believed to be bullish—after allegedly having crowdsourced the safety of the appearing-to-be stable, first-in-market asset. Key Support Level and the Spot ETF Inflows To keep its bullish price momentum, Bitcoin must hold above some key support levels. One of those is $97,877, where more than 101,000 BTC were amassed. Holding this level, the analysts say, is crucial for keeping the kind of “upward price pressure” on Bitcoin that has the potential to take it where it wants to go—up. The key support level for #Bitcoin is at $97,877, where more than 101,000 $BTC were accumulated. Holding above this level is crucial to sustaining the bullish momentum. pic.twitter.com/4kMR5ZtkWa — Ali (@ali_charts) January 25, 2025 On January 24, significant institutional interest was directed toward Bitcoin. For the seventh consecutive day, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw inflows, amassing a net total of $518 million over that time. One of the main drivers behind that surge in interest was Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), which alone saw a net inflow of $186 million. And by the time January 24 rolled around, the Bitcoin spot ETFs overall had a net asset value of an impressive $123.058 billion. The current state of affairs for the dominance of Bitcoin, along with the inflows of capital into Bitcoin ETFs, tells us that institutional investors are making some big bets on this leading digital asset. They’re betting on not just the sustained outperformance of Bitcoin but also its potential to become a go-to asset in times of crisis, which is what it looks set to become given the uncertain shape of international markets at the moment. On January 24, the total net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was $518 million, with net inflow for 7 consecutive days. The inflow of Fidelity ETF FBTC was $186 million. The current total net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETF is $123.058 billion. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG pic.twitter.com/ykhS8zZR5p — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 25, 2025 What’s Next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s rising dominance, ongoing institutional inflows, and dwindling exchange supply leave the cryptocurrency’s current outlook hard to dispute: it’s bullish. But there’s another reason for optimism, one that takes us to the end of 2024 and beyond. In addition, this asset’s sustained growth in the popularity of Bitcoin ETFs provides yet another support layer. The price of Bitcoin may keep enjoying the continued benefit of a steady stream of institutional capital as more people invest in these vehicles. Most people seem to believe that the price of Bitcoin will keep going up, but few if any, prices are set without some sort of “support level” being in place. Markets seem to be eyeing the $97,877 mark as a support level, and if Bitcoin can hold above that price, it’s “probably” going to keep moving up. To sum up, Bitcoin is reiterating its vigor as a market leader. The mixture of a blow-up in its dominance, a growing interest from institutions, and a supply that is all but nonexistent on exchanges makes the prospect of further price appreciation seem quite likely. Should the crucial support levels hold and inflows from institutions continue, it seems quite probable that we will see a new all-time high in 2025.

Priced at $0.0199 initially but rising to $0.0311, Remittix (RTX) is now hailed as the fastest-growing presale around. But what sets it apart from countless other tokens? Below, we’ll explore why thousands are grabbing RTX right now, how it tackles everyday payments and how it could reshape crypto usage for both newcomers and veterans alike. The Rapid Rise of Remittix: Numbers Don’t Lie Presales can fizzle out quickly if there’s no real substance behind the hype. So far, Remittix has proven it’s more than just talk. Surpassing $5 million raised, the altcoin soared past its early price of $0.0199 to $0.0311 all in a matter of weeks. This fast climb suggests Remittix appeals to investors craving a tangible solution, not another meme coin hype cycle. Demand has spiked among individuals who see real potential for cross-border payments, especially as global finance hunts for ways to cut down fees and transaction times. Some watchers note that this rapid fundraising outpaces many older tokens that took months to achieve similar figures. That jump in interest implies that mainstream or at least utility-minded backers find Remittix compelling. In a sea of meme-driven tokens that rise and fall with internet chatter, RTX offers a use case built around streamlining remittances, something high on the wish list of countless freelancers, global travelers and businesses. The Power of PayFi: Why Remittix Resonates So, what’s driving the Remittix appeal? The project revolves around PayFi, a model blending cryptocurrency with real-world banking. Rather than forcing users to navigate complicated DeFi protocols or chase meme mania, Remittix (RTX) focuses on letting people convert crypto to fiat within 24 hours. By removing hidden fees and complex steps, it opens crypto usage up to everyday folks who might otherwise find the technology baffling. Additionally, Remittix gives businesses an easier way to accept crypto payments, automatically settling transactions as traditional currencies. This plug-and-play approach allows merchants to hop on board without dealing with multi-step conversions. Essentially, Remittix handles the backend, sparing users from digging into multiple platforms or crossing their fingers for a stable token value. That direct utility may be what’s prompting thousands of people to join the presale, less hype, more tangible outcomes. A Welcome Break from Meme Overload While meme coins have commanded headlines, the novelty has worn thin for many. Projects like Shiba Inu soared, then tumbled, as hype drained away, leaving retail investors stuck or uncertain. Despite huge gains at their peak, people are now gravitating toward altcoins with a robust blueprint that goes beyond jokes. That’s where Remittix stands out. It’s not about dog mascots or comedic references; it’s about bridging finance and cryptocurrency so seamlessly that even non-crypto enthusiasts can benefit. Analysts also point out that as interest in purely meme-based tokens cools, utility tokens could see more stable growth. Remittix (RTX) may exemplify this trend, merging the excitement of a new altcoin with a real function that addresses a global market. Even if other tokens stumble during market downturns, a project offering everyday solutions often withstands price volatility better. The Road Ahead: Can Remittix Keep Momentum? Raising over $6 million in presale is a strong launchpad but the question remains: can Remittix fulfill its promise of driving cross-border transactions and dethroning the hassles of expensive remittances? Critics warn that no crypto is failproof, especially in an ever-changing landscape. That said, enthusiastic participants highlight PayFi’s potential to carve out a huge niche, especially in developing regions reliant on costly remittance services. Additionally, the team behind Remittix claims ongoing development to integrate the token with major crypto wallets and payment gateways. If it accomplishes those milestones quickly and fosters trust among early adopters Remittix (RTX) could see a steady climb rather than the pump-and-dump cycle so common in the altcoin scene. Conclusion: A Star in the Making? Frenzied presales often reflect short-lived excitement, but Remittix stands out by tackling a global issue: expensive, slow cross-border payments. With over $6 million raised at record pace and a price hike from $0.0199 to $0.0311, it’s drawing in thousands who’d rather invest in real solutions than memes. If PayFi takes hold and mainstream merchants latch onto the ease of instant crypto-to-fiat, Remittix (RTX) might prove itself beyond the crypto bubble potentially becoming a go-to altcoin for practical finance.

Below, we’ll explore why thousands are grabbing RTX right now, how it tackles everyday payments and how it could reshape crypto usage for both newcomers and veterans alike. Remittix's Meteoric Growth: The Figures Speak for Themselves Presales often lose momentum if there's nothing substantial behind the buzz. However, Remittix has demonstrated it's more than just hype. Surpassing the $5 million mark, the altcoin has accelerated from an initial $0.0199 to $0.0311 within weeks. This rapid ascent indicates that Remittix attracts investors seeking a practical solution rather than another temporary meme coin craze. Interest has surged among those who recognize its potential for cross-border payments, especially as the global financial system seeks to reduce fees and transaction durations. Observers have commented that this swift fundraising surpasses many older tokens that took months to reach similar amounts. This surge in interest suggests that mainstream or utility-focused investors find Remittix appealing. Amidst a landscape dominated by meme tokens that fluctuate with online buzz, RTX presents a use case centered around streamlining remittances, a top priority for many freelancers, international travelers, and businesses. Harnessing the Potential of PayFi: Why Remittix Matters What is fueling the allure of Remittix? At its core is PayFi, a model that merges cryptocurrency with traditional banking. Instead of pushing users into complex DeFi protocols or the latest meme frenzy, Remittix (RTX) emphasizes enabling users to convert crypto to fiat within a day. By eliminating hidden costs and simplifying the process, it makes crypto accessible to everyday individuals who might otherwise find the technology daunting. Furthermore, Remittix provides businesses with a straightforward way to accept crypto payments, converting transactions to conventional currencies automatically. This ready-to-use approach allows merchants to join in without the hassle of multi-step conversions. Essentially, Remittix manages the backend, sparing users from navigating multiple platforms or worrying about token stability. This direct utility is likely why thousands are participating in the presale, focusing on real outcomes rather than mere hype. Stepping Away from the Meme Coin Chaos While meme coins have captured attention, the initial thrill has faded for many. Projects like Shiba Inu experienced significant rises and falls, as excitement waned, leaving many retail investors in limbo. Despite their impressive peaks, people are increasingly drawn to altcoins with solid plans that transcend jokes. This is where Remittix distinguishes itself. It's not about dog mascots or humorous references; it's about seamlessly integrating finance and cryptocurrency so even those not familiar with crypto can benefit. Analysts also suggest that as interest in purely meme-based tokens dwindles, utility tokens might experience more steady growth. Remittix (RTX) could exemplify this shift, combining the thrill of a new altcoin with a practical function that caters to a global market. Even if other tokens falter during market declines, a project offering everyday solutions often weathers price fluctuations more effectively. Looking Forward: Will Remittix Sustain Its Growth? Raising over $6 million in a presale is an impressive start, but the question remains: can Remittix deliver on its promise to enhance cross-border transactions and alleviate the burden of costly remittances? Critics caution that no cryptocurrency is infallible, especially in a fluctuating environment. However, enthusiastic supporters emphasize PayFi’s potential to capture a significant market, particularly in regions where expensive remittance services are prevalent. Moreover, the team behind Remittix asserts that ongoing efforts are being made to integrate the token with major crypto wallets and payment gateways. If these milestones are achieved swiftly and early adopters’ trust is secured, Remittix (RTX) could experience a steady rise as opposed to the typical pump-and-dump cycle seen in the altcoin market. Conclusion: A Potential Rising Star? While frenzied presales often indicate short-term excitement, Remittix stands out by addressing a global challenge: costly, slow cross-border payments. With over $6 million raised at an unprecedented pace and a price increase from $0.0199 to $0.0311, it attracts thousands looking for genuine solutions rather than memes. Should PayFi become widely adopted and mainstream businesses embrace the simplicity of instant crypto-to-fiat conversions, Remittix (RTX) could transcend the crypto bubble, potentially emerging as a preferred altcoin for practical financial applications.

According to LeCun, the biggest point to note in its rise is its vision to keep AI models open source so that everybody can benefit from it. The Chinese artificial intelligence company recently launched its DeepSeek-R1, which features better reasoning and problem-solving capacities, rivaling industry leaders like OpenAI. The AI, launched on January 20, possesses remarkable features, with tests showcasing its exceptional abilities. Aside from that, DeepSeek provides training parameters under an MIT license, allowing researchers globally to study and enhance the program. LeCun noted that the company’s success story is not about putting China ahead of the United States in the AI industry, but making sure open source models are still ahead. It’s not that China’s AI is “surpassing the US,” but rather that “open source models are surpassing proprietary ones,” LeCun said. Meta’s Chief AI scientist discusses DeepSeek’s success DeepSeek shares the same attribute with the Llama model created by Meta, with both being open source. Their rival, OpenAI, which was originally created as an open-source AI firm, has since tried to shift its mission to create technology that will benefit all humanity. The move has caused a lot of legal tussle, with Elon Musk, one of its former executives and contributors asking the court to block its transition to a for-profit. According to Meta’s Chief AI scientist, DeepSeek has enjoyed open source and open research, noting that it was the idea that some people made that they chose to build on. “They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people’s work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it,” LeCun said. “That is the power of open research and open source.” During the unveiling of DeepSeek R1, the company mentioned that the system demonstrates remarkable reasoning capacity, something that has reportedly been put to the test. The company noted that it is trying to push the boundaries of open-source AI. In its paper, the company also highlighted that it made the system because it wanted to explore the potential of artificial intelligence to develop its reasoning abilities without the use of supervised data. According to Professor Ethan Mollick at Wharton, the responses gotten from the DeepSeek R1 is like a human thinking out loud. Meanwhile, there is the issue of the R1 providing issues to AI companies in the United States, seeing that both China and the US have been rivals for a while. With Trump in the White House again, the rivalry is expected to heat up. However, the rivalry is not the main concern, as the AI model shows that China will very much challenge the top AI companies in terms of development. Silicon Valley surprised by DeepSeek announcement The launch of the DeepSeek R1 model took Silicon Valley by surprise, taking center stage in tech discussions in a week that featured various events including Trump’s inauguration and his busy first few days in office, the World Economic Forum that took place in Davos, Switzerland, and TikTok cutting and restoring service to users in the United States. Days after DeepSeek unveiled its model, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to spend over $60 billion in 2025, as the firm prepares to invest big in artificial intelligence. The Meta boss has been a very outspoken proponent of open-source models, even going as far as backing his rival, Elon Musk, in his quest to block OpenAI’s for-profit move. In September 2024, the Meta CEO mentioned he wanted to build the next generation of open platforms. Zuckerberg noted that he hopes to achieve it in the next 10-15 years, stressing that open platforms must win. “I think that’s going to lead to a much more vibrant tech industry,” he added. Making a technology open source has been hailed as the way to go, since it allows anyone to modify and redistribute the codes, this way the technology develops rapidly in a democratic setting. However, proponents of a closed source system have also argued the merits of the models, noting that they are more secure because the codes are kept private. In his case, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has mentioned that taking the closed-source approach with the company provides them an easier way to hit the safety threshold. However, he mentioned in the AMA on Reddit that in the future, he might try to open-source more stuff.

A heavy hitter, World Liberty Financial, recently plunked down $20 million for 3,001 ETH and 95 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), in addition to its already sizable stash. Over the past five days, the fund has shelled out $210.9 million for Ethereum and WBTC. There seems to be no end to this whale activity, which is part of a larger trend that has seen Ethereum appreciating 107% over the past two years. As of January 2025, the asset had reached a value of $3,294.25. #Ethereum ’un Geleceği! Ethereum, son iki yılda %107’lik etkileyici bir artışla 2025 Ocak itibarıyla 3.294,25 dolara ulaşarak dijital varlık piyasasında önemli bir ivme kazandı. Bu yükseliş yalnızca Ethereum’un kendisiyle sınırlı kalmadı; Grayscale Ethereum Trust da aynı dönemde… pic.twitter.com/jQPHmU8YWq — Baykuş (@KriptoBaykusV2) January 24, 2025 Institutional Interest and the Growth of Ethereum ETFs Ethereum’s market is not just picking up the pace with whales and institutional investors; its assets are gaining traction across the board. For example, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust has rumbled up a cool 243% over the past two years—an impressive figure in such a turbulent market—which mirrors (and is slightly ahead of) the overall price performance of Ethereum itself. This means that not only is Ethereum being bought up, but also that investment vehicles built on top of Ethereum (like Grayscale’s Trust) are being increasingly seen as vehicles in which to place funds. At present, more than 3 million ETH are held by substantial institutional investors in Ethereum ETFs, a sign of their significant trust in the DeFi world. These really seem to be stable holdings, and not just because these investors are already underwater on their ETH positions (which is why they haven’t sold). It seems to indicate that Ethereum is developing “Federal Reserve Notes” for DeFi, so to speak, and that these large institutional investors expect it to be an increasingly “accepted asset” to hang on to in the long term. World Liberty Financial spent $20M to buy 3,001 $ETH and 95 $WBTC ~2 hours ago. In the past 5 days, the fund invested $210.9M, including $119.95M on 35,995 $ETH at ~$3,332 and $66.84M on 629.1 $WBTC at ~$106,249. Currently, it holds 77,818 $ETH ($257M), including 19,403 staked… https://t.co/Yg5pS4gY5O pic.twitter.com/K4BkKmZgWm — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) January 25, 2025 Yet, even though Ethereum’s fundamentals are solid, volatility continues to be the defining characteristic of the asset, as seen in the price of Grayscale Ethereum Trust. After reaching a high of $25.04 in February 2024, the price of Grayscale Ethereum Trust fell to a low of $21.27 in August 2024, only to recover again. These movements in the price of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust serve to remind investors that the market is a very volatile one and that short-term assets can see large price changes that are not reflective of their long-term value. Mixed Investor Sentiment Reflected in ETF Net Flows The spot ETFs for Ethereum, which give investors a way to get at the cryptocurrency without holding it directly, have seen some decent inflows. On January 24, two days after we first talked to Bitwise, these ETFs had recorded a total net inflow of just over $9 million. By far, the largest and leading the pack, inflow-wise, is the Bitwise Ethereum ETF. On top of that, it seems like these inflows are being led by institutions—big players who might be accumulating Ethereum for the long haul. On January 24, the total net inflow of Ethereum spot ETFs was $9.1772 million. There was only one day of net outflow in the past 8 days. The Ethereum spot ETF with the largest net inflow yesterday was Bitwise ETF ETHW, with a net inflow of $6.0096 million. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg pic.twitter.com/DsUtQxQYtm — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 25, 2025 There are mixed signals, though, when it comes to net ETF flows. Large institutional players like BlackRock and Grayscale have seen significant outflows, while some other firms, like Fidelity and Franklin Templeton, have seen pretty consistent inflows. This divergence, I think, illustrates that different segments of the institutional market have different views on Ethereum’s future. Some are clearly concerned about volatility in the short term and have pulled back significantly. Others, though, continue to seem pretty committed and have invested in the asset. The withdrawal of 20,001.39 ETH from Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF on January 13, 2025, serves as a stark reminder of the market’s volatility. Large outflows like this one can signal a meaningful shift in investor sentiment, and they’re a good occasion to stop and think about not just what caused this large outflow, but also to consider the external factors and internal market dynamics that make the cryptocurrency market so prone to large, rapid changes in direction. A Strong Future, But Caution Is Key Although Ethereum has achieved exceptional results over the past couple of years and is now embraced in the DeFi space, it is still a very volatile investment. In our recent report on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, we discussed this volatility and the substantial movements in the ETF market that both highlight and contribute to the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. In this piece, we’ll delve deeper into the Ethereum Trust, what it means to be a holder of the trust, and how these factors correlate with the aforementioned volatility. Whales have bought over 1.14 million #Ethereum $ETH in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/7X1ibdE1IG — Ali (@ali_charts) January 24, 2025 Dominating the digital asset ecosystem, Ethereum has shown a clear trajectory of growth. The asset’s future appears bright, with more institutional investors adding Ethereum to their portfolios and Ethereum-based ETFs experiencing increasing inflows. Still, as Grayscale’s price fluctuations and the market’s short-term shifts show, it’s on all investors to manage risk and remain vigilant to changing market conditions when investing in the Ethereum asset. To sum up, although the price appreciation and ETF developments seem to suggest a bright future for Ethereum, investors must anticipate the volatility that accompanies this type of asset. As the network matures, both individual and institutional investors seem to be mounting a long-term bet on what is now the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Still, it’s a bet that looks riskier than ever—just a couple of weeks ago, the price fell nearly 30% in just 48 hours. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

With projects like Kaspa gaining momentum in scalability and Helium revolutionizing IoT, it’s clear that blockchain innovation isn’t slowing down anytime soon. These coins aren’t just about flashy updates—they’re laying the groundwork for real-world impact, solidifying their places in the rapidly evolving ecosystem. Amid these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves with its groundbreaking Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. As one of the best crypto ICOs to invest in today, Qubetics is closing in on the 19th stage of its presale, with a 10% price increase coming this Sunday. From tokenizing physical assets to offering seamless liquidity for businesses and investors, Qubetics is tackling the inefficiencies traditional systems couldn’t solve. It’s not just about catching up—it’s about redefining blockchain’s purpose. Transforming Blockchain with Qubetics’ Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is taking asset tokenization to an entirely new level. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it unites leading blockchains to create a seamless platform for tokenized assets. This game-changing application is designed for businesses and individuals looking to unlock new investment opportunities. Imagine a small business owner using the Qubetics marketplace to tokenize their real estate assets, enabling them to access a global pool of investors. Similarly, a budding artist could fractionalize ownership of their work, allowing fans worldwide to invest in their creativity. By offering a secondary market for tokenized assets, Qubetics facilitates hassle-free sales and exchanges. Its platform ensures smooth asset management, empowering investors with efficient liquidity and higher returns. Businesses can easily access funding, diversify investments, and create innovative products. Individuals, on the other hand, gain unprecedented access to previously exclusive opportunities. The Qubetics marketplace doesn’t just bridge gaps—it creates an ecosystem where tokenization thrives. TICSScan Revolutionizing Blockchain Exploration Adding more firepower to its offerings is TICSScan, Qubetics’ blockchain explorer. It’s built to provide unmatched transparency, real-time data, and intuitive insights into blockchain activity. Validators can assess performance metrics, businesses can track transactions, and developers can debug smart contracts—all through TICSScan’s sleek, user-friendly interface. From verifying blocks to monitoring transaction fees, TICSScan empowers the Qubetics community to make informed decisions, ensuring seamless interaction with the blockchain. Qubetics Presale Offering Unmatched ROI The Qubetics presale is creating waves, and for a good reason. Currently in its 18th stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0551, with over $10.6 million raised, 16,000 holders onboard, and 439 million tokens sold. What’s even more exciting? Each presale stage lasts just seven days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at midnight. This means the window to join the Qubetics presale at the current price closes soon. Analysts are forecasting explosive growth for $TICS. By the presale’s end, $TICS is expected to hit $0.25, translating into a jaw-dropping ROI of 353.39%. But that’s not all—after the presale, $TICS could reach $1, delivering a staggering 1713.57% ROI. With its mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, projections go as high as $10 to $15, boasting ROIs of 18,035.76% and 27,103.64%, respectively. For example, a $200 investment today would yield 3,627.15 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $10 after the mainnet launch, this investment could grow to $36,271.50, or $54,407.25 if it hits $15. The clock’s ticking on this opportunity, and missing out would mean passing on one of the best crypto ICOs to invest in today. Kaspa’s Growth Trajectory Holds Investor Attention Kaspa’s rise is making headlines, and the potential is hard to ignore. The coin operates on the GHOSTDAG protocol, a revolutionary approach that enhances blockchain speed and scalability without compromising decentralization. Recent reports highlight its growing adoption among whales, particularly through the emerging PlutoChain network. The focus is on its potential to achieve mainstream adoption, with price predictions indicating Kaspa could hit $1 by the end of 2025. Analysts attribute Kaspa’s upward trajectory to its growing use cases in decentralized finance and blockchain solutions. Unlike its peers, Kaspa offers near-instantaneous transaction speeds and high security, attracting businesses looking for robust blockchain infrastructure. Its compatibility with PlutoChain’s ecosystem further strengthens its position as a developer-friendly platform, making it a compelling choice for both investors and creators. With whales accumulating Kaspa tokens at unprecedented rates, the confidence in its growth potential is clear. This trust is backed by Kaspa’s impressive roadmap, which focuses on scaling its technology while maintaining its unique GHOSTDAG advantage. The future looks bright for Kaspa, solidifying its place among must-watch cryptocurrencies. Helium’s Push for IoT Dominance Helium (HNT) continues to redefine IoT connectivity through its decentralized wireless network. The platform’s innovative Proof-of-Coverage model incentivizes users to establish hotspots that power the network. This model has led to significant growth, with Helium now boasting a circulating supply of 176.96 million HNT and a market cap of $770.53 million. The past 24 hours have been promising for Helium, with a trading volume of $11.66 million—a 3.25% increase. Helium’s focus on IoT solutions positions it as a frontrunner in industries ranging from logistics to smart cities. With its forward-looking vision, the network has become a magnet for developers and enterprises aiming to capitalize on IoT growth. As Helium continues to scale, its potential for further adoption remains high. Its transparent approach and real-world use cases make it a valuable addition to any portfolio. Backed by its unique decentralized model, HNT offers a tangible connection between blockchain technology and everyday life. Conclusion Cryptocurrency investments demand careful evaluation, and Qubetics, Kaspa, and Helium showcase their unique strengths in today’s landscape. Qubetics leads as one of the best crypto ICOs to invest , offering unparalleled growth potential with its Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace and presale opportunities. Kaspa stands out for its innovative GHOSTDAG protocol, while Helium excels in bridging IoT and blockchain. Together, these projects highlight the vast possibilities in the crypto world, from tokenization and IoT to groundbreaking blockchain solutions.

39502496,https://nulltx.com/?p=141057,1737847103,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Aptos Sees Unprecedented Growth, But Bearish Signals Loom on the Horizon",https://nulltx.com/aptos-sees-unprecedented-growth-but-bearish-signals-loom-on-the-horizon/,"The Aptos ecosystem is witnessing a rapid embrace as fresh users come to the platform and activity reaches unprecedented heights. Just this week, Aptos welcomed 2.1 million new users, bringing its total user base to a staggering 47 million. The platform’s steep rise in popularity is mirrored in the almost laughable surge in weekly active wallets, which hit 5.7 million, up from 3 million just a month ago. The pace of transactions has also been remarkable, with more than 39 million transactions processed in just the last week. This surge in activity shows that many people are interested in the Aptos blockchain and what it has to offer. Given its beginnings with engineers who previously worked at Facebook, the Aptos project has surprised many in the cryptocurrency community with the speed at which it has cultivated a user base. In recent months, that community has moved a substantial amount of money through a growing number of decentralized applications running on the blockchain. The network’s participation in the ecosystem is happening at lightning speed compared to many other blockchain projects. Aptos Price Action and Technical Outlook Even though the user base and activity levels are showing a positive growth trend, Aptos’ native token, $APT, may have a challenging technical outlook. The price of $APT appears to be in the process of carving out a head-and-shoulders top, a bearish technical formation that indicates more downside could be on the way. If this formation plays out as expected, the price of $APT could drop to about $4.30. The head-and-shoulders pattern is a widely recognized technical indicator that frequently denotes a trend reversal, especially when it occurs after a sustained upward price movement. In the instance of $APT, the token’s price has not been able to sustain upward momentum above vital levels, and the head-and-shoulders formation indicates that if market sentiment turns bearish, further price declines could be imminent. Nevertheless, investors in Aptos do have a silver lining to look forward to. To refute this bearish outlook, Aptos (APT) needs to prove it can sustain a close above the $10.50 mark. That threshold amounts to a resistance point, and if Aptos can stay above that in the next few trading sessions, it would send up a signal, or a sign of strength really, that the head-and-shoulders pattern has been invalidated, and that the next probable move is a continuation of an upward trend. 𝙒𝙏𝙁 𝙙𝙞𝙙 𝙄 𝙢𝙞𝙨𝙨 𝙤𝙣 𝘼𝙥𝙩𝙤𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙬𝙚𝙚𝙠?! For starters, 2.1M new users joined the ecosystem this week—pushing all-time users over 47M+ 🪽Weekly active wallets soared to an ATH of 5.7M A staggering 39M+ transactions were processed More in your Aptos… — Aptos (@Aptos) January 25, 2025 The Growing Popularity of Aptos Although APT’s technical chart might raise some eyebrows, the underlying growth of the Aptos network is nothing short of impressive. Its addition of 2.1 million new users in just one week is a clear testament to the platform’s appeal. We can hardly call it a “fledgling project” with numbers like these. It puts speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness front and center, serving decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. The number of active wallets each week is up to 5.7 million, and this reflects a substantial and growing commitment from users. It’s not just that the network is attracting new users; it’s also attracting a kind of new user that’s very important to the long-term prospects of any platform: users who stick around and stay engaged. And stay engaged they do, as evidenced by the number of transactions. We’re now seeing upwards of 39 million+ transactions each week. Users interact with dApps, make transactions, and otherwise occupy the space that is the broader blockchain ecosystem. Aptos is also making strides in attracting developers, and its ecosystem is expanding rapidly with the appearance of more projects on the platform. Those projects are often decentralized finance (DeFi) initiatives looking to scale. They are choosing Aptos because of its high throughput, low transaction costs, and stable infrastructure. In comparison with other protocols, Aptos has a generally favorable fee structure, and it has become a go-to developer choice in the DeFi space. A Mixed Picture for Investors The expansion of Aptos’ user base and the development of network activity are undoubtedly impressive. But what about the price of $APT? A bearish technical picture is emerging there, and on the surface, it looks like this is presenting a pretty mixed bag for investors. If you believe technical signals are worth anything, the appearance of a head-and-shoulders pattern comes off like a strong sell signal. That’s signaling a potential price decline. And a price decline is usually associated with a potential increase in network activity. But what if network activity is increasing? #Aptos $APT appears to be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern, with a potential downside target of $4.30. A sustained close above $10.50 is needed to invalidate the bearish outlook. pic.twitter.com/4rHCGcOxyy — Ali (@ali_charts) January 25, 2025 When contemplating the future of Aptos, investors would do well to keep a close watch on some pivotal price points—most notably the $10.50 mark. Any sort of prolonged rally above that level would seem to suggest strength in what is otherwise a still very young and unproven asset. On the flip side, if Aptos were to drop and head back toward the $4.30 area, it might raise some eyebrows and give off the appearance of a potential bath that this asset is taking. To be fair, Aptos is a blockchain network; however, like any network, its value is contingent not only on what people are willing to pay for its native asset (in this case, APT) but also on its ability to attract users and developers. To conclude, Aptos continues to impress with its growth and adoption, but its technical outlook for $APT remains unclear. Investors should keep a close watch on price actions over the next few weeks to see if the head-and-shoulders pattern comes to fruition or if $APT can push through resistance levels and keep the upward trend going. With its burgeoning ecosystem and strong user base, Aptos is a project to keep on your radar in the next few months. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Panshibi (SHIBI) has drawn attention as one of the few meme coins making quick developments on the blockchain. With projections of a 1,200% price surge, analysts believe Panshibi could soon compete with Polkadot or Solana prices. In this overview, we'll explore why you should capitalize on this investment opportunity! Panshibi Introduces a New Theme of Meme Coins Panshibi is setting a new standard for meme coins by capturing the excitement and imagination of the real world. Inspired by the charm of pandas, Panshibi brings more than just a theme—it represents a comfortable blend of creativity and innovation. As a relatable project, Panshibi is already being hailed as the next big thing. Moreover, the Panda-themed coin has the potential of mammoth profits right from its ongoing presale. Over 15 stages, Panshibi’s price is expected to shoot up by 1,200%, with predictions of even greater growth upon listing. This combination of strategic pricing and calculated scarcity is driving interest from all corners of the crypto market. With its smart contract being fully audited, liquidity will remain locked for ten years and the ownership of the token will be renounced after the presale. These measures not only protect investors but also ensure that the project remains decentralized and community-driven. As SHIBI prepares for its debut on major exchanges, its combination of community appeal and sound strategy is paving the way for significant success. Panshibi functions on a MemeFi model that allows it to operate outside of market hype. Its platform stands out from the rest in the often volatile meme coin space. Solana Price Could Reach New Heights Shortly after assuming office, the Trump administration launched a new crypto task force aimed at establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. Additionally, President Donald Trump introduced two Solana meme coins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Over the week, coins on the Solana network have registered double-figured price increases. SOLitself reached a 38% price increase in the same period, with a $300 valuation in sight. As a result, its TVL rose to a $12.1 billion all-time high. However, traders are cautious of Solana’s 10.4% volatility and 11.8% supply inflation. While the short-term looks promising, price analysts like CoinCodex predict a Solana price decline after the first quarter of 2025. Polkadot Community Raise Alarm as Project Burns Through Millions Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading above $6.5 , reflecting a 0.08% decrease from the previous week. Once a top 10 crypto, DOT has been on a steady decline, with newer projects and initiatives taking its former positions. Recently, Polkadot has proposed RFC-0092 to reduce its unstaking period from 28 days to just 2 days. However, the project has faced scrutiny after revealing $37 million in marketing expenses, prompting discussions within the community regarding budget allocations. Despite partnering with Inter Miami FC to support educators at the Pride Academy, the DOTeconomy is tilting towards a bearish sentiment. With its supply inflation above 55%, it is unlikely for DOT to make headway soon. Conclusion Unlike Polkadot's struggles and Solana's volatility, Panshibi combines decentralized governance, transparency, and scalability to establish itself as a serious contender. With its tokens selling for $0.002 apiece, SHIBI is poised to perform well ahead of a strong market debut.

Panshibi (SHIBI) has emerged as a standout among meme coins, advancing rapidly on the blockchain. With expectations of a 1,200% increase in value, experts suggest that Panshibi could soon rival the price of Polkadot or Solana. In this discussion, we'll delve into why this could be a lucrative investment opportunity! Panshibi Unveils a Fresh Theme in Meme Coins Panshibi is redefining meme coins by tapping into the excitement and creativity of the real world. Drawing inspiration from pandas, Panshibi offers more than a theme—it embodies a harmonious mix of creativity and innovation. As a relatable initiative, Panshibi is already being praised as the next significant development. Furthermore, the Panda-themed coin promises substantial returns right from its ongoing presale. Over 15 stages, Panshibi’s price is projected to spike by 1,200%, with potential for even greater growth once listed. This strategic pricing combined with calculated scarcity is attracting interest from across the crypto landscape. With a fully audited smart contract, liquidity will be locked for a decade, and token ownership will be relinquished post-presale. These steps not only secure investor interests but also ensure the project remains decentralized and community-focused. As SHIBI gears up for its launch on major exchanges, its mix of community engagement and strategic planning sets the stage for notable success. Panshibi operates under a MemeFi model, allowing it to function independently of market hype. Its platform distinguishes itself in the often unpredictable meme coin market. Solana Price Poised for New Peaks Soon after taking office, the Trump administration introduced a new crypto task force aimed at creating a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. Additionally, President Donald Trump launched two Solana meme coins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Throughout the week, coins on the Solana network have seen double-digit price gains. SOL itself achieved a 38% price increase over the same timeframe, with a $300 valuation on the horizon. Consequently, its TVL reached a record high of $12.1 billion. Nevertheless, traders remain wary of Solana’s 10.4% volatility and 11.8% supply inflation. Although the short-term outlook is positive, analysts like CoinCodex forecast a Solana price drop after the first quarter of 2025. Polkadot Community Raises Concerns Over Project's Spending Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading above $6.5 , marking a 0.08% dip from the previous week. Once a top 10 cryptocurrency, DOT has been on a downward trend, with newer projects and initiatives taking its former positions. Recently, Polkadot has suggested RFC-0092 to shorten its unstaking period from 28 days to just 2 days. However, the project has come under scrutiny after disclosing $37 million in marketing costs, sparking discussions within the community about budget management. Despite collaborating with Inter Miami FC to support educators at the Pride Academy, the DOT economy is leaning towards a bearish outlook. With supply inflation exceeding 55%, it's unlikely that DOT will gain momentum soon.

The prominent altcoin currently trades around $3,290 as investors await the crypto bull run’s return to form. On the other hand, rising institutional adoption provides a positive development for the Ethereum community. Related Reading: Justin Sun’s Grand Strategy For Ethereum Price: $10,000 Target BlackRock’s ETHA Lead Spot ETF Market With 1.2 Million ETH According to a recent X post by Burak Kesmeci, Ethereum is currently experiencing a surge in institutional adoption as evidenced by developments in the Spot ETF Market. Kesmeci highlights that BlackRock’s ETHA accounts for the majority of this demand with net assets of 1.2009 ETH valued at over $3.19 billion. According to data from SoSoValue, this record is largely unsurprising as ETHA has experienced the highest net cumulative inflows of $3.97 billion in the Ethereum Spot ETF market. Fidelity’s FETH occupies second place with 432,750 ETH valued at around $1.46 billion. Bitwise’s ETHW and VanEck’s ETHV follow with holdings of 105,974 ETH and 45,766 ETH, respectively. Meanwhile, all other Ethereum Spot ETFs except the Grayscale ETHE have accumulated at least 7,000 ETH since their launch in July 2024. A rise in institutional demand of Ethereum as Indicated by the data above indicates strong confidence in the asset’s long-term profitability. While Ethereum Spot ETFs may not replicate the performance of Bitcoin counterparts, the institutional demand these funds command could enhance ETH market stability and liquidity, paving the way for broader regulatory acceptance and mainstream adoption. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates But Open Interest Points to Potential Breakout Short Transactions Dominate Ethereum Market In other news, bearish sentiments currently prove dominant in the ETH market as dominated by a higher proportion of short-term transactions to long transactions. According to Kesmeci, short orders represent 57% of all Ethereum futures trades indicating that the majority of traders are betting the altcoin to experience a further price decline. This negative development is particularly observed on the Bitmex and Bitfinex exchanges. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,297 after 0.17% loss in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume has dipped by 24.24% and is now valued at $25.36 billion. Based on its daily trading chart, Ethereum appears to be consolidating despite recent losses. With any price rally, the altcoin could reach around $3,700, moving past which would spur a return to around $4,000. On the other hand, another fall in Ethereum’s price could result in a slump to around $3,100, which lies its next significant support level. With a market cap of $396.85 billion, ETH retains its position as the largest altcoin and second-largest cryptocurrency in the world.

Meme coins are more than just digital assets; they’re a community-driven movement, sparking massive enthusiasm and skyrocketing ROI for savvy investors. As the market continues to evolve, new meme coins are rising to the occasion, and among them, Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Popcat are making waves. These tokens promise not just thrilling gains but an adventurous ride for anyone looking to dive into the meme coin scene. But how do you separate the hype from the true winners? That’s where Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Popcat stand out. These meme coins aren’t just another flash in the pan—they’re backed by unique narratives, community engagement, and thrilling presale stages that make them the best new meme coins to invest in for short term profits. Let’s dive deeper into why these three meme coins are grabbing the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers to the crypto game. Arctic Pablo is leading the charge with its adventurous narrative and insane ROI potential. If you haven’t heard about it yet, you’re missing out on a journey unlike any other. Arctic Pablo: The Journey of a Lifetime Arctic Pablo is no ordinary meme coin. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about adventure. In an icy realm where myth and reality collide, Arctic Pablo embarks on a thrilling exploration, discovering hidden treasures with each step. Imagine a coin that doesn’t just grow in value but takes you on a journey to uncharted lands. The narrative of Arctic Pablo is as unique as it gets, and the best part? It’s built to deliver impressive ROI for those who jump in early. What sets Arctic Pablo apart is its presale model. Instead of sticking to a boring old stage system, Arctic Pablo’s presale is divided by locations, each representing a new chapter in Pablo’s exploration. From Metropolis to Snowy Shores, each location unlocks new tokens and opportunities for early investors. Right now, Arctic Pablo is at Stage 6, and over $430,000 has already been raised. But there’s a catch—each location comes with its own limited supply and burn mechanism, which only makes the coin more valuable. Why should you care about Arctic Pablo? Here’s the exciting part: if you join the presale now, you can get in at the current price of just $0.000038 per $APC. As the presale progresses, the price will gradually rise, and by the final presale stage, it’ll hit $0.0008. But the real magic happens when Arctic Pablo launches. At a launch price of $0.008, you could see a jaw-dropping ROI of over 20,000% from Stage 6 to launch price. This isn’t just a coin; it’s an adventure. So, if you’re looking for a meme coin with serious growth potential, Arctic Pablo is the best new meme coin to invest in for short term. And don’t forget about the staking opportunities—Arctic Pablo offers a staggering 66% APY, allowing you to grow your investment while embarking on this thrilling journey. Moo Deng: A Playful Coin with Serious Potential Moo Deng may not have the same adventurous narrative as Arctic Pablo, but don’t let that fool you—this meme coin is one to watch. Moo Deng’s charm lies in its community and the promise of a truly decentralized ecosystem. With a strong community-driven vision, Moo Deng has built a loyal following that’s eager to see the coin soar. As a meme coin with a unique twist, Moo Deng offers something different from the typical Doge and Shiba Inu clones. Moo Deng is more than just a fun name. With its deflationary tokenomics, it’s built to appreciate over time. And the more you hold, the more you stand to gain as the circulating supply decreases. Moo Deng has already proven its worth in its early stages, and the community’s enthusiasm is palpable. What makes this coin particularly attractive for short-term investment is the fact that it has an active roadmap with clear milestones ahead. As the project grows, Moo Deng plans to integrate more utility and features, including partnerships that could drive its price even higher. Popcat: A Meme Coin with Legendary Appeal Popcat needs no introduction—it’s a meme coin with a cult following that’s been a hit online for a while. As one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term, Popcat is riding a wave of popularity, thanks to its simple yet incredibly effective meme status. It’s funny, it’s viral, and it’s packed with potential. But Popcat isn’t just a meme—it’s a project that understands the value of community. The Popcat community is one of the most active in the meme coin space, and that’s one of the reasons why its value has skyrocketed in the past year. Like most meme coins, the key to Popcat’s success lies in its ability to capture the attention of internet culture and capitalize on the viral nature of memes. Conclusion: Jump on the Meme Coin Train Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin space is looking more promising than ever. Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Popcat each offer something unique for investors looking for short-term gains. However, if you want to be part of an epic journey with huge ROI potential, Arctic Pablo is the one to watch. With its adventurous narrative, presale opportunities, and insane 30,692% ROI potential, Arctic Pablo is undoubtedly the best new meme coin to invest in for short term profits. Don’t miss out—join the Arctic Pablo presale today and be part of a journey that could change your financial future. The clock is ticking, and each location brings new opportunities.

Web3Bay (3BAY) distinguishes itself with a novel e-commerce and decentralized governance model, marking it as a prudent selection in 2025. With an impressive $890,000 amassed in its presale and an anticipated 6,430% return on investment, Web3Bay transcends mere conjecture by providing both utility and expandability in a market poised for innovation. Ripple (XRP) on the Verge of $4 After Market Uptick Ripple (XRP) is nearing a $4 valuation after climbing past $3, a spike driven by fresh market enthusiasm following the latest presidential inauguration. Expert Ali Martinez notes that XRP’s ascension from a bullish flag pattern may push it toward $4.40 soon. Over the last week, XRP rose by 23.4% and 40.4% over the month, with technical indicators like a high relative strength index (RSI) hinting at sustained upward momentum. With significant buying from large-scale holders, a $4 target is becoming more feasible. Chainlink (LINK) Poised for Growth, Eyes $30.81 Mark Chainlink (LINK) exhibits strong upward trends, depicted in a progressing five-wave Elliott Wave pattern on daily and hourly charts. The RSI suggests there’s room for growth before hitting overbought levels, aiming to surpass the $30.81 high. The current third wave on the hourly chart follows a modest second-wave drop to $22.17, with goals set near $30.81. Stability above $22.74 is critical, however, as falling below this could prompt corrections, crucial for traders to watch. Web3Bay: A Prudent Choice for Tangible Utility and ROI The 3BAY token serves as the core of Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce framework, promising investors real advantages and substantial growth potential. At a current price of $0.004562625 in its fourth presale phase, the token is anticipated to debut at $0.1959—offering an impressive 6,430% ROI to early participants. In contrast, Ripple’s XRP is still trying to reach its previous highs, and Chainlink’s LINK largely depends on the DeFi sector’s performance. With its broad appeal and emphasis on viable solutions, Web3Bay stands out as an excellent investment choice. For instance, a $1,000 investment in 3BAY during the presale could potentially transform into over $42,900 at launch. This remarkable growth potential is not merely theoretical; it is underpinned by Web3Bay’s utility-oriented approach. As the platform gains users, the demand for 3BAY tokens is expected to surge, progressively boosting their value. Web3Bay: Built to Last in a Competitive Crypto Market Web3Bay’s allure extends beyond immediate financial returns. Its strategic roadmap is tailored for scalability and active user participation, aiming to maintain its pertinence over time. Essential developments include: NFT Marketplace : An arena for artists and collectors to effortlessly exchange digital items. Decentralized Governance : Allows token holders to shape the platform’s direction, fostering a community-led environment. Hybrid Payment System : Supports both crypto and conventional payments such as PayPal, broadening its accessibility worldwide. Layer-2 Scaling : Guarantees rapid and cost-effective transactions, even under heavy demand, ensuring a seamless user experience. These initiatives position Web3Bay as more than a mere cryptocurrency; it is an extensive platform tackling the inefficiencies plaguing the $5 trillion e-commerce sector. Unlike Chainlink’s focused application or Ripple’s exposure to regulatory hurdles, Web3Bay is crafting a functional solution for worldwide commerce. How Smart Investors Capitalize on Web3Bay Opportunities Smart investors recognize the significant advantages of utility tokens associated with platforms that address actual market needs. Ethereum and Binance Coin, initially viewed as speculative bets, have ultimately validated their substantial market value. In a similar vein, Web3Bay is currently navigating the initial phase of what promises to be a groundbreaking evolution. To illustrate: Web3Bay has successfully amassed over $890,000 in its presale so far, with the token price escalating at each phase. This tiered pricing model incentivizes early investors, encouraging swift action to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Participants from the early rounds of the presale are now enjoying considerable gains, with the token’s projected launch price of $0.1959 hinting at even more lucrative prospects ahead. Unlike Chainlink and Ripple, which have established themselves in specific areas like blockchain oracles and international payments, Web3Bay is introducing a fundamentally novel concept—a decentralized platform for e-commerce poised for exponential growth. The successful presale, a model grounded in utility, and a vision for long-term growth position Web3Bay as a smart investment choice for 2025 .

It stands out with its innovative architecture and a clear mission to revolutionize decentralized systems. BlockDAG is swiftly becoming a hot topic in the cryptocurrency discussions. Let’s examine the key selling points and breakthrough technology that make BlockDAG a focal point for both developers and buyers. Introducing BlockDAG BlockDAG is at the forefront of blockchain evolution, tackling the inherent limitations of traditional blockchain architectures. Rather than sticking to the linear block processing of older blockchains, BlockDAG employs Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology to process multiple blocks simultaneously. This method not only boosts transaction speed but also enhances scalability. The moniker “BlockDAG” captures this blend of blockchain resilience and DAG efficiency, forming a robust platform suited for high-volume applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and supply chain management. The Core Technology Powering BlockDAG The innovation at the core of BlockDAG is its capability to process several blocks in parallel, a significant shift from the traditional sequential blockchain operations. This linear method can lead to congestion as the network expands, slowing down transactions and inflating fees. BlockDAG revolutionizes this setup by allowing multiple blocks to exist and validate transactions together, which speeds up processing times and greatly expands network capacity. Whether it’s handling numerous small transactions or complex decentralized apps (dApps), BlockDAG offers a performance that traditional blockchains can hardly match. Furthermore, BlockDAG supports both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), enabling developers to utilize familiar tools for development, testing, and deployment, thus lowering the barriers to innovation and diversifying the ecosystem. Why BlockDAG Stands Out Unparalleled Speed & Scalability Thanks to its ability to handle multiple blocks concurrently, BlockDAG ensures swift and efficient network functionality, even under strain. This scalability makes it a robust choice for large-scale applications, future-proofing it in a rapidly advancing industry. Enhanced Security The unique structure of BlockDAG also augments its security. The interconnected DAG framework increases resilience against certain attacks, where altering any transaction demands substantial computational resources, thus ensuring the integrity of the network. Seamless Interoperability BlockDAG’s support for EVM and WASM facilitates an easier transition for developers looking to migrate existing projects or kick-start new ones. This adaptability is crucial in attracting a diverse developer base to the platform. A Developer-Centric Ecosystem BlockDAG is not just focused on technology; it aims to cultivate a thriving community of innovators. Partnering with HackerEarth, a global developer network, BlockDAG is committed to encouraging innovation through upcoming hackathons designed to stimulate over 200 Web3 projects, demonstrating its capacity as a developer-friendly ecosystem. A Record-Breaking Presale BlockDAG’s presale is turning heads, raising a whopping $184.5 million so far. Currently in its 27th batch, BDAG coins are priced at $0.0248, offering an attractive opportunity for anyone looking to buy early. Early adopters are already reaping rewards. Those who joined in the first batch have seen their holdings grow by 2380%. And there’s more to come—analysts predict BDAG could hit $1 by 2025. For those jumping in now, that means a potential 3932% return. What makes BlockDAG stand out is its practical potential. The platform’s speed and scalability make it a perfect fit for industries like finance and logistics. Think of a supply chain where transactions are processed instantly, or a DeFi platform that effortlessly handles millions of users without delays. This practicality is why developers and businesses are gravitating toward BlockDAG. By solving key blockchain issues like slow speeds, high costs, and scalability limits, it’s emerging as a solution not just for today’s problems, but for the innovations of tomorrow. The Ideal Time to Buy With the presale price at $0.0248, now is an exceptional time to buy. The mainnet launch is set for early 2025, and as the launch approaches, the opportunity to purchase at this level will diminish. As BlockDAG continues to attract more developers and expand its ecosystem, the demand for BDAG coins is likely to surge, potentially increasing their market value.

These factors appear to be shifting the market sentiment that DOGE has been witnessing. Elon Musk and Blockchain Technology Recently, Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of SpaceX and Tesla, revealed that he is exploring blockchain technology to make the DOGE department more efficient and to track government performance. Musk’s thoughts have gained significant attention from crypto experts and analysts. Looking at this, Cardano blockchain founder Charles Hoskinson posted on X (formerly Twitter) and stressed, “I’m thinking this is a job for a triumvirate of Cardano, Bitcoin, and Midnight. Yo, Dogemaster Elon Musk, give us a call. We’ll do it for free.” Well, I'm thinking this is a job for a triumvirate of Cardano, Bitcoin, and Midnight. Yo, dogemaster @elonmusk , give us a call.

Current Price Momentum Despite these positive developments, DOGE is currently trading near $0.354 and has witnessed a price surge of 1.35% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bullish, as it is currently at a crucial support level provided by the trendline and is also poised for an inclined trendline breakout on the four-hour time frame. Since December 2024, DOGE has taken support from this trendline four times, and each time, it has witnessed impressive upside momentum. Source: Trading View Looking at the historical price momentum, experts are expecting a similar kind of upside momentum. Based on the recent price action, if DOGE breaches the trendline and closes a four-hour candle above the $0.365 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 20% to reach the $0.43 level in the future.",News|Crypto news|Meme Coins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-26 00:30:11

Now, picture missing the boat because you hesitated when the market offered dips. In the volatile yet thrilling world of cryptocurrency, timing isn’t just everything—it’s your golden ticket. While Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Brett (BRETT) have solidified their spots among meme coin enthusiasts, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is grabbing attention with its amazing presale performance and innovative Bulls Squad. The 14th stage of BTFD’s presale has already raised over $5.6 million, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing. So, what makes BTFD Coin the must-watch contender for 2025? Here’s the deal: the BTFD presale has thrown a 100% bonus offer into the mix—a tantalizing reward for investors who act now. With the LAUNCH100 bonus code, buyers can double their coins. Intrigued yet? Let’s dive deeper into how BTFD is shaping up to be the best new meme coin to join for the long term. BTFD Coin: More Than a Meme, It’s a Movement At the heart of BTFD Coin lies a rallying cry: “ Buy The Dip .” This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a call to action for savvy investors who understand the value of seizing opportunities hidden in market chaos. Built on Ethereum for enhanced security and scalability, BTFD isn’t merely a token—it’s a thriving ecosystem powered by a dedicated community and a bold vision. With over 9,500 coin holders and 67 billion coins sold, BTFD is on track to become a game-changer in the meme coin space. The Bulls Squad: Meet the Guardians of the Dip At the heart of BTFD is the Bulls Squad, a dynamic team of mascots that encapsulates the project’s spirit of resilience and community. Baby Bull : The visionary face of BTFD, Baby Bull represents the optimism of buying the dip and inspires the community to hold strong. Raging Bull : This creative powerhouse ensures BTFD’s visuals and branding stay bold and exciting. Nerdy Bull : The brains behind the operation, Nerdy Bull guarantees that BTFD’s infrastructure runs smoothly. Peoples Bull : As the community’s voice, Peoples Bull keeps everyone engaged and informed, fostering a sense of belonging among investors. Together, the Bulls Squad fuels the BTFD movement, creating a robust community that thrives on market downturns and positions itself for massive gains during bull cycles. Staking and P2E Game: More Reasons to Join BTFD doesn’t stop at just meme coin hype—it brings real utility to the table. Its staking program offers an impressive 90% APY, letting investors earn substantial passive income. Plus, the full version of its P2E game is now live, allowing players to earn rewards while enjoying an immersive gaming experience. And let’s not forget the referral program: top referrers can earn 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens . With these features, BTFD is setting a new standard for meme coins, offering multiple ways for investors to profit while being part of a thriving community. Pepe Coin: A Meme Coin OG Pepe Coin has been a household name among crypto enthusiasts, celebrated for its nostalgic appeal and strong community backing. While it’s not currently offering any presale bonuses or new features, its longevity in the market showcases its resilience. Pepe Coin thrives as a reminder of how memes and community-driven projects can hold their ground in the volatile crypto world. With a massive following and its position as a cultural phenomenon, Pepe continues to serve as a reliable investment for those seeking to diversify their portfolios. However, with no ongoing incentives comparable to BTFD’s presale, it’s clear which project offers more excitement for new investors. Brett: The New Kid on the Block Brett is another meme coin gaining traction, known for its irreverent humor and unique branding. While still relatively new, Brett has carved out a niche among younger crypto enthusiasts who appreciate its playful approach. With no P2E games or staking programs currently available, Brett’s primary appeal lies in its potential to grow as a cultural icon. Despite its limitations, Brett’s ability to rally a loyal fanbase has ensured its spot in the meme coin conversation. Yet, when compared to BTFD’s robust ecosystem, Brett feels more like a side hustle than a main event. A Few Reasons Why BTFD Stands Out What sets BTFD Coin apart is its ability to combine innovation with community. With features like the Bulls Squad, the 100% bonus offer, and real utility through its P2E game and staking rewards, BTFD offers a comprehensive package for investors. The presale’s strategic structure—with escalating prices and token burns—ensures scarcity and value growth for early adopters. Investors who understand the importance of buying the dip will find BTFD’s presale an irresistible opportunity. With over $5.6 million raised and a price trajectory aiming for $0.0006 post-presale, now is the time to act. Don’t Miss Out on the 100% Bonus With the presale currently in Stage 14 , BTFD is offering a limited-time 100% bonus for investors who use the LAUNCH100 code. Here’s how it works: Visit the BTFD Presale . Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Enter the bonus code “LAUNCH100” in all caps. Input your desired investment amount and confirm the transaction. Every $4500 invested at $0.00016 per BTFD coin results in 28,125,000 tokens, which doubles to 56,250,000 tokens with the bonus code. At the end of the presale, when BTFD hits $0.0006, this investment could skyrocket to $33,750 in value—a stunning 650% ROI. Conclusion: Seize the Moment with BTFD Coin Meme coins are no longer just about laughs; they’re serious business. While Pepe Coin and Brett offer nostalgic and fun alternatives, BTFD Coin is the best new meme coin to join for long term growth. With its thriving community, innovative features, and irresistible presale incentives, BTFD is setting the stage for massive returns. The choice is yours: Watch from the sidelines or join the Bulls Squad today. With the LAUNCH100 bonus code doubling your investment, this is your chance to turn every dip into a golden opportunity. Don’t miss out— head to the BTFD presale now and ride the wave to the next bull run!

The post, co-authored by executives at the crypto-focused VC firm, has once again shed light on the current issues surrounding Ethereum’s leadership and future. The post was co-authored by Paradigm’s CTO Georgios Konstantopoulos, the firm’s co-founder Matt Huang, and its general partners Dan Robinson and Charlie Noyes. In the post, the authors highlighted Ethereum’s prowess as a driving force in the crypto sector, highlighting several aspects including smart contracts, decentralized finance, and decentralized autonomous organizations, among others that have been developed in the ecosystem. The post highlighted the great work that community developers and engineers have done, building a strong foundation for decentralized applications in the future. Paradigm calls for accelerated development on Ethereum The paradigm executives highlighted that the first version of the Ethereum protocol was launched about two years ago, the first project that drew the attention of Paradigm and the entire crypto industry. However, the ecosystem’s core protocol should be improving at a faster pace. The post highlights that Ethereum can make some integral improvements that will help it reach this goal without sacrificing its values. ETHEREUM ACCELERATION . With @matthuang , @danrobinson & @_charlienoyes . pic.twitter.com/5TJq3G7HhX — Georgios Konstantopoulos (@gakonst) January 25, 2025 According to the post, the executives are calling on Ethereum to increase its development pace, shipping more than a major update every year. The authors argue against the notion that the best way to protect the decentralization of Ethereum is to slow down the development of the core protocol. “The core development process is one of the main mechanisms for off-chain governance by Ethereum’s social layer, and reflects input from engineers, researchers, validators, and institutions,” the post states. “Ossifying the core protocol would mean abandoning that governance mechanism and Ethereum’s ability to evolve in response to changes in the market structures of areas like L2s and MEV,” the authors added. The authors highlight areas of improvement Paradigm executives highlighted several areas that Ethereum needs to make improvements. According to the authors, there are some improvements that the network can ship quickly instead of holding it off and fitting it in one big annual upgrade. The post mentioned that these improvements are non-controversial but are not done under the perception that only a few changes can be made annually. It mentioned that instead of trying to limit ambitions, Ethereum should do more faster. According to the post, changes like repricing L1’s opcodes to scale Ethereum without making changes to the gas limit. Other changes the authors suggested include improving the UX of batched transactions through further development of the account abstraction framework and developing rollups to meet the increasing demand. The post also shed light on Paradigm’s work on the Reth Ethereum client, which it says holds about 2% of Ethereum’s execution clients. According to Client Diversity, the leading client, Geth, currently holds a 43% market share, with Nethermind coming in second place, claiming around 36% of the market. “We built Reth intentionally as an SDK for building “EVM-core” nodes to enable experimentation and innovation by researchers and engineers,” the post states. “We invite the research community to collaborate with us in prototyping new features towards improving Ethereum’s performance, censorship resistance, and future-proofing, with Reth,” the post reads. The authors finalized the post by mentioning that shipping faster is the only important thing that Ethereum can do to expand what it can do, noting that it will help the protocol deliver the visions in its roadmap. The post highlighted that if it is achieved, then it will pave the way for a global and trust-minimized financial system.

The trader Ali Martinez tells his 118,700 followers on the social media platform X that the RWA project Ondo Finance ( ONDO ) “appears to be breaking out of a bull flag.” A bull flag is typically viewed as a bullish pattern, suggesting that an asset is consolidating before kicking off on a new rally.

At the time of writing, XRP is the third-largest crypto by market cap, and current buying trends suggest it might stay there for a while. As of January 25, 2025, the altcoin has a total supply of 100 billion tokens, with approximately 57.64 billion currently in circulation. Notably, a significant portion of this circulating supply is concentrated among a small number of wallets. Specifically, the top 10 addresses hold about 20.99% of the circulating supply, while the top 50 addresses control approximately 53.3%, which raises the question about the distribution of wealth in the ecosystem and who stands to benefit the most from the price rally. Top 20 Wallets And Their Dominance Over XRP Supply The largest XRP holdings are primarily associated with Ripple Labs, its founders, and major cryptocurrency exchanges. In terms of numbers, data from Coincarp shows that out of the 4,840,747 addresses, the top 20 holders, the top 50 holders, and the top 100 holders hold 50.31%, 63.74%, and 71.76% of the circulating supply, respectively. Related Reading: XRP Price Rallies To ATH At $3.4, Here’s What’s Driving It And Why The Pump Will Continue According to distribution data, Ripple Labs currently owns around 46 billion XRP tokens, although most are locked in escrow. These tokens are released periodically in pre-set amounts, limiting Ripple’s ability to freely access or manipulate the escrowed funds. Even with these restrictions, Ripple Labs holds a considerable amount of liquid XRP. Data from blockchain explorer Bithomp indicates that one of Ripple’s wallet addresses alone contains over 1.3 billion XRP. Also, Ripple Labs co-founder Chris Larsen is the largest individual holder of XRP, holding over 5 billion tokens, making him one of the wealthiest individuals in the ecosystem. Major exchanges like Binance and Uphold also manage significant reserves. For instance, one of Binance’s wallets holds over 1.3 billion XRP, accounting for approximately 1.33% of the circulating supply. South Korean-based crypto exchange Upbit also holds about 4.38% of the total supply, among a few other exchanges. Holding Distribution: Anything To Fear? These large-scale holdings by exchanges and Ripple-related entities paint a picture of an XRP ecosystem dominated by a relatively small group of stakeholders. However, when you think about it, these large holdings are not in the hands of any private company or individual that would potentially be at risk of manipulating the price for their benefit. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Bullish Flag Breakout That Could Put 50% Gains On The Board Furthermore, the bulk held by exchanges represents aggregated assets belonging to thousands, if not millions, of individual users. As such, their concentration in exchanges does not pose any unnatural risk to the natural price dynamics for XRP. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.10, having recently reached a seven-year high of $3.38.

Key market indicators suggest SOL could witness further downsizing as Ethereum’s makes a gradual resurgence after Vitalik Buterin announced the team’s intent to stop selling ETH. With SOL recently struggling to hold momentum as selling pressure builds, Ethereum (ETH) stabilizes above the $3,100-$3,300 support zone. This contrasting price action highlights the growing divergence between the two major Layer-1 competitors, as Ethereum’s looks poised to regain market dominance. Solana Price Weakens as Ethereum Stabilizes Solana (SOL) continues to show bearish price action as Ethereum’s (ETH) stability amid volatile market trends suggests traders are selectively navigating the markets. Analyzing the Ethereum price forecast chart , ETH price is consolidating above a key support zone between $3,050 and $3,208. This support is reinforced by the 200-day Moving Average (MA), a critical technical indicator for gauging long-term trends. Solana Price Technical Analysis vs. Ethereum (ETH) According to the TradingView chart above, ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near 47.57, signaling neutral momentum and potential for accumulation. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram shows mild bearish divergence but suggests weakening downside pressure, as recent bars narrow toward the zero line. These factors point to ETH price stabilizing, creating a subdued environment for correlated altcoins like Solana. SOL, by contrast, lacks strong institutional interest evident in Ethereum’s support zones. With ETH finding buyers near its 200-day MA and key horizontal levels, SOL’s price weakness could signal a flight to safety toward larger-cap assets. If Ethereum continues to consolidate above $3,200, it could exert indirect resistance on SOL, limiting its ability to recover in the short term. Solana bulls must reclaim lost support zones to shift sentiment to the next bullish phase. Solana Price Forecast: SOL To Crash 20% As Selling Pressure Builds Looking at the near-term Solana price forecast , current market dynamics indicate a bearish outlook, with a potential 20% decline as selling pressure intensifies. As seen in the chart below, SOL price has recently breached key support levels, including the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $232.51 and the 200-day SMA at $168.88, signaling weakening demand. The Swing Failure Pattern (SFP) due to excessive selling further confirms the bearish sentiment, as buyers failed to sustain upward momentum, leading to a breakdown. Solana Price Forecast The price is currently testing the range midpoint at $232.51, which now acts as resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and other momentum indicators are likely in oversold territory, but without significant buying interest, a rebound seems unlikely. The demand zone around $168.88, aligned with the 200-day SMA, is the next critical support level.

As 2025 unfolds, the focus is on projects that have demonstrated resilience, innovation, and the potential for significant returns. From digital currencies aiming to revolutionize cross-border transactions to tokens driving blockchain scalability, these altcoins are reshaping the investment landscape. Qubetics , Terra Classic, and SEI have emerged as standout projects, making a compelling case for why they are the best altcoins to buy in January 2025. Qubetics, in particular, is capturing attention with its presale performance and groundbreaking Web3 solutions. It’s a name that’s becoming synonymous with innovation and accessibility in the blockchain world. With milestones like over $10.6 million raised during its presale and advanced tools designed for developers and businesses, Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in the Web3 era. Meanwhile, Terra Classic and SEI continue to build their reputations within the crypto space. Terra Classic, known for its ongoing commitment to reducing token supply, remains a favorite among value-seeking investors. SEI, on the other hand, focuses on speed and scalability, attracting developers and strategic partners alike. Each project has carved out a niche, serving diverse investor interests. Here’s why they’re among the best altcoins to buy in January 2025. Qubetics: The World’s First Web3 Aggregator Redefining Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics is making waves, and it’s easy to see why. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator , this project is designed to simplify blockchain and decentralized applications (dApps) for everyone, from tech-savvy professionals to everyday users. With over $10.6 million raised during its presale, more than 439 million $TICS tokens sold, and a growing community of over 16,000 token holders, Qubetics is quickly becoming a household name in the crypto space. Priced at $0.0551 in its 18th presale stage, analysts are forecasting remarkable returns for $TICS holders. By the end of the presale, $TICS is projected to reach $0.25, a staggering 353.39% return. But the excitement doesn’t stop there. Post-presale predictions suggest $TICS could soar to $5 or even $15 after the Mainnet launch, offering unparalleled investment potential. The buzz around Qubetics isn’t just about the numbers. Its innovative focus on cross-border transactions is a game-changer. Picture a small e-commerce business in Buenos Aires trying to pay suppliers in another country. Traditional banking methods are slow, expensive, and often riddled with hidden fees. Qubetics streamlines the process, enabling fast, cost-effective, and secure payments that eliminate middlemen. Imagine a freelance designer in Mexico City receiving instant payments from clients worldwide—that’s the future Qubetics is building.

Whether it’s a blockchain-based supply chain solution or a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, the possibilities are endless.

Terra Classic: The Token That Keeps Evolving Terra Classic has weathered its share of challenges, but its resilience has solidified its place as a staple in the crypto market. With a current price of $0.0000815, Terra Classic continues to attract investors drawn to its innovative approach to reducing token supply. Earlier this month, Finance executed a burn of 1.7 billion LUNC tokens, aiming to lower the circulating supply and enhance its long-term value. What makes Terra Classic stand out is its community-driven approach. Investors and developers alike have rallied behind the project, ensuring its survival and growth even in turbulent times. Terra Classic’s unique position as a deflationary token has captured the imagination of those looking for long-term growth potential. The consistent token burns demonstrate the project’s commitment to value creation, offering a solid alternative to traditional investments. Think about an investor in Rio de Janeiro exploring ways to diversify their portfolio. Terra Classic provides an affordable entry point into crypto, with the potential for exponential growth. As the token supply decreases over time, the value proposition becomes even more attractive. It’s this deflationary model that sets Terra Classic apart as one of the best altcoins to buy in January 2025. SEI: Speed, Scalability, and a Growing Ecosystem SEI has carved out a reputation as a high-performance blockchain platform focused on scalability and speed. With a current trading price of $0.339, SEI has seen a recent dip, but that hasn’t deterred analysts from predicting a bright future. Many believe SEI could reach $1 by the end of 2025, driven by increased adoption and its expanding ecosystem. What makes SEI unique is its dedication to creating a blockchain that can handle large-scale applications without compromising efficiency. This focus has attracted a strong developer community and strategic partnerships, making it a go-to platform for building scalable dApps. Picture a tech startup in Colombia leveraging SEI’s ecosystem to create a high-speed payment platform. The blockchain’s performance ensures seamless transactions, making it a preferred choice for developers worldwide. SEI’s commitment to innovation doesn’t stop at speed.

With success stories like Dogecoin paving the way, the new year introduces Arctic Pablo, a meme coin with an adventurous twist. The crypto landscape is buzzing with opportunities, and if you missed Dogecoin’s early days, this could be your shot at a high-potential investment. Arctic Pablo is creating waves with its presale, unique narrative, and massive ROI potential, while Dogecoin continues to prove its staying power. Let’s dive into these two captivating projects and uncover why they’re the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in January 2025. Arctic Pablo: A Mystical Journey to Riches Imagine a daring explorer named Arctic Pablo braving icy tundras, his snowmobile blazing trails through frostbitten terrains. This isn’t just a story—it’s the heart of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC). As Arctic Pablo discovers mystical tokens hidden in icy realms, he invites the world to join him on a journey that blends myth with reality. With each location in the presale, Arctic Pablo uncovers new treasures, and early investors are reaping the rewards. The Arctic Pablo presale has already raised over $430,000 in just 15 days, and the momentum is growing fast. With a current price of $0.000038, $APC offers early adopters an unmatched chance for exponential gains. By the time it hits its final presale price of $0.0008 and a launch price of $0.008, investors could see returns of over 30,692%. Arctic Pablo’s weekly token burns during the presale ensure scarcity, driving up value. Every unsold token is permanently removed, creating a deflationary environment that benefits holders. Combined with a 66% APY staking program, $APC is designed to reward long-term investors. Picture this: by staking your tokens, you’re not only earning rewards but also participating in Arctic Pablo’s legendary journey. Unlike traditional presales divided into stages, Arctic Pablo’s is location-based. Currently, he’s in Metropolis, a realm filled with untapped treasures, and his next destination is Snowy Shores. But here’s the twist: if he discovers the treasure earlier than expected, the presale will move on—leaving latecomers behind. This unique approach adds urgency and excitement, making $APC one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in January 2025. Arctic Pablo isn’t just about financial returns; it’s a narrative-driven adventure that brings investors into a story of exploration and discovery. Don’t wait until the final presale location—join the journey now and secure your stake in Arctic Pablo’s mystical legacy. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin That Started It All No discussion of meme coins is complete without mentioning Dogecoin. What began as a playful jab at Bitcoin has now become one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies globally. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value surged by over 15,000%, making millionaires out of early adopters. Its mascot, the Shiba Inu dog, has become a cultural icon, symbolizing the fun and community-driven nature of crypto. Dogecoin operates on simplicity. It doesn’t promise elaborate narratives or cutting-edge features; instead, it thrives on its loyal fanbase and massive adoption. From tipping content creators to facilitating microtransactions, Dogecoin has cemented its utility. But with its current price hovering around $0.07, many investors wonder if it can replicate its past performance. Here’s where Arctic Pablo shines as a complementary investment. While Dogecoin offers stability and brand recognition, Arctic Pablo delivers innovation and high ROI potential. Imagine owning Dogecoin back in 2013—that’s the kind of opportunity Arctic Pablo presents today. And with its presale still in early phases, now’s the time to act. Dogecoin’s journey also underscores the importance of timing. Early adopters saw exponential gains, but those who joined late missed out on the windfall. Don’t let history repeat itself. Arctic Pablo’s adventurous narrative and deflationary tokenomics could make it the next big thing in the meme coin space. If you’ve been on the sidelines, it’s time to take the plunge and be part of Arctic Pablo’s journey. Conclusion: The Time to Act Is Now Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo and Dogecoin are the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in January 2025. Arctic Pablo’s presale is a golden opportunity to join a thrilling adventure with unmatched ROI potential, while Dogecoin’s legacy continues to provide value and stability. Whether you’re an experienced investor or a curious newcomer, now is the time to act. Don’t let these opportunities pass you by. Join the Arctic Pablo presale today and secure your place in a story of wealth and discovery.

Trump Buys XRP (TRUMPXRP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPXRP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Buys XRP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys XRP could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys XRP launched with over $32,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys XRP on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys XRP by entering its contract address (CA) – HjQUfYDa2vgcG3AYb8z5Sernxm1ttRfhjL4N7A65BY7x – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPXRP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|XRP|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 02:48:20

While these coins make headlines for their viral appeal, their reliance on hype often overshadows a lack of real-world utility. In contrast, Lightchain AI is emerging as a project with substance, combining blockchain and artificial intelligence to address tangible challenges. Currently priced at $0.005625 during its presale and having raised over $12.8 million, Lightchain AI offers a long-term alternative for investors seeking more than speculative gains. Rise (and Limits) of $TRUMP and $MELANIA Coins $TRUMP and $MELANIA coins have drawn significant attention by leveraging their ties to high-profile figures. Their launches created a frenzy among meme coin enthusiasts, leading to sharp price increases fueled by social media and retail hype. These coins have become cultural symbols for supporters of Donald and Melania Trump, with their political branding serving as the primary driver of interest. However, the volatility of these meme coins highlights their biggest drawback – a lack of utility. Once the hype subsides, these tokens often struggle to maintain value, leaving investors exposed to significant risks. This has led many to seek alternatives with sustainable growth potential and real-world applications—such as Lightchain AI . Lightchain AI – Beyond the Hype Unlike $TRUMP and $MELANIA, Lightchain AI is grounded in innovation and utility. One of its key features is its AI-Driven Decentralized Data Solutions, which enable businesses to securely store, process, and analyze data using blockchain technology. This innovation appeals to enterprises that require efficient and scalable systems for managing sensitive information. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s Presale Structure demonstrates its commitment to fostering an engaged community. By raising over $12.8 million during its presale, the platform has shown strong early-stage adoption, with investors confident in its ability to deliver on its promises. Lightchain AI’s roadmap, including its testnet launch in January 2025 and mainnet rollout in March, provides clear milestones for growth. Why Investors Are Choosing Lightchain AI For investors, the choice between meme coins and utility-driven projects like Lightchain AI is becoming increasingly clear. While $TRUMP and $MELANIA offer short-term excitement, their speculative nature makes them inherently unstable. Lightchain AI , on the other hand, provides a sustainable investment opportunity by addressing real-world challenges with advanced technology. Lightchain AI’s focus on empowering developers with tools to build decentralized applications (dApps) further cements its position as a leader in blockchain innovation. By fostering a collaborative ecosystem, the platform ensures its relevance in a rapidly evolving market. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-26 03:00:00

According to a Jan. 25 repo rt by Bloomberg, Elon wa nts blockchain to track federal spending, secure sensitive data, process payments, and even manage government buildings. The D.O.G.E, established by ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump, is tasked with making government tech leaner, meaner, and cheaper. The report says D.O.G.E has already met with representatives from public blockchain networks to evaluate what works and what doesn’t. Trump’s executive order kicks things off The Department of Government Efficiency was made official with an executive order signed by Trump on January 20. D.O.G.E has to deliver recommendations for spending cuts by July 4, 2026. Bloomberg’s report said Elon wasted no time, recruiting 100 volunteers before Trump even stepped into the Oval to start coding for D.O.G.E-related projects. In December, a person reportedly pitched Trump’s transition team in Palm Beach, Florida, on how blockchain could protect critical government data and track federal dollars. The pitch landed with Elon’s team, who believe a decentralized ledger could slash fraud, abuse, and unnecessary spending in federal programs. Using blockchain to run an operation as massive as the U.S. government is uncharted territory, though. Blockchain efforts in corporate America—like Walmart’s private blockchain for tracking supply chains—have been hit or miss. Many private blockchain experiments failed due to governance issues, high costs, or inefficiency compared to traditional databases. Public blockchains, on the other hand, offer transparency but come with their own baggage. Bitcoin and Solana, for instance, operate on decentralized networks of computers, which the Trump administration has used to launch meme coins TRUMP and MELANIA. Still, giants like BlackRock have started using public blockchains for business. BlackRock issued a money-market fund on crypto ledgers, and California’s Department of Motor Vehicles digitized millions of car titles on Avalanche. If D.O.G.E does move forward with blockchain, the scale of the project would dwarf anything attempted in the private sector. And crypto elites are already so excited about the prospects. Binance founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao pointed out : “All governments should track all their spending on the blockchain, an immutable public ledger. It’s called ‘public spending’ for a reason.” And Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said , “Well, I’m thinking this is a job for a triumvirate of Cardano, Bitcoin, and Midnight. Yo, Doge Master Elon Musk, give us a call. We’ll do it for free.” Elon’s White House takeover Elon’s D.O.G.E department is already embedded in the White House. The team has office space in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and plans to deploy four-person D.O.G.E teams to every federal agency. Elon’s close friendship with Trump plays a huge role in all of this. Elon poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign and has become his closest adviser. Trump even knighted him as the nation’s ‘First Buddy.’ But Elon’s deep ties to government contracts, including those of his companies Tesla and SpaceX, are bringing questions about conflicts of interest. Critics say Elon’s recommendations for budget cuts could clash with his personal business dealings. Elon, for his part, says he’s not taking a salary for leading D.O.G.E. But this guy has had a love-hate relationship with crypto for years. Also, a union representing hundreds of thousands of federal employees has already sued the Trump administration over D.O.G.E. The lawsuit said the initiative puts workers’ jobs at risk and doesn’t address systemic issues within federal agencies.

Kamala Sucks (KAMASUCK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because KAMASUCK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Kamala Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Kamala Sucks could become the next viral memecoin. Kamala Sucks launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Kamala Sucks on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kamala Sucks by entering its contract address (CA) – KFywQqjGH3WdEQ4hR42oYQ17v4nSePom6AjyJc8TNfU – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like KAMASUCK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 03:59:15

With its innovative strategies in e-commerce and decentralized decision-making, Web3Bay is quickly becoming a top investment pick for 2025. By raising $900,000 in its presale phase and boasting a potential 6,430% ROI, Web3Bay transcends mere speculation to provide real utility and scalability in a market poised for transformation. Ripple (XRP) Targets $4 After Strong Market Uptrend Ripple (XRP) is poised to reach $4 following its recent jump to $3, sparked by increased crypto market interest after President Trump’s latest inauguration. Noted analyst Ali Martinez points out that XRP has emerged from a bullish flag pattern, suggesting a rise to $4.40 soon. Over the last week, XRP has seen a 23.4% increase and 40.4% over the month. Positive signs from technical tools like the relative strength index (RSI) above its mid-point indicate strong bullish momentum. Supported by significant buyer interest, XRP’s journey to $4 looks promising. Chainlink (LINK) Price Trend: Bullish Trajectory Aims for $30.81 Chainlink (LINK) exhibits strong upward trends, moving through a five-wave Elliott Wave pattern on daily and hourly charts. The daily RSI indicates more room for growth before reaching overbought territory, with Wave (v) aiming to surpass the prior high of $30.81. Supportive Fibonacci levels hint at sustained upward movement. On the hourly chart, Wave (iii) progresses after a slight retreat in Wave (ii) to $22.17. With targets set near $30.81, Chainlink’s outlook is positive. However, a drop below $22.74 could trigger corrections, making these levels critical for traders. Web3Bay: A Wise Choice for Tangible Benefits and High ROI Web3Bay’s 3BAY token underpins its decentralized e-commerce framework, providing real benefits and growth potential. At $0.004562625 in its fourth presale stage and expected to launch at $0.1959, it offers a massive 6,430% ROI. In contrast, Ripple’s XRP has yet to reach past highs, and Chainlink’s LINK depends on the DeFi sector’s fortunes. Web3Bay’s broad appeal and practical approach set it apart as an investment choice. Investing $1,000 in 3BAY now could return over $42,900 at launch. This projection is backed by Web3Bay’s practical model. As the platform gains users, demand for 3BAY tokens will likely increase, boosting their value over time. Why Web3Bay Promises Long-Term Gains Web3Bay’s strategy extends beyond immediate profits. Its roadmap is geared toward growth and engaging users, ensuring its relevance for the future. Essential features include: NFT Marketplace: A venue for artists and collectors to trade digital items smoothly. Decentralized Governance: Token holders have a say in platform decisions, fostering a community-led environment. Hybrid Payment System: Accepts both crypto and traditional payments like PayPal, broadening its user base. Layer-2 Scaling: Keeps transactions fast and cheap even at high-demand times, enhancing user experience. These initiatives position Web3Bay as more than just a token; it’s a well-rounded solution tackling the $5 trillion e-commerce market’s inefficiencies. Unlike Chainlink’s limited focus and Ripple’s regulatory hurdles, Web3Bay is crafting a viable global commerce solution. Long Stroy, Short! Smart investors recognize the importance of utility tokens linked to platforms that address real challenges. Like Ethereum and Binance Coin, which moved past speculative phases to prove their value, Web3Bay is on a path to significant impact. Already with $900,000 from its presale and a token price that rises each round, Web3Bay’s structured pricing model rewards early backers, urging quick action. Those who joined early are already seeing substantial gains, and the forecasted launch price of $0.1959 presents even more potential. While Chainlink and Ripple excel in their specific blockchain and payment niches, Web3Bay introduces a unique decentralized e-commerce platform, making it a top investment in 2025 .

His remarks focus on identifying which projects qualify for the proposed zero capital gains tax and the implications for companies with global affiliations. Crypto Lawyer John Deaton Raises Concerns Over U.S. Tax Policies In a recent tweet , John Deaton discussed the ambiguity surrounding U.S.-based cryptocurrency projects. He questioned whether projects with operations or foundations abroad, such as Solana and Tezos, would meet the requirements for tax exemptions. Solana Labs, headquartered in San Francisco, operates under the Solana Foundation based in Switzerland, while Tezos was developed by U.S.-based Arthur and Kathleen Breitman but is governed by the Switzerland-based Tezos Foundation. Deaton’s inquiry centers on whether such hybrid structures qualify as U.S.-based entities under the proposed tax policies. John Deaton also pointed to cryptocurrencies like XRP, XLM, HBAR, AVAX, and XCH, which may face fewer jurisdictional hurdles. These projects meet the criteria on the surface, potentially positioning them to benefit from the zero capital gains tax. Moreover, Deaton emphasized the potential for tax incentives to drive broader adoption of cryptocurrencies as corporate treasury assets. He questioned whether companies adopting digital assets like XRP, XLM, and HBAR would gain a competitive edge under the proposed zero capital gains tax policy. He also raised concerns about the treatment of foreign entities with U.S. operations, such as Hut 8, and their eligibility for tax benefits. More so, recently the pro-XRP lawyer highlighted four key objectives for the White House Crypto Council. He urged its members to focus on critical areas like SAB 121, the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, crypto tax payments, and overarching crypto taxation policies. U.S. Crypto Companies and Mining Firms Could Reap Benefits John Deaton further explored how U.S.-based companies, including Ripple, Gemini, and ConsenSys, might benefit from the tax exemption if it applies to corporations. The tax breaks could incentivize these firms to expand their crypto holdings and encourage other companies to adopt cryptocurrency as a reserve asset. Deaton also addressed the status of Bitcoin miners like Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital Holdings. These U.S.-based miners might qualify for the exemption, but questions remain about companies like Hut 8 Corp, a Canadian entity with expanding operations in the U.S. John Deaton highlighted the need for clarity on whether international companies with significant U.S. activities could also benefit. Treasury Reserve Strategies and Corporate Crypto Adoption Another key issue raised by Deaton involves corporations adopting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP, and HBAR as part of their treasury reserves. He questioned whether such strategies would qualify these companies for tax benefits under the new policies. Prominent firms like MicroStrategy, known for its Bitcoin holdings, could stand to gain from the tax exemption if their crypto reserve strategies align with the proposed framework. The policy might also encourage other companies to include crypto in their balance sheets. More so, recently, Deaton also emphasized the broader challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry. He criticized past regulatory actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which he described as resource-draining and counterproductive. John Deaton called for an end to what he referred to as “crypto wars,” urging a shift toward clearer regulations to support innovation.

This new token provides a straightforward opportunity for traders and analysts to participate in its presale. With its utility-based tokens, this project aims to transform the landscape of meme coins. Let’s explore why investors are shifting their attention to this innovative offering. High Expectations from Solana Investors and Newer Options Solana(SOL) has long been celebrated for its high-throughput blockchain capabilities. It is a good alternative among developers and investors looking for scalability beyond Ethereum. The sol price has seen remarkable fluctuations, reflecting its volatile yet promising nature. However, as the market evolves, the quest for the next big opportunity leads many to explore emerging tokens like Panshibi . Solana investors, accustomed to the thrill of rapid price movements and the promise of blockchain innovation, enjoy the blend of entertainment and financial gain in Panshibi. The meme coin market offers a different kind of investment narrative than what Solana has traditionally provided. As the sol price stabilizes or faces resistance at higher levels, the allure of a project like Panshibi simply increases. Luckily, Panshibi offers a community-driven approach with its governance model that involves all token holders. This has pushed most Solana investors to diversify their Solana portfolios into what could be the next big meme coin phenomenon. The SUI Scenario Sui (SUI), with its focus on high performance and a developer-friendly environment, has attracted a different segment of the crypto community. However, even with impressive tech capabilities in Sui, the meme coin craze of 2025 has not spared its investors from looking elsewhere. The appeal of Panshibi lies not just in its potential for high returns but also in its unique positioning in the market. Sui holders are drawn to Panshibi for its novelty – merging the cultural significance of Asia, the universal appeal of pandas, and the vibrant world of meme coins. This shift is partly driven by the search for assets that can offer both entertainment and utility, something Sui does not directly cater to. With the meme coin market’s valuation hitting $115 billion in January 2025, the opportunity for growth in Panshibi seems vast. This means Sui investors have the opportunity to allocate portions of their holdings into what could be the best financial decision of 2025. Panshibi: The Meme Coin That’s Redefining Community and Investment Panshibi stands out in the crowded meme coin market with its unique tokenomics. At its core, Panshibi aims to unite three significant communities: those in Asia, panda lovers, and meme coin enthusiasts. This combination allows Panshibi to incorporate social finance and AI elements, actively engaging its community. Holders of SHIBI, Panshibi’s native token, are not just passive investors; they are active participants in a vibrant ecosystem. They have a say in project decisions and enjoy exclusive member perks through the Bamboo Private VIP Club. The Panshibi presale exemplifies its potential. It has a cap of $10 million and is structured across 15 stages, with the token price set to increase by 1,200% during the presale. Additionally, there is an ambitious projection of 145,000% growth after the launch. This strategy aims to reward early supporters and create a sense of urgency and fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors. Panshibi also emphasizes security and transparency, backed by a complete smart contract audit by Coinsult. As we look ahead to 2025, the meme coin market is expected to continue expanding as more traders and investors seek significant returns. For investors from Solana and Sui, Panshibi is more than just another token to add to their portfolios; it offers the chance to engage with a community that promises profits and rewards regardless of the price of Sui or Sol. Given that the token’s liquidity is locked for ten years and team tokens for two years, the future of Panshibi looks promising. For Sol and Sui enthusiasts searching for something to believe in, Panshibi represents hope for the meme coin market and cryptocurrency as a whole.

39513358,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=663210,1737866733,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39513358.jpeg,Wall Street CEOs support all of Trump’s pro-crypto plans,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-ceos-trump-pro-crypto-plans/,"Wall Street is finally warming up to crypto, thanks to President Donald Trump’s aggressive push to boost the industry, especially after Jan. 23rd’s executive order for the National Digital Asset Stockpile. Barely a week into Trump’s second term, a Jan. 25 report by CNBC says top financial executives are falling in line with his pro-crypto policies in a major pivot for an industry that previously kept Bitcoin at arm’s length. Trump’s executive order emphasizes “protecting and promoting” the use and development of cryptocurrencies. Wall Street CEOs jump in In Davos, Switzerland, at the World Economic Forum, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said, “We’ll be working with Treasury and the other regulators to figure out how we can offer that in a safe way.” The bank is known for pushing boundaries in crypto before most of its peers. In 2021, Morgan Stanley became the first major U.S. institution to give wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds. By 2024, it had authorized its advisors to pitch bitcoin ETFs to clients. ‘Crypto president’ Trump is surrounding himself with pro-crypto allies to make sure his agenda sticks. Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner under George W. Bush, has been nominated to lead the SEC. Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, has been tapped as Commerce Secretary. Scott Bessent, a hedge fund manager with a Bitcoin obsession, is Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary. If confirmed, Scott will oversee the IRS and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network—two agencies critical to creating clear tax and compliance policies for crypto. Trump’s policies are addressing longstanding frustrations from Wall Street. One major complaint has been the SEC’s 2022 accounting rule, known as SAB 121, which forced banks to classify cryptocurrencies as liabilities on their balance sheets. This rule discouraged banks from offering crypto custody services by imposing strict capital requirements. But as Cryptopolitan reported on Jan. 23rd, the SEC rescinded SAB 121, removing one of the biggest roadblocks for financial institutions looking to engage with digital assets. “Bye, bye SAB 121! It’s not been fun,” said SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who was tapped on Tuesday to lead a new “crypto task force.” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, also speaking in Davos, welcomed the changes. “If the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you’ll find that the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it,” he said. He pointed to crypto’s potential as a payment system, comparing it to Visa or Apple Pay. However, Moynihan steered clear of endorsing cryptos as investment assets, calling that “a separate question.” Bitcoin’s price has of course responded to the optimism. On Monday, it surged to nearly $110,000—its highest price ever—before settling at around $106,000 as of press time. Banks lobby for clear rules as adoption grows While the SEC’s actions have brought a lot of excitement, Wall Street is still grappling with other regulatory issues. Anti-money laundering (AML) rules remain a sticking point, as inconsistent guidelines make it difficult for banks to serve certain industries. Jamie Dimon, the anti-crypto CEO of JPMorgan Chase, summed up the frustration on a podcast earlier this week: “There should be far cleaner lines about what we have to do and what we don’t have to do. We’ve been complaining about this for years. We need to fix it.” Wall Street CEOs are also lobbying for a unified federal standard to replace the patchwork of state laws that complicate compliance. Trump’s administration is being pressured to address these challenges as part of its broader effort to streamline crypto regulation. Though on Thursday, Trump criticized JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, accusing them of denying services to conservative customers. The issue, known as “debanking,” has long been a Republican talking point. “We take this issue very seriously,” Bank of America said on Friday. “We will be engaging with the administration and Congress regarding the extensive government regulations that sometimes result in requirements to exit relationships.” The renewed focus on AML rules comes after a 2020 law aimed at overhauling these regulations fell short of its goals. Banks continue to push for clearer guidelines, arguing that inconsistent rules force them to walk away from certain clients and industries out of fear of penalties.

Speculation about Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and its potential role in the financial framework has gained momentum, fueled by crypto commentators like Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy. Ripple’s RLUSD and Federal Oversight Speculations Farina recently shared his views on X, proposing that the U.S. government could transfer Ripple’s escrowed XRP into federal reserves, effectively taking control of the asset. He argued that RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin launched in December 2024 , might serve as a central currency while adhering to regulatory standards. I speculate the Escrow is transferred to the U.S. stockpile, with the Gov. effectively taking control of $XRP while maintaining regulatory oversight. RLUSD becomes the CBDC. Chess, not checkers. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) January 23, 2025 One commenter echoed this speculation, stating , “Your speculation looks pretty good to me… Australia has had its CBDC set up for at least a couple of years, but has gone totally under the radar.” This highlights how other nations have approached digital currencies differently, creating a point of comparison for the U.S. financial strategy. However, considering Trump’s recent ban on CBDCs, he might have different plans for the U.S. crypto industry. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Ban on CBDCs and RLUSD’s Unique Position Trump’s executive order banning CBDCs leaves room for stablecoins like RLUSD to act as alternatives. One commenter noted , “RLUSD will act as a central currency.” This perspective suggests that RLUSD could fulfill functions similar to a CBDC while operating within private-sector boundaries. This explanation also aligns with a recent analysis from Austin King, a former Ripple employee, who believes Trump will empower the private sector and companies like Ripple through his crypto initiatives. By leveraging its stablecoin, Ripple could bridge the gap between private innovation and government oversight. Ripple’s blockchain infrastructure, known for its speed and efficiency, may position RLUSD as a practical solution for governments seeking digital currency innovation without creating centralized government-issued digital currencies. This approach could align with the U.S. government’s objectives under the new executive order. Ripple’s emphasis on regulatory compliance, like RLUSD’s NYDFS certification, also serves as a strong foundation for the asset. Ripple’s partnerships with international financial institutions XRP and RLUSD and Ripple’s technology could potentially become critical components in the U.S. financial ecosystem.

Hitler Musk (HITMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HITMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Hitler Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Hitler Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Hitler Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Hitler Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Hitler Musk by entering its contract address (CA) – GB5uSMr95szepTSfj6sbJHFxMaBHwwyBzUY6dPAWZCCH – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HITMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 05:00:32

Some Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are growing weary of the asset’s inherent volatility and are now seeking projects that might bring more stability. Among these sits Remittix (RTX), a powerful PayFi solution currently gaining traction in its presale for its modern approach to cross-border payments. So can Dogecoin (DOGE) bounce back and what is all the fuss about Remittix (RTX) ? Dogecoin Sees 8.4% Price Drop Dogecoin is down 6.58% in 24hrs and currently trades at $0.3713. Dogecoin (DOGE) is now trading near a key support level at $0.39 The RSI suggests that Dogecoin may be approaching oversold territory, which could precede a possible short term recovery. Conversely, the MACD dropped below the signal line indicating bearish sentiments for Dogecoin (DOGE) in the coming days. Interestingly, activity on the Dogecoin network has spiked recently. Address activity has hit a seven month high and whale transactions have peaked. Much like with other meme coins, Dogecoin’s current volatility makes it hard to predict what might happen next. Remittix Changes the Game for Cross-Border Payments The Remittix (RTX) platform lets you convert more than 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies and send money directly to bank accounts worldwide. Unlike traditional systems with unpredictable fees, Remittix uses a flat fee model, ensuring recipients know the exact amount being sent. Such a simple operational model and the low costs associated with Remittix make it a solid choice for both individuals and businesses. Another key feature contributing to Remittix’s (RTX) broad adoption is its ability to integrate with traditional financial infrastructures. Unlike many blockchain based solutions demanding technical expertise, Remittix ensures recipients experience benefit from crypto payments while enjoying the simplicity of traditional bank transfers and without needing a deep understanding of the crypto space. The straightforwardness of this system removes barriers to access, bridging the gap between digital assets and mainstream financial networks. Remittix (RTX) is also setting an example with its commitment to financial inclusion. RTX offers round the clock access to a global payment system that eliminates the limitations of traditional banking systems; the platform lets users in underbanked regions participate in global commerce. This accessibility, its instant settlement capabilities and transparent fee model, position Remittix as a major player in bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology. Remittix Powers Through Presale, Passing $7 Million Remittix (RTX) is currently seeing dominance in its presale, which has already raised over $7 million with tokens on offer for an enticing price of just $0.0350. As utility focused projects are becoming more of a priority in the crypto space, Remittix shines above others for its ability to solve real world problems and analysts anticipate a steep price gain of 800% in the presale alone. As it positions itself to dominate the prosperous cross-border payments space, Remittix is not a project to miss out on in 2025.

The SHIB token peaked at $0.00003340 in December and has plunged by about 40% to the current $0.00002. So, is the SHIB coin a good buy as a death cross approaches? Shiba Inu coin price technical analysis: death cross pattern nears The daily chart shows that the SHIB price peaked at $0.00003340 and then retreated to the psychological point at $0.000020. Technicals suggest that the SHIB coin has more downside. It has formed what looks like a head-and-shoulders pattern, which often leads to more downside in the longer term. The coin is also about to form a death cross pattern, which happens when the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages (WMA) cross each other. The spread between the two averages has continued to narrow, and currently stands at just 3.1%, down from over 10% a few days ago. A death cross is often seen as being one of the riskiest chart patterns in the financial market. That’s because it is a sign that bears have overcome the bulls, which leads to more downside. The coin has also formed a double-top chart pattern at $0.00002490. Like the death cross, this is also a highly popular bearish chart patterns. The Shiba Inu price has also moved to the closely watched 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, there is a risk that the coin will have a strong bearish breakdown in the next few weeks. If this happens, the next price to watch will be $0.00001850, its lowest swing on December 20. A drop below that support level will point to more downside, potentially to the 78.6% point at $0.00001568, down by 23% below the current point. Shiba Inu’s bearish outlook will remain as long as it is below the double-top point at $0.00002490. Why has SHIB coin crashed? There are two main reasons why the Shiba Inu price has crashed in the past few months. First, it has plunged as investors have rotated to newer and shinier meme coins. Most recently, they moved to the Official Trump and Melania meme coins that surged before the inauguration. Some cash moved from old meme tokens to these ones as investors looked for strong gains. A good example is the daily volume figures . SHIB had a 24-hour volume of $163 million, much lower than Official Trump’s $4.45 billion and Pudgy Penguins’ $169 million. Melania Trump’s meme coin had a daily volume of $215 million. Second, while the Shibarium is growing, data shows that the fees collected have continued falling. Shibarium’s completed transactions jumped to over 847 million, an impressive figure for a recently launched network. The average transaction fee has dropped 0.000064 BONE from 0.0003 BONE a month earlier. At the same time, the total sum of BONE fees collected by the network has continued to fall thos year and stands at less than 400 BONE per day. These fees are important because they signal whether the layer-2 network is growing or not. They are also crucial because their impact on Shibarium’s burn rate has dropped.

Many of them provide safe trends for traders to invest in. Certain coins have been tipped to increase by 1000x in 2025. PEPE’s price prediction shows it is on course to achieve this feat. Other new projects like Panshibi ($SHIBI) have also been tipped to achieve this feat. Let’s find out why! PEPE price prediction: whale accumulation suggests future gains amidst a price decrease PEPE is on course for an explosive price gain in 2025. Although its price at the moment may not depict this prediction, experts believe accumulation by whales could propel it to a new ATH. It is reduced by 4.02% today with a price of $0.00001512. Recent blockchain data shows that major investors have strategically bought PEPE during this dip. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently bought 508.6 million PEPE tokens. This action by a major investor in the crypto world has further fueled market speculations that PEPE could experience a 1000x increase in 2025. Vitalik Buterin’s endorsement, the increasing social media presence, and active addresses also reinforce PEPE’s price prediction. Experts also believe that PEPE’s double bottom formation at a critical support level and its bullish falling wedge are major signs of an incoming sustained increase.

The Russian president said that he is optimistic direct talks with Trump could lead to mutually beneficial outcomes, emphasizing the need for “calm and realistic discussions.” Putin then criticized Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, pointing to a decree Zelenskiy signed that prohibits Ukraine from negotiating with him. This, according to Putin, complicates the possibility of peace talks. “We are ready to talk,” he said in the interview, but added that progress depends heavily on the choices made by the current US administration. NATO praises Trump’s push for sanctions NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte was also quick to applaud Trump’s call for tougher sanctions and tariffs on Russia. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Rutte said, “I was very, very happy with Trump’s position to put more sanctions on Russia. The Russian economy is in terrible shape, and these measures will help squeeze it further.” He also urged European nations to follow Trump’s lead, encouraging them to increase their economic pressure on Moscow to deplete Russia’s war funds. Rutte pointed out the importance of a sustainable resolution to the war, adding that any peace deal should prevent Russia from regaining its territorial ambitions. He warned that Russia’s allies, including China and North Korea, would celebrate a weak settlement, which would embolden Moscow to attempt even more land grabs. “We must reach a position where Russia will never again dare to take even one square kilometer of Ukraine,” Rutte said. On Jan. 22nd, president Trump issued a warning through his Truth Social platform: “If no deal is reached to end the war, we’ll have no choice but to impose high tariffs, taxes, and sanctions on anything Russia sells to the US or our allies.” He added , “Let’s get this war—one that never would’ve started if I were president—over with. We can do it the easy way or the hard way.” Financial giants weigh in on Trump’s tariff strategy Wall Street leaders have chimed in on Trump’s escalating trade threats, offering varied perspectives. At the Davos event, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledged concerns about inflation and trade wars but said tariffs could be effective if used strategically. “If it’s a little inflationary but good for national security, so be it,” he said. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon suggested in an interview with CNBC that Trump’s tariffs might serve as leverage to renegotiate global trade agreements. He added that how quickly and thoughtfully these measures are implemented would determine their effectiveness. Trump’s tariff threats extend beyond Russia. He has promised to impose a 10% levy on Chinese goods and a 25% tariff on products from Canada and Mexico. The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a key deal negotiated during Trump’s first term, is up for review in 2026. Trump has also accused the European Union of unfair trade practices, pointing to the $214 billion trade deficit the US recorded with the EU in 2024.

Dogecoin News: Key Factors That Could Drive the DOGE Price Dogecoin has started 2025 on a positive note, showing strong growth in January.

Currently, the Dogecoin price is at $0.356 and if it continues its uptrend, DOGE could get near its ATH from May 2021. For Dogecoin to reach one dollar by March, three key factors could drive this price surge. First, wider adoption by retailers would boost demand, helping to increase its value. Second, a continued positive market outlook and more activity from whales could generate enough momentum to push the price higher. Also, if Dogecoin can break through important resistance levels, it could signal a stronger bullish trend, which would bring it closer to the one-dollar target. Join the $SHIBI Presale Today!

Bitcoin (BTC) and leading cryptocurrencies have consolidated over the past week, sparking speculations despite pro-cryptocurrency Donald Trump’s inauguration. Whereas, meme coins Shiba Inu (SHIB) and VINE have emerged as the talk of the cryptocurrency town over the week, gaining significant traction in light of broader trends and developments. Here’s a brief report on some of the top cryptocurrency market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. BTC & Top Crypto Mainly Consolidate Notably, BTC price chart has shown a period of sideways trading despite the broader market eagerly anticipating gains following Trump’s inauguration. Bitcoin price closed the week near the $105K level, up marginally by 0.1% in the past seven days. The flagship crypto’s current price trajectory comes despite bullish news for the asset surfacing across the industry. With the recent rescinding of SAB 121 , market participants have been highly positive on Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Further, Semler Scientific announced that it would raise $85 million in convertible notes to invest in BTC this week. This mover has sparked investor interest, paving a bullish road for the flagship coin in the light of heightened buying. Meanwhile, investment management company BlackRock sought U.S. SEC approval for its new redemption model for the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Overall, these events have emerged as highly optimistic news for the broader BTC market. Nevertheless, the asset continues to consolidate, raising investor speculation and uncertainty. CoinGape reported that China likely dumped a whopping 194K BTC recently, which falls in line with the current consolidation despite broader bullish developments. ETH & XRP Market Uncertain On the other hand, top crypto such as Ethereum (ETH) and XRP have also shown similar price actions. Notably, ETH closes the week at the $3,300 level, up by 0.5% over the week. Further, XRP also illustrated a sideways trading session, although the coin holds above $3. Ethereum’s consolidation raises severe uncertainty as ETH OI conversely rose to high levels recently, signaling a price breakout awaits the asset. Simultaneously, despite new XRP ETF filings reported this week, even the Ripple-backed asset consolidates, raising investor speculations. Meme Crypto SHIB & VINE Spark Buzz Meanwhile, the meme coins SHIB and VINE have stolen the spotlight, with the dog-themed crypto witnessing ecosystem developments and VINE seeing major listings amid heightened market interest. Notably, the Shiba Inu coin’s community introduced the revolutionary ShibOS (Shib Operating System) this week, offering users various use cases for a seamless Web2 to Web3 transition. On the other hand, with speculations of Vine social media app’s revival soaring, the Vine meme coin has gained substantial traction. Intriguingly, the token enjoys a bullish trend, securing major listings, witnessing an OI surge, and aiding traders in making massive profits. As a result, CoinGape reported that the Vine meme coin price could hit $1 shortly ahead. Overall, the abovementioned news emerged as some of the most buzzworthy topics reported by CoinGape over the past week.

Navigating the Meme Coin Mania Amid Market Uncertainties",https://nulltx.com/bonk-bonk-boom-or-bust-navigating-the-meme-coin-mania-amid-market-uncertainties/,"The crypto market consistently manages to astonish, and the recent fervor surrounding meme coins has infused yet another layer of interest. As of the most recent information available, the price of meme coins like Bonk has experienced a 24-hour change of -1.37%, with a market cap of $2.24 billion and a trading volume of $0.14 billion, placing it at #65 in the market [Source: coinmarketcap.com ]. Market Overview In recent weeks, the meme coin market has taken Bonk for a rollercoaster ride. Right now, though, the meme coin for dogs is worth nothing—literally $0, which is a change of -1.37% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Over the past week, trading has been just as equally wild, with the last 30 days highlighting Bonk’s performance unpredictability. If we can glean any insights from the last few months, it’s that coin flipping is a better way to determine price movement than any kind of technical analysis. Given its position at number 65, Bonk doesn’t really have a place in the market; it’s just kind of floating around out there in space. No key support levels have been established yet. When you look at a chart of Bonk, the resistances and supports are the first thing that pops out, considering how close resistance is to current price levels and how significant support is to investors who were lucky enough to snag Bonk at 4.8 cents or below. Recent News & Developments Investors and analysts have been paying close attention to a few key happenings. The filing for a $BONK ETF, now alongside the $DOGE and $TRUMP ETFs, suggests another potential access point for institutional investors to meme coins [ Source: coindesk.com ]. This development could provide a much-needed structure for investing in the meme coin space and thus could impact the market in a substantial way. The meme coin race is not going away. Indeed, we now have the first meme coin from Pi Network, PIDOG, which adds to the sheer absurdity of it all [ Source: minepi.com ]. Inside Bitcoins pointed out the potential of meme coins like $TRUMP, $DOGE, $BONK, and $WEPE ahead of ETF approvals, asserting that ‘Trump’s crypto-friendly stance signals big changes ahead.’ [ Source: insidebitcoins.com ] This political endorsement could instill a shot of investor confidence in these somewhat silly ‘meme’ coins, bringing them to heights we can’t even fathom, which is kind of the point. Technical Analysis Bonk and other meme coins have technical charts that show a mix of bullish and bearish patterns. The recent price movement has generated a symmetrical triangle, which could go either way depending on what the market thinks. If we look at the key indicators (such as the Relative Strength Index or the Moving Average Convergence Divergence), they are not offering much help since they seem to be in wait-and-see mode, neither catechizing bulls to charge forth nor calling bears to maul [ Source: tradingview.com ]. Analyzing volume shows trading activity that is balanced but not abundant. This is evident in the spikes related to major news events. The recent price levels that need to be watched are the recent highs and lows, which will function as the resistance and support that all prices must traverse. The trading activity itself has been a kind of short-term speculative hustle, without yet any long-term trend to speak of. Social & On-Chain Analysis Metrics assessing social sentiment indicate a bifurcated community. On the one hand, some users exude an almost naive optimism, seeing so much potential in the current market that they believe Bitcoin (BTC) is on an express train to $150,000 and that Dogecoin (DOGE) is poised to reach $1 [ Source: santiment.net ]. Yet, there are also many market participants expressing the exact opposite kind of sentiment. They see the current meme coin market and its broader crypto context as ‘doomer’ prone and in a dangerous vulnerable state. Indeed, the meme coin market is such an exciting flashpoint that institutional access to this segment of the crypto market has become a topic of conversation, especially in light of the $BONK ETF filing [ Source: coindesk.com ]. The actions of whales are well known, and any large transactions could potentially be influencing price action. Those most likely to spend a lot of money on meme coins are now doing so, which might be driving the uptick in network activity. And what about developer activity? It’s not quite what we see in other sectors, but there is some level of innovation really taking place in the meme coin space. Market Context & Future Outlook The correlation between the meme coin market and the broader cryptocurrency market is clear. Investors in meme coins look first to Bitcoin and Ethereum for guidance. These two coins are the performance leaders for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Notably, regulatory developments could soon provide a much clearer framework for the entire crypto market, including meme coins, which could serve to either legitimize or delegitimize this market sector. Projected prices are all over the place, with some analysts forecasting this year’s total meme coin market cap at between $300 billion to $500 billion [ Source: santiment.net ]. The meme coin market’s wild price swings make anything close to a sure bet very, very risky. Investors should stick to what is likely sensible and invest in meme coins with cash that can stand the loss of going to zero. In summation , the meme coin mania as seen with Bonk, remains quite en vogue within the crypto community. Although the market has not been favorable, recent developments infused with a healthy dose of social sentiment indicate a crypto space that is simultaneously chock-full of optimism yet also displaying caution. On a technical basis, the market is in a neutral formation and is best watched for the potential breakout or breakdown that is sure to happen soon. Verdict: future potentially bright—but investors must watch for the market’s next move, given its current unpredictability. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Trump Buys XRP (TRUMPXRP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPXRP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Buys XRP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys XRP could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys XRP launched with over $32,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys XRP on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys XRP by entering its contract address (CA) – HjQUfYDa2vgcG3AYb8z5Sernxm1ttRfhjL4N7A65BY7x – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPXRP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|XRP|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 05:42:00

These models are fifty times more efficient than even top U.S. offerings. The announcement has thrown American tech giants like OpenAI, Google, and Meta into a full-blown crisis, as their closed-door strategies suddenly stop cutting it. Now everyone on X is mocking them. For those confused why the US state and Silicon Valley are having a meltdown on twitter today. China released multiple AI models that are 50x more efficient than the best American AI models and made them open source, ruining the AI market — ashok kumar 🇵🇸 (@broseph_stalin) January 25, 2025 The man behind this shockwave is Liang Wenfeng, a hedge fund manager who turned a side project into one of the most disruptive AI advancements in history. DeepSeek’s R1 model is a self-learning system that can improve on its own without human oversight. And here’s what’s making Silicon Valley sweat: Liang is leveling the playing field for anyone—whether in China or anywhere else—looking to jump into AI development. Liang Wenfeng’s long game In 2021, while everyone else in China’s AI scene was focused on big tech, Liang quietly bought thousands of Nvidia graphic processing units (GPUs) and started experimenting with AI. People in the industry thought he was just another billionaire chasing a hobby. According to a business partner who reportedly spoke to the Financial Times, “When he told us he wanted to build a 10,000-chip cluster, we thought he was crazy. He didn’t even explain why, just said, ‘This will change everything.’” Fast forward to 2023, and Liang launched DeepSeek, hiring top AI engineers straight from his hedge fund. Using profits from the hedge fund High-Flyer, he built a team that not only understood AI but also mastered the infrastructure behind it. By 2024, DeepSeek had developed R1, a language model that industry insiders describe as a direct challenge to every major AI player in the U.S. Unlike its American competitors, DeepSeek wasn’t interested in commercialization. It focused entirely on research, with Liang using his own money to fund the operation. “DeepSeek’s offices feel like a university lab,” said the Financial Times. Based in Beijing and Hangzhou, the lab employs some of the best AI minds in China, offering salaries that rival TikTok-owner ByteDance. Liang’s singular goal, according to the report, was to prove that China could innovate on the same level as the U.S., and now he has done it. The timing couldn’t have been more deliberate either. Liang’s release of the R1 model coincided with his appearance at a high-profile meeting in Beijing led by Li Qiang, China’s second most powerful politician. Liang was the only AI leader invited. Li told the entrepreneurs present to focus on breaking through key technologies — a clear nod to China’s ambition to outpace the U.S. in AI development. Something tells us US president Donald Trump is not too happy about that. Silicon Valley’s scramble to catch up American tech giants, caught off guard, are now scrambling to respond. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a $100 billion joint venture with Japan’s SoftBank, dubbed Stargate, aimed at building new AI infrastructure in the U.S. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s xAI is expanding its Colossus supercomputer, planning to deploy over one million GPUs to train its Grok AI models. Google, Meta, and Anthropic are also throwing billions into upgrading their computing clusters with Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips. But the U.S. companies have one major disadvantage: secrecy. For years, Silicon Valley has operated on a closed-door model, keeping AI breakthroughs locked behind proprietary systems. DeepSeek’s decision to make R1 open source has flipped that narrative. This has triggered a wave of panic in the U.S., where companies now face pressure to decide whether to follow DeepSeek’s lead. But there are also concerns about whether DeepSeek can maintain its momentum. Despite its success, the company’s resources are admittedly limited compared to U.S. giants. “They’ve built one of the largest computing clusters in China,” said a source familiar with the company. “But compared to what OpenAI and Google are building, it’s not enough. They’ll need to scale up if they want to keep up.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",AI|DeepSeek|OpenAI,EN,0,0,ASIA|ZRX|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-26 05:52:50

Ripple CEO Weighs In,https://timestabloid.com/will-xrp-be-in-the-u-s-crypto-reserve-ripple-ceo-weighs-in/,"Discussions surrounding the inclusion of XRP in a potential U.S. strategic digital asset reserve have gained momentum following an executive order signed by former President Donald Trump. This order, introduced just days into his presidency, seeks to establish a comprehensive framework for digital asset regulation while exploring the concept of a national digital asset stockpile . Executive Order Sparks Debate The executive order directs the formation of a Presidential Working Group dedicated to assessing the future of digital assets within the United States. According to Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, the group’s focus extends beyond regulatory clarity to include the potential establishment of a strategic digital asset reserve. Initial speculation suggested that such a reserve would primarily feature Bitcoin. However, recent discussions have expanded the scope to consider other assets, including XRP. Scott Melker, host of The Wolf of All Streets Podcast, also hinted at this development. Reports indicate that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was among the crypto executives who recently met with President Trump. This interaction has further fueled speculation about XRP’s potential role in the proposed reserve. Criticism from Bitcoin Maximalists The idea of diversifying the reserve has not been universally accepted. Pierre Rochard, Vice President of Research at Riot Platforms, opposed XRP’s inclusion. He claimed Ripple and XRP pose the biggest threat to a Bitcoin-based reserve, accusing Ripple of lobbying to block a Bitcoin-exclusive reserve while advancing its CBDC initiatives. Rochard argued the administration initially aimed to make Bitcoin the foundation of a national reserve, but Ripple’s lobbying undermines this goal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Stance on Digital Asset Diversification Replying to Rochard, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse dismissed claims that the company lobbying is at odds with the administration’s goals. Instead, Ripple’s engagement with policymakers is to foster innovation and support American companies. Unless you are choosing to ignore the core tenants of the POTUS campaign (which aggressively supports American companies and technologies), our efforts are actually INCREASING the likelihood of a crypto strategic reserve (which includes bitcoin) happening. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 23, 2025 One community member shared a video where Garlinghouse suggested that a digital asset reserve should not be limited to Bitcoin but adopt a diversified approach. Other Experts Weigh In Vet (@Vet_X0), a validator on the XRP Ledger, also weighed in, stating that Rochard and people like him are the true obstacles to the crypto reserve, as they fail to see the benefits of the broader crypto industry for society. A report from the New York Post supported this perspective, suggesting that the administration might prioritize American-developed assets such as XRP, Solana, and USDC in its plans. Meanwhile, criticisms from the Bitcoin community continue to emerge, with some alleging that Ripple’s financial contributions to political initiatives have influenced policy decisions. However, this view was recently debunked by a former Ripple employee, who explained the reasons for Ripple’s financial involvement in politics.

With trends like Arctic Pablo’s mystical adventures and innovative projects like Notcoin and Dogs, the crypto space is buzzing with excitement. Arctic Pablo’s presale, in particular, is already making waves, boasting an impressive ROI and a narrative-driven investment approach that has captured the hearts of Gen Z and Millennials alike. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the top crypto that’s redefining the meme coin space. From Arctic Pablo’s mythological journey to Notcoin’s tech-driven tokenomics and Dogs’ community-first approach, we’ll uncover why these projects deserve your attention. Let’s explore how Arctic Pablo, the star of the current presale, brings adventure and ROI together like never before. Arctic Pablo: The Mystical Explorer Redefining the Top Crypto Presale In the frozen expanse of the Arctic, Arctic Pablo isn’t just any adventurer; he’s a legend in the making. Guided by a mythical map, Pablo embarks on a journey across hidden locations, uncovering treasures that promise wealth and wonder. The $APC coin isn’t just a currency—it’s a ticket to join this epic adventure. What makes Arctic Pablo unique is its location-based presale model. Instead of traditional stages, the presale moves with Pablo as he ventures to new realms. Currently, Arctic Pablo is in the El Dorado location, where $APC is priced at just $0.000038. With a final presale price of $0.0008 and a launch price of $0.008, early investors stand to gain an ROI of 20,000% by the time the token lists. The presale has already raised over $440,000 in just 15 days. This pace, coupled with the weekly token burns, ensures that $APC remains a hot commodity. Investors who act now can secure their share before Pablo’s next stop, the Glacier Grove. With no fixed timeline for each location, Pablo’s journey is unpredictable, adding an element of excitement to the presale. Combine this with a 66% APY staking program, and the rewards are undeniable. Staking allows investors to grow their holdings while becoming active participants in Arctic Pablo’s journey, fostering community engagement and long-term value. Arctic Pablo isn’t just a coin; it’s an experience. Its deflationary model, driven by weekly burns, ensures scarcity and value growth. The ecosystem is built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering low fees and high scalability. The presale’s unique storytelling, combined with its ROI potential, makes Arctic Pablo a standout in the top crypto presale landscape. Notcoin: The Tech-Powered Challenger While Arctic Pablo captivates with its narrative-driven approach, Notcoin takes a different route—it’s all about tech and utility. Positioned as the “anti-meme” coin, Notcoin appeals to those looking for a serious, tech-focused project in the crypto space. At its core, Notcoin aims to provide real-world solutions through blockchain technology. Unlike many meme coins, it emphasizes transparency and functionality. Built on Ethereum, Notcoin boasts an advanced smart contract system that facilitates secure, fast, and cost-effective transactions. Its primary goal is to simplify blockchain adoption for businesses and individuals, making it a go-to choice for those seeking practicality. Notcoin’s tokenomics further set it apart. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens, its distribution ensures sustainability and fairness. Fifty percent of the supply is allocated to community rewards, fostering long-term engagement. The remaining tokens are divided between liquidity pools, development, and marketing, ensuring the project’s growth and stability. Dogs: The Community-Driven Meme Coin Rounding out this trio is Dogs, a meme coin that takes community engagement to the next level. Inspired by the internet’s love for dog memes, Dogs leverages this universal appeal to create a token that’s fun, relatable, and highly engaging. Dogs’ strength lies in its community-first approach. From the outset, the project has prioritized transparency and inclusivity. Its development team frequently interacts with the community, hosting AMAs and voting sessions to ensure that every voice is heard. This level of engagement fosters trust and loyalty, making Dogs a standout in the crowded meme coin market. The tokenomics of Dogs are designed to reward holders and encourage long-term commitment. With a total supply of 500 billion tokens, the project employs a deflationary model similar to Arctic Pablo’s. Weekly token burns reduce the circulating supply, increasing scarcity and boosting value. Additionally, Dogs offers a staking program with an impressive APY, allowing investors to grow their holdings while supporting the ecosystem. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo, Notcoin, and Dogs represent unique opportunities in the ever-expanding crypto market. While each project has its strengths, Arctic Pablo stands out as the top crypto presale. Its adventurous narrative, location-based presale model, and staggering ROI potential make it a must-watch for investors. If you’re ready to join the journey, there’s no better time than now. With Arctic Pablo’s current location offering $APC at $0.000038, the window to secure life-changing gains is closing fast. Don’t miss out on the chance to turn a modest investment into a fortune. Join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now and be part of an epic adventure that bridges myth and reality.

Remittix (RTX) , an under-the-radar altcoin , is now attracting a lot of attention. Early investors are already getting notable returns as they have seen over 80% ROIs in just three weeks. Is it the creative approach to cross-border payments, the modern technology, or something far more promising that is resulting in the quick growth? Read on to discover how Remittix is quickly rising to be a major rival in the crypto market, surpassing Ethereum and Cardano. Ethereum (ETH) Displays Resilience Amid Market Swings Over the past week, the Ethereum price has exhibited notable growth, climbing by more than 2% despite some very noticeable swings. The Ethereum price chart shows that the altcoin has been facing a struggle between buyers and sellers by consolidating between $3,540 and $3,120. Although the week closed on a good note, the last month showed a somewhat bearish trend as the Ethereum price dropped by less than 1% among notable volatility. After a resistance level of $3,700, the Ethereum price fell to the $3,000 support zone; nevertheless, it quickly recovered ground and exceeded $3,200. Ethereum (ETH) is among the top altcoins traders looking for good prospects in the crypto market. Moreover, Ethereum (ETH) still has a strong bullish mood among its community even though it is almost 32% below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,891. Driven by the altcoin’s strong foundations and technical strength, analysts remain confident about a probable retest of its ATH this year. Though the Momentum Oscillator displays warnings with sell signals , indicators like the MACD and Moving Averages are pointing to buy chances on the Ethereum price chart . Cardano (ADA) Prepares For a Notable Growth Though the Cardano price has slightly dropped over 3% this past week, the swings reveal a more complex picture. The Cardano price chart shows that the altcoin has been between $1.18 to $0.95, exhibiting a period of volatility and possible buildup. The preceding month showed a more bullish trend despite this temporary fall as the Cardano price jumped over 10%, showing 8.52% price volatility and 18 green days out of 30. Cardano (ADA) is one of the promising altcoins to watch for traders and investors given its solid performance and the very positive attitude of the community. Looking forward, a convincing Cardano price prediction supports hope about its near-term direction. Analysts think the altcoin might revisit its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10 within this year, a possible milestone that has sparked ADA interest once more. Moreover, a 2025 Cardano price prediction points to the altcoin perhaps trading within a broad range between $0.99 and $5.10. Cardano (ADA) is still a promising asset with technical indicators showing the potential for long-term growth.

XRP is approaching the end of a triangle pattern, which typically indicates that a decision point is near. The market must now decide which direction to take as XRP is currently stuck in the range of $3.08-$3.14. The price is also down by more than 2 percent on the weekly chart. Elliott Wave Analysis for XRP Using Elliott Wave analysis, a popular sentiment-based method for predicting market movements, analysts anticipate higher prices for XRP in the near future . However, this does not guarantee that the breakout will be upwards right away. There could be a small dip before a rise, but as long as any pullbacks are corrective in nature (slow, overlapping movements), the longer-term trend remains bullish. These corrections are expected to hold above key support levels, particularly the $2.52 level. Key Support and Resistance Levels The triangle pattern on XRP’s chart completed on January 13th, marking the end of the current consolidation phase. From an Elliot Wave perspective, this could signal the beginning of a larger five-wave move to the upside. The critical support level to watch is $2.52; a break below this could signal a shift in the market’s direction, introducing more uncertainty. A decisive break below this support would suggest a potential deeper correction. On the upside, if XRP successfully breaks through resistance, the next target levels to watch are around $4.20 and eventually the $5 mark. These Fibonacci extension levels will give us an indication of the price movement in the coming weeks. With the triangle formation nearing completion, a breakout is expected soon, but it might take some time to materialize. Volume tends to be lower on weekends, so it’s possible the price could dance around key support levels until more decisive moves occur early next week.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-26 06:19:16

Kamala Sucks (KAMASUCK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because KAMASUCK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Kamala Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Kamala Sucks could become the next viral memecoin. Kamala Sucks launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Kamala Sucks on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kamala Sucks by entering its contract address (CA) – KFywQqjGH3WdEQ4hR42oYQ17v4nSePom6AjyJc8TNfU – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like KAMASUCK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 06:24:00

This follows a consistent bullish trend and the anticipation of unlocking 2% of its total supply in February. But while SUI impresses, another contender, Nebula Stride (NST), is emerging as a game-changer poised to revolutionize how we think about crypto and real-world assets. SUI’s Recent Price Performance and Developments SUI is at the forefront with the introduction of Mystceti V2 consensus and Remora scaling, innovations set to revolutionize blockchain efficiency by 2025. These developments aim to process up to 120,000 transactions per second, positioning SUI as a direct competitor to Solana. Additionally, privacy enhancements through zero-knowledge proofs are on the horizon, promising a more secure user experience. The market has responded positively, with SUI hitting a new all-time high in stablecoins, up 25.78% within the last 30 days. SUI’s upward trajectory is hard to ignore. Source: @x0mario Additionally, from $0.90 in August 2024 to an all-time high of $5.35 on Jan 06, 2025, the token has grown exponentially. SUI has also achieved a significant milestone with 50 million accounts, solidifying its position as a leading Layer-1 blockchain. The Total Value Locked (TVL) in Sui’s ecosystem soared to $1.75 billion by December 2024, showcasing increased investor confidence and activity. Despite retracing slightly to the current value of $4.17, recent charts show SUI printing a Hidden Bullish Divergence on the RSI, suggesting potential for continued upward movement. Analysts on X have noted SUI’s price movement mirroring Bitcoin’s during the 2017 bull market, indicating strong bullish momentum. However, while SUI celebrates its achievements, another cryptocurrency, Nebula Stride (NST), is poised to potentially eclipse these gains with its unique proposition: Nebula Stride (NST): Bridging the Gap Between Crypto and Real-World Assets Nebula Stride (NST) is transforming the blockchain landscape by allowing fractional ownership of tangible assets like real estate, art, and commodities. This opens up a market previously inaccessible to the average investor, potentially fueling massive adoption and price surges for NST. Emerging as one of the top RWA tokens and early-stage cryptocurrencies , NST is priced at a mere $0.02, offering a low entry barrier with significant upside potential as the tokenization of real-world assets gains traction. The platform’s focus on user-friendly infrastructure and tangible asset investment could lead to high returns for early investors. NST supports both institutional and individual investors through a robust ecosystem that includes asset management tools, educational platforms, and microloans. This inclusivity broadens its appeal, aiming to create one of the pioneers in the RWA sector. Nebula Stride (NST) Tokenomics Why NST Could Outshine SUI While SUI excels in blockchain performance, NST’s focus on RWAs gives it a unique edge. Here’s why: Broader appeal : NST’s integration with real-world assets attracts a diverse audience, including traditional investors seeking exposure to tokenized assets. Mass adoption potential: By simplifying access to high-value investments, NST can drive widespread adoption beyond the crypto community. Market disruption: Tokenizing RWAs could disrupt traditional investment sectors, unlocking new opportunities for both individual and institutional investors. Tangible utility: Unlike SUI, which primarily enhances blockchain efficiency, NST offers a direct connection to the physical economy, fostering stability and long-term growth, as one of the best new cryptocurrencies to invest in . Final Thoughts: The Road Ahead for SUI and Nebula Strides SUI’s developments in technology and expanding ecosystem, position it as a strong contender in the blockchain arena. Nevertheless, Nebula Stride’s pioneering approach of tokenizing real-world assets makes it a significant competitor for future leadership. Thanks to its affordable entry cost, adaptable infrastructure, and practical uses, NST is set to not only support but possibly surpass SUI in the cryptocurrency arena. As the industry evolves, both SUI and NST demonstrate the immense potential of blockchain technology. While SUI sets new standards for performance and scalability, NST’s focus on bridging digital and physical assets could redefine the crypto space. Investors should keep a close eye on both projects as they navigate the exciting and rapidly changing world of blockchain innovation.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/software-engineer-to-xrp-holders-things-about-to-happen-heres-why/,"The XRP community recently took note of an unusual market trend highlighted by Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode), a crypto expert active on X. Van Code shared an image of the XRP/USDT order book, emphasizing the minimal sell-side activity. He described this situation as “calm before the storm” and expressed confidence in significant developments for XRP holders. In all my years follow #XRP I have never seen an order book with so little sellers. I see this as calm before the storm. Things about to happen in my opinion. Exiting times my fellow HODLERS pic.twitter.com/gy0Ypr7jnh — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) January 23, 2025 Observations on the Order Book The shared order book reveals a striking imbalance between buy and sell orders, with 57.92% representing bids and only 42.08% attributed to asks. Notably, the sell orders are concentrated at higher price points, such as $3.2, $3.3, and $3.4. This scarcity of active sellers is unusual within the XRP market, which typically experiences greater activity on both sides. The absence of substantial sell pressure suggests that current holders are optimistic and potentially expecting higher prices soon. The bid side, however, appears robust, with significant buy interest at key levels like $3.1 and $3.0. This demand indicates market participants are eager to accumulate XRP, possibly reinforcing the sentiment that the asset may soon experience volatility or a directional breakout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Dynamics and Community Reactions Van Code’s observation quickly drew engagement from the XRP community. XRP currently shows many bullish signals, as another well-known analyst recently described a “ calm before the storm ” through technical analysis patterns. However, one commenter cautioned that exchanges could exploit the situation if traders rely heavily on leveraged positions. “If too many traders are long and using leverage, exchanges may capitalize on the volatility,” he wrote, alluding to the potential for sudden market reversals. In response, Van Code highlighted the profit model of exchanges, stating, “Exchanges don’t make money on price action.” He noted that exchanges make money based on the transaction volume. His remarks emphasized the role of market activity, rather than direction, in generating revenue for both exchanges and asset managers. He advised participants to focus on accumulating and holding chosen cryptocurrencies rather than reacting to market speculation. The reduced sell-side activity, as evidenced in the order book, could indicate broader market confidence in XRP. It may also reflect a wait-and-see approach among sellers, who are potentially anticipating more favorable conditions before exiting their positions. XRP is currently trading at $3.1. This trend aligns with heightened optimism from analysts and the broader community surrounding XRP’s long-term prospects.

President Donald Tru mp. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Inde x took a heavy hit, dropping 1.7% since last Friday. This is its sharpest weekly fall since July 2023, when the Federal Reserve ended a prolonged period of monetary tightening. While the president has consistently threatened major trade partners like Canada and Mexico, actual executive orders to enforce tariffs remain nonexistent. Instead, Trump has instructed the Treasury and Commerce departments to assess trade relations and provide a report by April 1. Investors brace for a dollar sell-off Currency traders are now starting to act on what they’ve been predicting for months: the dollar is overvalued and set for a correction. Matthew Hornbach, Morgan Stanley’s head of macro strategy, said investors were cautious about selling the dollar so early in Trump’s term, unsure whether he would push through tariffs immediately. Now that Trump has held back on action, traders feel freer to move. “The further we get into President Trump’s second term, the more comfortable investors are becoming with expressing their views. The dollar is rich, interest rates are high, and both are ripe for a correction,” Hornbach said. The correction has already benefited other major currencies. The British pound surged more than 2.5% against the dollar this week, buoyed by strong manufacturing and services data out of the UK. The euro also had a strong showing, recording its best weekly performance since 2023. Much of Trump’s trade rhetoric has focused on North American trading partners like Canada and Mexico, leaving the eurozone out of his direct crosshairs — for now. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley strategists warn that the tide against the dollar is building. The bank has one of the most bearish outlooks on the greenback among those surveyed by Bloomberg. “While dollar bulls are loud and active, there’s a quieter but substantial group of investors ready to bet against the currency,” they said. The data backs up this sentiment. Futures data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) shows traders holding $34.6 billion worth of bullish dollar positions, the highest since 2019. But with the dollar gauge up just 3% since Trump’s November victory, there are risks of a major reversal. But the dollar has gained over 2% in the past quarter against currencies like the Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, and Chinese yuan. However, many traders have opted to focus more on Trump’s actions—or lack thereof—rather than his words.

AI Predicts Steep Rally for EcoChain Crypto Price in 2025,https://timestabloid.com/from-0-006-to-5-ai-predicts-steep-rally-for-ecochain-crypto/,"EcoChain ($ECO) has emerged as one of the most promising crypto platforms due to its focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and sustainability. Experts and AI-driven projections anticipate the $ECO token value rising dramatically from its presale price of $0.01 to $5 by 2025. EcoChain Presale Success Raises $1.8 Million The EcoChain presale has already made waves, raising $1.8 million within its early stages. The $ECO presale price increases by 2% daily, allowing investors to earn up to 500% before the public listing. This innovative approach has attracted widespread attention from the crypto community, positioning EcoChain as a leader in combining blockchain technology with environmental impact. The platform enables tokenization of tangible assets such as real estate, commodities, and renewable energy projects, offering fractional ownership opportunities to investors. EcoChain’s mission to merge financial growth with ecological responsibility has drawn interest from retail and institutional investors alike, making it a standout in the competitive RWA space. AI Projections: $5 Price Target by 2025 Artificial intelligence analysis predicts a meteoric rise in $ECO’s value, with the token potentially reaching $5 by 2025. This anticipated growth aligns with the exponential expansion of the RWA sector, as tokenization of real-world assets gains momentum. EcoChain’s focus on sustainability and tokenization positions it as a trailblazer, capturing both first-mover advantages and long-term growth potential. Post-presale, $ECO is expected to be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, boosting liquidity and attracting global investors. The platform has also seen increased whale activity, with on-chain data showing significant investments—a clear indicator of confidence in EcoChain’s long-term vision. Engaging Community and Transparent Tokenomics EcoChain has cultivated a passionate community driven by its sustainability mission and transparent tokenomics. The platform’s $ECO token supply of 8.1 billion is allocated to ensure accessibility and long-term growth. EcoChain is transforming the crypto landscape by combining sustainability with the tokenization of real-world assets. With a successful presale, innovative features, and AI-driven growth projections, $ECO is poised to become a top-performing token by 2025. As the RWA market grows and investors seek platforms that combine financial rewards with ecological impact, EcoChain is leading the charge toward a greener, wealthier future.

If You’re Looking for Top Cryptos for Significant Returns, Qubetics Could Your Answer!",https://thecoinrise.com/missed-the-bitcoin-boom-if-youre-looking-for-top-cryptos-for-significant-returns-qubetics-could-your-answer/,"Let’s be real for a second: if you’re just diving into the world of cryptocurrency now, you might feel like you’ve missed out on Bitcoin. For years, Bitcoin has been the heavyweight champion of the crypto world, with early adopters raking in massive returns. Remember when Bitcoin was trading for under $1,000? Those were the days when if you’d just put a couple hundred bucks in, you’d be sitting on a small fortune today. But now, Bitcoin’s price is hovering in the $30,000 range, and while it’s still a solid investment, the chances of seeing those jaw-dropping, multi-thousand percent returns are looking pretty slim. So, what’s a crypto enthusiast to do now? Is the ship sailed on making big crypto gains? Absolutely not. There’s a fresh new project that could be your ticket to the next big wave in the crypto space: Qubetics . Qubetics ($TICS) is positioning itself as one of the Top Cryptos for Significant Returns , and it’s offering something that Bitcoin, despite all its glory, doesn’t: real-world utility. While Bitcoin helped introduce the world to the power of blockchain, Qubetics is taking it to the next level by enabling the tokenization of real-world assets. This means that everything from real estate to luxury goods can be represented as digital tokens on the blockchain—creating an entirely new marketplace for these assets. So, if you’re looking for that next big opportunity to take advantage of crypto’s potential, keep reading. Qubetics is offering something new, and the timing couldn’t be better. Bitcoin: The OG Crypto – But Has Its Time Passed? Ah, Bitcoin. The pioneer of the entire crypto movement. If you were one of the lucky ones who bought Bitcoin early, you’re probably sitting pretty by now. It’s often referred to as “digital gold,” and for good reason. Bitcoin’s rise from a few bucks to over $68,000 at its peak in 2021 cemented its status as a revolutionary asset. The problem? If you’re trying to get in now, the insane gains of yesteryear are pretty much out of reach. Sure, Bitcoin’s a solid bet for long-term investment, and it’s a great way to hedge against inflation or economic instability, but the wild, exponential growth we saw early on is harder to come by in 2025. Analysts expect Bitcoin’s price to continue rising, with some predicting it could hit $70,000 or more by the end of 2025, depending on how the market plays out. But let’s be honest here—if you’re looking to make quick, life-changing returns, Bitcoin’s no longer the low-risk, high-reward play it once was. It’s established. It’s stable. And in the world of crypto, that can be a bit of a double-edged sword. While Bitcoin will always have its place as the “king of crypto,” the high-flying days of sky-high percentage gains seem to be behind it. So, what does that mean for you as an investor? Don’t give up on crypto just yet. The next big opportunity might already be here, and its name is Qubetics. Qubetics: Tokenizing Real-World Assets for the Win This is where Qubetics comes into play. While Bitcoin has been great for what it is—primarily a store of value—Qubetics is doing something entirely different. It’s setting out to revolutionize the way real-world assets are bought, sold, and traded, with a focus on asset tokenization. Simply put, Qubetics is turning tangible, real-world assets like real estate, fine art, collectibles, and even business shares into digital tokens that can be traded on the blockchain. Imagine you’re a real estate investor looking to diversify your portfolio. Traditionally, this would involve buying entire properties, dealing with banks, handling paperwork, and all the red tape that comes with it. With Qubetics , you can tokenize your property and sell fractionalized ownership on the blockchain. This means you could own a part of a luxury home or office building without having to shell out millions upfront. You could buy a fraction of a Picasso or share in a rare vintage car. It opens up new investment opportunities for people who traditionally couldn’t afford high-value assets, democratizing access to wealth-building opportunities. Qubetics doesn’t just make it easier to invest in real-world assets; it also makes the process more efficient and secure. Blockchain technology eliminates the need for middlemen and offers unparalleled transparency. Everything is traceable, secure, and fast—no more waiting weeks or months for paperwork or dealing with unreliable third parties. Whether you’re a small business owner looking to unlock capital by tokenizing your intellectual property or an individual looking to invest in a new asset class, Qubetics provides the tools to make it happen. So, why should you care? Well, the Qubetics presale has been a huge success. Over $435 million $TICS tokens have been sold so far to more than 15,700 holders, raising over $10.4 million. And it’s still going. In the 18th stage of its presale, $TICS is priced at just $0.0551 per token, but experts believe the price could skyrocket once the mainnet launches. Why Qubetics Could Be the Next Big Crypto Opportunity Here’s the thing: Bitcoin has done its job in terms of proving the concept of digital currency, but it’s not the next big opportunity if you’re looking for mind-blowing returns. Qubetics is where the real action is right now. Why? Because it’s addressing real-world problems that Bitcoin simply can’t solve. Tokenizing assets gives everyday investors the chance to own parts of high-value goods that were previously inaccessible. For example, let’s say you’re a fan of luxury watches, and you want to invest in a rare timepiece. In the traditional world, that could cost you tens of thousands of dollars. But with Qubetics , you could own a fraction of that luxury watch by buying a token, giving you exposure to the high-end watch market without needing to break the bank. The truth is, Qubetics is offering a whole new level of financial inclusion. If you’re tired of watching the rich get richer by investing in things like real estate, rare art, or exclusive collectibles, Qubetics gives you the opportunity to get in on the action. The ability to tokenize assets opens up countless investment avenues for people from all walks of life. And let’s not forget the presale—if you can get in now while $TICS is still at a low price, the potential return on investment could be massive. Conclusion: The Future is Here with Qubetics If you’ve been holding off on jumping into the crypto space because you missed Bitcoin’s meteoric rise, don’t sweat it. Bitcoin will always have its place, but the real opportunity now lies with projects like Qubetics that are setting the stage for the next wave of innovation. By tokenizing real-world assets, Qubetics is solving a problem that Bitcoin didn’t address—and offering massive upside potential for investors in the process. The presale for Qubetics is still ongoing, and with predictions of $TICS reaching $5, $10, or even $15 after the mainnet launch, now is the time to get in. If you want to be part of one of the Top Cryptos for Significant Returns in 2025 , Qubetics is your best bet. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers—invest in the future of tokenized assets today.

Solana’s SOL: The High-Speed Crypto Powering Tomorrow’s Apps Solana is a blockchain platform built for speed and scalability. It offers a solid foundation for decentralized applications, or dapps, placing it alongside competitors like Ethereum and Cardano. What sets Solana apart is its design focused on faster transactions and flexible development options. Developers can use multiple programming languages, making it more accessible. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. SOL is essential for transactions, running special programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The potential of SOL is tied to Solana’s unique technology. Unlike some platforms, Solana doesn’t rely on sharding or extra layers to handle more transactions. Instead, it uses its powerful network to scale naturally. This makes it attractive to developers and investors who need a platform that can handle high activity. In the current market, where speed and capacity matter, SOL stands out. It offers an alternative to coins like Ethereum, which can be slower due to heavy use. With more projects looking for fast and scalable solutions, SOL could become more valuable and see significant growth. Trump’s Meme Coin Surges to $15 Billion: A New Chapter in Crypto? Donald Trump’s latest venture into cryptocurrency has taken the market by storm with the launch of his new meme coin, $TRUMP. Released on Friday, the coin’s market capitalization soared to $9 billion, peaking at over $15 billion early Sunday. Hosted on the Solana blockchain, $TRUMP saw its price jump by more than 300% within a day. At its peak, the coin briefly surpassed $75, marking a significant moment as Trump prepares for his upcoming inauguration. The rapid rise of $TRUMP reflects the growing interest in meme coins and their potential in today’s market. With an initial supply of 200 million coins, developers plan to expand the total supply to 1 billion over the next three years. This strategy mirrors the approaches of other successful cryptocurrencies. While the coin is affiliated with the Trump Organization, its website notes that $TRUMP is “not intended to be” an investment opportunity or a security, and it distances itself from political ties. In a market where meme coins like Dogecoin have captured the imagination of investors, $TRUMP could ride the wave of popularity. Its association with a well-known figure might make it attractive, but as always, potential buyers should be cautious and stay informed. MELANIA Coin Soars 53%: A New Crypto Sensation Emerges MELANIA Coin burst onto the crypto scene with a 53% surge just hours after launch. Starting at $11.36, it quickly reached a market cap over $1.6 billion, entering the top 100 cryptocurrencies. With a total supply of 1 billion coins, MELANIA emphasizes that it has no ties to politics or governments. The coin’s distribution involves the team (35%), community (20%), reserves (20%), public sales (15%), and liquidity (10%). Committed to transparency, the project has a 13-month full vesting period. Investors are seeing huge returns. According to Lookonchain, one investor used two wallets and earned $47.5 million from MELANIA Coin. The first wallet spent 2,100 SOL ($560,000) to buy 1.52 million MELANIA, then sold them for 46,453 SOL ($11.5 million), making an $11 million profit. The second wallet bought 3.84 million MELANIA with 800,000 USDC, sold half for 16.45 million USDC, and kept the rest worth over $20 million, totaling a profit of $36.5 million. In a market eager for new opportunities, MELANIA Coin’s rapid rise and focus on transparency might attract investors looking for the next big thing. Conclusion While SOL, TRUMP, and MELANIA coins show promise, XYZVerse stands out as the pioneering sports memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth in the current bull run.

Binance Coin, Ripple Or Remittix?",https://timestabloid.com/which-of-these-crypto-assets-will-make-you-rich-in-2025-and-why/,"Finding the top crypto investments 2025 is crucial for many traders, and three names often come up: Binance Coin, Ripple, and Remittix. Each token has die-hard fans and unique perks, but which is set for the biggest returns? Some say Binance Coin benefits from exchange backing, while others praise Ripple for streamlining global finance. Meanwhile, a rising contender called Remittix aims to beat them both by solving everyday money-transfer problems. Below, we see how they compare and why Remittix might be the top performer. Binance Coin: Exchange Powerhouse Launched by the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance Coin (BNB) has grown popular for trading discounts and DeFi access. Recently, Binance Coin completed its 30th quarterly burn, removing 1.6 million tokens from circulation. This scarcity could drive future value, though daily moves show it’s up +0.63% over 24 hours but down -5.06% for the week and -2.76% for the month. Some traders label Binance Coin a staple holding. Its ties to a high-traffic exchange keep volume steady, and many still consider it among the top crypto investments 2025. Yet new projects, like Remittix, offer unique features that might lure investors away if they promise faster gains. While BNB remains a household name, innovation in other tokens means it won’t be an uncontested king forever. Ripple: Banking Connections Praised for quick cross-border transactions, Ripple (XRP) boasts partnerships with major financial institutions. Over the last month, Ripple rose +39.77%, though it dipped -2.36% this week. Daily changes show a +4.25% uptick, hinting at ongoing market interest. Many supporters see it as a prime choice for DeFi growth, securing a spot among the top crypto investments by 2025. Yet tokens like Remittix could offer a strong alternative if they cater more effectively to everyday users. Ripple does well at targeting banks, but smaller businesses and freelancers might prefer simpler, cheaper solutions. If these groups flock to upstart projects, Ripple (XRP) might face stiffer competition. Still, it remains a heavyweight, thanks to strong brand recognition and a well-established network. Remittix: Poised To Outperform While Binance Coin and Ripple focus on large-scale adoption, Remittix zeroes in on affordable transfers for regular people and small businesses. Investors note that Remittix (RTX) could disrupt the sector by cutting remittance fees and wait times. This real-world utility might push Remittix above older coins tied to corporate deals. Many now rank it among the top crypto investments 2025 for its ease of use. Because Remittix offers fast, low-cost services, it’s quickly becoming a favorite. Observers say Remittix (RTX) could surpass even big names if mass adoption keeps rising. Unlike other tokens that depend on hype, Remittix fixes real user problems. This practical angle fuels hopes it will claim the spotlight soon, potentially outdoing both Binance Coin and Ripple in daily usage. Conclusion Whether you’re drawn to the exchange clout of Binance Coin (BNB) or the financial links of Ripple (XRP), it’s clear fresh projects like Remittix (RTX) can shake up the field. Each one promises major returns, but many investors see Remittix as a real standout. By slashing fees and simplifying cross-border transactions, it could deliver bigger gains than established tokens. For those seeking the top crypto investments 2025, Remittix may well be the one to watch. Ready to explore Remittix further?

Hitler Musk (HITMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HITMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Hitler Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Hitler Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Hitler Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Hitler Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Hitler Musk by entering its contract address (CA) – GB5uSMr95szepTSfj6sbJHFxMaBHwwyBzUY6dPAWZCCH – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HITMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 07:04:00

The cryptocurrency currently appears to be in a ranging phase, with no decisive movements above or below key resistance and support levels. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, “XRP is simply ranging, and it’s best to wait for the yellow 21 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) to align with the price” This indicates a period of market consolidation, where traders are waiting for more clarity before committing to major positions. #XRP – Daily Time Frame Analysis – Noise Time: #XRP is simply ranging, and it's best to wait for the yellow 21 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) to align with the price.

Invalidation… pic.twitter.com/kcBBC97roH — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 24, 2025 Critical Levels to Monitor EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis highlights several important price levels for XRP. The key resistance level lies at $3.40, with the analyst noting that a daily close above this price would serve as an “invalidation point,” shifting the overall market outlook toward a bullish trend. On the downside, the analyst identified potential support levels at $2.83 and $2.50, where a temporary price dip could occur before buyers step in. The analyst emphasizes that a wick down to $2.50 is “normal” during this market behavior, especially as XRP seeks equilibrium. Furthermore, the current price action suggests a close interaction with the 21-day EMA, a dynamic support and resistance indicator. Once this moving average aligns with the price, it could kickstart a price rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Where is XRP Going Next? The analysis reflects the uncertainty in the market as XRP attempts to stabilize following a period of volatility. Multiple analysts expect a massive breakout from the current market position, with one notable analyst recently setting an $8 target . XRP is currently trading at $3.1, and although it has fallen over 2.5% from yesterday, it is still up over 42% from last month. The digital asset recently rose to $3.39, a multi-year high reached on January 16. Another well-known analyst shared a detailed analysis that could send XRP to $4 . Reaching this target would decisively confirm the breakout above $3.4 that EGRAG CRYPTO outlined, and also breach its all-time high of $3.84. The importance of the $3.40 resistance level cannot be overstated, as surpassing it would likely bring renewed bullish momentum and attract increased investor interest. This breakout would confirm the asset’s momentum and pave the way for a further climb. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

However, it lacks the structured growth trajectory and clear utility that BTFD showcases, which could be a deciding factor for serious investors. The core appeal of Dogwifhat lies in its vibrant and active community. This coin thrives on social media engagement and grassroots marketing campaigns, which have helped it gain traction in a crowded market. Its followers are known for their enthusiasm and collective efforts in promoting WIF across various platforms, creating a sense of camaraderie and belonging among holders. Dogwifhat’s development team has also been key in fostering this strong community bond. They regularly engage with users, provide updates, and host events that encourage participation and investment. While Dogwifhat may not yet offer the extensive utility or high-profile partnerships seen in some other meme coins, its community-focused approach provides a solid foundation for potential growth and sustainability in the volatile crypto market. Why did this coin make it to this list? Dogwifhat made it to this list for its community-driven approach and the sheer enthusiasm of its followers. Yet, when stacked against BTFD’s structured economic strategies and higher earning potential, it’s clear why discerning investors might lean towards BTFD for long-term gains. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends , it’s evident that BTFD Coin not only leads the pack with its innovative features and solid investment potential but also sets a new standard for what meme coins can achieve. As BTFD prepares for its listing, the window for getting in on this presale is closing fast. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity; don’t let this chance to be part of something revolutionary slip away.

Ripple (XRP), which has been accused of similar allegations, stands out. Following US President Donald Trump’s speeches implying that US-based cryptocurrencies are in an advantageous position, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, according to unproven claims, advocates the idea of a reserve in the US that includes many altcoins instead of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, and opposes the idea of a reserve consisting of a single BTC. Related News: Big Whale Sells Big on This Altcoin, Making Huge Profits However, the White House recently announced the creation of a working group on this issue and used the term “Digital Asset Stock” instead of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. In an interesting development, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino also released a statement on the subject. Ardoino claimed that the same companies that attacked Bitcoin (there is also an allusion to Ripple here) also attacked Tether. The Tether CEO said that the companies behind these attacks are becoming more apparent these days. He added that there are more companies than those accused so far. *This is not investment advice.

39518663,https://nulltx.com/?p=141066,1737878087,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Uniswap’s UNI Token Holds Steady Amidst Market Volatility and Mixed Sentiment,https://nulltx.com/uniswaps-uni-token-holds-steady-amidst-market-volatility-and-mixed-sentiment/,"Uniswap’s UNI token has remained remarkably steady over the past 24 hours, holding at a stable price of $12.17. This price reflects an almost zen moment of calm in what is otherwise a tumbling crypto market. In recent days, the broader crypto space has taken a beating. The BTC price dropped 4.08% in the past week, and ether (ETH) decreased by 7.47%. Yet, despite this clear downward trend in the overall crypto market, the Uniswap token continues to seemingly hold its own, with relatively little price movement over the past few days. The recent progress surrounding Uniswap has brought a mix of upbeat and worrisome tidings. Uniswap was in the spotlight when it went for a $35 million airdrop of its governance token, UNI , ahead of what should have been a low-key announcement about the protocol’s next (fourth) major version [Source: manilatimes.net ]. Uniswap had said that the new version would be launching on something called “X,” which turned out to be the not-so-undisclosed platform formerly known as Twitter, but also serves as a public billboard in the event of a major protocol overhaul. This moment of excitement for early participants and potential new users of Uniswap was then marred by an analysis that (presumably) Uniswap didn’t want to be associated with: AMBCrypto published a piece suggesting that bad price action meant that UNI was forming “bearish patterns” on the daily charts, and could suffer a 20% drop “in the near future” [Source: AMBCrypto.com ]. Market Analysis An in-depth analysis of UNI from a technical perspective reveals that the token’s price has been spinning within a narrow range and forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart. This pattern usually indicates a disagreement between buyers and sellers, with the possible price breakout in either direction. Our analysis of trading volume suggests that trader indecision is at an all-time high for this token, as volume has been steadily declining since the end of May. Two key price levels to watch in the next few days: support at $11.50 and resistance at $13.00. A clear breakout (up or down) is needed before any new trades can be taken. Until then, the price is likely to continue this pattern of low volatility. Social and on-chain analysis further refine our understanding of UNI’s market dynamics. The social sentiment metrics suggest a community full of mixed emotions. It is certainly not a boring time for the Uniswap community, given the wild range of feelings members express about it. Some definitely express frustration about the platform’s listing policies, with a not insignificant number complaining to and about a variety of entities associated with the platform. Directly above their heads are Layer 2 projects (ZKSync, StarkWare, etc.), which users are incredibly excited about. Network activity has been at all-time highs, comprised mainly of direct user interactions with the Uniswap platform and Layer 2 project testnets. Meanwhile, the core development team has been grinding away during the intense bear market, pushing through an incredible number of protocol upgrades and just overall goodness. The price is rising, and there are a number of reasons that we feel compelled to get into those next. Market Outlook In the larger market context, UNI’s performance is closely linked to the overall sentiment in the DeFi sector. The next catalysts, like the V4 rollout and the official X announcement, could be what tips things over into a bullish breakout. However, there are clouds on the horizon—a couple of regulatory issues seem to be brewing, of a kind that seems to happen every couple of months. Could this be another opportunity to buy UNI at a lower price? Projections for future UNI price seem cautiously optimistic—more a sentiment of “We should be okay, as long as things stay like this.” Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

33767162,[object Object],1737878420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Price Hits Double Bottom To Trigger Massive Rally, Here’s The First Target",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-hits-double-bottom/,"The Dogecoin price has experienced significant growth, maintaining a steady climb within a well-defined “Channel Up” pattern since December 2024. Recent technical indicators and price action suggest that Dogecoin may be getting ready for a major price rally. A crypto analyst has confirmed this bullish outlook, forecasting Dogecoin’s rise to its first target of $0.432. Double Bottom Confirms Dogecoin Price Bullish Set-Up ‘TradingShot,’ a crypto analyst on TradingView, has forecasted a new bullish target for Dogecoin, expecting the meme coin to rally above the $0.4325 target. According to the market expert, the Dogecoin price has bounced off the higher lows trendline of its Channel Up pattern, forming a distinct Double Bottom pattern . The analyst shared a price chart, highlighting that the meme coin was initially trading within the Channel Up pattern since it hit a price bottom on December 20, 2024. Typically, a double bottom pattern forms near the higher lows trendline, signaling a potential for upward reversals. The TradingView analyst also revealed that a unique buy signal always emerges whenever the Dogecoin price makes a Double Bottom near the higher lows trendline of the pattern. Furthermore, each time this Double Bottom pattern occurs, the 4-hour Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays two consecutive bullish crosses. Previously, Dogecoin formed two Double Bottom and MACDs, triggering a significant price rally in both cases. At the time, the price of the meme coin skyrocketed to the 2.618 Fibonacci extension level, marking new highs. Based on this past trend, the analyst believes that the meme coin could experience a similar rally as its price action appears to repeat the same pattern for the third time. The TradingView expert’s technical analysis also highlights the role of other moving averages, underscoring that the 4-hour MA50 acts as a crucial support area while the MA200 underscores a broader trend. Currently, the Dogecoin price is rebounding off the Double Bottom near the trend line, and the analyst projects a short-term rally toward $0.4325, aligning with the 2.618 Fibonacci extension level. Historical Patterns To Trigger Price Rally Above $20 In another X post , crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade projected a massive price surge for Dogecoin in this bull market. The analyst has based his optimistic forecast on historical trends where DOGE experienced bull rallies after surpassing a previous “candle body high” in 2017 and 2021. At the time, the meme coin had jumped by over 3,000% and 8,000% respectively. Drawing from historical trends, Trader Tardigrade predicts that if Dogecoin follows a similar trend pattern, its price could rally to $8.32 before skyrocketing to an ultimate target of $20.68.

Blockchain “de-anonymizing” platform Arkham reports that World Liberty Financial boosted its crypto holdings after making large Ethereum ( ETH ) and Tron ( TRX ) purchases late on Friday. “DONALD TRUMP’S PROJECT WORLD LIBERTY FI BUYS AND STAKES 4,700 ETH ($15 million), PURCHASES $2.65 MILLION TRX AS TRUMP PLEDGES TO DEVELOP NATIONAL DIGITAL ASSET STOCKPILE.” Source: Arkham/X The project recently joined the top 0.1% of all Ethereum stakers with its aggressive ETH accumulation spree. On the day of Trump’s inauguration, World Liberty Financial bought $47 million worth of ETH, $47 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin ( wBTC ), $4.7 million worth of Aave ( AAVE ), $4.7 million worth of Chainlink ( LINK ), $4.7 million worth of Tron ( TRX ) and $4.7 million worth of Ethena ( ENA ). While accumulating crypto assets, President Trump has been working on legislation to accommodate the industry and reverse the hostile regulatory climate created by the previous presidential administration. The president recently signed an executive order to study the creation of a strategic national Bitcoin ( BTC ) and crypto stockpile, as well as prevent the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) while boosting stablecoin adoption. The order, entitled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” states the administration supports the “responsible growth” and use of digital assets and blockchain technology. The order revokes former President Biden’s digital asset directives and creates a new working group that will coordinate and propose clear rules of the road for cryptocurrencies within six months. “The Working Group shall evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile and propose criteria for establishing such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
