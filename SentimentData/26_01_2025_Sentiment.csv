These Metrics Show Why It Might Never Happen,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/an-altcoin-season-in-sight/,"Bitcoin has yet to relinquish its dominance in this market cycle, leaving many investors still holding onto hopes for the arrival of an altcoin season. Still, there remains a possibility that an altcoin rally might never come to fruition this season, given the recent market trends this cycle. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez echoed this perspective in a recent post on X, claiming that an altcoin season may never return. His observation sheds light on the change in market dynamics and the significant shifts that have occurred since previous alt seasons. Why AltSeason Might Never Happen An altcoin season is defined by a period of rapid price surges across a wide range of altcoins. Furthermore, an altcoin season is characterized by investors cashing out their Bitcoin profits and pouring them into altcoins. This period is always accompanied by social media hype and FOMO from crypto investors as they rush in to get in on the action. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 However, current market conditions have seen the crypto industry grow from its early days into a new market with a close relationship with investors in the traditional finance sector. Additionally, the altcoin market has expanded dramatically since the last major bull run in 2021, and you could argue that it has become somewhat oversaturated. Martinez highlighted a startling statistic: over 36.4 million altcoins are now in circulation. This is a dramatic increase compared to fewer than 3,000 altcoins during the 2017-2018 altcoin season and an even smaller pool of fewer than 500 in the 2013-2014 bull market cycle. The sheer scale of this supply explosion has fundamentally altered the cryptocurrency landscape, diluting attention and capital among an overwhelming number of assets. This oversaturation means that achieving widespread price surges across altcoins has become a far more challenging proposition than in previous market cycles. Furthermore, many of these altcoins have unclear use cases or poor fundamentals and only divert attention from specific altcoins with strong utility. Could The Era Of Altcoin Seasons Be Over? The concept of an altcoin season may be a relic of a less crowded market. Ethereum, the largest altcoin, has largely failed to perform up to expectations this cycle. Known as the primary driver of past altcoin seasons, Ethereum has struggled to gain momentum for over a year, even as other altcoins like Solana, XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin continue to push to multi-year highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dominance And Altcoin Season: What The Sudden Volatility Means For The Market If Ethereum, with its established dominance and utility, cannot deliver, it raises serious questions about the potential of other altcoins to rally. Instead, individual altcoins with strong fundamentals or unique propositions could continue to thrive while the rest of the market remains stagnant. At the time of writing, Coinmarketcap’s dominance data shows that Bitcoin commands 57.9% of the total crypto market cap, increasing by 0.69% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum is steadily losing ground, with its dominance dropping by 1.07% over the same period, now accounting for just 11.1% of the overall market.

BlockDAG , a pioneering blockchain initiative that integrates Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with conventional blockchain traits, stands out as one of the key projects to watch by 2025. As its presale nears the impressive $200 million milestone, the enthusiasm for this transformative venture is clearly justified. Could BlockDAG Climb from $0.0248 to $1? Exploring the Potential for a 3932% Return BDAG coins are currently priced at a mere $0.0248 in the ongoing 27th presale batch. Market analysts anticipate that by 2025, BlockDAG’s valuation might reach $1, presenting an opportunity for a remarkable 3932% ROI. Initial holders have already enjoyed significant profits, with gains up to 2380% from the first batch. For those yet to participate, this is a critical time to get involved before this chance passes. BlockDAG is more than just promising numbers; it represents a bold vision for the future of blockchain technology. Its advanced hybrid framework offers unmatched speed, scalability, and security, appealing to both developers and corporate sectors. Equipped to support Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), BlockDAG enables a robust platform for innovative decentralized applications (dApps). Significant CEX Listings Scheduled for 2025: Key to BDAG’s Valuation Surge A distinct aspect of BlockDAG’s strategy is its detailed roadmap for 2025. Alongside the highly anticipated mainnet debut, there are plans for significant listings on prominent centralized exchanges (CEXs). These listings are poised to greatly boost BDAG’s liquidity and visibility, potentially elevating its market value substantially. Traditionally, tokens that launch on major CEXs see notable increases in value as they attract heightened buyer interest. BlockDAG is strategically positioned to capitalize on this trend, offering early adopters a unique opportunity to be part of a groundbreaking endeavor. The presale itself reflects the project’s expanding influence, with nearly $200 million already secured. This early funding from institutional traders, tech developers, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts signals strong market confidence in BlockDAG’s ability to innovate within the industry. For potential traders, the current presale batch presents a prime buying opportunity. As the presale progresses, prices are expected to rise, making the present the optimal moment to buy at a favorable rate. With the mainnet launch and upcoming CEX listings, BDAG’s price trajectory is set for significant growth. Seize the Opportunity: BDAG Poised for Substantial Growth BlockDAG’s trajectory is defined not just by its ambitions but also by its proven commitment to scalability, speed, and developer friendliness, ensuring its continued relevance in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. As it plans to introduce several hackathons and integrate over 200 Web3 projects, BlockDAG is reinforcing its reputation as a forward-looking platform. In a market where opportunities can disappear as quickly as they emerge, BlockDAG represents a fleeting chance for considerable returns. With the presale almost reaching $200 million and major exchange launches planned for 2025, the window for early buying is narrowing. Don’t miss out on being part of one of the most significant cryptocurrency success stories of the decade—secure your BDAG coins today.

In a recent post, Kiyosaki shared his positive view regarding the crypto and emphasized Gresham’s Law and Metcalfe’s Law as the core principles that support his view. Robert Kiyosaki Explains Why Bitcoin Outshines The US Dollar in Today’s Economy Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the Rich Dad Poor Dad, recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) about Bitcoin becoming bigger than the US dollar. He said that according to Gresham’s Law bad money chases good money out of circulation. Kiyosaki noted that fiat currencies, including the US dollar, have lost credibility due to inflation and excessive money printing. He said that in this case, Bitcoin, gold and silver are the “good money.” According to Kiyosaki, such assets are turning into the safest places for investing, given that people no longer trust paper currencies. He also pointed out that people have been using physical metals like gold and silver as a means of accepting value for a long time, and now digital currency has been accepted. Robert Kiyosaki added, “Good money gold and silver have been hiding from FAKE US dollars for years. Today, Gold, silver, and Bitcoin are forcing the fake US dollar into hiding.” Notably, Binance founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao and “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki have encouraged buying Bitcoin during dips amid rising FOMO. CZ advised responsible investing due to Bitcoin’s volatility, while Kiyosaki emphasized BTC potential for wealth creation, urging individuals to buy for long-term gains. BTC Network Power Using Metcalfe’s Law Kiyosaki also highlighted Metcalfe’s Law, which states that the value of a network grows exponentially with its number of users. He explained that Bitcoin’s expanding network of users and global adoption contributes to its increasing value and influence. This principle has been a key driver in Bitcoin rise as a decentralized asset. He compared Bitcoin’s network growth to established systems like franchise networks and large corporations, which gain power from their scale. Kiyosaki emphasized that BTC decentralized nature allows individuals and businesses to leverage its growing network for transactions and value storage. However, recently, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon reiterated his belief in the US dollar’s dominance, dismissing Bitcoin as a speculative asset and not a threat to global financial stability. While the bank explores blockchain technology for operational efficiency, it remains restricted from directly owning Bitcoin due to regulations. Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver Are Emerging as Alternatives to the US Dollar As the US dollar faces declining global trust, Kiyosaki pointed out that Bitcoin, gold, and silver are challenging its dominance. He noted that the over-reliance on fiat currencies has led to economic instability, prompting individuals to seek alternatives. Bitcoin network, with its limited supply and decentralized nature, is increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation. Kiyosaki emphasized that the transition to these assets is a natural response to the erosion of purchasing power in fiat currencies. He reiterated his belief that tangible assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin network offer a more reliable store of value during uncertain times. Rich Dad Poor Dad author also warned of an ongoing giant market crash fueled by reckless monetary policies and financial mismanagement. He attributed this economic downturn to government decisions to print excessive amounts of money, which devalues fiat currencies. The author reaffirmed his bullish outlook on Bitcoin, gold, and silver, urging individuals to focus on accumulating these assets. According to Kiyosaki, they represent the best tools for preserving wealth and stability during the current economic climate.

The protocol focused on what Ethereum could achieve if the developers and the broader community shunned some ideologies. The research discussed ways to accelerate Ethereum’s development to maximize its resources. Paradigm on Ethereum Shipping Issues According to the firm, the network ships updates slowly, at one yearly upgrade. It is noted that this is not ideal and is masked by two major concepts it identified as “inertia” and “the need to ossify.” He emphasized the latter reason as the belief that Ethereum may only maintain its decentralization if changes to the core chain are slow. Paradigm pointed out that Ethereum is often torn between the need to balance values and innovation. However, the investment giant noted that Ethereum has yet to maximize its technical capabilities to start placing so much emphasis on values. “We think ossification is too risky for Ethereum. It prevents Ethereum from staying competitive as a platform, as applications and users move toward more centralized alternatives. Ossification also poses its own centralization risks to Ethereum.” As Paradigm also noted, there are ways Ethereum can overcome these challenges. One is encouraging client teams to have a say, not a veto, in development affairs. In addition, the firm said it would allocate more resources to R&D and improve the All Core Devs process. Paradigm’s Role In Improving Ethereum According to the firm, it contributes to Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), drawing on its status as researchers and engineers. Beyond this, it also assists the ETH growth with data analysis and code, focusing on EIP-7862. This EIP, as noted, does not conflict with the rest of the protocol’s roadmap. Beyond this, the research firm said it developed Reth as an SDK to help with Ethereum’s experimentation. It said it is building and supporting foundational tooling to cap its role within the ecosystem. These include but are not limited to Foundary, Alloy, and Solar. To summarize its latest take, Paradigm believes the protocol can perform better if it ships faster. Expected Upgrades and Price Outlook Based on its recent call from all core developers, key stakeholders agreed on a mid-March launch timeline for the Pectra upgrade . This upgrade has been in the works for months and will enhance usability for both developers and ushers. Ultimately, experts believe the changes within the ecosystem will positively impact prices. At the time of writing, ETH was changing hands for $3,341.89, up by 0.48% in 24 hours. Per the long-term projection offered by Bitwise, the ETH price could hit $7,000 this year.

The past year has seen many crypto enthusiasts make a fortune. Bitcoin has soared over 220% from its 2024 price of $46,000 to all-time highs of $109,000, and many new cryptocurrencies have followed suit. Cardano and Ripple holders have been on the favorable end of the crypto market in recent years, with the latter benefiting from a favorable verdict in its battle with the SEC. With the hype in the market reaching record highs, investors are seeking better opportunities to maximize their investments. 1Fuel, which has delivered a 1,700% return for its Stage 1 presale investors , has become a major name on the radar. XRP’s 2025 started on a high note XRP’s success story has been nothing short of spectacular. A victory against the SEC, new all-time highs, and talks of an XRP ETF have all put Ripple in the spotlight this year. Its unique proposition as a one-stop shop for low-cost cross-border payments may be debated, but its momentum and positive market sentiment cannot be denied. The question on everyone’s mind is: After this SEC victory, what’s next for Ripple? With the price approaching overbought territory, investors are carefully weighing their options for the next big coin to buy. 1Fuel has already emerged as a clear option. With no multi-wallet concerns, seamless cross-chain interoperability, and a strong, unified community, it stands out as a top contender. What next after Cardano hits $1 Soaring to $1.30 was a landmark achievement for Cardano. The almost three-year wait to reach $1 was worth it, but the question on everyone's mind is: What’s next? Cardano seems to need a catalyst to push higher, and the lack of one is evident in its price chart, which suggests a drop to the $0.55 zone is more likely. While chatter about a potential Cardano ETF is growing, it is unlikely to significantly move the needle. With nearly 10 other cryptocurrencies vying for an ETF, and Bitcoin and Ethereum firmly cementing their status as the leading cryptocurrencies, Cardano faces stiff competition. Cardano holders are now turning their attention to a cryptocurrency that doesn’t rely on an ETF, boasts cutting-edge technology, and prioritizes security and privacy 1Fuel ($OFT). Why the hype on 1Fuel 1Fuel is positioning itself as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency industry. With its disposable wallets and inbuilt mixers, privacy and ease of use are brought to the forefront as key focuses of the technology. However, privacy and ease are just the beginning. The 1Fuel platform integrates a wide range of features into one cohesive ecosystem. The goal isn’t simply to be another name in the crypto market but to redefine what cryptocurrencies stand for and drive global adoption. The hype surrounding 1Fuel is already evident in its presales. From a Stage 1 presale price of $0.01 to its current presale price of $0.17, investors are seeing significant gains. Many cryptocurrency analysts predict that 1Fuel could soar by as much as 50x after it lists on exchanges. The presale is underway, offering you the opportunity to secure 1Fuel ($OFT) at the lowest possible price.

Meow, Jupiter’s founder, shared the acquisition update with the community in a post on X. Notably, Moonshot is an app that enables the purchase of memecoins via Apple Pay. Strategic Acquisition to Enhance Memecoin Engagement According to Meow’s announcement, Jupiter has become the primary owner of Moonshot. Users can, therefore, look forward to Moonshot benefitting from the resources of Jupiter and an alignment of goals going forward. The acquisition could result in a unique blend of both entities, as Meow lauded and complimented the Moonshot team. The team is amongst the most innovative, driven group of people I have ever met,” he wrote in his post. This highlights that Moonshot’s team could add significant expertise and value to Jupiter. Industry stakeholders have suggested that the collaboration focuses on memes, digital culture, or humor-based projects. Moonshot’s Amazing Performance Notably, memecoins remain a viable way of engaging users in the crypto space. A clear example was the surprise launch of Donald Trump’s Official Trump (TRUMP) on January 18, 2025. The token immediately gained traction in crypto and beyond, with many raking in huge profits from the project. Interestingly, Moonshot’s popularity soared after the launch of TRUMP. Although it was launched in July 2024, Moonshot did not make much of a splash, remaining in the 309th position on the U.S. App Store ranking as of January 1, 2025. However, following the launch of TRUMP memecoin, Moonshot jumped to the top spot, buoyed by the sentiments. This saw Moonshot’s trading volume leap by approximately $400 million. This positive effect also rubbed off on Solana and pushed it to a new all-time high (ATH) of $294.33 on January 19. Jupiter’s Planned Airdrops and Ecosystem Growth Meanwhile, Jupiter has plans to carry out a major token airdrop worth $580 million this January. According to the announcement last month, it would distribute about 700 million tokens to stakers, users, and contributors in the community. Aside from using it as a loyalty reward program, the airdrop could also attract new users to the platform.

Why Crypto Traders are Crypto dumping Dogecoin (DOGE) at $0.40 Dogecoin (DOGE) price tumbled towards $0.35 on Saturday, January 25, down 20% within the 7-day timeframe. Market data analysis reveals key reasons DOGE traders are taking on a bearish outlook this week. Profit-Taking Following Trump’s Inauguration Leading up to President Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025, DOGE saw a significant rally, surging from $0.10 to $0.40—a 300% increase. This surge was largely driven by market optimism surrounding Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency stance and the appointment of Elon Musk to lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). The inauguration served as a catalyst for profit-taking, with many investors liquidating their positions to realize gains, contributing to the recent price decline. Dogecoin Price Action DOGE price has experienced a 20% decline over the past week, trading around $0.35 as of January 25, 2025. This downturn coincides with the introduction of new memecoins associated with President Donald Trump on the Solana blockchain.2. 2. Emergence of Trump’s Memecoins on Solana On January 18, 2025, President Trump announced the launch of the $TRUMP token on the Solana blockchain. The token quickly gained traction, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $10 billion shortly after its release. Trump Launches Official Memecoins, January 20 | Source: X.com The rapid ascent of $TRUMP and similar tokens has diverted investor attention and capital away from DOGE, leading to decreased demand and downward price pressure on Dogecoin. 3. Concerns Over Political Associations The establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) and its association with Dogecoin has introduced political considerations for investors. Some market participants are cautious about potential regulatory scrutiny or reputational risks stemming from the cryptocurrency’s perceived alignment with the current administration. Speculators hint Elon Musk could deploy Dogecoin for D.O.GE | Source: X.com Emphasizing this stance, after talks of Dogecoin logo on the official D.O.G.E website, speculations have emerged that Elon Musk might be considering untilzing the Dogecoin blockchain for some of the agency’s activity. This apprehension has led certain investors to reduce or exit their DOGE holdings, further contributing to the recent price decline. In summary, the combination of profit-taking post-inauguration, the rise of competing memecoins like $TRUMP, and concerns over political affiliations has collectively influenced Dogecoin’s recent market performance. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Forecast: Potential Drop to $0.31 Support Dogecoin price forecast chart show that the memecoin currently trades at $0.359, posting modest 2.53% intraday gain. However, the technical indicators suggest a potential bearish shift in the near term. The Keltner Channel highlights DOGE’s price struggling to reclaim the median band at $0.36, with the upper resistance at $0.42 remaining untested since the recent rejection. The Parabolic SAR indicators remain above the price action, signaling bearish momentum dominance. The recent 19.55% price drop over seven days reflects weakening buyer strength, as evidenced by declining volumes post-recovery. Dogecoin Price Forecast | DOGEUSD In a bullish scenario, DOGE would need to reclaim and sustain levels above $0.36 while breaking the upper Keltner Channel resistance near $0.42. A rise in RSI above 55.00 could signal renewed bullish momentum, driven by increased market interest. However, in a bearish case, DOGE risks breaking below immediate support at $0.35, with a potential drop toward the critical $0.31 support. A further RSI dip below 50.00 would confirm overselling pressure, while decreasing trading volumes support this outlook.

Currently in presale, Remittix has sold nearly 3 million tokens, bringing in approximately $6.2 million in total. Positioned to transform the crypto-to-fiat PayFi protocol, this token's growing appeal continues to attract more investors. Dogecoin's Price Surge Utilizing sophisticated AI models, analysts predict Dogecoin's price could reach $1 this year. CoinCodex, a well-known crypto prediction platform, anticipates that Dogecoin could achieve the $1 mark by the end of March 2025. The platform projects that DOGE could hit $1.04 by the end of the first quarter and reach $1.11 by April — a leap of over 215% from its current value. At this press time, Dogecoin is trading at 0.3558, reflecting a 1.0% increase in the past day. However, its performance in recent days has been underwhelming, with an 8.2% decline over the past week. Dogecoin's downturn coincided with the removal of Shiba Inu’s image from the newly launched D.O.G.E. website, created by the Department Of Government Efficiency. Although the site is unrelated to Dogecoin, its name caught the crypto community's attention due to its resemblance to DOGE. This removal also coincided with a significant drop in Dogecoin's trading volume, which decreased by 75%. If this bearish trend persists, RTX could quickly overtake DOGE. Bonk Overtaken by TRUMP Meanwhile, Bonk, a memecoin on the Solana blockchain, has experienced a more favorable price rally recently, with increases of 7.8% and 11.2% over the past week and 14 days respectively. However, its price remains down by 7.2% over the last month. Bonk enjoyed a remarkable surge late last year, reaching a new all-time high of $0.00005916 in November 2024. Bonk is currently trading at $0.00003114, showing a year-to-date growth of 196%. Its market cap stands at $2.3 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $389k. In the meantime, a newcomer in the crypto space, $TRUMP, has surpassed Bonk in market cap, tripling Bonk's figure as it reaches $6.92 billion. Analysts predict that RTX could perform even better upon launch, potentially overtaking Bonk's market cap within a week. Will RTX Surpass Dogecoin and Bonk? With mixed signals affecting Dogecoin's price and the $Trump token overtaking Bonk, analysts are very optimistic about RTX’s price outlook, seeing it as a potential standout in this bull run. Drawing parallels with the early success of Solana, experts believe this token could surpass Dogecoin and Bonk, providing investors with substantial returns. Remittix, the company behind the RTX token, is redefining international payments by merging blockchain technology with fiat transactions. Supporting around 50 cryptocurrencies, Remittix facilitates easy conversion to fiat currencies like USD and EUR, offering a swifter and more economical alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. With a straightforward flat-fee structure, Remittix ensures recipients receive the full amount sent without any hidden fees. Additionally, businesses can leverage the platform’s API for efficient international payroll, converting crypto payments into fiat and directly depositing funds into employees’ bank accounts, simplifying global operations and cutting costs. For transparency, Remittix emphasizes user control and security, removing third-party involvement in transactions. Audited by Solidproof and BlockSAFU, Remittix provides a dependable and trusted framework, with locked team tokens for three years to prevent insider sell-offs and boost investor confidence. Priced at $0.0311 during its presale, the RTX token presents a compelling investment opportunity for ambitious investors; with a limited supply of 1.5 billion tokens and predictions of up to 100x returns by 2025, Remittix is well-positioned to shake up the cross-border payments industry, outperforming Dogecoin and Bonk in terms of profit potential. What makes Remittix particularly notable is the strong investor support for the token. The Remittix presale has already raised $6.2 million, selling over 320 million tokens in total. Participants who joined early have experienced a 100% increase in their holdings, with analysts predicting the price to climb by 800% as the presale progresses.

Currently in its presale, Remittix has seen close to 3 million token sales, generating about $6.2 million in total. Set to revolutionize crypto-to-fiat PayFi protocol, this token’s appeal keeps investors increasing their holdings. Dogecoin's Price Rally Using advanced AI models, analysts forecast Dogecoin's price could reach $1 this year. According to CoinCodex’s prediction, the popular crypto prediction platform, Dogecoin, could hit the $1 milestone by the end of March 2025. The platform forecasts DOGE could attain the $1.04 milestone by the end of the first quarter and even reach $1.11 by April — an over 215% surge from its current price. As of this press, Dogecoin is trading at 0.3558, a 1.0% rise in the past day. However, its price has been far from impressive in recent days, down by 8.2% in the past week. Dogecoin's loss came at the time Shiba Inu’s image was removed from the newly launched D.O.G.E. website —created by the Department Of Government Efficiency. Interestingly, the website is unrelated to Dogecoin but its name garnered attention within the crypto community due to similarity to DOGE. This removal also marked a sharp decline in Dogecoin's trading volume, falling by 75%. If this bearish trend continues, RTX could overcome DOGE in no time. Bonk Loses First Place To TRUMP Meanwhile, Bonk, a Solana memecoin has seen a better price rally in the past few days, with 7.8% and 11.2% rise in the past week and 14 days respectively. However, its price is still down by 7.2% in the past one month. Meanwhile, Bonk had a beautiful run late last year, reaching a new all-time high at $0.00005916 in November 2024. Bonk currently trades at $0.00003114, marking a year-to-date growth of 196%. Bonk’s market cap currently stands at $2.3 billion, with 24 hours trading volume of $389k. As such, a new entrant in the crypto scene $TRUMP has now flipped Bonk in market cap, tripling Bonk’s as it reaches $6.92 Billion. Meanwhile, analysts project RTX to have even a better run when launch, which could see it also flip Bonk's market cap within a week. Can RTX Obliterate Dogecoin and Bonk? With mixed signals dominating Dogecoin's price and $Trump token flipping Bonk, analysts are overly bullish on RTX’s price prediction, a crypto token that could be the hallmark of this bull run. Citing numerous use cases with patterns mirroring the early days of Solana, analysts predict this token could obliterate Dogecoin and Bonk, giving investors monumental returns on their investment. Remittix, the platform behind the RTX token, is transforming international payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions. Supporting about 50 cryptocurrencies, Remittix enables seamless conversion to fiat currencies like USD and EUR.

Priced at $0.0311 during its presale the RTX token offers a promising investment opportunity for any ambitious investors; with a capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens and forecasts of up to 100x returns in 2025, Remittix is well-positioned to transform the cross-border payments sector, obliterating Dogecoin and Bonk in profit potential. What makes Remittix particularly impressive is the way investors are rallying around the token. The Remittix presale has already raised $6.2 million, selling over 320 million tokens in total.

This portends a 90-day restructuring plan into which the protocol appears to be entering. Those familiar with the situation say it has been catalyzed by fears of insolvency. While trading on the platform remains active, the associated token, $RUNE, has not been able to make headway and is down 30%. THORChain halts THORFi lending over insolvency fears, kicking off a 90-day restructuring plan. Trading stays active, but $RUNE is down 30%. This pause feels like a ‘bankruptcy freeze’ to avoid a liquidity crisis. Will they pull through? pic.twitter.com/GvDL01HGEn — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) January 24, 2025 THORFi Lending Halted: A Bankruptcy Freeze in Disguise? Numerous commentators have analogized the decision to stop THORFi lending with a “bankruptcy freeze,” a precautionary measure often taken to prevent a liquidity crisis. THORChain states that the pause allows it to deal with “some structural issues” within its THORFi lending services while it recalibrates the entirety of that operation. The lending service will not be available for three months, according to announcements made by THORChain and on the THORFi website. The financial health of the protocol has come under fire with the sudden suspension. Critics have even gone so far as to accuse it of insolvency. They have raised serious doubts about whether THORChain is able to meet its obligations and, if not, what that means for the growing number of users that rely on it. The situation is putting immense pressure on $RUNE, which has already lost nearly a third of its value over the past few days. Financial Troubles Cast a Shadow Over THORChain A decentralized liquidity protocol that enables cross-chain swaps, THORChain has for some time occupied a vital position within the DeFi sector. Recently, however, it has experienced some financial difficulties that have made some observers raise doubt about its future. A primary concern is whether the platform’s reserves are even sufficient to cover its obligations. Critics point to possible mismatches between the assets that the protocol holds and the liabilities tied to its lending services. If these gaps exist, they’re a ticking time bomb that could lead to significant, not to say catastrophic, liquidity issues. Compounding the problems is the steep drop in the value of $RUNE. As the protocol’s native token, $RUNE has a critical role in the THORChain ecosystem. It serves as a medium of exchange and collateral, underpinning the whole system. When a native token drops significantly in price, it impacts confidence in the system and the ability to attract and retain users. The trending cryptocurrencies getting the highest increases in discussion Friday include: Bitcoin $BTC : US President Trump has made an executive order regarding a national digital asset stockpile, which affects Bitcoin custody by banks. The order rescinds prior… pic.twitter.com/riWOR4400L — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 24, 2025 Market Reaction: $RUNE Takes a Hit The reaction of the market to the news has been quick and intense. The $RUNE price falling 30% clearly shows that investors are deeply concerned about THORChain’s financial stability. There is a clear decrease in both trading volume and confidence in the platform. When something like this happens, what we usually do in the writing community is pull back and look at the facts available to us before moving forward in the narrative. Even in this time of turmoil, THORChain trading proceeds apace. The platform has assured users that it will continue to operate core functions while it restructures. Increased activity on the RUNE token suggests that users are betting on RUNE’s replacement of asset pool balances to keep THORChain itself from stalling. Still, assurances and RUNE token activity haven’t quashed fears that pausing the lending feature signals deeper problems within the protocol. The 90-Day Restructuring Plan: A Path to Recovery? THORChain has announced a 90-day restructuring plan, and it’s a doozy. It’s probably the most significant step that THORChain could take for its platform and its users. Not much is known about the plan yet, but looking at the few details that are available—along with what we know about the impending hard fork—offers some insight into just what might be happening over the next three months. Although some see the restructuring as a necessary step toward recovery, others are skeptical. The platform’s financial position is so unclear that people are speculating up and down about the true extent of its problems. The next three months are going to be critical for THORChain—either it will establish itself as a functioning, sustainable platform, or it won’t. Implications for the Broader DeFi Ecosystem The problems that THORChain has encountered shine a light on the vulnerabilities that still exist in the DeFi ecosystem. Even though decentralized platforms are offering some new and innovative solutions to the kinds of problems that we face in the financial transaction space, they are not risk-free, particularly when it comes to liquidity management and other issues that are related to, or that fall under the umbrella of, market fluctuations. DeFi protocols should heed THORChain’s cautionary tale. They need to be well-planned and financially sound. They also need to be transparent so that users and investors—in this case, daring participants in decentralized finance—can make responsible decisions about the use of and investment in DeFi protocols. DeFi finance is real finance, with a real need for responsible participants. Conclusion: Uncertainty Ahead for THORChain The THORChain lending protocol has had to hit the brakes. It’s now not lending, but THORFi, in recent days, has been too uncertain for the team to go on with lending. And that’s obviously a turbulent situation for the team. It’s a challenge for the protocol and the team to navigate through allegations of insolvency. And when you walk into the allegations of insolvency, it certainly walks directly through user confidence and into the user experience. At this point, the main concentration is on $RUNE, which keeps taking the hits from the market’s uncertainty. As the plan to restructure the whole thing plays out, every set of eyes that can will be watching THORChain to see if it can pull off a restoration of trust and come up with a reaffirmation of its position as a key player in the DeFi space. Until then, the caution that it may have urged in the past is now, plainly, its better part. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While these established cryptocurrencies have experienced consistent growth, this emerging contender promises even more impressive returns, driven by its cutting-edge features and expanding user base. If you're searching for the top cryptocurrency investment today, this altcoin could be your ideal choice for achieving financial success! Solana (SOL) Displays Resilience Amidst Obstacles Solana's native token, SOL, has already increased by 34% this year, showing solid performance in 2025. Although maintaining a position above the $260 support level remains challenging, the token's price saw a 7% rise on January 22, reaching $263.54. The surge in meme coin trading, especially after the launch of the Official Trump (Trump) token on January 18, significantly contributed to this growth. While SOL may continue to ascend, surpassing the $280 mark might require more time. The token hit a high of $295 on January 19, but several indicators suggest difficulties ahead. For example, Solana's network fees plummeted by 67%, from $35.5 million on January 19 to $11.7 million on January 21. Typically, lower fees indicate reduced trading activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Raydium, Pump.fun, and Orca. Despite these declines, Solana's overall activity remains stronger than the previous week, reflecting the network's resilience. Analysts are closely monitoring SOL's progress as it could potentially break new records. For now, it serves as a reminder that while Solana is evolving, market dynamics can shift rapidly. Cardano's Path to $4: What Lies Ahead for ADA? Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.9711, with a decrease of 3.56% over the past 24 hours and 7.65% over the last week. However, there is a silver lining; ADA's 7.69% increase over the past month shows that it is maintaining its position at critical support levels. Analysts believe this could signal a potential price breakout in the future. Cryptocurrency expert Ali Martinez has observed an increase in daily active addresses on Cardano's network throughout January. This uptick in user activity is a positive sign of growth. Historically, when network engagement rises, prices often follow suit. ADA might be setting the stage for an upward trend here. Nonetheless, the journey isn’t entirely smooth. A ""death cross"" pattern on hourly charts suggests ADA could face more short-term losses. This occurs when two moving averages cross in a typical downward pattern. Additionally, many futures market traders are betting on a further decline in ADA, which could exert additional downward pressure. Despite these hurdles, Cardano's rapid growth and high user engagement point to promising times ahead. Will ADA reach the $4 mark? Only time will tell.

While these big names have seen steady growth, this rising star promises even bigger gains, thanks to its innovative features and growing community. If you're looking for the best coin to invest today, this altcoin might just be your best bet for success! Solana (SOL) Shows Strength Despite Challenges Rising 34% already this year, Solana's native token, SOL, has been performing nicely in 2025. Though it still challenges to keep above the $260 support level, the token's price rose by 7% on January 22 to reach $263.54. Excitement about meme coin trading, particularly following the release of the Official Trump (Trump) token on January 18, accounts for a great portion of this increase. Although SOL might rise further, breaking beyond $280 could take some time. The token peaked at $295 on January 19, but certain signs point to difficulties for it currently. For instance, from $35.5 million on January 19 to $11.7 million on January 21 Solana's network fees dropped by 67%. Usually, lower fees translate into less trading activity on dispersed exchanges (DEXs) such as Raydium, Pump.fun, and Orca. Solana's general activity stays better than last week even with these declines, indicating that the network is still robust. SOL's performance is under intense observation by analysts as it can potentially make another step toward record highs. For now, it reminds us that although Solana is developing, market conditions change fast. Cardano’s Journey to $4, What’s Next for ADA? With its price down 3.56% over the previous 24 hours and 7.65% over the past week, Cardano (ADA) is now trading at $0.9711. Still, it's not all bad news; ADA's last month's rise of 7.69% indicates that it is maintaining support at crucial levels. This might indicate, according to analysts, a future possible price breakout. Expert in cryptocurrencies Ali Martinez has seen a rise in daily active addresses of Cardano throughout January. More individuals are utilizing the network, a clear sign of expansion. Historically, when network activity rises like this, prices usually follow with rising motions. ADA might be laying the groundwork for a rise here. Still, there is not perfect sailing. On hourly charts, a ""death cross"" pattern points to ADA maybe suffering further temporary losses. This is the situation when two moving averages cross in typically declining fashion. Furthermore, a lot of futures market traders are predicting that ADA would decline much more, which would have further negative influence. Cardano's rapid expansion and high user engagement suggest better days ahead despite these obstacles. Is ADA still on course for $4? Time will prove.

39501712,https://nulltx.com/?p=141044,1737845619,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Analyzing TRUMP and MELANIA Token Metrics: Diverging Trends and Unique Behaviors,https://nulltx.com/analyzing-trump-and-melania-token-metrics-diverging-trends-and-unique-behaviors/,"The on-chain activity linked to the TRUMP ($TRUMP) and MELANIA ($MELANIA) tokens has piqued the interest of the crypto community. Named after two of today’s most visible public figures, these tokens have revealed some extremely distinct holder behaviors, with real and potential PNL (profit and loss) that have marked them as something of an asset. And while the world was watching last week, both the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens were making primetime headlines, with some developments that are horning in on the usually low-profile space of crypto asset custody. Wallet Creation Patterns: A Shared Origin A truly remarkable statistic is the considerable crossover between the creation of wallets and the acquisition of tokens. Almost half of the holders of $TRUMP and $MELANIA created their wallets on the same day they bought these tokens. This strange behavior indicates that a lot of really interested people were making their first purchases of crypto. We are clearly in the midst of a meme token moment, with these two tokens virally attracting a lot of new entrants to the ecosystem. Profitability Metrics: TRUMP Outpaces MELANIA In terms of profitability, $TRUMP traders appear to have done better than their $MELANIA counterparts. Most $TRUMP traders are at a net loss, but the number of traders making profits between $10,000 and $10 million exceeds the number of traders reporting losses of that same magnitude. This signals that while many $TRUMP traders have not succeeded in making profitable trades, a handful of them has managed to steer the token in a direction that allowed for some “cash in hand.” By contrast, reported $MELANIA traders had a significantly greater percentage of negative PNL outcomes. This difference highlights trading dynamics and market sentiment discrepancies between the two tokens. $MELANIA trading activities seem to have been more concentrated among a few participants, which may explain the heightened loss likelihood. Trading Behavior: A Tale of Two Sell-Offs The patterns of selling for $TRUMP and $MELANIA reveal further differences in trader behavior. For $TRUMP, the largest sell-offs seem to have happened on January 19, when the price was over $60. On this day alone, traders who sold $TRUMP (and only $TRUMP) sold tokens worth approximately $78 million. And this was on a day when the token was surging. So what were these traders up to? Well, if you ask the tokenomics team, they’ll say it was a wave of profit-taking among sellers who seemingly sought to capitalize on the surge. In contrast, $MELANIA’s sell-off was concentrated in time. The majority of $MELANIA tokens were sold within the first four hours after the token’s launch, with a total sell volume of around $98 million. This rapid liquidation suggests that many early buyers saw $MELANIA as an opportunity with a very short window for making gains, leading to quick profit-taking and a trading activity level that fell off a cliff after those first four hours. Token Distribution: A Concentration of Small Holders Another important factor is the distribution of token ownership among $TRUMP and $MELANIA holders. More than 80% of holders for both tokens own less than $1,000 worth of assets on Solana. This distribution highlights the pixels of these tokens, and it shows in really bold letters that the buy button is being pushed by main street—by retail investors, that is. And that’s not a bad thing; in fact, it’s seemingly a good thing for these Solana-based meme tokens. And it is certainly a much, much better thing than if these tokens were being owned and controlled by a handful of big players. TRUMP & MELANIA Onchain Metrics 1/6 Nearly half of $TRUMP and $MELANIA holders created their wallets on the same day they purchased the tokens. pic.twitter.com/7wtEOIM1W4 — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) January 24, 2025 What These Metrics Tell Us On-chain data for $TRUMP and $MELANIA reveals the unique dynamics of meme-token markets. Both tokens drew much interest from newcomers to the space, as evidenced by a ton of new wallets created to trade the assets. But what happened after the wallets were created didn’t look too similar for $TRUMP and $MELANIA, with their trading patterns and profitability outcomes diverging significantly in a very short amount of time. The data for $TRUMP indicates a kind of activity that is a mix of speculation and strategic profit-taking. Some traders have been trying to catch $TRUMP’s volatility and have done so quite successfully to secure them some very nice gains. $MELANIA, however, is showing us an entirely different picture. The concentrated sell-off occurring in $MELANIA alongside a pretty pronounced negative PNL outcome trend has us believing that $MELANIA isn’t giving its traders the kinds of favorable long-term holding conditions that we occasionally see in $TRUMP. Looking Ahead The crypto market is still developing, and the tokens that are created in its meme image, like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, are sure to remain a hot-button issue. While the viral nature of these assets can easily generate huge levels of interest and trading volumes, their speculative nature makes them risky investments. Meme tokens are held mostly by small-scale holders, and because these tokens are so volatile, caution is warranted. If you’re contemplating trading in or investing in meme tokens, attempting to understand the metrics and behind-the-scene workings of the market can yield useful insights into the nature of the potential risks and rewards that are part and parcel of this very speculative asset class. In the end, both $TRUMP and $MELANIA, through their rise and downfall, remind us of the speculative charm of meme tokens and their almost child-like appeal to the crypto community. They may not last or hold any real value, but if they can get people talking, thinking, and imagining, then they’ve done what all good tokens are supposed to do.

39501882,https://nulltx.com/?p=141048,1737845914,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Fresh Wallet 0x977 Makes Major $OM Moves: A Whale is on the Hunt?,https://nulltx.com/fresh-wallet-0x977-makes-major-om-moves-a-whale-is-on-the-hunt/,"In a development that has caught the attention of the crypto community, an active cryptocurrency wallet , 0x977, is making a name for itself in the market. Just 15 hours ago, it withdrew a staggering amount of over 616,610 $OM tokens (worth $2.23 million) from the cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. This withdrawal, mind you, was not an isolated event. In the past 36 hours, the wallet has amassed an aggressive total of $OM tokens, withdrawing a total of 1.859 million tokens from Binance. The average price for these tokens (according to the crypto news site Blockworks) was $3.627. That means the wallet has invested an estimated $6.74 million in those tokens. And as you might expect, lots of folks in the crypto community are now rightfully asking questions. A Coordinated Accumulation of $OM: Whale Behavior or a Bigger Play? The attention the crypto community has given the wallet’s latest activity is perhaps understandable. It is not every day, after all, that a newly active wallet makes such large-scale and obviously orchestrated withdrawals of such an obviously valuable asset—especially with the amount of $OM tokens involved. In fact, the sheer scale of these operations is more than enough to prompt a discussion about whether we are just looking at a single whale making a very profitable move or a part of some larger, whale-led scheme to depress token prices. What makes this specific whale behavior captivating is that it seems not to be a single occurrence. Other wallets have been seen not just being, well, wallet-ish, but also showing heightened activity and accumulating $OM tokens. Could this be a sign of something larger looming? Are these several wallets working together in some sort of financial choreography to raise the token’s price or, just maybe, to set the stage for a big, coordinated sell-off? This conduct is frequently observed among big market players who try to amass a position prior to making a significant move—usually either an upward price shift triggered by new developments or, conversely, a large-scale dumping operation. The fact that a single digital wallet has moved over $6 million worth of tokens in such a short time span is an ominous sign for the token’s price and could indicate that the price is about to go down. This activity has an outsized impact on the price of tokens. If other investors begin to note the substantial positions these wallets are establishing, we could see a real uptrend in interest and an uptick in buying pressure. Conversely, if the wallets doing all this aren’t doing it for fun and are looking to cash out, we could see a large sell-off that would have a dramatic effect on the price of $OM in the very near future. A Closer Look at $OM’s Recent Performance To completely grasp the influence of these latest whale moves, it’s necessary to assess the recent performance of $OM itself. This token has captured the attention of a lot of investors, and for a good reason. It has shown some serious price movement of late. Right now, the price of $OM sits at $3.627 per token, but the volume of those recent withdrawals suggests that a lot of people believe $OM has a lot more room to run. 0x977’s actions could indicate a belief in $OM’s possible upside. With $OM trading at about $3.627, this wallet’s buying signifies a heavy bet on the token. “Whales” like 0x977 usually don’t accumulate without a good reason. Given the kind of price volatility that $OM has already seen, not to mention the speculative nature of many meme coins and altcoins, these large-scale purchases could be setting up for a massive price movement in one direction or the other. Fresh Wallet 0x977 Goes Big on $OM A newly active wallet, 0x977, just made another significant move, withdrawing 616,610 #OM ($2.23M) from Binance 15 hours ago. pic.twitter.com/v8rfKLJQeM — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) January 25, 2025 Although no conclusive proof indicates that $OM will tread the same way as some of the more famous altcoins that have seen their prices explode, the recent attention and enthusiasm around it have traders watching closely. In recent days, and alongside the broader market uptick, $OM has seen a dramatic uptick in withdrawals and wallet activity. If this keeps up, pulls the price up with it, and fills back into the exchanges, it could trigger a nice little price rally. What’s Next for $OM? The main issue at hand is what’s next for $OM and the wallets that have been implicated. Historically, large holders, or whales, have bought up lots of crypto, made some big moves, and then our favorite tokens have moved in some kind of phase. Whether $OM and its wallets are going to make some kind of price phase next week remains a mystery. Investors in cryptocurrency will be observing attentively to determine if larger wallets enter the market and whether the price of $OM sees a remarkable uptick in the next few days. Given the level of activity around this token, it seems certain that $OM is poised to make a significant move in the near future—upwards, if demand continues to swell, and downwards, if the increased activity turns out to be the prelude to a substantial sell-off. To conclude, the activities of wallet 0x977 and others have infused fresh vigor into the $OM market. Although, whether this will amount to any significant price action or not will depend largely on the state of the macro markets, right now, with the macro being what it is, all eyes are on $OM and the whales playing a pivotal role in its price trajectory.

This new AI altcoin is generating whispers of unparalleled potential, and experts predict it could deliver a staggering 40,000% market edge. This coin’s unique integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology positions it as a game-changer, and its disruptive potential is drawing the attention of seasoned Ripple whales seeking the next exponential growth opportunity. What sets this AI altcoin, PCHAIN apart is its innovative use of AI, the Metaverse, and smart contracts to redefine the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. As Ripple whales quietly accumulate positions, their movements suggest confidence in this coin’s ability to redefine market dynamics. PCHAIN: The AI Altcoin In Question PCHAIN is the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-powered real estate tokenization platform. The token gives investors early access to the future of the multi-trillion-dollar real estate market. Unlike most traditional crypto assets that thrive on market sentiment, this innovative AI altcoin is backed by the number one asset class in the world. According to leading market experts, PCHAIN is positioned for a massive 40,000% rally, making it a potential top-gainer in the crypto space. Although an emerging AI altcoin, Ripple whales see huge potential in the asset, which is why these seasoned investors are quietly joining the ongoing PCHAIN presale. Why Ripple Whales Are Paying Attention Ripple whales , known for their strategic investments, are very good at spotting opportunities before they hit the mainstream. Their recent interest in this AI altcoin, PCHAIN, is based on several compelling factors: Unmatched Growth Potential A 40,000% market edge is not a figure to ignore.

Digitalization of Real World Assets This is a great revolution in the real estate sector As PropiChain plans to digitalize all real estate assets and transactions, ensuring trades on a secure blockchain network eradicating the need for physical documentations. In addition this further stretches to the fractional ownership of assets allowing small scale investors to buy, sell, own and manage properties in fractions rather than as a whole. Through this process, homeowners can access financing at lower interest rates, similar to traditional HELOCs, thereby providing a more accessible and affordable financing option for property owners. 3D Metaverse Property Exploration Metaverse implementation allows international investors to explore properties virtually from anywhere in the world creating more customized options of home, offices, and commercial spaces. Its immersive 3D environment creates a more dynamic and interactive experience that far surpasses traditional methods reducing uncertainty and enhancing confidence in purchase decisions. Its AR/VR capabilities also eradicate a geographical barrier that might be an hindrance during property exploration making real estate transactions more accessible and convenient, whether it’s discussing terms or even finalizing a deal. Conclusion With $2.2 million raised and stage two of the Token Presale in full swing, PropiChain is emerging as a game-changer in the crypto ecosystem.

This is a noticeable trend as the amount of BTC available on centralized exchanges (CEXs) continues to drop. HODLers are still HODLing, and we are seeing a shift to an even more favorable supply-and-demand picture for BTC, with long-term holders clearly becoming more and more reluctant to sell their coins. BTC recorded $800M in net outflows from exchanges this week, showing demand is still strong as supply available on CEXs continues to decrease pic.twitter.com/6raOgFV0Q1 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 25, 2025 Hodler Selling and the Rise of Bitcoin Dominance A large part of this story is the long-term holders of Bitcoin selling, especially after Donald Trump was elected in November 2024. Since then, they have moved an estimated 500,000 BTC, worth around $50 billion, from their addresses. The good part of this trend is that it seems to indicate a slowdown in selling activity. And what’s good about that is that it aligns with a growing sentiment that Bitcoin is once again primed for further upward momentum. Hodler selling accelerated since Trump's election, with 500k BTC (~$50B) leaving long-term holders' addresses since November pic.twitter.com/xcpmBFwSHe — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 24, 2025 The metric that tracks BTC’s share of the total cryptocurrency market, called Bitcoin dominance, is again on the upswing. After hitting an approximate low of 54% in December 2024, BTC dominance has surged back above 57% in January 2025, signaling a renewed interest in what is still the leading cryptocurrency. This behavior, in which BTC dominance casts a shadow well over $1 trillion, echoes what happened in the 2020 cycle, in which Bitcoin’s price also saw a wall-to-wall significant rally. Back then, BTC dominance bottomed out at around 60% in November 2020 before rallying to 69% in January 2021. #Bitcoin dominance is climbing again. After bottoming in December 2024 at ~54%, #BTC dominance has surged past 57% in January 2025. This mirrors the 2020 cycle, where $BTC dominance bottomed in Nov '20 (~60%), then rallied to 69% in Jan '21 before its decline:… pic.twitter.com/ekqfdoIach — glassnode (@glassnode) January 24, 2025 The current market dynamics are best understood in relation to the dominance of Bitcoin and its price. In the last cycle, as the price of BTC began to increase, dominance began to decrease. This decrease signaled not just a shift in the price of Bitcoin but also a shift in what investors were interested in purchasing. After the price of Bitcoin had reached new highs, investors appeared to have resumed moving toward riskier assets—the next-high-altcoin or whatever else promises strong returns when the market is believed to be bullish—after allegedly having crowdsourced the safety of the appearing-to-be stable, first-in-market asset. Key Support Level and the Spot ETF Inflows To keep its bullish price momentum, Bitcoin must hold above some key support levels. One of those is $97,877, where more than 101,000 BTC were amassed. Holding this level, the analysts say, is crucial for keeping the kind of “upward price pressure” on Bitcoin that has the potential to take it where it wants to go—up. The key support level for #Bitcoin is at $97,877, where more than 101,000 $BTC were accumulated. Holding above this level is crucial to sustaining the bullish momentum. pic.twitter.com/4kMR5ZtkWa — Ali (@ali_charts) January 25, 2025 On January 24, significant institutional interest was directed toward Bitcoin. For the seventh consecutive day, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw inflows, amassing a net total of $518 million over that time. One of the main drivers behind that surge in interest was Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), which alone saw a net inflow of $186 million. And by the time January 24 rolled around, the Bitcoin spot ETFs overall had a net asset value of an impressive $123.058 billion. The current state of affairs for the dominance of Bitcoin, along with the inflows of capital into Bitcoin ETFs, tells us that institutional investors are making some big bets on this leading digital asset. They’re betting on not just the sustained outperformance of Bitcoin but also its potential to become a go-to asset in times of crisis, which is what it looks set to become given the uncertain shape of international markets at the moment. On January 24, the total net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was $518 million, with net inflow for 7 consecutive days. The inflow of Fidelity ETF FBTC was $186 million. The current total net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETF is $123.058 billion. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG pic.twitter.com/ykhS8zZR5p — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 25, 2025 What’s Next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s rising dominance, ongoing institutional inflows, and dwindling exchange supply leave the cryptocurrency’s current outlook hard to dispute: it’s bullish. But there’s another reason for optimism, one that takes us to the end of 2024 and beyond. In addition, this asset’s sustained growth in the popularity of Bitcoin ETFs provides yet another support layer. The price of Bitcoin may keep enjoying the continued benefit of a steady stream of institutional capital as more people invest in these vehicles. Most people seem to believe that the price of Bitcoin will keep going up, but few if any, prices are set without some sort of “support level” being in place. Markets seem to be eyeing the $97,877 mark as a support level, and if Bitcoin can hold above that price, it’s “probably” going to keep moving up. To sum up, Bitcoin is reiterating its vigor as a market leader. The mixture of a blow-up in its dominance, a growing interest from institutions, and a supply that is all but nonexistent on exchanges makes the prospect of further price appreciation seem quite likely. Should the crucial support levels hold and inflows from institutions continue, it seems quite probable that we will see a new all-time high in 2025.

Priced at $0.0199 initially but rising to $0.0311, Remittix (RTX) is now hailed as the fastest-growing presale around. But what sets it apart from countless other tokens? Below, we’ll explore why thousands are grabbing RTX right now, how it tackles everyday payments and how it could reshape crypto usage for both newcomers and veterans alike. Remittix's Meteoric Growth: The Figures Speak for Themselves Presales often lose momentum if there's nothing substantial behind the buzz. However, Remittix has demonstrated it's more than just hype. Surpassing the $5 million mark, the altcoin has accelerated from an initial $0.0199 to $0.0311 within weeks. This rapid ascent indicates that Remittix attracts investors seeking a practical solution rather than another temporary meme coin craze. Interest has surged among those who recognize its potential for cross-border payments, especially as the global financial system seeks to reduce fees and transaction durations. Observers have commented that this swift fundraising surpasses many older tokens that took months to reach similar amounts. This surge in interest suggests that mainstream or utility-focused investors find Remittix appealing. Amidst a landscape dominated by meme tokens that fluctuate with online buzz, RTX presents a use case centered around streamlining remittances, a top priority for many freelancers, international travelers, and businesses. Harnessing the Potential of PayFi: Why Remittix Matters What is fueling the allure of Remittix? At its core is PayFi, a model that merges cryptocurrency with traditional banking. Instead of pushing users into complex DeFi protocols or the latest meme frenzy, Remittix (RTX) emphasizes enabling users to convert crypto to fiat within a day. By eliminating hidden costs and simplifying the process, it makes crypto accessible to everyday individuals who might otherwise find the technology daunting. Furthermore, Remittix provides businesses with a straightforward way to accept crypto payments, converting transactions to conventional currencies automatically. This ready-to-use approach allows merchants to join in without the hassle of multi-step conversions. Essentially, Remittix manages the backend, sparing users from navigating multiple platforms or worrying about token stability. This direct utility is likely why thousands are participating in the presale, focusing on real outcomes rather than mere hype. Stepping Away from the Meme Coin Chaos While meme coins have captured attention, the initial thrill has faded for many. Projects like Shiba Inu experienced significant rises and falls, as excitement waned, leaving many retail investors in limbo. Despite their impressive peaks, people are increasingly drawn to altcoins with solid plans that transcend jokes. This is where Remittix distinguishes itself. It's not about dog mascots or humorous references; it's about seamlessly integrating finance and cryptocurrency so even those not familiar with crypto can benefit. Analysts also suggest that as interest in purely meme-based tokens dwindles, utility tokens might experience more steady growth. Remittix (RTX) could exemplify this shift, combining the thrill of a new altcoin with a practical function that caters to a global market. Even if other tokens falter during market declines, a project offering everyday solutions often weathers price fluctuations more effectively. Looking Forward: Will Remittix Sustain Its Growth? Raising over $6 million in a presale is an impressive start, but the question remains: can Remittix deliver on its promise to enhance cross-border transactions and alleviate the burden of costly remittances? Critics caution that no cryptocurrency is infallible, especially in a fluctuating environment. However, enthusiastic supporters emphasize PayFi’s potential to capture a significant market, particularly in regions where expensive remittance services are prevalent. Moreover, the team behind Remittix asserts that ongoing efforts are being made to integrate the token with major crypto wallets and payment gateways. If these milestones are achieved swiftly and early adopters’ trust is secured, Remittix (RTX) could experience a steady rise as opposed to the typical pump-and-dump cycle seen in the altcoin market. Conclusion: A Potential Rising Star? While frenzied presales often indicate short-term excitement, Remittix stands out by addressing a global challenge: costly, slow cross-border payments. With over $6 million raised at an unprecedented pace and a price increase from $0.0199 to $0.0311, it attracts thousands looking for genuine solutions rather than memes. Should PayFi become widely adopted and mainstream businesses embrace the simplicity of instant crypto-to-fiat conversions, Remittix (RTX) could transcend the crypto bubble, potentially emerging as a preferred altcoin for practical financial applications.

Below, we’ll explore why thousands are grabbing RTX right now, how it tackles everyday payments and how it could reshape crypto usage for both newcomers and veterans alike. The Rapid Rise of Remittix: Numbers Don’t Lie Presales can fizzle out quickly if there’s no real substance behind the hype. So far, Remittix has proven it’s more than just talk. Surpassing $5 million raised, the altcoin soared past its early price of $0.0199 to $0.0311 all in a matter of weeks. This fast climb suggests Remittix appeals to investors craving a tangible solution, not another meme coin hype cycle. Demand has spiked among individuals who see real potential for cross-border payments, especially as global finance hunts for ways to cut down fees and transaction times. Some watchers note that this rapid fundraising outpaces many older tokens that took months to achieve similar figures. That jump in interest implies that mainstream or at least utility-minded backers find Remittix compelling. In a sea of meme-driven tokens that rise and fall with internet chatter, RTX offers a use case built around streamlining remittances, something high on the wish list of countless freelancers, global travelers and businesses. The Power of PayFi: Why Remittix Resonates So, what’s driving the Remittix appeal? The project revolves around PayFi, a model blending cryptocurrency with real-world banking. Rather than forcing users to navigate complicated DeFi protocols or chase meme mania, Remittix (RTX) focuses on letting people convert crypto to fiat within 24 hours. By removing hidden fees and complex steps, it opens crypto usage up to everyday folks who might otherwise find the technology baffling. Additionally, Remittix gives businesses an easier way to accept crypto payments, automatically settling transactions as traditional currencies. This plug-and-play approach allows merchants to hop on board without dealing with multi-step conversions. Essentially, Remittix handles the backend, sparing users from digging into multiple platforms or crossing their fingers for a stable token value. That direct utility may be what’s prompting thousands of people to join the presale, less hype, more tangible outcomes. A Welcome Break from Meme Overload While meme coins have commanded headlines, the novelty has worn thin for many. Projects like Shiba Inu soared, then tumbled, as hype drained away, leaving retail investors stuck or uncertain. Despite huge gains at their peak, people are now gravitating toward altcoins with a robust blueprint that goes beyond jokes. That’s where Remittix stands out. It’s not about dog mascots or comedic references; it’s about bridging finance and cryptocurrency so seamlessly that even non-crypto enthusiasts can benefit. Analysts also point out that as interest in purely meme-based tokens cools, utility tokens could see more stable growth. Remittix (RTX) may exemplify this trend, merging the excitement of a new altcoin with a real function that addresses a global market. Even if other tokens stumble during market downturns, a project offering everyday solutions often withstands price volatility better. The Road Ahead: Can Remittix Keep Momentum? Raising over $6 million in presale is a strong launchpad but the question remains: can Remittix fulfill its promise of driving cross-border transactions and dethroning the hassles of expensive remittances? Critics warn that no crypto is failproof, especially in an ever-changing landscape. That said, enthusiastic participants highlight PayFi’s potential to carve out a huge niche, especially in developing regions reliant on costly remittance services. Additionally, the team behind Remittix claims ongoing development to integrate the token with major crypto wallets and payment gateways. If it accomplishes those milestones quickly and fosters trust among early adopters Remittix (RTX) could see a steady climb rather than the pump-and-dump cycle so common in the altcoin scene. Conclusion: A Star in the Making? Frenzied presales often reflect short-lived excitement, but Remittix stands out by tackling a global issue: expensive, slow cross-border payments. With over $6 million raised at record pace and a price hike from $0.0199 to $0.0311, it’s drawing in thousands who’d rather invest in real solutions than memes. If PayFi takes hold and mainstream merchants latch onto the ease of instant crypto-to-fiat, Remittix (RTX) might prove itself beyond the crypto bubble potentially becoming a go-to altcoin for practical finance.

39505253,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=663195,1737846479,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39505253.jpeg,Meta’s Chief AI scientist shares his opinion about DeepSeek’s success,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/metas-chief-ai-scientist-shares-his-opinion-about-deepseeks-success/,"Meta’s Chief AI scientist Yann LeCun has given his assessment about the success that DeepSeek is enjoying in the artificial intelligence industry. According to LeCun, the biggest point to note in its rise is its vision to keep AI models open source so that everybody can benefit from it. The Chinese artificial intelligence company recently launched its DeepSeek-R1, which features better reasoning and problem-solving capacities, rivaling industry leaders like OpenAI. The AI, launched on January 20, possesses remarkable features, with tests showcasing its exceptional abilities. Aside from that, DeepSeek provides training parameters under an MIT license, allowing researchers globally to study and enhance the program. LeCun noted that the company’s success story is not about putting China ahead of the United States in the AI industry, but making sure open source models are still ahead. It’s not that China’s AI is “surpassing the US,” but rather that “open source models are surpassing proprietary ones,” LeCun said. Meta’s Chief AI scientist discusses DeepSeek’s success DeepSeek shares the same attribute with the Llama model created by Meta, with both being open source. Their rival, OpenAI, which was originally created as an open-source AI firm, has since tried to shift its mission to create technology that will benefit all humanity. The move has caused a lot of legal tussle, with Elon Musk, one of its former executives and contributors asking the court to block its transition to a for-profit. According to Meta’s Chief AI scientist, DeepSeek has enjoyed open source and open research, noting that it was the idea that some people made that they chose to build on. “They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people’s work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it,” LeCun said. “That is the power of open research and open source.” During the unveiling of DeepSeek R1, the company mentioned that the system demonstrates remarkable reasoning capacity, something that has reportedly been put to the test. The company noted that it is trying to push the boundaries of open-source AI. In its paper, the company also highlighted that it made the system because it wanted to explore the potential of artificial intelligence to develop its reasoning abilities without the use of supervised data. According to Professor Ethan Mollick at Wharton, the responses gotten from the DeepSeek R1 is like a human thinking out loud. Meanwhile, there is the issue of the R1 providing issues to AI companies in the United States, seeing that both China and the US have been rivals for a while. With Trump in the White House again, the rivalry is expected to heat up. However, the rivalry is not the main concern, as the AI model shows that China will very much challenge the top AI companies in terms of development. Silicon Valley surprised by DeepSeek announcement The launch of the DeepSeek R1 model took Silicon Valley by surprise, taking center stage in tech discussions in a week that featured various events including Trump’s inauguration and his busy first few days in office, the World Economic Forum that took place in Davos, Switzerland, and TikTok cutting and restoring service to users in the United States. Days after DeepSeek unveiled its model, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to spend over $60 billion in 2025, as the firm prepares to invest big in artificial intelligence. The Meta boss has been a very outspoken proponent of open-source models, even going as far as backing his rival, Elon Musk, in his quest to block OpenAI’s for-profit move. In September 2024, the Meta CEO mentioned he wanted to build the next generation of open platforms. Zuckerberg noted that he hopes to achieve it in the next 10-15 years, stressing that open platforms must win. “I think that’s going to lead to a much more vibrant tech industry,” he added. Making a technology open source has been hailed as the way to go, since it allows anyone to modify and redistribute the codes, this way the technology develops rapidly in a democratic setting. However, proponents of a closed source system have also argued the merits of the models, noting that they are more secure because the codes are kept private. In his case, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has mentioned that taking the closed-source approach with the company provides them an easier way to hit the safety threshold. However, he mentioned in the AMA on Reddit that in the future, he might try to open-source more stuff.

A heavy hitter, World Liberty Financial, recently plunked down $20 million for 3,001 ETH and 95 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), in addition to its already sizable stash. Over the past five days, the fund has shelled out $210.9 million for Ethereum and WBTC. There seems to be no end to this whale activity, which is part of a larger trend that has seen Ethereum appreciating 107% over the past two years. As of January 2025, the asset had reached a value of $3,294.25. #Ethereum ’un Geleceği! Ethereum, son iki yılda %107’lik etkileyici bir artışla 2025 Ocak itibarıyla 3.294,25 dolara ulaşarak dijital varlık piyasasında önemli bir ivme kazandı. Bu yükseliş yalnızca Ethereum’un kendisiyle sınırlı kalmadı; Grayscale Ethereum Trust da aynı dönemde… pic.twitter.com/jQPHmU8YWq — Baykuş (@KriptoBaykusV2) January 24, 2025 Institutional Interest and the Growth of Ethereum ETFs Ethereum’s market is not just picking up the pace with whales and institutional investors; its assets are gaining traction across the board. For example, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust has rumbled up a cool 243% over the past two years—an impressive figure in such a turbulent market—which mirrors (and is slightly ahead of) the overall price performance of Ethereum itself. This means that not only is Ethereum being bought up, but also that investment vehicles built on top of Ethereum (like Grayscale’s Trust) are being increasingly seen as vehicles in which to place funds. At present, more than 3 million ETH are held by substantial institutional investors in Ethereum ETFs, a sign of their significant trust in the DeFi world. These really seem to be stable holdings, and not just because these investors are already underwater on their ETH positions (which is why they haven’t sold). It seems to indicate that Ethereum is developing “Federal Reserve Notes” for DeFi, so to speak, and that these large institutional investors expect it to be an increasingly “accepted asset” to hang on to in the long term. World Liberty Financial spent $20M to buy 3,001 $ETH and 95 $WBTC ~2 hours ago. In the past 5 days, the fund invested $210.9M, including $119.95M on 35,995 $ETH at ~$3,332 and $66.84M on 629.1 $WBTC at ~$106,249. Currently, it holds 77,818 $ETH ($257M), including 19,403 staked… https://t.co/Yg5pS4gY5O pic.twitter.com/K4BkKmZgWm — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) January 25, 2025 Yet, even though Ethereum’s fundamentals are solid, volatility continues to be the defining characteristic of the asset, as seen in the price of Grayscale Ethereum Trust. After reaching a high of $25.04 in February 2024, the price of Grayscale Ethereum Trust fell to a low of $21.27 in August 2024, only to recover again. These movements in the price of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust serve to remind investors that the market is a very volatile one and that short-term assets can see large price changes that are not reflective of their long-term value. Mixed Investor Sentiment Reflected in ETF Net Flows The spot ETFs for Ethereum, which give investors a way to get at the cryptocurrency without holding it directly, have seen some decent inflows. On January 24, two days after we first talked to Bitwise, these ETFs had recorded a total net inflow of just over $9 million. By far, the largest and leading the pack, inflow-wise, is the Bitwise Ethereum ETF. On top of that, it seems like these inflows are being led by institutions—big players who might be accumulating Ethereum for the long haul. On January 24, the total net inflow of Ethereum spot ETFs was $9.1772 million. There was only one day of net outflow in the past 8 days. The Ethereum spot ETF with the largest net inflow yesterday was Bitwise ETF ETHW, with a net inflow of $6.0096 million. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg pic.twitter.com/DsUtQxQYtm — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 25, 2025 There are mixed signals, though, when it comes to net ETF flows. Large institutional players like BlackRock and Grayscale have seen significant outflows, while some other firms, like Fidelity and Franklin Templeton, have seen pretty consistent inflows. This divergence, I think, illustrates that different segments of the institutional market have different views on Ethereum’s future. Some are clearly concerned about volatility in the short term and have pulled back significantly. Others, though, continue to seem pretty committed and have invested in the asset. The withdrawal of 20,001.39 ETH from Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF on January 13, 2025, serves as a stark reminder of the market’s volatility. Large outflows like this one can signal a meaningful shift in investor sentiment, and they’re a good occasion to stop and think about not just what caused this large outflow, but also to consider the external factors and internal market dynamics that make the cryptocurrency market so prone to large, rapid changes in direction. A Strong Future, But Caution Is Key Although Ethereum has achieved exceptional results over the past couple of years and is now embraced in the DeFi space, it is still a very volatile investment. In our recent report on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, we discussed this volatility and the substantial movements in the ETF market that both highlight and contribute to the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. In this piece, we’ll delve deeper into the Ethereum Trust, what it means to be a holder of the trust, and how these factors correlate with the aforementioned volatility. Whales have bought over 1.14 million #Ethereum $ETH in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/7X1ibdE1IG — Ali (@ali_charts) January 24, 2025 Dominating the digital asset ecosystem, Ethereum has shown a clear trajectory of growth. The asset’s future appears bright, with more institutional investors adding Ethereum to their portfolios and Ethereum-based ETFs experiencing increasing inflows. Still, as Grayscale’s price fluctuations and the market’s short-term shifts show, it’s on all investors to manage risk and remain vigilant to changing market conditions when investing in the Ethereum asset. To sum up, although the price appreciation and ETF developments seem to suggest a bright future for Ethereum, investors must anticipate the volatility that accompanies this type of asset. As the network matures, both individual and institutional investors seem to be mounting a long-term bet on what is now the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Still, it’s a bet that looks riskier than ever—just a couple of weeks ago, the price fell nearly 30% in just 48 hours. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

With projects like Kaspa gaining momentum in scalability and Helium revolutionizing IoT, it’s clear that blockchain innovation isn’t slowing down anytime soon. These coins aren’t just about flashy updates—they’re laying the groundwork for real-world impact, solidifying their places in the rapidly evolving ecosystem. Amid these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves with its groundbreaking Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. As one of the best crypto ICOs to invest in today, Qubetics is closing in on the 19th stage of its presale, with a 10% price increase coming this Sunday. From tokenizing physical assets to offering seamless liquidity for businesses and investors, Qubetics is tackling the inefficiencies traditional systems couldn’t solve. It’s not just about catching up—it’s about redefining blockchain’s purpose. Transforming Blockchain with Qubetics’ Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is taking asset tokenization to an entirely new level. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it unites leading blockchains to create a seamless platform for tokenized assets. This game-changing application is designed for businesses and individuals looking to unlock new investment opportunities. Imagine a small business owner using the Qubetics marketplace to tokenize their real estate assets, enabling them to access a global pool of investors. Similarly, a budding artist could fractionalize ownership of their work, allowing fans worldwide to invest in their creativity. By offering a secondary market for tokenized assets, Qubetics facilitates hassle-free sales and exchanges. Its platform ensures smooth asset management, empowering investors with efficient liquidity and higher returns. Businesses can easily access funding, diversify investments, and create innovative products. Individuals, on the other hand, gain unprecedented access to previously exclusive opportunities. The Qubetics marketplace doesn’t just bridge gaps—it creates an ecosystem where tokenization thrives. TICSScan Revolutionizing Blockchain Exploration Adding more firepower to its offerings is TICSScan, Qubetics’ blockchain explorer. It’s built to provide unmatched transparency, real-time data, and intuitive insights into blockchain activity. Validators can assess performance metrics, businesses can track transactions, and developers can debug smart contracts—all through TICSScan’s sleek, user-friendly interface. From verifying blocks to monitoring transaction fees, TICSScan empowers the Qubetics community to make informed decisions, ensuring seamless interaction with the blockchain. Qubetics Presale Offering Unmatched ROI The Qubetics presale is creating waves, and for a good reason. Currently in its 18th stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0551, with over $10.6 million raised, 16,000 holders onboard, and 439 million tokens sold. What’s even more exciting? Each presale stage lasts just seven days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at midnight. This means the window to join the Qubetics presale at the current price closes soon. Analysts are forecasting explosive growth for $TICS. By the presale’s end, $TICS is expected to hit $0.25, translating into a jaw-dropping ROI of 353.39%. But that’s not all—after the presale, $TICS could reach $1, delivering a staggering 1713.57% ROI. With its mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, projections go as high as $10 to $15, boasting ROIs of 18,035.76% and 27,103.64%, respectively. For example, a $200 investment today would yield 3,627.15 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $10 after the mainnet launch, this investment could grow to $36,271.50, or $54,407.25 if it hits $15. The clock’s ticking on this opportunity, and missing out would mean passing on one of the best crypto ICOs to invest in today. Kaspa’s Growth Trajectory Holds Investor Attention Kaspa’s rise is making headlines, and the potential is hard to ignore. The coin operates on the GHOSTDAG protocol, a revolutionary approach that enhances blockchain speed and scalability without compromising decentralization. Recent reports highlight its growing adoption among whales, particularly through the emerging PlutoChain network. The focus is on its potential to achieve mainstream adoption, with price predictions indicating Kaspa could hit $1 by the end of 2025. Analysts attribute Kaspa’s upward trajectory to its growing use cases in decentralized finance and blockchain solutions. Unlike its peers, Kaspa offers near-instantaneous transaction speeds and high security, attracting businesses looking for robust blockchain infrastructure. Its compatibility with PlutoChain’s ecosystem further strengthens its position as a developer-friendly platform, making it a compelling choice for both investors and creators. With whales accumulating Kaspa tokens at unprecedented rates, the confidence in its growth potential is clear. This trust is backed by Kaspa’s impressive roadmap, which focuses on scaling its technology while maintaining its unique GHOSTDAG advantage. The future looks bright for Kaspa, solidifying its place among must-watch cryptocurrencies. Helium’s Push for IoT Dominance Helium (HNT) continues to redefine IoT connectivity through its decentralized wireless network. The platform’s innovative Proof-of-Coverage model incentivizes users to establish hotspots that power the network. This model has led to significant growth, with Helium now boasting a circulating supply of 176.96 million HNT and a market cap of $770.53 million. The past 24 hours have been promising for Helium, with a trading volume of $11.66 million—a 3.25% increase. Helium’s focus on IoT solutions positions it as a frontrunner in industries ranging from logistics to smart cities. With its forward-looking vision, the network has become a magnet for developers and enterprises aiming to capitalize on IoT growth. As Helium continues to scale, its potential for further adoption remains high. Its transparent approach and real-world use cases make it a valuable addition to any portfolio. Backed by its unique decentralized model, HNT offers a tangible connection between blockchain technology and everyday life. Conclusion Cryptocurrency investments demand careful evaluation, and Qubetics, Kaspa, and Helium showcase their unique strengths in today’s landscape. Qubetics leads as one of the best crypto ICOs to invest , offering unparalleled growth potential with its Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace and presale opportunities. Kaspa stands out for its innovative GHOSTDAG protocol, while Helium excels in bridging IoT and blockchain. Together, these projects highlight the vast possibilities in the crypto world, from tokenization and IoT to groundbreaking blockchain solutions.

39502496,https://nulltx.com/?p=141057,1737847103,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Aptos Sees Unprecedented Growth, But Bearish Signals Loom on the Horizon",https://nulltx.com/aptos-sees-unprecedented-growth-but-bearish-signals-loom-on-the-horizon/,"The Aptos ecosystem is witnessing a rapid embrace as fresh users come to the platform and activity reaches unprecedented heights. Just this week, Aptos welcomed 2.1 million new users, bringing its total user base to a staggering 47 million. The platform’s steep rise in popularity is mirrored in the almost laughable surge in weekly active wallets, which hit 5.7 million, up from 3 million just a month ago. The pace of transactions has also been remarkable, with more than 39 million transactions processed in just the last week. This surge in activity shows that many people are interested in the Aptos blockchain and what it has to offer. Given its beginnings with engineers who previously worked at Facebook, the Aptos project has surprised many in the cryptocurrency community with the speed at which it has cultivated a user base. In recent months, that community has moved a substantial amount of money through a growing number of decentralized applications running on the blockchain. The network’s participation in the ecosystem is happening at lightning speed compared to many other blockchain projects. Aptos Price Action and Technical Outlook Even though the user base and activity levels are showing a positive growth trend, Aptos’ native token, $APT, may have a challenging technical outlook. The price of $APT appears to be in the process of carving out a head-and-shoulders top, a bearish technical formation that indicates more downside could be on the way. If this formation plays out as expected, the price of $APT could drop to about $4.30. The head-and-shoulders pattern is a widely recognized technical indicator that frequently denotes a trend reversal, especially when it occurs after a sustained upward price movement. In the instance of $APT, the token’s price has not been able to sustain upward momentum above vital levels, and the head-and-shoulders formation indicates that if market sentiment turns bearish, further price declines could be imminent. Nevertheless, investors in Aptos do have a silver lining to look forward to. To refute this bearish outlook, Aptos (APT) needs to prove it can sustain a close above the $10.50 mark. That threshold amounts to a resistance point, and if Aptos can stay above that in the next few trading sessions, it would send up a signal, or a sign of strength really, that the head-and-shoulders pattern has been invalidated, and that the next probable move is a continuation of an upward trend. 𝙒𝙏𝙁 𝙙𝙞𝙙 𝙄 𝙢𝙞𝙨𝙨 𝙤𝙣 𝘼𝙥𝙩𝙤𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙬𝙚𝙚𝙠?! For starters, 2.1M new users joined the ecosystem this week—pushing all-time users over 47M+ 🪽Weekly active wallets soared to an ATH of 5.7M A staggering 39M+ transactions were processed More in your Aptos… — Aptos (@Aptos) January 25, 2025 The Growing Popularity of Aptos Although APT’s technical chart might raise some eyebrows, the underlying growth of the Aptos network is nothing short of impressive. Its addition of 2.1 million new users in just one week is a clear testament to the platform’s appeal. We can hardly call it a “fledgling project” with numbers like these. It puts speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness front and center, serving decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. The number of active wallets each week is up to 5.7 million, and this reflects a substantial and growing commitment from users. It’s not just that the network is attracting new users; it’s also attracting a kind of new user that’s very important to the long-term prospects of any platform: users who stick around and stay engaged. And stay engaged they do, as evidenced by the number of transactions. We’re now seeing upwards of 39 million+ transactions each week. Users interact with dApps, make transactions, and otherwise occupy the space that is the broader blockchain ecosystem. Aptos is also making strides in attracting developers, and its ecosystem is expanding rapidly with the appearance of more projects on the platform. Those projects are often decentralized finance (DeFi) initiatives looking to scale. They are choosing Aptos because of its high throughput, low transaction costs, and stable infrastructure. In comparison with other protocols, Aptos has a generally favorable fee structure, and it has become a go-to developer choice in the DeFi space. A Mixed Picture for Investors The expansion of Aptos’ user base and the development of network activity are undoubtedly impressive. But what about the price of $APT? A bearish technical picture is emerging there, and on the surface, it looks like this is presenting a pretty mixed bag for investors. If you believe technical signals are worth anything, the appearance of a head-and-shoulders pattern comes off like a strong sell signal. That’s signaling a potential price decline. And a price decline is usually associated with a potential increase in network activity. But what if network activity is increasing? #Aptos $APT appears to be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern, with a potential downside target of $4.30. A sustained close above $10.50 is needed to invalidate the bearish outlook. pic.twitter.com/4rHCGcOxyy — Ali (@ali_charts) January 25, 2025 When contemplating the future of Aptos, investors would do well to keep a close watch on some pivotal price points—most notably the $10.50 mark. Any sort of prolonged rally above that level would seem to suggest strength in what is otherwise a still very young and unproven asset. On the flip side, if Aptos were to drop and head back toward the $4.30 area, it might raise some eyebrows and give off the appearance of a potential bath that this asset is taking. To be fair, Aptos is a blockchain network; however, like any network, its value is contingent not only on what people are willing to pay for its native asset (in this case, APT) but also on its ability to attract users and developers. To conclude, Aptos continues to impress with its growth and adoption, but its technical outlook for $APT remains unclear. Investors should keep a close watch on price actions over the next few weeks to see if the head-and-shoulders pattern comes to fruition or if $APT can push through resistance levels and keep the upward trend going. With its burgeoning ecosystem and strong user base, Aptos is a project to keep on your radar in the next few months. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Panshibi (SHIBI) has drawn attention as one of the few meme coins making quick developments on the blockchain. With projections of a 1,200% price surge, analysts believe Panshibi could soon compete with Polkadot or Solana prices. In this overview, we'll explore why you should capitalize on this investment opportunity! Panshibi Introduces a New Theme of Meme Coins Panshibi is setting a new standard for meme coins by capturing the excitement and imagination of the real world. Inspired by the charm of pandas, Panshibi brings more than just a theme—it represents a comfortable blend of creativity and innovation. As a relatable project, Panshibi is already being hailed as the next big thing. Moreover, the Panda-themed coin has the potential of mammoth profits right from its ongoing presale. Over 15 stages, Panshibi’s price is expected to shoot up by 1,200%, with predictions of even greater growth upon listing. This combination of strategic pricing and calculated scarcity is driving interest from all corners of the crypto market. With its smart contract being fully audited, liquidity will remain locked for ten years and the ownership of the token will be renounced after the presale. These measures not only protect investors but also ensure that the project remains decentralized and community-driven. As SHIBI prepares for its debut on major exchanges, its combination of community appeal and sound strategy is paving the way for significant success. Panshibi functions on a MemeFi model that allows it to operate outside of market hype. Its platform stands out from the rest in the often volatile meme coin space. Solana Price Could Reach New Heights Shortly after assuming office, the Trump administration launched a new crypto task force aimed at establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. Additionally, President Donald Trump introduced two Solana meme coins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Over the week, coins on the Solana network have registered double-figured price increases. SOLitself reached a 38% price increase in the same period, with a $300 valuation in sight. As a result, its TVL rose to a $12.1 billion all-time high. However, traders are cautious of Solana’s 10.4% volatility and 11.8% supply inflation. While the short-term looks promising, price analysts like CoinCodex predict a Solana price decline after the first quarter of 2025. Polkadot Community Raise Alarm as Project Burns Through Millions Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading above $6.5 , reflecting a 0.08% decrease from the previous week. Once a top 10 crypto, DOT has been on a steady decline, with newer projects and initiatives taking its former positions. Recently, Polkadot has proposed RFC-0092 to reduce its unstaking period from 28 days to just 2 days. However, the project has faced scrutiny after revealing $37 million in marketing expenses, prompting discussions within the community regarding budget allocations. Despite partnering with Inter Miami FC to support educators at the Pride Academy, the DOTeconomy is tilting towards a bearish sentiment. With its supply inflation above 55%, it is unlikely for DOT to make headway soon. Conclusion Unlike Polkadot's struggles and Solana's volatility, Panshibi combines decentralized governance, transparency, and scalability to establish itself as a serious contender. With its tokens selling for $0.002 apiece, SHIBI is poised to perform well ahead of a strong market debut.

Panshibi (SHIBI) has emerged as a standout among meme coins, advancing rapidly on the blockchain. With expectations of a 1,200% increase in value, experts suggest that Panshibi could soon rival the price of Polkadot or Solana. In this discussion, we'll delve into why this could be a lucrative investment opportunity! Panshibi Unveils a Fresh Theme in Meme Coins Panshibi is redefining meme coins by tapping into the excitement and creativity of the real world. Drawing inspiration from pandas, Panshibi offers more than a theme—it embodies a harmonious mix of creativity and innovation. As a relatable initiative, Panshibi is already being praised as the next significant development. Furthermore, the Panda-themed coin promises substantial returns right from its ongoing presale. Over 15 stages, Panshibi’s price is projected to spike by 1,200%, with potential for even greater growth once listed. This strategic pricing combined with calculated scarcity is attracting interest from across the crypto landscape. With a fully audited smart contract, liquidity will be locked for a decade, and token ownership will be relinquished post-presale. These steps not only secure investor interests but also ensure the project remains decentralized and community-focused. As SHIBI gears up for its launch on major exchanges, its mix of community engagement and strategic planning sets the stage for notable success. Panshibi operates under a MemeFi model, allowing it to function independently of market hype. Its platform distinguishes itself in the often unpredictable meme coin market. Solana Price Poised for New Peaks Soon after taking office, the Trump administration introduced a new crypto task force aimed at creating a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. Additionally, President Donald Trump launched two Solana meme coins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Throughout the week, coins on the Solana network have seen double-digit price gains. SOL itself achieved a 38% price increase over the same timeframe, with a $300 valuation on the horizon. Consequently, its TVL reached a record high of $12.1 billion. Nevertheless, traders remain wary of Solana’s 10.4% volatility and 11.8% supply inflation. Although the short-term outlook is positive, analysts like CoinCodex forecast a Solana price drop after the first quarter of 2025. Polkadot Community Raises Concerns Over Project's Spending Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading above $6.5 , marking a 0.08% dip from the previous week. Once a top 10 cryptocurrency, DOT has been on a downward trend, with newer projects and initiatives taking its former positions. Recently, Polkadot has suggested RFC-0092 to shorten its unstaking period from 28 days to just 2 days. However, the project has come under scrutiny after disclosing $37 million in marketing costs, sparking discussions within the community about budget management. Despite collaborating with Inter Miami FC to support educators at the Pride Academy, the DOT economy is leaning towards a bearish outlook. With supply inflation exceeding 55%, it's unlikely that DOT will gain momentum soon. Conclusion Unlike Polkadot's challenges and Solana's volatility, Panshibi combines decentralized governance, transparency, and scalability to position itself as a serious contender.

The prominent altcoin currently trades around $3,290 as investors await the crypto bull run’s return to form. On the other hand, rising institutional adoption provides a positive development for the Ethereum community. Related Reading: Justin Sun’s Grand Strategy For Ethereum Price: $10,000 Target BlackRock’s ETHA Lead Spot ETF Market With 1.2 Million ETH According to a recent X post by Burak Kesmeci, Ethereum is currently experiencing a surge in institutional adoption as evidenced by developments in the Spot ETF Market. Kesmeci highlights that BlackRock’s ETHA accounts for the majority of this demand with net assets of 1.2009 ETH valued at over $3.19 billion. According to data from SoSoValue, this record is largely unsurprising as ETHA has experienced the highest net cumulative inflows of $3.97 billion in the Ethereum Spot ETF market. Fidelity’s FETH occupies second place with 432,750 ETH valued at around $1.46 billion. Bitwise’s ETHW and VanEck’s ETHV follow with holdings of 105,974 ETH and 45,766 ETH, respectively. Meanwhile, all other Ethereum Spot ETFs except the Grayscale ETHE have accumulated at least 7,000 ETH since their launch in July 2024. A rise in institutional demand of Ethereum as Indicated by the data above indicates strong confidence in the asset’s long-term profitability. While Ethereum Spot ETFs may not replicate the performance of Bitcoin counterparts, the institutional demand these funds command could enhance ETH market stability and liquidity, paving the way for broader regulatory acceptance and mainstream adoption. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates But Open Interest Points to Potential Breakout Short Transactions Dominate Ethereum Market In other news, bearish sentiments currently prove dominant in the ETH market as dominated by a higher proportion of short-term transactions to long transactions. According to Kesmeci, short orders represent 57% of all Ethereum futures trades indicating that the majority of traders are betting the altcoin to experience a further price decline. This negative development is particularly observed on the Bitmex and Bitfinex exchanges. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,297 after 0.17% loss in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume has dipped by 24.24% and is now valued at $25.36 billion. Based on its daily trading chart, Ethereum appears to be consolidating despite recent losses. With any price rally, the altcoin could reach around $3,700, moving past which would spur a return to around $4,000. On the other hand, another fall in Ethereum’s price could result in a slump to around $3,100, which lies its next significant support level. With a market cap of $396.85 billion, ETH retains its position as the largest altcoin and second-largest cryptocurrency in the world.

Meme coins are more than just digital assets; they’re a community-driven movement, sparking massive enthusiasm and skyrocketing ROI for savvy investors. As the market continues to evolve, new meme coins are rising to the occasion, and among them, Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Popcat are making waves. These tokens promise not just thrilling gains but an adventurous ride for anyone looking to dive into the meme coin scene. But how do you separate the hype from the true winners? That’s where Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Popcat stand out. These meme coins aren’t just another flash in the pan—they’re backed by unique narratives, community engagement, and thrilling presale stages that make them the best new meme coins to invest in for short term profits. Let’s dive deeper into why these three meme coins are grabbing the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers to the crypto game. Arctic Pablo is leading the charge with its adventurous narrative and insane ROI potential. If you haven’t heard about it yet, you’re missing out on a journey unlike any other. Arctic Pablo: The Journey of a Lifetime Arctic Pablo is no ordinary meme coin. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about adventure. In an icy realm where myth and reality collide, Arctic Pablo embarks on a thrilling exploration, discovering hidden treasures with each step. Imagine a coin that doesn’t just grow in value but takes you on a journey to uncharted lands. The narrative of Arctic Pablo is as unique as it gets, and the best part? It’s built to deliver impressive ROI for those who jump in early. What sets Arctic Pablo apart is its presale model. Instead of sticking to a boring old stage system, Arctic Pablo’s presale is divided by locations, each representing a new chapter in Pablo’s exploration. From Metropolis to Snowy Shores, each location unlocks new tokens and opportunities for early investors. Right now, Arctic Pablo is at Stage 6, and over $430,000 has already been raised. But there’s a catch—each location comes with its own limited supply and burn mechanism, which only makes the coin more valuable. Why should you care about Arctic Pablo? Here’s the exciting part: if you join the presale now, you can get in at the current price of just $0.000038 per $APC. As the presale progresses, the price will gradually rise, and by the final presale stage, it’ll hit $0.0008. But the real magic happens when Arctic Pablo launches. At a launch price of $0.008, you could see a jaw-dropping ROI of over 20,000% from Stage 6 to launch price. This isn’t just a coin; it’s an adventure. So, if you’re looking for a meme coin with serious growth potential, Arctic Pablo is the best new meme coin to invest in for short term. And don’t forget about the staking opportunities—Arctic Pablo offers a staggering 66% APY, allowing you to grow your investment while embarking on this thrilling journey. Moo Deng: A Playful Coin with Serious Potential Moo Deng may not have the same adventurous narrative as Arctic Pablo, but don’t let that fool you—this meme coin is one to watch. Moo Deng’s charm lies in its community and the promise of a truly decentralized ecosystem. With a strong community-driven vision, Moo Deng has built a loyal following that’s eager to see the coin soar. As a meme coin with a unique twist, Moo Deng offers something different from the typical Doge and Shiba Inu clones. Moo Deng is more than just a fun name. With its deflationary tokenomics, it’s built to appreciate over time. And the more you hold, the more you stand to gain as the circulating supply decreases. Moo Deng has already proven its worth in its early stages, and the community’s enthusiasm is palpable. What makes this coin particularly attractive for short-term investment is the fact that it has an active roadmap with clear milestones ahead. As the project grows, Moo Deng plans to integrate more utility and features, including partnerships that could drive its price even higher. Popcat: A Meme Coin with Legendary Appeal Popcat needs no introduction—it’s a meme coin with a cult following that’s been a hit online for a while. As one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term, Popcat is riding a wave of popularity, thanks to its simple yet incredibly effective meme status. It’s funny, it’s viral, and it’s packed with potential. But Popcat isn’t just a meme—it’s a project that understands the value of community. The Popcat community is one of the most active in the meme coin space, and that’s one of the reasons why its value has skyrocketed in the past year. Like most meme coins, the key to Popcat’s success lies in its ability to capture the attention of internet culture and capitalize on the viral nature of memes. Conclusion: Jump on the Meme Coin Train Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin space is looking more promising than ever. Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Popcat each offer something unique for investors looking for short-term gains. However, if you want to be part of an epic journey with huge ROI potential, Arctic Pablo is the one to watch. With its adventurous narrative, presale opportunities, and insane 30,692% ROI potential, Arctic Pablo is undoubtedly the best new meme coin to invest in for short term profits.

Web3Bay (3BAY) distinguishes itself with a novel e-commerce and decentralized governance model, marking it as a prudent selection in 2025. With an impressive $890,000 amassed in its presale and an anticipated 6,430% return on investment, Web3Bay transcends mere conjecture by providing both utility and expandability in a market poised for innovation. Ripple (XRP) on the Verge of $4 After Market Uptick Ripple (XRP) is nearing a $4 valuation after climbing past $3, a spike driven by fresh market enthusiasm following the latest presidential inauguration. Expert Ali Martinez notes that XRP’s ascension from a bullish flag pattern may push it toward $4.40 soon. Over the last week, XRP rose by 23.4% and 40.4% over the month, with technical indicators like a high relative strength index (RSI) hinting at sustained upward momentum. With significant buying from large-scale holders, a $4 target is becoming more feasible. Chainlink (LINK) Poised for Growth, Eyes $30.81 Mark Chainlink (LINK) exhibits strong upward trends, depicted in a progressing five-wave Elliott Wave pattern on daily and hourly charts. The RSI suggests there’s room for growth before hitting overbought levels, aiming to surpass the $30.81 high. The current third wave on the hourly chart follows a modest second-wave drop to $22.17, with goals set near $30.81. Stability above $22.74 is critical, however, as falling below this could prompt corrections, crucial for traders to watch. Web3Bay: A Prudent Choice for Tangible Utility and ROI The 3BAY token serves as the core of Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce framework, promising investors real advantages and substantial growth potential. At a current price of $0.004562625 in its fourth presale phase, the token is anticipated to debut at $0.1959—offering an impressive 6,430% ROI to early participants. In contrast, Ripple’s XRP is still trying to reach its previous highs, and Chainlink’s LINK largely depends on the DeFi sector’s performance. With its broad appeal and emphasis on viable solutions, Web3Bay stands out as an excellent investment choice. For instance, a $1,000 investment in 3BAY during the presale could potentially transform into over $42,900 at launch. This remarkable growth potential is not merely theoretical; it is underpinned by Web3Bay’s utility-oriented approach. As the platform gains users, the demand for 3BAY tokens is expected to surge, progressively boosting their value. Web3Bay: Built to Last in a Competitive Crypto Market Web3Bay’s allure extends beyond immediate financial returns. Its strategic roadmap is tailored for scalability and active user participation, aiming to maintain its pertinence over time. Essential developments include: NFT Marketplace : An arena for artists and collectors to effortlessly exchange digital items. Decentralized Governance : Allows token holders to shape the platform’s direction, fostering a community-led environment. Hybrid Payment System : Supports both crypto and conventional payments such as PayPal, broadening its accessibility worldwide. Layer-2 Scaling : Guarantees rapid and cost-effective transactions, even under heavy demand, ensuring a seamless user experience. These initiatives position Web3Bay as more than a mere cryptocurrency; it is an extensive platform tackling the inefficiencies plaguing the $5 trillion e-commerce sector. Unlike Chainlink’s focused application or Ripple’s exposure to regulatory hurdles, Web3Bay is crafting a functional solution for worldwide commerce. How Smart Investors Capitalize on Web3Bay Opportunities Smart investors recognize the significant advantages of utility tokens associated with platforms that address actual market needs. Ethereum and Binance Coin, initially viewed as speculative bets, have ultimately validated their substantial market value. In a similar vein, Web3Bay is currently navigating the initial phase of what promises to be a groundbreaking evolution. To illustrate: Web3Bay has successfully amassed over $890,000 in its presale so far, with the token price escalating at each phase. This tiered pricing model incentivizes early investors, encouraging swift action to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Participants from the early rounds of the presale are now enjoying considerable gains, with the token’s projected launch price of $0.1959 hinting at even more lucrative prospects ahead. Unlike Chainlink and Ripple, which have established themselves in specific areas like blockchain oracles and international payments, Web3Bay is introducing a fundamentally novel concept—a decentralized platform for e-commerce poised for exponential growth. The successful presale, a model grounded in utility, and a vision for long-term growth position Web3Bay as a smart investment choice for 2025 .

It stands out with its innovative architecture and a clear mission to revolutionize decentralized systems. BlockDAG is swiftly becoming a hot topic in the cryptocurrency discussions. Let’s examine the key selling points and breakthrough technology that make BlockDAG a focal point for both developers and buyers. Introducing BlockDAG BlockDAG is at the forefront of blockchain evolution, tackling the inherent limitations of traditional blockchain architectures. Rather than sticking to the linear block processing of older blockchains, BlockDAG employs Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology to process multiple blocks simultaneously. This method not only boosts transaction speed but also enhances scalability. The moniker “BlockDAG” captures this blend of blockchain resilience and DAG efficiency, forming a robust platform suited for high-volume applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and supply chain management. The Core Technology Powering BlockDAG The innovation at the core of BlockDAG is its capability to process several blocks in parallel, a significant shift from the traditional sequential blockchain operations. This linear method can lead to congestion as the network expands, slowing down transactions and inflating fees. BlockDAG revolutionizes this setup by allowing multiple blocks to exist and validate transactions together, which speeds up processing times and greatly expands network capacity. Whether it’s handling numerous small transactions or complex decentralized apps (dApps), BlockDAG offers a performance that traditional blockchains can hardly match. Furthermore, BlockDAG supports both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), enabling developers to utilize familiar tools for development, testing, and deployment, thus lowering the barriers to innovation and diversifying the ecosystem. Why BlockDAG Stands Out Unparalleled Speed & Scalability Thanks to its ability to handle multiple blocks concurrently, BlockDAG ensures swift and efficient network functionality, even under strain. This scalability makes it a robust choice for large-scale applications, future-proofing it in a rapidly advancing industry. Enhanced Security The unique structure of BlockDAG also augments its security. The interconnected DAG framework increases resilience against certain attacks, where altering any transaction demands substantial computational resources, thus ensuring the integrity of the network. Seamless Interoperability BlockDAG’s support for EVM and WASM facilitates an easier transition for developers looking to migrate existing projects or kick-start new ones. This adaptability is crucial in attracting a diverse developer base to the platform. A Developer-Centric Ecosystem BlockDAG is not just focused on technology; it aims to cultivate a thriving community of innovators. Partnering with HackerEarth, a global developer network, BlockDAG is committed to encouraging innovation through upcoming hackathons designed to stimulate over 200 Web3 projects, demonstrating its capacity as a developer-friendly ecosystem. A Record-Breaking Presale BlockDAG’s presale is turning heads, raising a whopping $184.5 million so far. Currently in its 27th batch, BDAG coins are priced at $0.0248, offering an attractive opportunity for anyone looking to buy early. Early adopters are already reaping rewards. Those who joined in the first batch have seen their holdings grow by 2380%. And there’s more to come—analysts predict BDAG could hit $1 by 2025. For those jumping in now, that means a potential 3932% return. What makes BlockDAG stand out is its practical potential. The platform’s speed and scalability make it a perfect fit for industries like finance and logistics. Think of a supply chain where transactions are processed instantly, or a DeFi platform that effortlessly handles millions of users without delays. This practicality is why developers and businesses are gravitating toward BlockDAG. By solving key blockchain issues like slow speeds, high costs, and scalability limits, it’s emerging as a solution not just for today’s problems, but for the innovations of tomorrow. The Ideal Time to Buy With the presale price at $0.0248, now is an exceptional time to buy. The mainnet launch is set for early 2025, and as the launch approaches, the opportunity to purchase at this level will diminish. As BlockDAG continues to attract more developers and expand its ecosystem, the demand for BDAG coins is likely to surge, potentially increasing their market value.

These factors appear to be shifting the market sentiment that DOGE has been witnessing. Elon Musk and Blockchain Technology Recently, Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of SpaceX and Tesla, revealed that he is exploring blockchain technology to make the DOGE department more efficient and to track government performance. Musk’s thoughts have gained significant attention from crypto experts and analysts. Looking at this, Cardano blockchain founder Charles Hoskinson posted on X (formerly Twitter) and stressed, “I’m thinking this is a job for a triumvirate of Cardano, Bitcoin, and Midnight. Yo, Dogemaster Elon Musk, give us a call. We’ll do it for free.” Well, I'm thinking this is a job for a triumvirate of Cardano, Bitcoin, and Midnight. Yo, dogemaster @elonmusk , give us a call.

Current Price Momentum Despite these positive developments, DOGE is currently trading near $0.354 and has witnessed a price surge of 1.35% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bullish, as it is currently at a crucial support level provided by the trendline and is also poised for an inclined trendline breakout on the four-hour time frame. Since December 2024, DOGE has taken support from this trendline four times, and each time, it has witnessed impressive upside momentum. Source: Trading View Looking at the historical price momentum, experts are expecting a similar kind of upside momentum. Based on the recent price action, if DOGE breaches the trendline and closes a four-hour candle above the $0.365 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 20% to reach the $0.43 level in the future.",News|Crypto news|Meme Coins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-26 00:30:11

Now, picture missing the boat because you hesitated when the market offered dips. In the volatile yet thrilling world of cryptocurrency, timing isn’t just everything—it’s your golden ticket. While Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Brett (BRETT) have solidified their spots among meme coin enthusiasts, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is grabbing attention with its amazing presale performance and innovative Bulls Squad. The 14th stage of BTFD’s presale has already raised over $5.6 million, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing. So, what makes BTFD Coin the must-watch contender for 2025? Here’s the deal: the BTFD presale has thrown a 100% bonus offer into the mix—a tantalizing reward for investors who act now. With the LAUNCH100 bonus code, buyers can double their coins. Intrigued yet? Let’s dive deeper into how BTFD is shaping up to be the best new meme coin to join for the long term. BTFD Coin: More Than a Meme, It’s a Movement At the heart of BTFD Coin lies a rallying cry: “ Buy The Dip .” This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a call to action for savvy investors who understand the value of seizing opportunities hidden in market chaos. Built on Ethereum for enhanced security and scalability, BTFD isn’t merely a token—it’s a thriving ecosystem powered by a dedicated community and a bold vision. With over 9,500 coin holders and 67 billion coins sold, BTFD is on track to become a game-changer in the meme coin space. The Bulls Squad: Meet the Guardians of the Dip At the heart of BTFD is the Bulls Squad, a dynamic team of mascots that encapsulates the project’s spirit of resilience and community. Baby Bull : The visionary face of BTFD, Baby Bull represents the optimism of buying the dip and inspires the community to hold strong. Raging Bull : This creative powerhouse ensures BTFD’s visuals and branding stay bold and exciting. Nerdy Bull : The brains behind the operation, Nerdy Bull guarantees that BTFD’s infrastructure runs smoothly. Peoples Bull : As the community’s voice, Peoples Bull keeps everyone engaged and informed, fostering a sense of belonging among investors. Together, the Bulls Squad fuels the BTFD movement, creating a robust community that thrives on market downturns and positions itself for massive gains during bull cycles. Staking and P2E Game: More Reasons to Join BTFD doesn’t stop at just meme coin hype—it brings real utility to the table. Its staking program offers an impressive 90% APY, letting investors earn substantial passive income. Plus, the full version of its P2E game is now live, allowing players to earn rewards while enjoying an immersive gaming experience. And let’s not forget the referral program: top referrers can earn 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens . With these features, BTFD is setting a new standard for meme coins, offering multiple ways for investors to profit while being part of a thriving community. Pepe Coin: A Meme Coin OG Pepe Coin has been a household name among crypto enthusiasts, celebrated for its nostalgic appeal and strong community backing. While it’s not currently offering any presale bonuses or new features, its longevity in the market showcases its resilience. Pepe Coin thrives as a reminder of how memes and community-driven projects can hold their ground in the volatile crypto world. With a massive following and its position as a cultural phenomenon, Pepe continues to serve as a reliable investment for those seeking to diversify their portfolios. However, with no ongoing incentives comparable to BTFD’s presale, it’s clear which project offers more excitement for new investors. Brett: The New Kid on the Block Brett is another meme coin gaining traction, known for its irreverent humor and unique branding. While still relatively new, Brett has carved out a niche among younger crypto enthusiasts who appreciate its playful approach. With no P2E games or staking programs currently available, Brett’s primary appeal lies in its potential to grow as a cultural icon. Despite its limitations, Brett’s ability to rally a loyal fanbase has ensured its spot in the meme coin conversation. Yet, when compared to BTFD’s robust ecosystem, Brett feels more like a side hustle than a main event. A Few Reasons Why BTFD Stands Out What sets BTFD Coin apart is its ability to combine innovation with community. With features like the Bulls Squad, the 100% bonus offer, and real utility through its P2E game and staking rewards, BTFD offers a comprehensive package for investors. The presale’s strategic structure—with escalating prices and token burns—ensures scarcity and value growth for early adopters. Investors who understand the importance of buying the dip will find BTFD’s presale an irresistible opportunity. With over $5.6 million raised and a price trajectory aiming for $0.0006 post-presale, now is the time to act. Don’t Miss Out on the 100% Bonus With the presale currently in Stage 14 , BTFD is offering a limited-time 100% bonus for investors who use the LAUNCH100 code. Here’s how it works: Visit the BTFD Presale . Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Enter the bonus code “LAUNCH100” in all caps. Input your desired investment amount and confirm the transaction. Every $4500 invested at $0.00016 per BTFD coin results in 28,125,000 tokens, which doubles to 56,250,000 tokens with the bonus code. At the end of the presale, when BTFD hits $0.0006, this investment could skyrocket to $33,750 in value—a stunning 650% ROI. Conclusion: Seize the Moment with BTFD Coin Meme coins are no longer just about laughs; they’re serious business. While Pepe Coin and Brett offer nostalgic and fun alternatives, BTFD Coin is the best new meme coin to join for long term growth. With its thriving community, innovative features, and irresistible presale incentives, BTFD is setting the stage for massive returns. The choice is yours: Watch from the sidelines or join the Bulls Squad today. With the LAUNCH100 bonus code doubling your investment, this is your chance to turn every dip into a golden opportunity. Don’t miss out— head to the BTFD presale now and ride the wave to the next bull run!

The post, co-authored by executives at the crypto-focused VC firm, has once again shed light on the current issues surrounding Ethereum’s leadership and future. The post was co-authored by Paradigm’s CTO Georgios Konstantopoulos, the firm’s co-founder Matt Huang, and its general partners Dan Robinson and Charlie Noyes. In the post, the authors highlighted Ethereum’s prowess as a driving force in the crypto sector, highlighting several aspects including smart contracts, decentralized finance, and decentralized autonomous organizations, among others that have been developed in the ecosystem. The post highlighted the great work that community developers and engineers have done, building a strong foundation for decentralized applications in the future. Paradigm calls for accelerated development on Ethereum The paradigm executives highlighted that the first version of the Ethereum protocol was launched about two years ago, the first project that drew the attention of Paradigm and the entire crypto industry. However, the ecosystem’s core protocol should be improving at a faster pace. The post highlights that Ethereum can make some integral improvements that will help it reach this goal without sacrificing its values. ETHEREUM ACCELERATION . With @matthuang , @danrobinson & @_charlienoyes . pic.twitter.com/5TJq3G7HhX — Georgios Konstantopoulos (@gakonst) January 25, 2025 According to the post, the executives are calling on Ethereum to increase its development pace, shipping more than a major update every year. The authors argue against the notion that the best way to protect the decentralization of Ethereum is to slow down the development of the core protocol. “The core development process is one of the main mechanisms for off-chain governance by Ethereum’s social layer, and reflects input from engineers, researchers, validators, and institutions,” the post states. “Ossifying the core protocol would mean abandoning that governance mechanism and Ethereum’s ability to evolve in response to changes in the market structures of areas like L2s and MEV,” the authors added. The authors highlight areas of improvement Paradigm executives highlighted several areas that Ethereum needs to make improvements. According to the authors, there are some improvements that the network can ship quickly instead of holding it off and fitting it in one big annual upgrade. The post mentioned that these improvements are non-controversial but are not done under the perception that only a few changes can be made annually. It mentioned that instead of trying to limit ambitions, Ethereum should do more faster. According to the post, changes like repricing L1’s opcodes to scale Ethereum without making changes to the gas limit. Other changes the authors suggested include improving the UX of batched transactions through further development of the account abstraction framework and developing rollups to meet the increasing demand. The post also shed light on Paradigm’s work on the Reth Ethereum client, which it says holds about 2% of Ethereum’s execution clients. According to Client Diversity, the leading client, Geth, currently holds a 43% market share, with Nethermind coming in second place, claiming around 36% of the market. “We built Reth intentionally as an SDK for building “EVM-core” nodes to enable experimentation and innovation by researchers and engineers,” the post states. “We invite the research community to collaborate with us in prototyping new features towards improving Ethereum’s performance, censorship resistance, and future-proofing, with Reth,” the post reads. The authors finalized the post by mentioning that shipping faster is the only important thing that Ethereum can do to expand what it can do, noting that it will help the protocol deliver the visions in its roadmap. The post highlighted that if it is achieved, then it will pave the way for a global and trust-minimized financial system.

The trader Ali Martinez tells his 118,700 followers on the social media platform X that the RWA project Ondo Finance ( ONDO ) “appears to be breaking out of a bull flag.” A bull flag is typically viewed as a bullish pattern, suggesting that an asset is consolidating before kicking off on a new rally.

At the time of writing, XRP is the third-largest crypto by market cap, and current buying trends suggest it might stay there for a while. As of January 25, 2025, the altcoin has a total supply of 100 billion tokens, with approximately 57.64 billion currently in circulation. Notably, a significant portion of this circulating supply is concentrated among a small number of wallets. Specifically, the top 10 addresses hold about 20.99% of the circulating supply, while the top 50 addresses control approximately 53.3%, which raises the question about the distribution of wealth in the ecosystem and who stands to benefit the most from the price rally. Top 20 Wallets And Their Dominance Over XRP Supply The largest XRP holdings are primarily associated with Ripple Labs, its founders, and major cryptocurrency exchanges. In terms of numbers, data from Coincarp shows that out of the 4,840,747 addresses, the top 20 holders, the top 50 holders, and the top 100 holders hold 50.31%, 63.74%, and 71.76% of the circulating supply, respectively. Related Reading: XRP Price Rallies To ATH At $3.4, Here’s What’s Driving It And Why The Pump Will Continue According to distribution data, Ripple Labs currently owns around 46 billion XRP tokens, although most are locked in escrow. These tokens are released periodically in pre-set amounts, limiting Ripple’s ability to freely access or manipulate the escrowed funds. Even with these restrictions, Ripple Labs holds a considerable amount of liquid XRP. Data from blockchain explorer Bithomp indicates that one of Ripple’s wallet addresses alone contains over 1.3 billion XRP. Also, Ripple Labs co-founder Chris Larsen is the largest individual holder of XRP, holding over 5 billion tokens, making him one of the wealthiest individuals in the ecosystem. Major exchanges like Binance and Uphold also manage significant reserves. For instance, one of Binance’s wallets holds over 1.3 billion XRP, accounting for approximately 1.33% of the circulating supply. South Korean-based crypto exchange Upbit also holds about 4.38% of the total supply, among a few other exchanges. Holding Distribution: Anything To Fear? These large-scale holdings by exchanges and Ripple-related entities paint a picture of an XRP ecosystem dominated by a relatively small group of stakeholders. However, when you think about it, these large holdings are not in the hands of any private company or individual that would potentially be at risk of manipulating the price for their benefit. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Bullish Flag Breakout That Could Put 50% Gains On The Board Furthermore, the bulk held by exchanges represents aggregated assets belonging to thousands, if not millions, of individual users. As such, their concentration in exchanges does not pose any unnatural risk to the natural price dynamics for XRP. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.10, having recently reached a seven-year high of $3.38.

Key market indicators suggest SOL could witness further downsizing as Ethereum’s makes a gradual resurgence after Vitalik Buterin announced the team’s intent to stop selling ETH. With SOL recently struggling to hold momentum as selling pressure builds, Ethereum (ETH) stabilizes above the $3,100-$3,300 support zone. This contrasting price action highlights the growing divergence between the two major Layer-1 competitors, as Ethereum’s looks poised to regain market dominance. Solana Price Weakens as Ethereum Stabilizes Solana (SOL) continues to show bearish price action as Ethereum’s (ETH) stability amid volatile market trends suggests traders are selectively navigating the markets. Analyzing the Ethereum price forecast chart , ETH price is consolidating above a key support zone between $3,050 and $3,208. This support is reinforced by the 200-day Moving Average (MA), a critical technical indicator for gauging long-term trends. Solana Price Technical Analysis vs. Ethereum (ETH) According to the TradingView chart above, ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near 47.57, signaling neutral momentum and potential for accumulation. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram shows mild bearish divergence but suggests weakening downside pressure, as recent bars narrow toward the zero line. These factors point to ETH price stabilizing, creating a subdued environment for correlated altcoins like Solana. SOL, by contrast, lacks strong institutional interest evident in Ethereum’s support zones. With ETH finding buyers near its 200-day MA and key horizontal levels, SOL’s price weakness could signal a flight to safety toward larger-cap assets. If Ethereum continues to consolidate above $3,200, it could exert indirect resistance on SOL, limiting its ability to recover in the short term. Solana bulls must reclaim lost support zones to shift sentiment to the next bullish phase. Solana Price Forecast: SOL To Crash 20% As Selling Pressure Builds Looking at the near-term Solana price forecast , current market dynamics indicate a bearish outlook, with a potential 20% decline as selling pressure intensifies. As seen in the chart below, SOL price has recently breached key support levels, including the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $232.51 and the 200-day SMA at $168.88, signaling weakening demand. The Swing Failure Pattern (SFP) due to excessive selling further confirms the bearish sentiment, as buyers failed to sustain upward momentum, leading to a breakdown. Solana Price Forecast The price is currently testing the range midpoint at $232.51, which now acts as resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and other momentum indicators are likely in oversold territory, but without significant buying interest, a rebound seems unlikely. The demand zone around $168.88, aligned with the 200-day SMA, is the next critical support level.

As 2025 unfolds, the focus is on projects that have demonstrated resilience, innovation, and the potential for significant returns. From digital currencies aiming to revolutionize cross-border transactions to tokens driving blockchain scalability, these altcoins are reshaping the investment landscape. Qubetics , Terra Classic, and SEI have emerged as standout projects, making a compelling case for why they are the best altcoins to buy in January 2025. Qubetics, in particular, is capturing attention with its presale performance and groundbreaking Web3 solutions. It’s a name that’s becoming synonymous with innovation and accessibility in the blockchain world. With milestones like over $10.6 million raised during its presale and advanced tools designed for developers and businesses, Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in the Web3 era. Meanwhile, Terra Classic and SEI continue to build their reputations within the crypto space. Terra Classic, known for its ongoing commitment to reducing token supply, remains a favorite among value-seeking investors. SEI, on the other hand, focuses on speed and scalability, attracting developers and strategic partners alike. Each project has carved out a niche, serving diverse investor interests. Here’s why they’re among the best altcoins to buy in January 2025. Qubetics: The World’s First Web3 Aggregator Redefining Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics is making waves, and it’s easy to see why. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator , this project is designed to simplify blockchain and decentralized applications (dApps) for everyone, from tech-savvy professionals to everyday users. With over $10.6 million raised during its presale, more than 439 million $TICS tokens sold, and a growing community of over 16,000 token holders, Qubetics is quickly becoming a household name in the crypto space. Priced at $0.0551 in its 18th presale stage, analysts are forecasting remarkable returns for $TICS holders. By the end of the presale, $TICS is projected to reach $0.25, a staggering 353.39% return. But the excitement doesn’t stop there. Post-presale predictions suggest $TICS could soar to $5 or even $15 after the Mainnet launch, offering unparalleled investment potential. The buzz around Qubetics isn’t just about the numbers. Its innovative focus on cross-border transactions is a game-changer. Picture a small e-commerce business in Buenos Aires trying to pay suppliers in another country. Traditional banking methods are slow, expensive, and often riddled with hidden fees. Qubetics streamlines the process, enabling fast, cost-effective, and secure payments that eliminate middlemen. Imagine a freelance designer in Mexico City receiving instant payments from clients worldwide—that’s the future Qubetics is building.

Whether it’s a blockchain-based supply chain solution or a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, the possibilities are endless.

Terra Classic: The Token That Keeps Evolving Terra Classic has weathered its share of challenges, but its resilience has solidified its place as a staple in the crypto market. With a current price of $0.0000815, Terra Classic continues to attract investors drawn to its innovative approach to reducing token supply. Earlier this month, Finance executed a burn of 1.7 billion LUNC tokens, aiming to lower the circulating supply and enhance its long-term value. What makes Terra Classic stand out is its community-driven approach. Investors and developers alike have rallied behind the project, ensuring its survival and growth even in turbulent times. Terra Classic’s unique position as a deflationary token has captured the imagination of those looking for long-term growth potential. The consistent token burns demonstrate the project’s commitment to value creation, offering a solid alternative to traditional investments. Think about an investor in Rio de Janeiro exploring ways to diversify their portfolio. Terra Classic provides an affordable entry point into crypto, with the potential for exponential growth. As the token supply decreases over time, the value proposition becomes even more attractive. It’s this deflationary model that sets Terra Classic apart as one of the best altcoins to buy in January 2025. SEI: Speed, Scalability, and a Growing Ecosystem SEI has carved out a reputation as a high-performance blockchain platform focused on scalability and speed. With a current trading price of $0.339, SEI has seen a recent dip, but that hasn’t deterred analysts from predicting a bright future. Many believe SEI could reach $1 by the end of 2025, driven by increased adoption and its expanding ecosystem. What makes SEI unique is its dedication to creating a blockchain that can handle large-scale applications without compromising efficiency. This focus has attracted a strong developer community and strategic partnerships, making it a go-to platform for building scalable dApps. Picture a tech startup in Colombia leveraging SEI’s ecosystem to create a high-speed payment platform. The blockchain’s performance ensures seamless transactions, making it a preferred choice for developers worldwide. SEI’s commitment to innovation doesn’t stop at speed.

With success stories like Dogecoin paving the way, the new year introduces Arctic Pablo, a meme coin with an adventurous twist. The crypto landscape is buzzing with opportunities, and if you missed Dogecoin’s early days, this could be your shot at a high-potential investment. Arctic Pablo is creating waves with its presale, unique narrative, and massive ROI potential, while Dogecoin continues to prove its staying power. Let’s dive into these two captivating projects and uncover why they’re the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in January 2025. Arctic Pablo: A Mystical Journey to Riches Imagine a daring explorer named Arctic Pablo braving icy tundras, his snowmobile blazing trails through frostbitten terrains. This isn’t just a story—it’s the heart of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC). As Arctic Pablo discovers mystical tokens hidden in icy realms, he invites the world to join him on a journey that blends myth with reality. With each location in the presale, Arctic Pablo uncovers new treasures, and early investors are reaping the rewards. The Arctic Pablo presale has already raised over $430,000 in just 15 days, and the momentum is growing fast. With a current price of $0.000038, $APC offers early adopters an unmatched chance for exponential gains. By the time it hits its final presale price of $0.0008 and a launch price of $0.008, investors could see returns of over 30,692%. Arctic Pablo’s weekly token burns during the presale ensure scarcity, driving up value. Every unsold token is permanently removed, creating a deflationary environment that benefits holders. Combined with a 66% APY staking program, $APC is designed to reward long-term investors. Picture this: by staking your tokens, you’re not only earning rewards but also participating in Arctic Pablo’s legendary journey. Unlike traditional presales divided into stages, Arctic Pablo’s is location-based. Currently, he’s in Metropolis, a realm filled with untapped treasures, and his next destination is Snowy Shores. But here’s the twist: if he discovers the treasure earlier than expected, the presale will move on—leaving latecomers behind. This unique approach adds urgency and excitement, making $APC one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in January 2025. Arctic Pablo isn’t just about financial returns; it’s a narrative-driven adventure that brings investors into a story of exploration and discovery. Don’t wait until the final presale location—join the journey now and secure your stake in Arctic Pablo’s mystical legacy. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin That Started It All No discussion of meme coins is complete without mentioning Dogecoin. What began as a playful jab at Bitcoin has now become one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies globally. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value surged by over 15,000%, making millionaires out of early adopters. Its mascot, the Shiba Inu dog, has become a cultural icon, symbolizing the fun and community-driven nature of crypto. Dogecoin operates on simplicity. It doesn’t promise elaborate narratives or cutting-edge features; instead, it thrives on its loyal fanbase and massive adoption. From tipping content creators to facilitating microtransactions, Dogecoin has cemented its utility. But with its current price hovering around $0.07, many investors wonder if it can replicate its past performance. Here’s where Arctic Pablo shines as a complementary investment. While Dogecoin offers stability and brand recognition, Arctic Pablo delivers innovation and high ROI potential. Imagine owning Dogecoin back in 2013—that’s the kind of opportunity Arctic Pablo presents today. And with its presale still in early phases, now’s the time to act. Dogecoin’s journey also underscores the importance of timing. Early adopters saw exponential gains, but those who joined late missed out on the windfall. Don’t let history repeat itself. Arctic Pablo’s adventurous narrative and deflationary tokenomics could make it the next big thing in the meme coin space. If you’ve been on the sidelines, it’s time to take the plunge and be part of Arctic Pablo’s journey. Conclusion: The Time to Act Is Now Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo and Dogecoin are the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in January 2025. Arctic Pablo’s presale is a golden opportunity to join a thrilling adventure with unmatched ROI potential, while Dogecoin’s legacy continues to provide value and stability. Whether you’re an experienced investor or a curious newcomer, now is the time to act. Don’t let these opportunities pass you by. Join the Arctic Pablo presale today and secure your place in a story of wealth and discovery.

Trump Buys XRP (TRUMPXRP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPXRP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Buys XRP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys XRP could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys XRP launched with over $32,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys XRP on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys XRP by entering its contract address (CA) – HjQUfYDa2vgcG3AYb8z5Sernxm1ttRfhjL4N7A65BY7x – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPXRP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|XRP|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 02:48:20

While these coins make headlines for their viral appeal, their reliance on hype often overshadows a lack of real-world utility. In contrast, Lightchain AI is emerging as a project with substance, combining blockchain and artificial intelligence to address tangible challenges. Currently priced at $0.005625 during its presale and having raised over $12.8 million, Lightchain AI offers a long-term alternative for investors seeking more than speculative gains. Rise (and Limits) of $TRUMP and $MELANIA Coins $TRUMP and $MELANIA coins have drawn significant attention by leveraging their ties to high-profile figures. Their launches created a frenzy among meme coin enthusiasts, leading to sharp price increases fueled by social media and retail hype. These coins have become cultural symbols for supporters of Donald and Melania Trump, with their political branding serving as the primary driver of interest. However, the volatility of these meme coins highlights their biggest drawback – a lack of utility. Once the hype subsides, these tokens often struggle to maintain value, leaving investors exposed to significant risks. This has led many to seek alternatives with sustainable growth potential and real-world applications—such as Lightchain AI . Lightchain AI – Beyond the Hype Unlike $TRUMP and $MELANIA, Lightchain AI is grounded in innovation and utility. One of its key features is its AI-Driven Decentralized Data Solutions, which enable businesses to securely store, process, and analyze data using blockchain technology. This innovation appeals to enterprises that require efficient and scalable systems for managing sensitive information. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s Presale Structure demonstrates its commitment to fostering an engaged community. By raising over $12.8 million during its presale, the platform has shown strong early-stage adoption, with investors confident in its ability to deliver on its promises. Lightchain AI’s roadmap, including its testnet launch in January 2025 and mainnet rollout in March, provides clear milestones for growth. Why Investors Are Choosing Lightchain AI For investors, the choice between meme coins and utility-driven projects like Lightchain AI is becoming increasingly clear. While $TRUMP and $MELANIA offer short-term excitement, their speculative nature makes them inherently unstable. Lightchain AI , on the other hand, provides a sustainable investment opportunity by addressing real-world challenges with advanced technology. Lightchain AI’s focus on empowering developers with tools to build decentralized applications (dApps) further cements its position as a leader in blockchain innovation. By fostering a collaborative ecosystem, the platform ensures its relevance in a rapidly evolving market. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-26 03:00:00

According to a Jan. 25 repo rt by Bloomberg, Elon wa nts blockchain to track federal spending, secure sensitive data, process payments, and even manage government buildings. The D.O.G.E, established by ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump, is tasked with making government tech leaner, meaner, and cheaper. The report says D.O.G.E has already met with representatives from public blockchain networks to evaluate what works and what doesn’t. Trump’s executive order kicks things off The Department of Government Efficiency was made official with an executive order signed by Trump on January 20. D.O.G.E has to deliver recommendations for spending cuts by July 4, 2026. Bloomberg’s report said Elon wasted no time, recruiting 100 volunteers before Trump even stepped into the Oval to start coding for D.O.G.E-related projects. In December, a person reportedly pitched Trump’s transition team in Palm Beach, Florida, on how blockchain could protect critical government data and track federal dollars. The pitch landed with Elon’s team, who believe a decentralized ledger could slash fraud, abuse, and unnecessary spending in federal programs. Using blockchain to run an operation as massive as the U.S. government is uncharted territory, though. Blockchain efforts in corporate America—like Walmart’s private blockchain for tracking supply chains—have been hit or miss. Many private blockchain experiments failed due to governance issues, high costs, or inefficiency compared to traditional databases. Public blockchains, on the other hand, offer transparency but come with their own baggage. Bitcoin and Solana, for instance, operate on decentralized networks of computers, which the Trump administration has used to launch meme coins TRUMP and MELANIA. Still, giants like BlackRock have started using public blockchains for business. BlackRock issued a money-market fund on crypto ledgers, and California’s Department of Motor Vehicles digitized millions of car titles on Avalanche. If D.O.G.E does move forward with blockchain, the scale of the project would dwarf anything attempted in the private sector. And crypto elites are already so excited about the prospects. Binance founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao pointed out : “All governments should track all their spending on the blockchain, an immutable public ledger. It’s called ‘public spending’ for a reason.” And Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said , “Well, I’m thinking this is a job for a triumvirate of Cardano, Bitcoin, and Midnight. Yo, Doge Master Elon Musk, give us a call. We’ll do it for free.” Elon’s White House takeover Elon’s D.O.G.E department is already embedded in the White House. The team has office space in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and plans to deploy four-person D.O.G.E teams to every federal agency. Elon’s close friendship with Trump plays a huge role in all of this. Elon poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign and has become his closest adviser. Trump even knighted him as the nation’s ‘First Buddy.’ But Elon’s deep ties to government contracts, including those of his companies Tesla and SpaceX, are bringing questions about conflicts of interest. Critics say Elon’s recommendations for budget cuts could clash with his personal business dealings. Elon, for his part, says he’s not taking a salary for leading D.O.G.E. But this guy has had a love-hate relationship with crypto for years. Also, a union representing hundreds of thousands of federal employees has already sued the Trump administration over D.O.G.E. The lawsuit said the initiative puts workers’ jobs at risk and doesn’t address systemic issues within federal agencies.

Kamala Sucks (KAMASUCK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because KAMASUCK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Kamala Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Kamala Sucks could become the next viral memecoin. Kamala Sucks launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Kamala Sucks on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kamala Sucks by entering its contract address (CA) – KFywQqjGH3WdEQ4hR42oYQ17v4nSePom6AjyJc8TNfU – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like KAMASUCK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 03:59:15

With its innovative strategies in e-commerce and decentralized decision-making, Web3Bay is quickly becoming a top investment pick for 2025. By raising $900,000 in its presale phase and boasting a potential 6,430% ROI, Web3Bay transcends mere speculation to provide real utility and scalability in a market poised for transformation. Ripple (XRP) Targets $4 After Strong Market Uptrend Ripple (XRP) is poised to reach $4 following its recent jump to $3, sparked by increased crypto market interest after President Trump’s latest inauguration. Noted analyst Ali Martinez points out that XRP has emerged from a bullish flag pattern, suggesting a rise to $4.40 soon. Over the last week, XRP has seen a 23.4% increase and 40.4% over the month. Positive signs from technical tools like the relative strength index (RSI) above its mid-point indicate strong bullish momentum. Supported by significant buyer interest, XRP’s journey to $4 looks promising. Chainlink (LINK) Price Trend: Bullish Trajectory Aims for $30.81 Chainlink (LINK) exhibits strong upward trends, moving through a five-wave Elliott Wave pattern on daily and hourly charts. The daily RSI indicates more room for growth before reaching overbought territory, with Wave (v) aiming to surpass the prior high of $30.81. Supportive Fibonacci levels hint at sustained upward movement. On the hourly chart, Wave (iii) progresses after a slight retreat in Wave (ii) to $22.17. With targets set near $30.81, Chainlink’s outlook is positive. However, a drop below $22.74 could trigger corrections, making these levels critical for traders. Web3Bay: A Wise Choice for Tangible Benefits and High ROI Web3Bay’s 3BAY token underpins its decentralized e-commerce framework, providing real benefits and growth potential. At $0.004562625 in its fourth presale stage and expected to launch at $0.1959, it offers a massive 6,430% ROI. In contrast, Ripple’s XRP has yet to reach past highs, and Chainlink’s LINK depends on the DeFi sector’s fortunes. Web3Bay’s broad appeal and practical approach set it apart as an investment choice. Investing $1,000 in 3BAY now could return over $42,900 at launch. This projection is backed by Web3Bay’s practical model. As the platform gains users, demand for 3BAY tokens will likely increase, boosting their value over time. Why Web3Bay Promises Long-Term Gains Web3Bay’s strategy extends beyond immediate profits. Its roadmap is geared toward growth and engaging users, ensuring its relevance for the future. Essential features include: NFT Marketplace: A venue for artists and collectors to trade digital items smoothly. Decentralized Governance: Token holders have a say in platform decisions, fostering a community-led environment. Hybrid Payment System: Accepts both crypto and traditional payments like PayPal, broadening its user base. Layer-2 Scaling: Keeps transactions fast and cheap even at high-demand times, enhancing user experience. These initiatives position Web3Bay as more than just a token; it’s a well-rounded solution tackling the $5 trillion e-commerce market’s inefficiencies. Unlike Chainlink’s limited focus and Ripple’s regulatory hurdles, Web3Bay is crafting a viable global commerce solution. Long Stroy, Short! Smart investors recognize the importance of utility tokens linked to platforms that address real challenges. Like Ethereum and Binance Coin, which moved past speculative phases to prove their value, Web3Bay is on a path to significant impact. Already with $900,000 from its presale and a token price that rises each round, Web3Bay’s structured pricing model rewards early backers, urging quick action. Those who joined early are already seeing substantial gains, and the forecasted launch price of $0.1959 presents even more potential. While Chainlink and Ripple excel in their specific blockchain and payment niches, Web3Bay introduces a unique decentralized e-commerce platform, making it a top investment in 2025 .

His remarks focus on identifying which projects qualify for the proposed zero capital gains tax and the implications for companies with global affiliations. Crypto Lawyer John Deaton Raises Concerns Over U.S. Tax Policies In a recent tweet , John Deaton discussed the ambiguity surrounding U.S.-based cryptocurrency projects. He questioned whether projects with operations or foundations abroad, such as Solana and Tezos, would meet the requirements for tax exemptions. Solana Labs, headquartered in San Francisco, operates under the Solana Foundation based in Switzerland, while Tezos was developed by U.S.-based Arthur and Kathleen Breitman but is governed by the Switzerland-based Tezos Foundation. Deaton’s inquiry centers on whether such hybrid structures qualify as U.S.-based entities under the proposed tax policies. John Deaton also pointed to cryptocurrencies like XRP, XLM, HBAR, AVAX, and XCH, which may face fewer jurisdictional hurdles. These projects meet the criteria on the surface, potentially positioning them to benefit from the zero capital gains tax. Moreover, Deaton emphasized the potential for tax incentives to drive broader adoption of cryptocurrencies as corporate treasury assets. He questioned whether companies adopting digital assets like XRP, XLM, and HBAR would gain a competitive edge under the proposed zero capital gains tax policy. He also raised concerns about the treatment of foreign entities with U.S. operations, such as Hut 8, and their eligibility for tax benefits. More so, recently the pro-XRP lawyer highlighted four key objectives for the White House Crypto Council. He urged its members to focus on critical areas like SAB 121, the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, crypto tax payments, and overarching crypto taxation policies. U.S. Crypto Companies and Mining Firms Could Reap Benefits John Deaton further explored how U.S.-based companies, including Ripple, Gemini, and ConsenSys, might benefit from the tax exemption if it applies to corporations. The tax breaks could incentivize these firms to expand their crypto holdings and encourage other companies to adopt cryptocurrency as a reserve asset. Deaton also addressed the status of Bitcoin miners like Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital Holdings. These U.S.-based miners might qualify for the exemption, but questions remain about companies like Hut 8 Corp, a Canadian entity with expanding operations in the U.S. John Deaton highlighted the need for clarity on whether international companies with significant U.S. activities could also benefit. Treasury Reserve Strategies and Corporate Crypto Adoption Another key issue raised by Deaton involves corporations adopting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP, and HBAR as part of their treasury reserves. He questioned whether such strategies would qualify these companies for tax benefits under the new policies. Prominent firms like MicroStrategy, known for its Bitcoin holdings, could stand to gain from the tax exemption if their crypto reserve strategies align with the proposed framework. The policy might also encourage other companies to include crypto in their balance sheets. More so, recently, Deaton also emphasized the broader challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry. He criticized past regulatory actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which he described as resource-draining and counterproductive. John Deaton called for an end to what he referred to as “crypto wars,” urging a shift toward clearer regulations to support innovation.

This new token provides a straightforward opportunity for traders and analysts to participate in its presale. With its utility-based tokens, this project aims to transform the landscape of meme coins. Let’s explore why investors are shifting their attention to this innovative offering. High Expectations from Solana Investors and Newer Options Solana(SOL) has long been celebrated for its high-throughput blockchain capabilities. It is a good alternative among developers and investors looking for scalability beyond Ethereum. The sol price has seen remarkable fluctuations, reflecting its volatile yet promising nature. However, as the market evolves, the quest for the next big opportunity leads many to explore emerging tokens like Panshibi . Solana investors, accustomed to the thrill of rapid price movements and the promise of blockchain innovation, enjoy the blend of entertainment and financial gain in Panshibi. The meme coin market offers a different kind of investment narrative than what Solana has traditionally provided. As the sol price stabilizes or faces resistance at higher levels, the allure of a project like Panshibi simply increases. Luckily, Panshibi offers a community-driven approach with its governance model that involves all token holders. This has pushed most Solana investors to diversify their Solana portfolios into what could be the next big meme coin phenomenon. The SUI Scenario Sui (SUI), with its focus on high performance and a developer-friendly environment, has attracted a different segment of the crypto community. However, even with impressive tech capabilities in Sui, the meme coin craze of 2025 has not spared its investors from looking elsewhere. The appeal of Panshibi lies not just in its potential for high returns but also in its unique positioning in the market. Sui holders are drawn to Panshibi for its novelty – merging the cultural significance of Asia, the universal appeal of pandas, and the vibrant world of meme coins. This shift is partly driven by the search for assets that can offer both entertainment and utility, something Sui does not directly cater to. With the meme coin market’s valuation hitting $115 billion in January 2025, the opportunity for growth in Panshibi seems vast. This means Sui investors have the opportunity to allocate portions of their holdings into what could be the best financial decision of 2025. Panshibi: The Meme Coin That’s Redefining Community and Investment Panshibi stands out in the crowded meme coin market with its unique tokenomics. At its core, Panshibi aims to unite three significant communities: those in Asia, panda lovers, and meme coin enthusiasts. This combination allows Panshibi to incorporate social finance and AI elements, actively engaging its community. Holders of SHIBI, Panshibi’s native token, are not just passive investors; they are active participants in a vibrant ecosystem. They have a say in project decisions and enjoy exclusive member perks through the Bamboo Private VIP Club. The Panshibi presale exemplifies its potential. It has a cap of $10 million and is structured across 15 stages, with the token price set to increase by 1,200% during the presale. Additionally, there is an ambitious projection of 145,000% growth after the launch. This strategy aims to reward early supporters and create a sense of urgency and fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors. Panshibi also emphasizes security and transparency, backed by a complete smart contract audit by Coinsult. As we look ahead to 2025, the meme coin market is expected to continue expanding as more traders and investors seek significant returns. For investors from Solana and Sui, Panshibi is more than just another token to add to their portfolios; it offers the chance to engage with a community that promises profits and rewards regardless of the price of Sui or Sol. Given that the token’s liquidity is locked for ten years and team tokens for two years, the future of Panshibi looks promising. For Sol and Sui enthusiasts searching for something to believe in, Panshibi represents hope for the meme coin market and cryptocurrency as a whole.

39513358,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=663210,1737866733,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39513358.jpeg,Wall Street CEOs support all of Trump’s pro-crypto plans,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-ceos-trump-pro-crypto-plans/,"Wall Street is finally warming up to crypto, thanks to President Donald Trump’s aggressive push to boost the industry, especially after Jan. 23rd’s executive order for the National Digital Asset Stockpile. Barely a week into Trump’s second term, a Jan. 25 report by CNBC says top financial executives are falling in line with his pro-crypto policies in a major pivot for an industry that previously kept Bitcoin at arm’s length. Trump’s executive order emphasizes “protecting and promoting” the use and development of cryptocurrencies. Wall Street CEOs jump in In Davos, Switzerland, at the World Economic Forum, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said, “We’ll be working with Treasury and the other regulators to figure out how we can offer that in a safe way.” The bank is known for pushing boundaries in crypto before most of its peers. In 2021, Morgan Stanley became the first major U.S. institution to give wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds. By 2024, it had authorized its advisors to pitch bitcoin ETFs to clients. ‘Crypto president’ Trump is surrounding himself with pro-crypto allies to make sure his agenda sticks. Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner under George W. Bush, has been nominated to lead the SEC. Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, has been tapped as Commerce Secretary. Scott Bessent, a hedge fund manager with a Bitcoin obsession, is Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary. If confirmed, Scott will oversee the IRS and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network—two agencies critical to creating clear tax and compliance policies for crypto. Trump’s policies are addressing longstanding frustrations from Wall Street. One major complaint has been the SEC’s 2022 accounting rule, known as SAB 121, which forced banks to classify cryptocurrencies as liabilities on their balance sheets. This rule discouraged banks from offering crypto custody services by imposing strict capital requirements. But as Cryptopolitan reported on Jan. 23rd, the SEC rescinded SAB 121, removing one of the biggest roadblocks for financial institutions looking to engage with digital assets. “Bye, bye SAB 121! It’s not been fun,” said SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who was tapped on Tuesday to lead a new “crypto task force.” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, also speaking in Davos, welcomed the changes. “If the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you’ll find that the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it,” he said. He pointed to crypto’s potential as a payment system, comparing it to Visa or Apple Pay. However, Moynihan steered clear of endorsing cryptos as investment assets, calling that “a separate question.” Bitcoin’s price has of course responded to the optimism. On Monday, it surged to nearly $110,000—its highest price ever—before settling at around $106,000 as of press time. Banks lobby for clear rules as adoption grows While the SEC’s actions have brought a lot of excitement, Wall Street is still grappling with other regulatory issues. Anti-money laundering (AML) rules remain a sticking point, as inconsistent guidelines make it difficult for banks to serve certain industries. Jamie Dimon, the anti-crypto CEO of JPMorgan Chase, summed up the frustration on a podcast earlier this week: “There should be far cleaner lines about what we have to do and what we don’t have to do. We’ve been complaining about this for years. We need to fix it.” Wall Street CEOs are also lobbying for a unified federal standard to replace the patchwork of state laws that complicate compliance. Trump’s administration is being pressured to address these challenges as part of its broader effort to streamline crypto regulation. Though on Thursday, Trump criticized JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, accusing them of denying services to conservative customers. The issue, known as “debanking,” has long been a Republican talking point. “We take this issue very seriously,” Bank of America said on Friday. “We will be engaging with the administration and Congress regarding the extensive government regulations that sometimes result in requirements to exit relationships.” The renewed focus on AML rules comes after a 2020 law aimed at overhauling these regulations fell short of its goals. Banks continue to push for clearer guidelines, arguing that inconsistent rules force them to walk away from certain clients and industries out of fear of penalties.

Speculation about Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and its potential role in the financial framework has gained momentum, fueled by crypto commentators like Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy. Ripple’s RLUSD and Federal Oversight Speculations Farina recently shared his views on X, proposing that the U.S. government could transfer Ripple’s escrowed XRP into federal reserves, effectively taking control of the asset. He argued that RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin launched in December 2024 , might serve as a central currency while adhering to regulatory standards. I speculate the Escrow is transferred to the U.S. stockpile, with the Gov. effectively taking control of $XRP while maintaining regulatory oversight. RLUSD becomes the CBDC. Chess, not checkers. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) January 23, 2025 One commenter echoed this speculation, stating , “Your speculation looks pretty good to me… Australia has had its CBDC set up for at least a couple of years, but has gone totally under the radar.” This highlights how other nations have approached digital currencies differently, creating a point of comparison for the U.S. financial strategy. However, considering Trump’s recent ban on CBDCs, he might have different plans for the U.S. crypto industry. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Ban on CBDCs and RLUSD’s Unique Position Trump’s executive order banning CBDCs leaves room for stablecoins like RLUSD to act as alternatives. One commenter noted , “RLUSD will act as a central currency.” This perspective suggests that RLUSD could fulfill functions similar to a CBDC while operating within private-sector boundaries. This explanation also aligns with a recent analysis from Austin King, a former Ripple employee, who believes Trump will empower the private sector and companies like Ripple through his crypto initiatives. By leveraging its stablecoin, Ripple could bridge the gap between private innovation and government oversight. Ripple’s blockchain infrastructure, known for its speed and efficiency, may position RLUSD as a practical solution for governments seeking digital currency innovation without creating centralized government-issued digital currencies. This approach could align with the U.S. government’s objectives under the new executive order. Ripple’s emphasis on regulatory compliance, like RLUSD’s NYDFS certification, also serves as a strong foundation for the asset. Ripple’s partnerships with international financial institutions XRP and RLUSD and Ripple’s technology could potentially become critical components in the U.S. financial ecosystem.

Hitler Musk (HITMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HITMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Hitler Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Hitler Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Hitler Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Hitler Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Hitler Musk by entering its contract address (CA) – GB5uSMr95szepTSfj6sbJHFxMaBHwwyBzUY6dPAWZCCH – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HITMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 05:00:32

Some Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are growing weary of the asset’s inherent volatility and are now seeking projects that might bring more stability. Among these sits Remittix (RTX), a powerful PayFi solution currently gaining traction in its presale for its modern approach to cross-border payments. So can Dogecoin (DOGE) bounce back and what is all the fuss about Remittix (RTX) ? Dogecoin Sees 8.4% Price Drop Dogecoin is down 6.58% in 24hrs and currently trades at $0.3713. Dogecoin (DOGE) is now trading near a key support level at $0.39 The RSI suggests that Dogecoin may be approaching oversold territory, which could precede a possible short term recovery. Conversely, the MACD dropped below the signal line indicating bearish sentiments for Dogecoin (DOGE) in the coming days. Interestingly, activity on the Dogecoin network has spiked recently. Address activity has hit a seven month high and whale transactions have peaked. Much like with other meme coins, Dogecoin’s current volatility makes it hard to predict what might happen next. Remittix Changes the Game for Cross-Border Payments The Remittix (RTX) platform lets you convert more than 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies and send money directly to bank accounts worldwide. Unlike traditional systems with unpredictable fees, Remittix uses a flat fee model, ensuring recipients know the exact amount being sent. Such a simple operational model and the low costs associated with Remittix make it a solid choice for both individuals and businesses. Another key feature contributing to Remittix’s (RTX) broad adoption is its ability to integrate with traditional financial infrastructures. Unlike many blockchain based solutions demanding technical expertise, Remittix ensures recipients experience benefit from crypto payments while enjoying the simplicity of traditional bank transfers and without needing a deep understanding of the crypto space. The straightforwardness of this system removes barriers to access, bridging the gap between digital assets and mainstream financial networks. Remittix (RTX) is also setting an example with its commitment to financial inclusion. RTX offers round the clock access to a global payment system that eliminates the limitations of traditional banking systems; the platform lets users in underbanked regions participate in global commerce. This accessibility, its instant settlement capabilities and transparent fee model, position Remittix as a major player in bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology. Remittix Powers Through Presale, Passing $7 Million Remittix (RTX) is currently seeing dominance in its presale, which has already raised over $7 million with tokens on offer for an enticing price of just $0.0350. As utility focused projects are becoming more of a priority in the crypto space, Remittix shines above others for its ability to solve real world problems and analysts anticipate a steep price gain of 800% in the presale alone. As it positions itself to dominate the prosperous cross-border payments space, Remittix is not a project to miss out on in 2025.

The SHIB token peaked at $0.00003340 in December and has plunged by about 40% to the current $0.00002. So, is the SHIB coin a good buy as a death cross approaches? Shiba Inu coin price technical analysis: death cross pattern nears The daily chart shows that the SHIB price peaked at $0.00003340 and then retreated to the psychological point at $0.000020. Technicals suggest that the SHIB coin has more downside. It has formed what looks like a head-and-shoulders pattern, which often leads to more downside in the longer term. The coin is also about to form a death cross pattern, which happens when the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages (WMA) cross each other. The spread between the two averages has continued to narrow, and currently stands at just 3.1%, down from over 10% a few days ago. A death cross is often seen as being one of the riskiest chart patterns in the financial market. That’s because it is a sign that bears have overcome the bulls, which leads to more downside. The coin has also formed a double-top chart pattern at $0.00002490. Like the death cross, this is also a highly popular bearish chart patterns. The Shiba Inu price has also moved to the closely watched 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, there is a risk that the coin will have a strong bearish breakdown in the next few weeks. If this happens, the next price to watch will be $0.00001850, its lowest swing on December 20. A drop below that support level will point to more downside, potentially to the 78.6% point at $0.00001568, down by 23% below the current point. Shiba Inu’s bearish outlook will remain as long as it is below the double-top point at $0.00002490. Why has SHIB coin crashed? There are two main reasons why the Shiba Inu price has crashed in the past few months. First, it has plunged as investors have rotated to newer and shinier meme coins. Most recently, they moved to the Official Trump and Melania meme coins that surged before the inauguration. Some cash moved from old meme tokens to these ones as investors looked for strong gains. A good example is the daily volume figures . SHIB had a 24-hour volume of $163 million, much lower than Official Trump’s $4.45 billion and Pudgy Penguins’ $169 million. Melania Trump’s meme coin had a daily volume of $215 million. Second, while the Shibarium is growing, data shows that the fees collected have continued falling. Shibarium’s completed transactions jumped to over 847 million, an impressive figure for a recently launched network. The average transaction fee has dropped 0.000064 BONE from 0.0003 BONE a month earlier. At the same time, the total sum of BONE fees collected by the network has continued to fall thos year and stands at less than 400 BONE per day. These fees are important because they signal whether the layer-2 network is growing or not. They are also crucial because their impact on Shibarium’s burn rate has dropped.

Many of them provide safe trends for traders to invest in. Certain coins have been tipped to increase by 1000x in 2025. PEPE’s price prediction shows it is on course to achieve this feat. Other new projects like Panshibi ($SHIBI) have also been tipped to achieve this feat. Let’s find out why! PEPE price prediction: whale accumulation suggests future gains amidst a price decrease PEPE is on course for an explosive price gain in 2025. Although its price at the moment may not depict this prediction, experts believe accumulation by whales could propel it to a new ATH. It is reduced by 4.02% today with a price of $0.00001512. Recent blockchain data shows that major investors have strategically bought PEPE during this dip. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently bought 508.6 million PEPE tokens. This action by a major investor in the crypto world has further fueled market speculations that PEPE could experience a 1000x increase in 2025. Vitalik Buterin’s endorsement, the increasing social media presence, and active addresses also reinforce PEPE’s price prediction. Experts also believe that PEPE’s double bottom formation at a critical support level and its bullish falling wedge are major signs of an incoming sustained increase.

The Russian president said that he is optimistic direct talks with Trump could lead to mutually beneficial outcomes, emphasizing the need for “calm and realistic discussions.” Putin then criticized Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, pointing to a decree Zelenskiy signed that prohibits Ukraine from negotiating with him. This, according to Putin, complicates the possibility of peace talks. “We are ready to talk,” he said in the interview, but added that progress depends heavily on the choices made by the current US administration. NATO praises Trump’s push for sanctions NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte was also quick to applaud Trump’s call for tougher sanctions and tariffs on Russia. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Rutte said, “I was very, very happy with Trump’s position to put more sanctions on Russia. The Russian economy is in terrible shape, and these measures will help squeeze it further.” He also urged European nations to follow Trump’s lead, encouraging them to increase their economic pressure on Moscow to deplete Russia’s war funds. Rutte pointed out the importance of a sustainable resolution to the war, adding that any peace deal should prevent Russia from regaining its territorial ambitions. He warned that Russia’s allies, including China and North Korea, would celebrate a weak settlement, which would embolden Moscow to attempt even more land grabs. “We must reach a position where Russia will never again dare to take even one square kilometer of Ukraine,” Rutte said. On Jan. 22nd, president Trump issued a warning through his Truth Social platform: “If no deal is reached to end the war, we’ll have no choice but to impose high tariffs, taxes, and sanctions on anything Russia sells to the US or our allies.” He added , “Let’s get this war—one that never would’ve started if I were president—over with. We can do it the easy way or the hard way.” Financial giants weigh in on Trump’s tariff strategy Wall Street leaders have chimed in on Trump’s escalating trade threats, offering varied perspectives. At the Davos event, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledged concerns about inflation and trade wars but said tariffs could be effective if used strategically. “If it’s a little inflationary but good for national security, so be it,” he said. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon suggested in an interview with CNBC that Trump’s tariffs might serve as leverage to renegotiate global trade agreements. He added that how quickly and thoughtfully these measures are implemented would determine their effectiveness. Trump’s tariff threats extend beyond Russia. He has promised to impose a 10% levy on Chinese goods and a 25% tariff on products from Canada and Mexico. The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a key deal negotiated during Trump’s first term, is up for review in 2026. Trump has also accused the European Union of unfair trade practices, pointing to the $214 billion trade deficit the US recorded with the EU in 2024.

Dogecoin News: Key Factors That Could Drive the DOGE Price Dogecoin has started 2025 on a positive note, showing strong growth in January.

Currently, the Dogecoin price is at $0.356 and if it continues its uptrend, DOGE could get near its ATH from May 2021. For Dogecoin to reach one dollar by March, three key factors could drive this price surge. First, wider adoption by retailers would boost demand, helping to increase its value. Second, a continued positive market outlook and more activity from whales could generate enough momentum to push the price higher. Also, if Dogecoin can break through important resistance levels, it could signal a stronger bullish trend, which would bring it closer to the one-dollar target. Join the $SHIBI Presale Today!

Bitcoin (BTC) and leading cryptocurrencies have consolidated over the past week, sparking speculations despite pro-cryptocurrency Donald Trump’s inauguration. Whereas, meme coins Shiba Inu (SHIB) and VINE have emerged as the talk of the cryptocurrency town over the week, gaining significant traction in light of broader trends and developments. Here’s a brief report on some of the top cryptocurrency market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. BTC & Top Crypto Mainly Consolidate Notably, BTC price chart has shown a period of sideways trading despite the broader market eagerly anticipating gains following Trump’s inauguration. Bitcoin price closed the week near the $105K level, up marginally by 0.1% in the past seven days. The flagship crypto’s current price trajectory comes despite bullish news for the asset surfacing across the industry. With the recent rescinding of SAB 121 , market participants have been highly positive on Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Further, Semler Scientific announced that it would raise $85 million in convertible notes to invest in BTC this week. This mover has sparked investor interest, paving a bullish road for the flagship coin in the light of heightened buying. Meanwhile, investment management company BlackRock sought U.S. SEC approval for its new redemption model for the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Overall, these events have emerged as highly optimistic news for the broader BTC market. Nevertheless, the asset continues to consolidate, raising investor speculation and uncertainty. CoinGape reported that China likely dumped a whopping 194K BTC recently, which falls in line with the current consolidation despite broader bullish developments. ETH & XRP Market Uncertain On the other hand, top crypto such as Ethereum (ETH) and XRP have also shown similar price actions. Notably, ETH closes the week at the $3,300 level, up by 0.5% over the week. Further, XRP also illustrated a sideways trading session, although the coin holds above $3. Ethereum’s consolidation raises severe uncertainty as ETH OI conversely rose to high levels recently, signaling a price breakout awaits the asset. Simultaneously, despite new XRP ETF filings reported this week, even the Ripple-backed asset consolidates, raising investor speculations. Meme Crypto SHIB & VINE Spark Buzz Meanwhile, the meme coins SHIB and VINE have stolen the spotlight, with the dog-themed crypto witnessing ecosystem developments and VINE seeing major listings amid heightened market interest. Notably, the Shiba Inu coin’s community introduced the revolutionary ShibOS (Shib Operating System) this week, offering users various use cases for a seamless Web2 to Web3 transition. On the other hand, with speculations of Vine social media app’s revival soaring, the Vine meme coin has gained substantial traction. Intriguingly, the token enjoys a bullish trend, securing major listings, witnessing an OI surge, and aiding traders in making massive profits. As a result, CoinGape reported that the Vine meme coin price could hit $1 shortly ahead. Overall, the abovementioned news emerged as some of the most buzzworthy topics reported by CoinGape over the past week.

Navigating the Meme Coin Mania Amid Market Uncertainties",https://nulltx.com/bonk-bonk-boom-or-bust-navigating-the-meme-coin-mania-amid-market-uncertainties/,"The crypto market consistently manages to astonish, and the recent fervor surrounding meme coins has infused yet another layer of interest. As of the most recent information available, the price of meme coins like Bonk has experienced a 24-hour change of -1.37%, with a market cap of $2.24 billion and a trading volume of $0.14 billion, placing it at #65 in the market [Source: coinmarketcap.com ]. Market Overview In recent weeks, the meme coin market has taken Bonk for a rollercoaster ride. Right now, though, the meme coin for dogs is worth nothing—literally $0, which is a change of -1.37% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Over the past week, trading has been just as equally wild, with the last 30 days highlighting Bonk’s performance unpredictability. If we can glean any insights from the last few months, it’s that coin flipping is a better way to determine price movement than any kind of technical analysis. Given its position at number 65, Bonk doesn’t really have a place in the market; it’s just kind of floating around out there in space. No key support levels have been established yet. When you look at a chart of Bonk, the resistances and supports are the first thing that pops out, considering how close resistance is to current price levels and how significant support is to investors who were lucky enough to snag Bonk at 4.8 cents or below. Recent News & Developments Investors and analysts have been paying close attention to a few key happenings. The filing for a $BONK ETF, now alongside the $DOGE and $TRUMP ETFs, suggests another potential access point for institutional investors to meme coins [ Source: coindesk.com ]. This development could provide a much-needed structure for investing in the meme coin space and thus could impact the market in a substantial way. The meme coin race is not going away. Indeed, we now have the first meme coin from Pi Network, PIDOG, which adds to the sheer absurdity of it all [ Source: minepi.com ]. Inside Bitcoins pointed out the potential of meme coins like $TRUMP, $DOGE, $BONK, and $WEPE ahead of ETF approvals, asserting that ‘Trump’s crypto-friendly stance signals big changes ahead.’ [ Source: insidebitcoins.com ] This political endorsement could instill a shot of investor confidence in these somewhat silly ‘meme’ coins, bringing them to heights we can’t even fathom, which is kind of the point. Technical Analysis Bonk and other meme coins have technical charts that show a mix of bullish and bearish patterns. The recent price movement has generated a symmetrical triangle, which could go either way depending on what the market thinks. If we look at the key indicators (such as the Relative Strength Index or the Moving Average Convergence Divergence), they are not offering much help since they seem to be in wait-and-see mode, neither catechizing bulls to charge forth nor calling bears to maul [ Source: tradingview.com ]. Analyzing volume shows trading activity that is balanced but not abundant. This is evident in the spikes related to major news events. The recent price levels that need to be watched are the recent highs and lows, which will function as the resistance and support that all prices must traverse. The trading activity itself has been a kind of short-term speculative hustle, without yet any long-term trend to speak of. Social & On-Chain Analysis Metrics assessing social sentiment indicate a bifurcated community. On the one hand, some users exude an almost naive optimism, seeing so much potential in the current market that they believe Bitcoin (BTC) is on an express train to $150,000 and that Dogecoin (DOGE) is poised to reach $1 [ Source: santiment.net ]. Yet, there are also many market participants expressing the exact opposite kind of sentiment. They see the current meme coin market and its broader crypto context as ‘doomer’ prone and in a dangerous vulnerable state. Indeed, the meme coin market is such an exciting flashpoint that institutional access to this segment of the crypto market has become a topic of conversation, especially in light of the $BONK ETF filing [ Source: coindesk.com ]. The actions of whales are well known, and any large transactions could potentially be influencing price action. Those most likely to spend a lot of money on meme coins are now doing so, which might be driving the uptick in network activity. And what about developer activity? It’s not quite what we see in other sectors, but there is some level of innovation really taking place in the meme coin space. Market Context & Future Outlook The correlation between the meme coin market and the broader cryptocurrency market is clear. Investors in meme coins look first to Bitcoin and Ethereum for guidance. These two coins are the performance leaders for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Notably, regulatory developments could soon provide a much clearer framework for the entire crypto market, including meme coins, which could serve to either legitimize or delegitimize this market sector. Projected prices are all over the place, with some analysts forecasting this year’s total meme coin market cap at between $300 billion to $500 billion [ Source: santiment.net ]. The meme coin market’s wild price swings make anything close to a sure bet very, very risky. Investors should stick to what is likely sensible and invest in meme coins with cash that can stand the loss of going to zero. In summation , the meme coin mania as seen with Bonk, remains quite en vogue within the crypto community. Although the market has not been favorable, recent developments infused with a healthy dose of social sentiment indicate a crypto space that is simultaneously chock-full of optimism yet also displaying caution. On a technical basis, the market is in a neutral formation and is best watched for the potential breakout or breakdown that is sure to happen soon. Verdict: future potentially bright—but investors must watch for the market’s next move, given its current unpredictability. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Trump Buys XRP (TRUMPXRP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPXRP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Buys XRP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys XRP could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys XRP launched with over $32,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys XRP on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys XRP by entering its contract address (CA) – HjQUfYDa2vgcG3AYb8z5Sernxm1ttRfhjL4N7A65BY7x – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPXRP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|XRP|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 05:42:00

These models are fifty times more efficient than even top U.S. offerings. The announcement has thrown American tech giants like OpenAI, Google, and Meta into a full-blown crisis, as their closed-door strategies suddenly stop cutting it. Now everyone on X is mocking them. For those confused why the US state and Silicon Valley are having a meltdown on twitter today. China released multiple AI models that are 50x more efficient than the best American AI models and made them open source, ruining the AI market — ashok kumar 🇵🇸 (@broseph_stalin) January 25, 2025 The man behind this shockwave is Liang Wenfeng, a hedge fund manager who turned a side project into one of the most disruptive AI advancements in history. DeepSeek’s R1 model is a self-learning system that can improve on its own without human oversight. And here’s what’s making Silicon Valley sweat: Liang is leveling the playing field for anyone—whether in China or anywhere else—looking to jump into AI development. Liang Wenfeng’s long game In 2021, while everyone else in China’s AI scene was focused on big tech, Liang quietly bought thousands of Nvidia graphic processing units (GPUs) and started experimenting with AI. People in the industry thought he was just another billionaire chasing a hobby. According to a business partner who reportedly spoke to the Financial Times, “When he told us he wanted to build a 10,000-chip cluster, we thought he was crazy. He didn’t even explain why, just said, ‘This will change everything.’” Fast forward to 2023, and Liang launched DeepSeek, hiring top AI engineers straight from his hedge fund. Using profits from the hedge fund High-Flyer, he built a team that not only understood AI but also mastered the infrastructure behind it. By 2024, DeepSeek had developed R1, a language model that industry insiders describe as a direct challenge to every major AI player in the U.S. Unlike its American competitors, DeepSeek wasn’t interested in commercialization. It focused entirely on research, with Liang using his own money to fund the operation. “DeepSeek’s offices feel like a university lab,” said the Financial Times. Based in Beijing and Hangzhou, the lab employs some of the best AI minds in China, offering salaries that rival TikTok-owner ByteDance. Liang’s singular goal, according to the report, was to prove that China could innovate on the same level as the U.S., and now he has done it. The timing couldn’t have been more deliberate either. Liang’s release of the R1 model coincided with his appearance at a high-profile meeting in Beijing led by Li Qiang, China’s second most powerful politician. Liang was the only AI leader invited. Li told the entrepreneurs present to focus on breaking through key technologies — a clear nod to China’s ambition to outpace the U.S. in AI development. Something tells us US president Donald Trump is not too happy about that. Silicon Valley’s scramble to catch up American tech giants, caught off guard, are now scrambling to respond. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a $100 billion joint venture with Japan’s SoftBank, dubbed Stargate, aimed at building new AI infrastructure in the U.S. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s xAI is expanding its Colossus supercomputer, planning to deploy over one million GPUs to train its Grok AI models. Google, Meta, and Anthropic are also throwing billions into upgrading their computing clusters with Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips. But the U.S. companies have one major disadvantage: secrecy. For years, Silicon Valley has operated on a closed-door model, keeping AI breakthroughs locked behind proprietary systems. DeepSeek’s decision to make R1 open source has flipped that narrative. This has triggered a wave of panic in the U.S., where companies now face pressure to decide whether to follow DeepSeek’s lead. But there are also concerns about whether DeepSeek can maintain its momentum. Despite its success, the company’s resources are admittedly limited compared to U.S. giants. “They’ve built one of the largest computing clusters in China,” said a source familiar with the company. “But compared to what OpenAI and Google are building, it’s not enough. They’ll need to scale up if they want to keep up.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",AI|DeepSeek|OpenAI,EN,0,0,ASIA|ZRX|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-26 05:52:50

Ripple CEO Weighs In,https://timestabloid.com/will-xrp-be-in-the-u-s-crypto-reserve-ripple-ceo-weighs-in/,"Discussions surrounding the inclusion of XRP in a potential U.S. strategic digital asset reserve have gained momentum following an executive order signed by former President Donald Trump. This order, introduced just days into his presidency, seeks to establish a comprehensive framework for digital asset regulation while exploring the concept of a national digital asset stockpile . Executive Order Sparks Debate The executive order directs the formation of a Presidential Working Group dedicated to assessing the future of digital assets within the United States. According to Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, the group’s focus extends beyond regulatory clarity to include the potential establishment of a strategic digital asset reserve. Initial speculation suggested that such a reserve would primarily feature Bitcoin. However, recent discussions have expanded the scope to consider other assets, including XRP. Scott Melker, host of The Wolf of All Streets Podcast, also hinted at this development. Reports indicate that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was among the crypto executives who recently met with President Trump. This interaction has further fueled speculation about XRP’s potential role in the proposed reserve. Criticism from Bitcoin Maximalists The idea of diversifying the reserve has not been universally accepted. Pierre Rochard, Vice President of Research at Riot Platforms, opposed XRP’s inclusion. He claimed Ripple and XRP pose the biggest threat to a Bitcoin-based reserve, accusing Ripple of lobbying to block a Bitcoin-exclusive reserve while advancing its CBDC initiatives. Rochard argued the administration initially aimed to make Bitcoin the foundation of a national reserve, but Ripple’s lobbying undermines this goal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Stance on Digital Asset Diversification Replying to Rochard, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse dismissed claims that the company lobbying is at odds with the administration’s goals. Instead, Ripple’s engagement with policymakers is to foster innovation and support American companies. Unless you are choosing to ignore the core tenants of the POTUS campaign (which aggressively supports American companies and technologies), our efforts are actually INCREASING the likelihood of a crypto strategic reserve (which includes bitcoin) happening. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 23, 2025 One community member shared a video where Garlinghouse suggested that a digital asset reserve should not be limited to Bitcoin but adopt a diversified approach. Other Experts Weigh In Vet (@Vet_X0), a validator on the XRP Ledger, also weighed in, stating that Rochard and people like him are the true obstacles to the crypto reserve, as they fail to see the benefits of the broader crypto industry for society. A report from the New York Post supported this perspective, suggesting that the administration might prioritize American-developed assets such as XRP, Solana, and USDC in its plans. Meanwhile, criticisms from the Bitcoin community continue to emerge, with some alleging that Ripple’s financial contributions to political initiatives have influenced policy decisions. However, this view was recently debunked by a former Ripple employee, who explained the reasons for Ripple’s financial involvement in politics.

With trends like Arctic Pablo’s mystical adventures and innovative projects like Notcoin and Dogs, the crypto space is buzzing with excitement. Arctic Pablo’s presale, in particular, is already making waves, boasting an impressive ROI and a narrative-driven investment approach that has captured the hearts of Gen Z and Millennials alike. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the top crypto that’s redefining the meme coin space. From Arctic Pablo’s mythological journey to Notcoin’s tech-driven tokenomics and Dogs’ community-first approach, we’ll uncover why these projects deserve your attention. Let’s explore how Arctic Pablo, the star of the current presale, brings adventure and ROI together like never before. Arctic Pablo: The Mystical Explorer Redefining the Top Crypto Presale In the frozen expanse of the Arctic, Arctic Pablo isn’t just any adventurer; he’s a legend in the making. Guided by a mythical map, Pablo embarks on a journey across hidden locations, uncovering treasures that promise wealth and wonder. The $APC coin isn’t just a currency—it’s a ticket to join this epic adventure. What makes Arctic Pablo unique is its location-based presale model. Instead of traditional stages, the presale moves with Pablo as he ventures to new realms. Currently, Arctic Pablo is in the El Dorado location, where $APC is priced at just $0.000038. With a final presale price of $0.0008 and a launch price of $0.008, early investors stand to gain an ROI of 20,000% by the time the token lists. The presale has already raised over $440,000 in just 15 days. This pace, coupled with the weekly token burns, ensures that $APC remains a hot commodity. Investors who act now can secure their share before Pablo’s next stop, the Glacier Grove. With no fixed timeline for each location, Pablo’s journey is unpredictable, adding an element of excitement to the presale. Combine this with a 66% APY staking program, and the rewards are undeniable. Staking allows investors to grow their holdings while becoming active participants in Arctic Pablo’s journey, fostering community engagement and long-term value. Arctic Pablo isn’t just a coin; it’s an experience. Its deflationary model, driven by weekly burns, ensures scarcity and value growth. The ecosystem is built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering low fees and high scalability. The presale’s unique storytelling, combined with its ROI potential, makes Arctic Pablo a standout in the top crypto presale landscape. Notcoin: The Tech-Powered Challenger While Arctic Pablo captivates with its narrative-driven approach, Notcoin takes a different route—it’s all about tech and utility. Positioned as the “anti-meme” coin, Notcoin appeals to those looking for a serious, tech-focused project in the crypto space. At its core, Notcoin aims to provide real-world solutions through blockchain technology. Unlike many meme coins, it emphasizes transparency and functionality. Built on Ethereum, Notcoin boasts an advanced smart contract system that facilitates secure, fast, and cost-effective transactions. Its primary goal is to simplify blockchain adoption for businesses and individuals, making it a go-to choice for those seeking practicality. Notcoin’s tokenomics further set it apart. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens, its distribution ensures sustainability and fairness. Fifty percent of the supply is allocated to community rewards, fostering long-term engagement. The remaining tokens are divided between liquidity pools, development, and marketing, ensuring the project’s growth and stability. Dogs: The Community-Driven Meme Coin Rounding out this trio is Dogs, a meme coin that takes community engagement to the next level. Inspired by the internet’s love for dog memes, Dogs leverages this universal appeal to create a token that’s fun, relatable, and highly engaging. Dogs’ strength lies in its community-first approach. From the outset, the project has prioritized transparency and inclusivity. Its development team frequently interacts with the community, hosting AMAs and voting sessions to ensure that every voice is heard. This level of engagement fosters trust and loyalty, making Dogs a standout in the crowded meme coin market. The tokenomics of Dogs are designed to reward holders and encourage long-term commitment. With a total supply of 500 billion tokens, the project employs a deflationary model similar to Arctic Pablo’s. Weekly token burns reduce the circulating supply, increasing scarcity and boosting value. Additionally, Dogs offers a staking program with an impressive APY, allowing investors to grow their holdings while supporting the ecosystem. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo, Notcoin, and Dogs represent unique opportunities in the ever-expanding crypto market. While each project has its strengths, Arctic Pablo stands out as the top crypto presale. Its adventurous narrative, location-based presale model, and staggering ROI potential make it a must-watch for investors. If you’re ready to join the journey, there’s no better time than now. With Arctic Pablo’s current location offering $APC at $0.000038, the window to secure life-changing gains is closing fast. Don’t miss out on the chance to turn a modest investment into a fortune. Join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now and be part of an epic adventure that bridges myth and reality.

Remittix (RTX) , an under-the-radar altcoin , is now attracting a lot of attention. Early investors are already getting notable returns as they have seen over 80% ROIs in just three weeks. Is it the creative approach to cross-border payments, the modern technology, or something far more promising that is resulting in the quick growth? Read on to discover how Remittix is quickly rising to be a major rival in the crypto market, surpassing Ethereum and Cardano. Ethereum (ETH) Displays Resilience Amid Market Swings Over the past week, the Ethereum price has exhibited notable growth, climbing by more than 2% despite some very noticeable swings. The Ethereum price chart shows that the altcoin has been facing a struggle between buyers and sellers by consolidating between $3,540 and $3,120. Although the week closed on a good note, the last month showed a somewhat bearish trend as the Ethereum price dropped by less than 1% among notable volatility. After a resistance level of $3,700, the Ethereum price fell to the $3,000 support zone; nevertheless, it quickly recovered ground and exceeded $3,200. Ethereum (ETH) is among the top altcoins traders looking for good prospects in the crypto market. Moreover, Ethereum (ETH) still has a strong bullish mood among its community even though it is almost 32% below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,891. Driven by the altcoin’s strong foundations and technical strength, analysts remain confident about a probable retest of its ATH this year. Though the Momentum Oscillator displays warnings with sell signals , indicators like the MACD and Moving Averages are pointing to buy chances on the Ethereum price chart . Cardano (ADA) Prepares For a Notable Growth Though the Cardano price has slightly dropped over 3% this past week, the swings reveal a more complex picture. The Cardano price chart shows that the altcoin has been between $1.18 to $0.95, exhibiting a period of volatility and possible buildup. The preceding month showed a more bullish trend despite this temporary fall as the Cardano price jumped over 10%, showing 8.52% price volatility and 18 green days out of 30. Cardano (ADA) is one of the promising altcoins to watch for traders and investors given its solid performance and the very positive attitude of the community. Looking forward, a convincing Cardano price prediction supports hope about its near-term direction. Analysts think the altcoin might revisit its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10 within this year, a possible milestone that has sparked ADA interest once more. Moreover, a 2025 Cardano price prediction points to the altcoin perhaps trading within a broad range between $0.99 and $5.10. Cardano (ADA) is still a promising asset with technical indicators showing the potential for long-term growth.

XRP is approaching the end of a triangle pattern, which typically indicates that a decision point is near. The market must now decide which direction to take as XRP is currently stuck in the range of $3.08-$3.14. The price is also down by more than 2 percent on the weekly chart. Elliott Wave Analysis for XRP Using Elliott Wave analysis, a popular sentiment-based method for predicting market movements, analysts anticipate higher prices for XRP in the near future . However, this does not guarantee that the breakout will be upwards right away. There could be a small dip before a rise, but as long as any pullbacks are corrective in nature (slow, overlapping movements), the longer-term trend remains bullish. These corrections are expected to hold above key support levels, particularly the $2.52 level. Key Support and Resistance Levels The triangle pattern on XRP’s chart completed on January 13th, marking the end of the current consolidation phase. From an Elliot Wave perspective, this could signal the beginning of a larger five-wave move to the upside. The critical support level to watch is $2.52; a break below this could signal a shift in the market’s direction, introducing more uncertainty. A decisive break below this support would suggest a potential deeper correction. On the upside, if XRP successfully breaks through resistance, the next target levels to watch are around $4.20 and eventually the $5 mark. These Fibonacci extension levels will give us an indication of the price movement in the coming weeks. With the triangle formation nearing completion, a breakout is expected soon, but it might take some time to materialize. Volume tends to be lower on weekends, so it’s possible the price could dance around key support levels until more decisive moves occur early next week.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-26 06:19:16

Kamala Sucks (KAMASUCK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because KAMASUCK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Kamala Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Kamala Sucks could become the next viral memecoin. Kamala Sucks launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Kamala Sucks on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kamala Sucks by entering its contract address (CA) – KFywQqjGH3WdEQ4hR42oYQ17v4nSePom6AjyJc8TNfU – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like KAMASUCK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 06:24:00

This follows a consistent bullish trend and the anticipation of unlocking 2% of its total supply in February. But while SUI impresses, another contender, Nebula Stride (NST), is emerging as a game-changer poised to revolutionize how we think about crypto and real-world assets. SUI’s Recent Price Performance and Developments SUI is at the forefront with the introduction of Mystceti V2 consensus and Remora scaling, innovations set to revolutionize blockchain efficiency by 2025. These developments aim to process up to 120,000 transactions per second, positioning SUI as a direct competitor to Solana. Additionally, privacy enhancements through zero-knowledge proofs are on the horizon, promising a more secure user experience. The market has responded positively, with SUI hitting a new all-time high in stablecoins, up 25.78% within the last 30 days. SUI’s upward trajectory is hard to ignore. Source: @x0mario Additionally, from $0.90 in August 2024 to an all-time high of $5.35 on Jan 06, 2025, the token has grown exponentially. SUI has also achieved a significant milestone with 50 million accounts, solidifying its position as a leading Layer-1 blockchain. The Total Value Locked (TVL) in Sui’s ecosystem soared to $1.75 billion by December 2024, showcasing increased investor confidence and activity. Despite retracing slightly to the current value of $4.17, recent charts show SUI printing a Hidden Bullish Divergence on the RSI, suggesting potential for continued upward movement. Analysts on X have noted SUI’s price movement mirroring Bitcoin’s during the 2017 bull market, indicating strong bullish momentum. However, while SUI celebrates its achievements, another cryptocurrency, Nebula Stride (NST), is poised to potentially eclipse these gains with its unique proposition: Nebula Stride (NST): Bridging the Gap Between Crypto and Real-World Assets Nebula Stride (NST) is transforming the blockchain landscape by allowing fractional ownership of tangible assets like real estate, art, and commodities. This opens up a market previously inaccessible to the average investor, potentially fueling massive adoption and price surges for NST. Emerging as one of the top RWA tokens and early-stage cryptocurrencies , NST is priced at a mere $0.02, offering a low entry barrier with significant upside potential as the tokenization of real-world assets gains traction. The platform’s focus on user-friendly infrastructure and tangible asset investment could lead to high returns for early investors. NST supports both institutional and individual investors through a robust ecosystem that includes asset management tools, educational platforms, and microloans. This inclusivity broadens its appeal, aiming to create one of the pioneers in the RWA sector. Nebula Stride (NST) Tokenomics Why NST Could Outshine SUI While SUI excels in blockchain performance, NST’s focus on RWAs gives it a unique edge. Here’s why: Broader appeal : NST’s integration with real-world assets attracts a diverse audience, including traditional investors seeking exposure to tokenized assets. Mass adoption potential: By simplifying access to high-value investments, NST can drive widespread adoption beyond the crypto community. Market disruption: Tokenizing RWAs could disrupt traditional investment sectors, unlocking new opportunities for both individual and institutional investors. Tangible utility: Unlike SUI, which primarily enhances blockchain efficiency, NST offers a direct connection to the physical economy, fostering stability and long-term growth, as one of the best new cryptocurrencies to invest in . Final Thoughts: The Road Ahead for SUI and Nebula Strides SUI’s developments in technology and expanding ecosystem, position it as a strong contender in the blockchain arena. Nevertheless, Nebula Stride’s pioneering approach of tokenizing real-world assets makes it a significant competitor for future leadership. Thanks to its affordable entry cost, adaptable infrastructure, and practical uses, NST is set to not only support but possibly surpass SUI in the cryptocurrency arena. As the industry evolves, both SUI and NST demonstrate the immense potential of blockchain technology. While SUI sets new standards for performance and scalability, NST’s focus on bridging digital and physical assets could redefine the crypto space. Investors should keep a close eye on both projects as they navigate the exciting and rapidly changing world of blockchain innovation.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/software-engineer-to-xrp-holders-things-about-to-happen-heres-why/,"The XRP community recently took note of an unusual market trend highlighted by Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode), a crypto expert active on X. Van Code shared an image of the XRP/USDT order book, emphasizing the minimal sell-side activity. He described this situation as “calm before the storm” and expressed confidence in significant developments for XRP holders. In all my years follow #XRP I have never seen an order book with so little sellers. I see this as calm before the storm. Things about to happen in my opinion. Exiting times my fellow HODLERS pic.twitter.com/gy0Ypr7jnh — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) January 23, 2025 Observations on the Order Book The shared order book reveals a striking imbalance between buy and sell orders, with 57.92% representing bids and only 42.08% attributed to asks. Notably, the sell orders are concentrated at higher price points, such as $3.2, $3.3, and $3.4. This scarcity of active sellers is unusual within the XRP market, which typically experiences greater activity on both sides. The absence of substantial sell pressure suggests that current holders are optimistic and potentially expecting higher prices soon. The bid side, however, appears robust, with significant buy interest at key levels like $3.1 and $3.0. This demand indicates market participants are eager to accumulate XRP, possibly reinforcing the sentiment that the asset may soon experience volatility or a directional breakout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Dynamics and Community Reactions Van Code’s observation quickly drew engagement from the XRP community. XRP currently shows many bullish signals, as another well-known analyst recently described a “ calm before the storm ” through technical analysis patterns. However, one commenter cautioned that exchanges could exploit the situation if traders rely heavily on leveraged positions. “If too many traders are long and using leverage, exchanges may capitalize on the volatility,” he wrote, alluding to the potential for sudden market reversals. In response, Van Code highlighted the profit model of exchanges, stating, “Exchanges don’t make money on price action.” He noted that exchanges make money based on the transaction volume. His remarks emphasized the role of market activity, rather than direction, in generating revenue for both exchanges and asset managers. He advised participants to focus on accumulating and holding chosen cryptocurrencies rather than reacting to market speculation. The reduced sell-side activity, as evidenced in the order book, could indicate broader market confidence in XRP. It may also reflect a wait-and-see approach among sellers, who are potentially anticipating more favorable conditions before exiting their positions. XRP is currently trading at $3.1. This trend aligns with heightened optimism from analysts and the broader community surrounding XRP’s long-term prospects.

President Donald Tru mp. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Inde x took a heavy hit, dropping 1.7% since last Friday. This is its sharpest weekly fall since July 2023, when the Federal Reserve ended a prolonged period of monetary tightening. While the president has consistently threatened major trade partners like Canada and Mexico, actual executive orders to enforce tariffs remain nonexistent. Instead, Trump has instructed the Treasury and Commerce departments to assess trade relations and provide a report by April 1. Investors brace for a dollar sell-off Currency traders are now starting to act on what they’ve been predicting for months: the dollar is overvalued and set for a correction. Matthew Hornbach, Morgan Stanley’s head of macro strategy, said investors were cautious about selling the dollar so early in Trump’s term, unsure whether he would push through tariffs immediately. Now that Trump has held back on action, traders feel freer to move. “The further we get into President Trump’s second term, the more comfortable investors are becoming with expressing their views. The dollar is rich, interest rates are high, and both are ripe for a correction,” Hornbach said. The correction has already benefited other major currencies. The British pound surged more than 2.5% against the dollar this week, buoyed by strong manufacturing and services data out of the UK. The euro also had a strong showing, recording its best weekly performance since 2023. Much of Trump’s trade rhetoric has focused on North American trading partners like Canada and Mexico, leaving the eurozone out of his direct crosshairs — for now. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley strategists warn that the tide against the dollar is building. The bank has one of the most bearish outlooks on the greenback among those surveyed by Bloomberg. “While dollar bulls are loud and active, there’s a quieter but substantial group of investors ready to bet against the currency,” they said. The data backs up this sentiment. Futures data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) shows traders holding $34.6 billion worth of bullish dollar positions, the highest since 2019. But with the dollar gauge up just 3% since Trump’s November victory, there are risks of a major reversal. But the dollar has gained over 2% in the past quarter against currencies like the Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, and Chinese yuan. However, many traders have opted to focus more on Trump’s actions—or lack thereof—rather than his words.

AI Predicts Steep Rally for EcoChain Crypto Price in 2025,https://timestabloid.com/from-0-006-to-5-ai-predicts-steep-rally-for-ecochain-crypto/,"EcoChain ($ECO) has emerged as one of the most promising crypto platforms due to its focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and sustainability. Experts and AI-driven projections anticipate the $ECO token value rising dramatically from its presale price of $0.01 to $5 by 2025. EcoChain Presale Success Raises $1.8 Million The EcoChain presale has already made waves, raising $1.8 million within its early stages. The $ECO presale price increases by 2% daily, allowing investors to earn up to 500% before the public listing. This innovative approach has attracted widespread attention from the crypto community, positioning EcoChain as a leader in combining blockchain technology with environmental impact. The platform enables tokenization of tangible assets such as real estate, commodities, and renewable energy projects, offering fractional ownership opportunities to investors. EcoChain’s mission to merge financial growth with ecological responsibility has drawn interest from retail and institutional investors alike, making it a standout in the competitive RWA space. AI Projections: $5 Price Target by 2025 Artificial intelligence analysis predicts a meteoric rise in $ECO’s value, with the token potentially reaching $5 by 2025. This anticipated growth aligns with the exponential expansion of the RWA sector, as tokenization of real-world assets gains momentum. EcoChain’s focus on sustainability and tokenization positions it as a trailblazer, capturing both first-mover advantages and long-term growth potential. Post-presale, $ECO is expected to be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, boosting liquidity and attracting global investors. The platform has also seen increased whale activity, with on-chain data showing significant investments—a clear indicator of confidence in EcoChain’s long-term vision. Engaging Community and Transparent Tokenomics EcoChain has cultivated a passionate community driven by its sustainability mission and transparent tokenomics. The platform’s $ECO token supply of 8.1 billion is allocated to ensure accessibility and long-term growth. EcoChain is transforming the crypto landscape by combining sustainability with the tokenization of real-world assets. With a successful presale, innovative features, and AI-driven growth projections, $ECO is poised to become a top-performing token by 2025. As the RWA market grows and investors seek platforms that combine financial rewards with ecological impact, EcoChain is leading the charge toward a greener, wealthier future.

If You’re Looking for Top Cryptos for Significant Returns, Qubetics Could Your Answer!",https://thecoinrise.com/missed-the-bitcoin-boom-if-youre-looking-for-top-cryptos-for-significant-returns-qubetics-could-your-answer/,"Let’s be real for a second: if you’re just diving into the world of cryptocurrency now, you might feel like you’ve missed out on Bitcoin. For years, Bitcoin has been the heavyweight champion of the crypto world, with early adopters raking in massive returns. Remember when Bitcoin was trading for under $1,000? Those were the days when if you’d just put a couple hundred bucks in, you’d be sitting on a small fortune today. But now, Bitcoin’s price is hovering in the $30,000 range, and while it’s still a solid investment, the chances of seeing those jaw-dropping, multi-thousand percent returns are looking pretty slim. So, what’s a crypto enthusiast to do now? Is the ship sailed on making big crypto gains? Absolutely not. There’s a fresh new project that could be your ticket to the next big wave in the crypto space: Qubetics . Qubetics ($TICS) is positioning itself as one of the Top Cryptos for Significant Returns , and it’s offering something that Bitcoin, despite all its glory, doesn’t: real-world utility. While Bitcoin helped introduce the world to the power of blockchain, Qubetics is taking it to the next level by enabling the tokenization of real-world assets. This means that everything from real estate to luxury goods can be represented as digital tokens on the blockchain—creating an entirely new marketplace for these assets. So, if you’re looking for that next big opportunity to take advantage of crypto’s potential, keep reading. Qubetics is offering something new, and the timing couldn’t be better. Bitcoin: The OG Crypto – But Has Its Time Passed? Ah, Bitcoin. The pioneer of the entire crypto movement. If you were one of the lucky ones who bought Bitcoin early, you’re probably sitting pretty by now. It’s often referred to as “digital gold,” and for good reason. Bitcoin’s rise from a few bucks to over $68,000 at its peak in 2021 cemented its status as a revolutionary asset. The problem? If you’re trying to get in now, the insane gains of yesteryear are pretty much out of reach. Sure, Bitcoin’s a solid bet for long-term investment, and it’s a great way to hedge against inflation or economic instability, but the wild, exponential growth we saw early on is harder to come by in 2025. Analysts expect Bitcoin’s price to continue rising, with some predicting it could hit $70,000 or more by the end of 2025, depending on how the market plays out. But let’s be honest here—if you’re looking to make quick, life-changing returns, Bitcoin’s no longer the low-risk, high-reward play it once was. It’s established. It’s stable. And in the world of crypto, that can be a bit of a double-edged sword. While Bitcoin will always have its place as the “king of crypto,” the high-flying days of sky-high percentage gains seem to be behind it. So, what does that mean for you as an investor? Don’t give up on crypto just yet. The next big opportunity might already be here, and its name is Qubetics. Qubetics: Tokenizing Real-World Assets for the Win This is where Qubetics comes into play. While Bitcoin has been great for what it is—primarily a store of value—Qubetics is doing something entirely different. It’s setting out to revolutionize the way real-world assets are bought, sold, and traded, with a focus on asset tokenization. Simply put, Qubetics is turning tangible, real-world assets like real estate, fine art, collectibles, and even business shares into digital tokens that can be traded on the blockchain. Imagine you’re a real estate investor looking to diversify your portfolio. Traditionally, this would involve buying entire properties, dealing with banks, handling paperwork, and all the red tape that comes with it. With Qubetics , you can tokenize your property and sell fractionalized ownership on the blockchain. This means you could own a part of a luxury home or office building without having to shell out millions upfront. You could buy a fraction of a Picasso or share in a rare vintage car. It opens up new investment opportunities for people who traditionally couldn’t afford high-value assets, democratizing access to wealth-building opportunities. Qubetics doesn’t just make it easier to invest in real-world assets; it also makes the process more efficient and secure. Blockchain technology eliminates the need for middlemen and offers unparalleled transparency. Everything is traceable, secure, and fast—no more waiting weeks or months for paperwork or dealing with unreliable third parties. Whether you’re a small business owner looking to unlock capital by tokenizing your intellectual property or an individual looking to invest in a new asset class, Qubetics provides the tools to make it happen. So, why should you care? Well, the Qubetics presale has been a huge success. Over $435 million $TICS tokens have been sold so far to more than 15,700 holders, raising over $10.4 million. And it’s still going. In the 18th stage of its presale, $TICS is priced at just $0.0551 per token, but experts believe the price could skyrocket once the mainnet launches. Why Qubetics Could Be the Next Big Crypto Opportunity Here’s the thing: Bitcoin has done its job in terms of proving the concept of digital currency, but it’s not the next big opportunity if you’re looking for mind-blowing returns. Qubetics is where the real action is right now. Why? Because it’s addressing real-world problems that Bitcoin simply can’t solve. Tokenizing assets gives everyday investors the chance to own parts of high-value goods that were previously inaccessible. For example, let’s say you’re a fan of luxury watches, and you want to invest in a rare timepiece. In the traditional world, that could cost you tens of thousands of dollars. But with Qubetics , you could own a fraction of that luxury watch by buying a token, giving you exposure to the high-end watch market without needing to break the bank. The truth is, Qubetics is offering a whole new level of financial inclusion. If you’re tired of watching the rich get richer by investing in things like real estate, rare art, or exclusive collectibles, Qubetics gives you the opportunity to get in on the action. The ability to tokenize assets opens up countless investment avenues for people from all walks of life. And let’s not forget the presale—if you can get in now while $TICS is still at a low price, the potential return on investment could be massive. Conclusion: The Future is Here with Qubetics If you’ve been holding off on jumping into the crypto space because you missed Bitcoin’s meteoric rise, don’t sweat it. Bitcoin will always have its place, but the real opportunity now lies with projects like Qubetics that are setting the stage for the next wave of innovation. By tokenizing real-world assets, Qubetics is solving a problem that Bitcoin didn’t address—and offering massive upside potential for investors in the process. The presale for Qubetics is still ongoing, and with predictions of $TICS reaching $5, $10, or even $15 after the mainnet launch, now is the time to get in. If you want to be part of one of the Top Cryptos for Significant Returns in 2025 , Qubetics is your best bet. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers—invest in the future of tokenized assets today.

Solana’s SOL: The High-Speed Crypto Powering Tomorrow’s Apps Solana is a blockchain platform built for speed and scalability. It offers a solid foundation for decentralized applications, or dapps, placing it alongside competitors like Ethereum and Cardano. What sets Solana apart is its design focused on faster transactions and flexible development options. Developers can use multiple programming languages, making it more accessible. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. SOL is essential for transactions, running special programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The potential of SOL is tied to Solana’s unique technology. Unlike some platforms, Solana doesn’t rely on sharding or extra layers to handle more transactions. Instead, it uses its powerful network to scale naturally. This makes it attractive to developers and investors who need a platform that can handle high activity. In the current market, where speed and capacity matter, SOL stands out. It offers an alternative to coins like Ethereum, which can be slower due to heavy use. With more projects looking for fast and scalable solutions, SOL could become more valuable and see significant growth. Trump’s Meme Coin Surges to $15 Billion: A New Chapter in Crypto? Donald Trump’s latest venture into cryptocurrency has taken the market by storm with the launch of his new meme coin, $TRUMP. Released on Friday, the coin’s market capitalization soared to $9 billion, peaking at over $15 billion early Sunday. Hosted on the Solana blockchain, $TRUMP saw its price jump by more than 300% within a day. At its peak, the coin briefly surpassed $75, marking a significant moment as Trump prepares for his upcoming inauguration. The rapid rise of $TRUMP reflects the growing interest in meme coins and their potential in today’s market. With an initial supply of 200 million coins, developers plan to expand the total supply to 1 billion over the next three years. This strategy mirrors the approaches of other successful cryptocurrencies. While the coin is affiliated with the Trump Organization, its website notes that $TRUMP is “not intended to be” an investment opportunity or a security, and it distances itself from political ties. In a market where meme coins like Dogecoin have captured the imagination of investors, $TRUMP could ride the wave of popularity. Its association with a well-known figure might make it attractive, but as always, potential buyers should be cautious and stay informed. MELANIA Coin Soars 53%: A New Crypto Sensation Emerges MELANIA Coin burst onto the crypto scene with a 53% surge just hours after launch. Starting at $11.36, it quickly reached a market cap over $1.6 billion, entering the top 100 cryptocurrencies. With a total supply of 1 billion coins, MELANIA emphasizes that it has no ties to politics or governments. The coin’s distribution involves the team (35%), community (20%), reserves (20%), public sales (15%), and liquidity (10%). Committed to transparency, the project has a 13-month full vesting period. Investors are seeing huge returns. According to Lookonchain, one investor used two wallets and earned $47.5 million from MELANIA Coin. The first wallet spent 2,100 SOL ($560,000) to buy 1.52 million MELANIA, then sold them for 46,453 SOL ($11.5 million), making an $11 million profit. The second wallet bought 3.84 million MELANIA with 800,000 USDC, sold half for 16.45 million USDC, and kept the rest worth over $20 million, totaling a profit of $36.5 million. In a market eager for new opportunities, MELANIA Coin’s rapid rise and focus on transparency might attract investors looking for the next big thing. Conclusion While SOL, TRUMP, and MELANIA coins show promise, XYZVerse stands out as the pioneering sports memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth in the current bull run.

Binance Coin, Ripple Or Remittix?",https://timestabloid.com/which-of-these-crypto-assets-will-make-you-rich-in-2025-and-why/,"Finding the top crypto investments 2025 is crucial for many traders, and three names often come up: Binance Coin, Ripple, and Remittix. Each token has die-hard fans and unique perks, but which is set for the biggest returns? Some say Binance Coin benefits from exchange backing, while others praise Ripple for streamlining global finance. Meanwhile, a rising contender called Remittix aims to beat them both by solving everyday money-transfer problems. Below, we see how they compare and why Remittix might be the top performer. Binance Coin: Exchange Powerhouse Launched by the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance Coin (BNB) has grown popular for trading discounts and DeFi access. Recently, Binance Coin completed its 30th quarterly burn, removing 1.6 million tokens from circulation. This scarcity could drive future value, though daily moves show it’s up +0.63% over 24 hours but down -5.06% for the week and -2.76% for the month. Some traders label Binance Coin a staple holding. Its ties to a high-traffic exchange keep volume steady, and many still consider it among the top crypto investments 2025. Yet new projects, like Remittix, offer unique features that might lure investors away if they promise faster gains. While BNB remains a household name, innovation in other tokens means it won’t be an uncontested king forever. Ripple: Banking Connections Praised for quick cross-border transactions, Ripple (XRP) boasts partnerships with major financial institutions. Over the last month, Ripple rose +39.77%, though it dipped -2.36% this week. Daily changes show a +4.25% uptick, hinting at ongoing market interest. Many supporters see it as a prime choice for DeFi growth, securing a spot among the top crypto investments by 2025. Yet tokens like Remittix could offer a strong alternative if they cater more effectively to everyday users. Ripple does well at targeting banks, but smaller businesses and freelancers might prefer simpler, cheaper solutions. If these groups flock to upstart projects, Ripple (XRP) might face stiffer competition. Still, it remains a heavyweight, thanks to strong brand recognition and a well-established network. Remittix: Poised To Outperform While Binance Coin and Ripple focus on large-scale adoption, Remittix zeroes in on affordable transfers for regular people and small businesses. Investors note that Remittix (RTX) could disrupt the sector by cutting remittance fees and wait times. This real-world utility might push Remittix above older coins tied to corporate deals. Many now rank it among the top crypto investments 2025 for its ease of use. Because Remittix offers fast, low-cost services, it’s quickly becoming a favorite. Observers say Remittix (RTX) could surpass even big names if mass adoption keeps rising. Unlike other tokens that depend on hype, Remittix fixes real user problems. This practical angle fuels hopes it will claim the spotlight soon, potentially outdoing both Binance Coin and Ripple in daily usage. Conclusion Whether you’re drawn to the exchange clout of Binance Coin (BNB) or the financial links of Ripple (XRP), it’s clear fresh projects like Remittix (RTX) can shake up the field. Each one promises major returns, but many investors see Remittix as a real standout. By slashing fees and simplifying cross-border transactions, it could deliver bigger gains than established tokens. For those seeking the top crypto investments 2025, Remittix may well be the one to watch. Ready to explore Remittix further?

Hitler Musk (HITMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HITMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Hitler Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Hitler Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Hitler Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Hitler Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Hitler Musk by entering its contract address (CA) – GB5uSMr95szepTSfj6sbJHFxMaBHwwyBzUY6dPAWZCCH – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HITMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 07:04:00

The cryptocurrency currently appears to be in a ranging phase, with no decisive movements above or below key resistance and support levels. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, “XRP is simply ranging, and it’s best to wait for the yellow 21 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) to align with the price” This indicates a period of market consolidation, where traders are waiting for more clarity before committing to major positions. #XRP – Daily Time Frame Analysis – Noise Time: #XRP is simply ranging, and it's best to wait for the yellow 21 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) to align with the price.

Invalidation… pic.twitter.com/kcBBC97roH — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 24, 2025 Critical Levels to Monitor EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis highlights several important price levels for XRP. The key resistance level lies at $3.40, with the analyst noting that a daily close above this price would serve as an “invalidation point,” shifting the overall market outlook toward a bullish trend. On the downside, the analyst identified potential support levels at $2.83 and $2.50, where a temporary price dip could occur before buyers step in. The analyst emphasizes that a wick down to $2.50 is “normal” during this market behavior, especially as XRP seeks equilibrium. Furthermore, the current price action suggests a close interaction with the 21-day EMA, a dynamic support and resistance indicator. Once this moving average aligns with the price, it could kickstart a price rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Where is XRP Going Next? The analysis reflects the uncertainty in the market as XRP attempts to stabilize following a period of volatility. Multiple analysts expect a massive breakout from the current market position, with one notable analyst recently setting an $8 target . XRP is currently trading at $3.1, and although it has fallen over 2.5% from yesterday, it is still up over 42% from last month. The digital asset recently rose to $3.39, a multi-year high reached on January 16. Another well-known analyst shared a detailed analysis that could send XRP to $4 . Reaching this target would decisively confirm the breakout above $3.4 that EGRAG CRYPTO outlined, and also breach its all-time high of $3.84. The importance of the $3.40 resistance level cannot be overstated, as surpassing it would likely bring renewed bullish momentum and attract increased investor interest. This breakout would confirm the asset’s momentum and pave the way for a further climb. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

However, it lacks the structured growth trajectory and clear utility that BTFD showcases, which could be a deciding factor for serious investors. The core appeal of Dogwifhat lies in its vibrant and active community. This coin thrives on social media engagement and grassroots marketing campaigns, which have helped it gain traction in a crowded market. Its followers are known for their enthusiasm and collective efforts in promoting WIF across various platforms, creating a sense of camaraderie and belonging among holders. Dogwifhat’s development team has also been key in fostering this strong community bond. They regularly engage with users, provide updates, and host events that encourage participation and investment. While Dogwifhat may not yet offer the extensive utility or high-profile partnerships seen in some other meme coins, its community-focused approach provides a solid foundation for potential growth and sustainability in the volatile crypto market. Why did this coin make it to this list? Dogwifhat made it to this list for its community-driven approach and the sheer enthusiasm of its followers. Yet, when stacked against BTFD’s structured economic strategies and higher earning potential, it’s clear why discerning investors might lean towards BTFD for long-term gains. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends , it’s evident that BTFD Coin not only leads the pack with its innovative features and solid investment potential but also sets a new standard for what meme coins can achieve. As BTFD prepares for its listing, the window for getting in on this presale is closing fast. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity; don’t let this chance to be part of something revolutionary slip away.

Ripple (XRP), which has been accused of similar allegations, stands out. Following US President Donald Trump’s speeches implying that US-based cryptocurrencies are in an advantageous position, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, according to unproven claims, advocates the idea of a reserve in the US that includes many altcoins instead of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, and opposes the idea of a reserve consisting of a single BTC. Related News: Big Whale Sells Big on This Altcoin, Making Huge Profits However, the White House recently announced the creation of a working group on this issue and used the term “Digital Asset Stock” instead of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. In an interesting development, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino also released a statement on the subject. Ardoino claimed that the same companies that attacked Bitcoin (there is also an allusion to Ripple here) also attacked Tether. The Tether CEO said that the companies behind these attacks are becoming more apparent these days. He added that there are more companies than those accused so far. *This is not investment advice.

Recently, Mickle (@xrpmickle), a respected voice in the XRP community, addressed these claims with facts. His statements highlight key aspects of XRP that are frequently misunderstood or misrepresented. Bitcoin maxis love spreading FUD about XRP. Let’s debunk some lies with FACTS: • XRP is deflationary—no more can ever be created. • The XRP Ledger is decentralized. • Brad Garlinghouse didn’t create XRP. • XRP isn’t a company—Ripple is. • Ripple isn’t anti-Bitcoin (Brad… — mickle (@xrpmickle) January 25, 2025 XRP’s Deflationary Nature and Decentralization Contrary to claims that XRP can be manipulated through new token issuance, Mickle clarified that XRP is deflationary, meaning no additional tokens can ever be created. This provides certainty about the token supply, unlike inflationary cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) operates as a decentralized blockchain. It relies on independent validators worldwide to secure the network. This dispels the narrative that it is controlled by Ripple. Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has debunked these decentralization claims multiple times, calling the argument incredibly stupid . Clarifying Ripple’s Role Another common misconception is the difference between XRP and Ripple. However, as Mickle pointed out, “XRP isn’t a company—Ripple is.” Ripple’s efforts focus on leveraging XRP for practical use cases, particularly in cross-border payments. Furthermore, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse did not create XRP, which was launched by developers with deep roots in the Bitcoin community. Mickle also noted that Ripple is not anti-Bitcoin, with Garlinghouse himself holding Bitcoin, countering claims of hostility toward the leading cryptocurrency. XRP Use Cases and Adoption XRP’s use cases are another area where misinformation persists. Mickle emphasized that XRP has “significant use cases,” particularly in banking and payment systems. Financial institutions worldwide have adopted Ripple’s payment solutions. They often utilize XRP to improve transaction efficiency. This real-world utility demonstrates XRP’s value beyond speculative trading.

Critics argue that Ripple’s control over escrowed XRP makes the network centralized. However, Ripple has been reducing its control by releasing XRP from escrow based on a fixed schedule, contributing to decentralization over time. As another community member pointed out , Bitcoin faces increasing centralization concerns. He noted that “companies like MicroStrategy and BlackRock keep buying Bitcoin, making it more centralized.” Moreover, Bitcoin mining is now concentrated among a small group of entities with access to specialized hardware and resources. This shift contrasts with Bitcoin’s original vision of decentralization. Meanwhile, Ripple’s efforts to reduce its influence over XRP strengthen the case for its decentralized ecosystem. Satoshi’s Acknowledgment Mickle also reminded the community that XRP’s origins are intertwined with Bitcoin’s history. XRP was created by early Bitcoin developers who sought to improve its design. Mickle also reminded the community that Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, previously acknowledged Ripple. Mickle urged readers not to fall for echo chambers and instead explore the facts about XRP. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

39518663,https://nulltx.com/?p=141066,1737878087,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Uniswap’s UNI Token Holds Steady Amidst Market Volatility and Mixed Sentiment,https://nulltx.com/uniswaps-uni-token-holds-steady-amidst-market-volatility-and-mixed-sentiment/,"Uniswap’s UNI token has remained remarkably steady over the past 24 hours, holding at a stable price of $12.17. This price reflects an almost zen moment of calm in what is otherwise a tumbling crypto market. In recent days, the broader crypto space has taken a beating. The BTC price dropped 4.08% in the past week, and ether (ETH) decreased by 7.47%. Yet, despite this clear downward trend in the overall crypto market, the Uniswap token continues to seemingly hold its own, with relatively little price movement over the past few days. The recent progress surrounding Uniswap has brought a mix of upbeat and worrisome tidings. Uniswap was in the spotlight when it went for a $35 million airdrop of its governance token, UNI , ahead of what should have been a low-key announcement about the protocol’s next (fourth) major version [Source: manilatimes.net ]. Uniswap had said that the new version would be launching on something called “X,” which turned out to be the not-so-undisclosed platform formerly known as Twitter, but also serves as a public billboard in the event of a major protocol overhaul. This moment of excitement for early participants and potential new users of Uniswap was then marred by an analysis that (presumably) Uniswap didn’t want to be associated with: AMBCrypto published a piece suggesting that bad price action meant that UNI was forming “bearish patterns” on the daily charts, and could suffer a 20% drop “in the near future” [Source: AMBCrypto.com ]. Market Analysis An in-depth analysis of UNI from a technical perspective reveals that the token’s price has been spinning within a narrow range and forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart. This pattern usually indicates a disagreement between buyers and sellers, with the possible price breakout in either direction. Our analysis of trading volume suggests that trader indecision is at an all-time high for this token, as volume has been steadily declining since the end of May. Two key price levels to watch in the next few days: support at $11.50 and resistance at $13.00. A clear breakout (up or down) is needed before any new trades can be taken. Until then, the price is likely to continue this pattern of low volatility. Social and on-chain analysis further refine our understanding of UNI’s market dynamics. The social sentiment metrics suggest a community full of mixed emotions. It is certainly not a boring time for the Uniswap community, given the wild range of feelings members express about it. Some definitely express frustration about the platform’s listing policies, with a not insignificant number complaining to and about a variety of entities associated with the platform. Directly above their heads are Layer 2 projects (ZKSync, StarkWare, etc.), which users are incredibly excited about. Network activity has been at all-time highs, comprised mainly of direct user interactions with the Uniswap platform and Layer 2 project testnets. Meanwhile, the core development team has been grinding away during the intense bear market, pushing through an incredible number of protocol upgrades and just overall goodness. The price is rising, and there are a number of reasons that we feel compelled to get into those next. Market Outlook In the larger market context, UNI’s performance is closely linked to the overall sentiment in the DeFi sector. The next catalysts, like the V4 rollout and the official X announcement, could be what tips things over into a bullish breakout. However, there are clouds on the horizon—a couple of regulatory issues seem to be brewing, of a kind that seems to happen every couple of months. Could this be another opportunity to buy UNI at a lower price? Projections for future UNI price seem cautiously optimistic—more a sentiment of “We should be okay, as long as things stay like this.” Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

According to his recent analysis , XRP has successfully eliminated a seven-year resistance level, signaling a strong upward trajectory. Dark Defender believes this achievement has set the stage for further price expansion, with a mid-term target of $77.7. On 15 January, we discussed a fascinating Fibonacci Level. After 7 years of consolidation, XRP is now winking at $77.7, my mid-term target. (NFA) Four of a kind! pic.twitter.com/hu5VADeGam — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) January 24, 2025 XRP’s Path to $77.7 The attached chart emphasizes that XRP’s consolidation has built a solid foundation for its next potential rally. Fibonacci levels are central to this analysis, focusing on the 261.8% and 361.8% extensions, which indicate strong upward targets. In early January, XRP broke above the 50% Fibonacci retracement, a critical level at $2.8160. It has held above this level since the breakout, further solidifying its bullish outlook. Key Observations From the Chart XRP’s breakout from its prolonged resistance has shifted the market dynamics. This move suggests long-term holders and institutions could drive the asset’s price. XRP is also firmly positioned above the Ichimoku Cloud , indicating robust support and bullish sentiment. This level has historically acted as a key indicator of price direction. If XRP maintains its current trajectory, achieving the $77.7 target is feasible. However, this requires sustained buying pressure and a favorable macroeconomic environment.

These levels are a key indicator of where XRP could face resistance or aim for new highs. Notably, the 261.8% level aligns with $5.85, marking a significant point of interest in the short term. Beyond this, the 361.8% extension places another milestone at $18.22, showing the scope for a broader rally. Dark Defender has previously set these targets , adding credence to his new prediction. The standout target remains $77.7, a level that reflects a strong mid-term ambition. According to the analyst, this figure represents XRP’s next major move if the bullish momentum continues. XRP is currently trading at $3.13, and the $77.7 target would require a significant 2,382.43% increase for the digital asset. While such targets are speculative, the technical setup provides a basis for these projections. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Kamala Sucks (KAMASUCK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because KAMASUCK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Kamala Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Kamala Sucks could become the next viral memecoin. Kamala Sucks launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Kamala Sucks on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kamala Sucks by entering its contract address (CA) – KFywQqjGH3WdEQ4hR42oYQ17v4nSePom6AjyJc8TNfU – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like KAMASUCK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 07:57:34

Cardano’s 24-hour trading volume is extremely lively, sitting at $2.27 billion.

On the day of Trump’s inauguration, World Liberty Financial bought $47 million worth of ETH, $47 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin ( wBTC ), $4.7 million worth of Aave ( AAVE ), $4.7 million worth of Chainlink ( LINK ), $4.7 million worth of Tron ( TRX ) and $4.7 million worth of Ethena ( ENA ). While accumulating crypto assets, President Trump has been working on legislation to accommodate the industry and reverse the hostile regulatory climate created by the previous presidential administration.

Known for his staunch support of Bitcoin, Mow has often opposed other cryptocurrencies, and his recent remarks on social media have rallied similar Bitcoin maximalists and intensified scrutiny of Ripple and the role XRP could play in a potential U.S. crypto reserve. Mow Challenges XRP’s Inclusion U.S. President Donald Trump recently ordered the evaluation of a national digital asset reserve . The debate within the cryptocurrency community now centers on whether the U.S. should diversify a potential digital asset reserve beyond Bitcoin. Mow strongly opposes this idea, asserting that Bitcoin alone holds value as a national crypto reserve. He argues that adding other cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, would effectively reward companies that created tokens without inherent value. He highlighted Ripple’s issuance of 100 billion XRP tokens as an example of this practice, stating that such actions are akin to generating wealth “out of thin air.” According to Mow, including XRP in a government-controlled reserve would misuse taxpayer funds, ultimately benefiting Ripple and its founders. Calls For Increased Criticism of Ripple and XRP Beyond the debate over crypto reserves, Mow expanded his critique of Ripple and XRP. Referring to a surge in posts criticizing the company and its cryptocurrency, Mow argued that existing negative opinions did not go far enough. In his recent post on X, he commented, “I see a lot of posts hating on or listing out reasons why you should hate Ripple/XRP, and I just want to add some perspective. You still don’t hate them enough, and there are still way more reasons why you should hate them.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Mow’s remarks underline his belief that XRP’s creation process and its association with Ripple contradict the principles of decentralization and scarcity that Bitcoin embodies. His outspoken criticism has positioned him as a key opponent of Ripple’s ambitions within the cryptocurrency space. However, not all his criticisms hold water. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has consistently debunked centralization claims . While many Bitcoin maximalists share Mow’s views, others remain open to exploring the potential of altcoins like XRP. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, recently weighed in on the debate, asserting that only Bitcoin is likely to be included in a U.S. digital asset reserve. However, unlike Mow, Hoskinson did not criticize Ripple or XRP but has worked with Ripple on RLUSD, showing that past personal problems should be put aside for the advancement of the crypto world.

According to the entrepreneur’s post on X, the idea is powerful and thoughtful, one that is in-line with the growing trends globally. The bill, known as House Bill 18 , was introduced by Steve Demetriou, a State Representative alongside six other co-sponsors backing it. The bill will mandate the state treasurer to invest about 10% of the state’s general fund, prizes trust fund, and budget stabilization fund into a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, which will include Bitcoin. According to Demetriou, the bill was necessary to hedge the state’s funds from the biting effects of inflation. Vivek Ramaswamy backs Ohio’s Bitcoin reserve bill Investing in cryptocurrencies via a strategic cryptocurrency reserve bill is one trend that has gotten attention over the last few months. The trend started with United States President Donald Trump leaning over and showing support for the crypto industry during his campaign. With Ohio now leaning towards that area, it is something that Ramaswamy is backing wholeheartedly. According to Ramaswamy, aside from the bill being thoughtful and powerful, it provides a way to hedge inflation risks provided by the government. He also hailed Steve Demetriou for proposing the bill. “A thoughtful & powerful bill here in Ohio. We need to think creatively about hedging against government-created inflation risks & keeping our state at the cutting edge of innovation, rather than playing from behind. Kudos to @steve4ohiohouse for thinking outside the box,” he said. A thoughtful & powerful bill here in Ohio. We need to think creatively about hedging against government-created inflation risks & keeping our state at the cutting edge of innovation, rather than playing from behind. Kudos to @steve4ohiohouse for thinking outside the box. https://t.co/gBg4IuqO8O — Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) January 25, 2025 According to Demetriou on X, he proposed the bill because he wants to hedge against inflation while making sure Ohio is at the front when it comes to cutting-edge monetary and technological innovation. In a post by co-founder and CEO of Satoshi Action Fund, Dennis Porter, the new proposed strategic reserve bill uses ‘digital assets’, instead of explicitly mentioning Bitcoin. Porter noted that the approach will help Ohio maintain neutrality and avoid potential political friction in the future. Ohio’s strategic reserve bill features strict investment requirements Ohio’s strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill sets out very strict investment criteria for digital assets. One of the requirements is that the asset of choice should be an exchange-traded product with an average market capitalization of around $750 billion 12 months before the asset is picked. Bitcoin easily makes the cut, seeing that it presently has a market cap of about $2 trillion. However, the bill explicitly mentions that other digital assets could well be considered if they can achieve this feat. “The average market capitalization of the digital assets over the preceding twelve months is at least seven hundred fifty billion dollars, as determined by the treasurer of state using a commercially reasonable method,” the bill read. The bill also sets strict conditions for secure custody solutions, provided the state decides to hold the digital assets directly. If the opposite is the case, then the state can consider the services of banks, trust companies, or other regulated investment services in providing custody. If the bill is officially passed, it will be a major milestone in the state, allowing Ohio to use digital assets as potential investment vehicles for state funds and retirement systems. The bill is Ohio’s second attempt at a strategic Bitcoin Reserve, with the first bill, House Bill 703, submitted last month by Derek Martin, the House Republican leader. The bill is seeking to outrightly establish a Bitcoin Reserve for Ohio, with Porter noting that about 11 States are presently in the Bitcoin reserve race. The current bill came after United States President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a working group that will look into the development of a federal regulatory framework for digital assets, which will include stablecoins. The group is also tasked with looking into the establishment of a national digital asset reserve.

Community Debates,https://cryptopotato.com/should-ripples-xrp-be-part-of-the-us-digital-asset-reserve-community-debates/,"President Donald Trump splashed the crypto waters earlier this week when he signed an executive order focused on digital assets to be potentially included in the US reserves. Although it’s not officially approved yet, the decision has sparked substantial debates within the community on which cryptocurrencies should be included or whether it should just be bitcoin. The Debate Ever since Trump changed his tune on the crypto industry last year and made dozens of optimistic promises during his election campaign, the talk of the town has been whether he will stay true to his word and establish a US BTC reserve. The first portion of that plan would be for the US government to stop selling the seized BTC from illegal operations. However, Trump went further on Thursday by signing an executive order titled ‘Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technologies’ to explore the inclusion of various cryptocurrencies into the US reserve. This sent shockwaves throughout the community, especially those favoring many US-based projects and their underlying assets, such as SOL, XRP, and ADA. Many believe that companies like Ripple are actually working against BTC in this manner by ‘throwing around millions at politicians, desperately trying to derail it.’ Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, refuted the accusations, saying their efforts ‘are actually increasing the likelihood of a crypto strategic reserve (which includes bitcoin) happening.’ Unless you are choosing to ignore the core tenants of the POTUS campaign (which aggressively supports American companies and technologies), our efforts are actually INCREASING the likelihood of a crypto strategic reserve (which includes bitcoin) happening. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 23, 2025 No XRP, Please Messari’s founder, Ryan Selkis, joined the anti-XRP front, indicating that the Ripple incentive is ‘toxic.’ He went further, described the project’s native token as a ‘piece of s**t,’ and said it would be better to have no crypto strategic reserve than to put XRP in it. Selkis concluded that BTC is the only exception and that it makes sense to be the sole crypto rep in that reserve. America-First is not “American-Shitcoin First” We’d be better off having no strategic reserve than one with a “endorsed” pieces of shit like XRP. Still, I think Bitcoin is an exception. 1. Build different (with energy) 2. Lindy, mcap dominance, no insiders 3. Global traction https://t.co/eCNhKjpgSL — Ryan Selkis (d/acc) (@twobitidiot) January 23, 2025 In contrast, Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, who has been collaborating with the Ripple team for a while now, said there’s no need to ‘base XRP’ and claimed that the strategic reserve will start as bitcoin-only.

FXGuys , a standout in the altcoin ecosystem, is catching their attention with its groundbreaking Trade2Earn program, high-value staking rewards, and unparalleled prop trading funding program. Here’s why FXGuys is stealing the spotlight as the Top PropFi Project of 2025. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE The $FXG Token: A Game-Changer in Decentralized Finance At the heart of FXGuys’ appeal lies the $FXG token, hailed as one of the best defi tokens for 2025. Unlike many other tokens in the market, $FXG comes with tangible benefits: Staking Rewards: Investors can stake $FXG to earn a 20% profit and revenue share from broker trading volume. This feature ensures passive income, making it highly attractive for those seeking consistent returns. No Buy or Sell Tax: FXGuys eliminates hidden trading fees, providing transparency and efficiency for traders. Trade2Earn Opportunities: Every trade executed within the FXGuys ecosystem earns users $FXG tokens, creating a unique incentive for high trading activity. Why Cardano Investors Are Pivoting While Cardano has been a leader in scalability and energy efficiency, FXGuys offers a unique approach that Cardano currently lacks. The high-potential altcoins sector is dominated by projects providing innovative solutions, and FXGuys fits the bill perfectly. Cardano investors are particularly drawn to: Instant Funding Prop Firm Access: FXGuys’ prop trading funding program allows traders to gain access to up to $500,000 in trading capital. This makes it one of the best proprietary trading firms for ambitious traders. Same-Day Fiat and Crypto Withdrawals: Flexibility in withdrawals, available in over 100 local currencies and cryptocurrencies, is a significant advantage. Custom Trading Platforms: With access to FXGuys Trader, MT5, Match-Trader, cTrader, and DXtrade, users can select the platform that best fits their geographic location and trading style. The Rise of the Trade2Earn Model The Trade2Earn program is a groundbreaking feature that incentivizes traders by rewarding them with $FXG tokens for every trade they make. This model not only boosts trading activity but also ensures a continuous cycle of growth and token demand. Analysts have highlighted this as a key driver for the FXguys’ current success, as it fosters an ecosystem where users directly benefit from their engagement. Additionally, FXGuys has raised over $2.6 million in its Stage 2 presale, showcasing strong investor confidence. With its current price at $0.04, the project’s growth trajectory points toward substantial gains. FXGuys’ Trader Funding Program: Empowering Smart Prop Traders FXGuys’ prop trading funding program stands out as a beacon for retail traders aiming to scale their operations. The program offers: $500,000 Trading Capital: Retail traders who pass the trading evaluations gain access to significant funding, with profit splits favoring the trader at 80/20. Trader Development Ecosystem: FXGuys goes beyond funding, offering tools and training to develop traders into industry leaders. No KYC Requirements: The platform’s decentralized nature ensures that traders can participate without cumbersome verification processes. These features position FXGuys as a haven for smart prop traders , setting it apart from competitors in the best proprietary trading firms category. Analysts Back FXGuys Over Cardano and Others While Cardano continues to maintain its reputation as a blockchain powerhouse, analysts are increasingly recommending the FX Guys for its innovative solutions and investor-friendly features. The $FXG token’s combination of staking rewards, zero-tax trading, and a robust Trade2Earn model is unmatched, making it a top contender among top defi coins and high potential altcoins . >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Conclusion: A Bright Future for FXGuys As Bonk and Cardano slow down, FXGuys is becoming the go-to choice for savvy investors. With its Trade2Earn program , prop trading funding program , and $FXG token staking benefits, FXGuys is carving out its place as the Top PropFi Project of 2025. At just $0.04 per token in its Stage 2 presale, it’s no wonder investors are doubling down on this high-potential altcoin.

With their groundbreaking ecosystems and loyal investor bases, these projects have consistently ranked among the best altcoins to buy. But things are shifting, and a new player, FXGuys ($FXG) , is making big moves with a presale success that has made the project impossible to ignore. Raising over $3 million and it’s still in its second stage, FXGuys has quickly positioned itself as one of the trending altcoins that are related to decentralized fìnance. Investors have started to notìce, and for good reason. The question is whether the rise of FXGuys could mean the end of Polkadot and Cardano’s dominance or at least loosen their grip on the market. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Cardano (ADA) Ecosystem Challenges Expose It To Newer Options Cardano is now facing challenges in maintaining its dominance as newer projects gain more ground. Thanks to its impressive method of development, Cardano quickly became positioned as a top blockchain. Despite multìple positive reception, Cardano’s slow rollout of features and upgrades has frustrated many in the crypto community. While competitors are innovating at a rapid pace, Cardano feels like it’s lagging, leaving room for other projects to become trending altcoins. Cardano’s ADA token has also struggled to deliver returns over the past year. While the network’s ecosystem contìnues to grow, the pace hasn’t been fast enough to compete with fast-rising projects that offer more benefìts, risking getting overshadowed by them. Polkadot’s (DOT) Recent Performance Pushes Holders To Alternative Options Polkadot has started showing cracks in its foundation. The network’s ability to connect multiple blockchains through its parachain system made it a key option in the crypto space. As new projects come up with innovative offerings made to fìt the demands of investors, Polkadot’s relevance has come into question. While its parachains remain a unique feature, other platforms now offer similar features with faster deployment and more effìcient processes. The DOT token itself has also been tanking since December last year despite being a top-20 cryptocurrency by market cap. Its price performance in recent months is pushing holders to consider whether it can keep up with stronger competitors. FXGuys ($FXG) Showcases Impressive Potential To Be Among The Best Altcoins To Buy FXGuys is an impressive reimagination of what decentralized fìnance can achieve when paired with new investment solutions. The FX Guys platform delivers innovation with tangible benefìts, startìng with the groundbreaking Trader Funding Program. This feature grants traders up to $500,000 in trading capital, removing the need to risk their own funds and creating a better way to trade without any stress. But FXGuys goes even further. It has a Trade2Earn system that flips the everyday trading model by rewarding users with $FXG tokens for every trade they make—even if it’s a win or a loss. This approach builds wealth for traders, making it one of the best altcoins to buy if you prefer to be highly rewarded for your participation. Then there’s the platform’s staking program, which offers token holders passive income with APY and a share of the platform’s revenue. Combine this with a no-KYC policy, and it’s no surprise that the ongoing presale has raked in millions in such little tìme. Investors still have the opportunity to earn over 150% profìts by the tìme the presale tokens launch, but they have to buy in at the current discount of just $0.04. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Conclusion Projects like Cardano and Polkadot are beginning to feel the heat from newer projects like FXGuys . While these projects face challenges in keeping up, FXGuys has emerged as an alternative with more benefìts for investors. As the presale tokens contìnue to attract millions, the FXGuys is proving that it’s not like every other altcoin—it’s a project that can help you gain fìnancial freedom in no time.

Hitler Musk (HITMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HITMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Hitler Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Hitler Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Hitler Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Hitler Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Hitler Musk by entering its contract address (CA) – GB5uSMr95szepTSfj6sbJHFxMaBHwwyBzUY6dPAWZCCH – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HITMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 08:50:54

While Pepe (PEPE) grapples to find its feet after a 19.5% loss in the last week, Remittix (RTX) is experiencing similarly explosive growth to what Pepe (PEPE) achieved upon its launch. It has done this by targeting one of the largest financial sectors: a $190 trillion cross-border payments market expected to reach $290 trillion by the end of the decade. This PayFi project has captured attention rapidly, raising over $7 million in its presale. With its bold approach and powerful platform, Remittix is shaking up the financial industry. So, how will these two projects fare in 2025? What’s Happening with Pepe? Pepe (PEPE) is confusing crypto spectators right now, as it has a habit of doing. It can’t seem to make up its mind which way to go. Following a major 19.5% dip in the last 7 days, Pepe (PEPE) is now down 5% in the last 24 hours, suggesting a possible resurgence. Pepe’s price charts hint at potential growth. On-chain data shows an uptick in active wallets holding Pepe, suggesting that new investors are joining the fold. While meme coins are known for their volatility, Pepe has proven its staying power and many speculate it could deliver gains in 2025. Disrupting the Global Payments System Expenses, hidden charges and delays have long hampered the global payments market. Remittix tackles these issues head on by making transactions easier for individuals and businesses. Its advanced platform connects fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, facilitating simple but effective international transfers. Using Remittix (RTX), users can change more than 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies and send money worldwide within 24 hours. Its flat-rate pricing structure eliminates hidden fees, offering a straightforward alternative to traditional banking systems. One of the most attractive features of Remittix is its Pay API, which simplifies international operations for businesses. This tool supports over 30 fiat currencies and 50 cryptocurrency pairs allowing companies to take payments in cryptocurrency and settle in fiat. This API lets businesses expand across borders without the usual cross-border payment headaches. Remittix places strong emphasis on accessibility and security. Transactions are processed as standard bank transfers, but without exposing their cryptocurrency origins. This feature makes the platform approachable for crypto-savvy users and those new to digital assets, forming a bridge between blockchain technology and traditional finance. One of Remittix’s defining missions is to expand access to financial services. By operating 24/7 and eliminating reliance on traditional banking infrastructure, the platform reaches underbanked populations worldwide. This effort to democratize financial tools opens up new opportunities for communities often excluded from global finance. The Rush for RTX Tokens The Remittix (RTX) presale is making waves, having yielded over $7 million in investment in just a few weeks. The $RTX token plays a central role in the ecosystem, offering both functionality and potential for investors. The project’s broad utility has led analysts to predict an 800% price surge during the presale with further growth anticipated post-launch. As Remittix (RTX) continues to address real-world financial problems, it is poised to disrupt the PayFi space in 2025.

Thanks to strong investor support, the platform has already raised over $7 million just weeks into its presale period. More crucially, one of the best altcoins to buy now is the RTX token, which leading crypto analysts project a possible 50x rise for in 2025. Remittix is surely one of the best crypto investment prospects right now as a result of many unique and promising offerings. Remittix: Revolutionizing Global Payments Remittix is transforming cross-border payments by reducing the friction and expenses long afflicting conventional financial systems. Moreover, Remittix provides a flawless solution since it lets users transmit cryptos that are immediately converted into fiat and sent straight into any bank account all around the world. Usually found in services like Stripe, Wise, and even Coinbase, which are known for their hefty fees and lengthy processing times, this procedure removes the intermediaries. The blockchain-powered Remittix PayFi system blends the best of both worlds—cryptocurrency speed and transparency, along with the simplicity of fiat currency transfers. Faster, more reasonably priced worldwide transactions guarantee that both individuals and companies gain from this creative approach, which removes expensive delays and costs. With cross-border payments expected to be worth a whopping $250 trillion by 2027, Remittix is positioned to take a sizable chunk of this growing sector especially as it presents a better substitute to conventional banking services. Growing Demand and a Promising Future for Remittix Selling over 281 million RTX tokens, the platform has now raised more than $7 million as the Remittix presale keeps acquiring popularity. Early investors are being given the unusual chance to buy tokens at a presale price of just $0.0334 per RTX , which is projected to skyrocket upon token debuts on tier-1 exchanges. Remittix is generating such tremendous excitement that analysts estimate a 700% price rise during the presale period and some even foresee a possible 50x gain in 2025. Meanwhile, Remittix’s creative approach to crypto-to-fiat conversion supports this potential with worldwide payments backed by low fees and an outstanding user experience. With full transparency free of hidden costs, Remittix supports over 50 crypto pairs and 30 fiat currencies, enabling users to send money anywhere in the globe immediately. RTX is becoming among the best cryptos to invest in today for long-term returns. For companies trying to simplify their worldwide transactions as well as for crypto aficionados, Remittix’s simplicity and efficiency cause great appeal. The Best Crypto Investment : Remittix vs. Other Altcoins Though there are many opportunities in the forthcoming altcoin season , few like Remittix stand out. Its twin concentration on the profitable remittance industry and crypto-to-fiat payments sets it in a special position to profit from the growing worldwide need for quicker, less expensive, more secure money transfers. Remittix offers a real-world solution to a worldwide issue—cross-border payments—while many top altcoins mostly focus on speculative price movements or limited use cases. Moreover, Remittix distinguishes itself from other top crypto coins by emphasizing scalable, pragmatic answers to long-standing problems in the financial sector. Although other altcoins could show brief price swings, Remittix’s principles are designed for long-term, steady increases. Another important difference is Remittix’s capacity to let companies take crypto payments and immediately convert them into fiat for flawless cash flow control. As the platform keeps extending its reach, this function is predicted to be quite appealing to companies functioning in a worldwide market and inspire broad acceptance. A Reliable Investment with Passive Income Potential Apart from its amazing growth potential, Remittix presents investors with the opportunity to generate passive income from its RTX utility token. RTX token staking let’s holders get yearly staking bonuses between 4% and 8%. Remittix is much more promising to investors who search for both capital appreciation and consistent income generation since this offers a consistent stream of passive income. Moreover, the Remittix platform is dedicated to security and openness, which BlockSAFU has personally confirmed rather thoroughly. This guarantees that knowing the platform is safe, dependable, and future-proof, investors may feel confident in their investment. Why RTX is One of the Best Cryptos to Buy Now RTX is one of the best cryptos to buy right now as we enter the altcoin season since its mix of blockchain technology and practical use is outstanding. The Remittix (RTX) coin is clearly a top candidate for exponential gains in 2025 with the platform’s creative ideas for cross-border payments, expanding community, and great potential for development. Remittix is positioned to lead in the crypto scene by fixing inefficiencies in the worldwide remittance sector and providing an easily available platform for companies and individuals. Now is the time for investors wishing to guarantee their place in the future of global payments to engage with Remittix.

The move comes amid Donald Trump’s decision to make crypto a national priority regarding crypto policy and regulations, starting with signing an executive order to develop the national digital asset stockpile . However, experts claim cryptocurrencies and crypto projects developed in the United States may not see zero tax benefits. Why Is Zero Capital Gains Tax on Crypto May Not Be Possible Dennis Porter, CEO and co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, in an X post on January 26 said removing capital gains on crypto entirely depends on US Congress. He asserts it is highly unlikely that the US Congress will include such a proposal in a tax bill in the near term. He added that the primary obstacle is the significant loss in government tax revenue, making the proposal look difficult to approve currently. The primary agenda for the Trump administration is tax cuts and any policy that threatens those cuts will be sidelined. The zero income tax on crypto presents significant practical, legal, and economic challenges. The Trump administration will review the anticipated reduction in tax on US-based crypto but not vice-versa, which could be detrimental to equities, bonds, and other financial instruments. Eric Peterson, policy director at Satoshi Action Fund, said: Capital gain taxes on crypto is not going to 0% folks. Congress makes tax policy, not the president. Work towards attainable goals like the de minimis exemption. Recently, John Deaton discussed the ambiguity surrounding U.S.-based cryptocurrency projects . He questioned whether projects with operations or foundations abroad, such as Solana and Tezos, would meet the requirements for tax exemptions. The Crypto Industry Must Lobby for Meaningful Steps Forward Dennis Porter believes the crypto industry can take meaningful steps forward to reduce tax obligations. He suggests securing a de minimis exemption of $200 for Bitcoin and other digital asset transactions. “This proposal aligns with the existing $200 exemption for foreign currency transactions. It’s a far more attainable and reasonable goal, with minimal impact on Trump’s ability to renew his tax cuts,” he added. Americans who live off of Bitcoin and digital assets should not have to report every small transaction, such as buying coffee, meals, or groceries, for tax purposes. This is an overly burdensome task and it’s time we pursue this simplification of the tax code. Porter reveals that the U.S. Congress has bipartisan support for this idea and it could become a reality with de minimis exemption. In order to be successful, it must be tied to inflation and bipartisan support that balances innovation and fairness. Crypto Market Bullish on Zero Crypto Gains Tax Proposal The crypto market participants are bullish on the US-based crypto and likely zero tax on these crypto as the Trump administration introduces pro-crypto policy and regulations. Eric Trump confirmed advocating for zero capital gains tax for the U.S.-based crypto projects. ‘Made In USA’ crypto such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Hedera (HBAR) and others will benefit from tax cuts.

The altcoins are with minor gains on a daily scale but the weekend charts show a different picture for many of them. BTC Holds Steady at $105K The largest cryptocurrency went through a spectacular ride at the beginning of the business week. It began with a nosedive on Monday morning from $106,000 to under $100,000 before it exploded to a new all-time high of over $109,000. More volatility ensued before, during, and after Donald Trump’s inauguration speech as he failed to mention crypto. Following a price slump to $101,000, the bulls stepped up and didn’t allow a price slump into five-digit territory. In fact, BTC started to recover some ground and spiked to $107,000 a few days later. It failed there and was pushed south by three grand on Saturday morning but has recovered from that decline and now sits about a grand higher with little to no movement over the past 12 hours. Its market capitalization has climbed to $2.080 trillion on CoinGecko, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 55.4%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView AVAX on the Rise The largest altcoins have recovered some of the losses charted yesterday. Ethereum has bounced above $3,300 after a 1.3% daily increase, while XRP is above $3.1 following a similar increase. BNB, DOGE, and ADA stand in the same bracket. Solana and Chainlink have gained around 3% each and now trade at $255 and $25, respectively. Avalanche has emerged as the top performer from the larger-cap alts, surging by 6% to $37.5. The biggest gainers from the top 100 alts are XCN (91%), OM (30%), TAO (13%), and TRUMP (10%). The total crypto market cap has recovered over $60 billion overnight and is up to $3.750 trillion on CG.

From the iconic Dogecoin to the more recent Shiba Inu, these quirky tokens have turned casual investors into overnight success stories. But the game keeps changing, and if you missed the Just a Chill Guy opportunity, don’t fret! BTFD Coin is stepping in, offering an exciting chance for those looking to capitalize on the latest trends in the meme coin market. What’s got everyone buzzing about BTFD Coin? For starters, it’s not just another meme coin; it’s a full-fledged investment opportunity with a slew of innovative features. With its recently launched Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , a lucrative referral program, and a staggering 90% annual percentage yield (APY) on staking, BTFD Coin is set to take the meme coin popularity to a whole new level. The ongoing presale has already raised over $5.6 million, and analysts are predicting even bigger things on the horizon. If you’re on the lookout for the best new meme coins to invest in for short term gains, BTFD Coin should be at the top of your list. As we dive deeper, let’s explore what makes BTFD Coin so special and how it stacks up against Just a Chill Guy. One thing’s for sure: if you’re serious about crypto, you won’t want to miss this opportunity. BTFD Coin: Your Ticket to a Bright Future BTFD Coin is currently in its 14th stage of presale, with the price sitting at $0.00016—up from an astounding $0.000004 when it first launched. That’s a massive leap, and it shows that investors are taking notice. With over 66 billion BTFD coins sold and more than 9,300 holders, affectionately known as “Bulls,” this coin is gaining traction at an impressive rate. Now let’s talk about the exciting features that really set BTFD Coin apart. First off, the P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, and it’s already creating quite a buzz. Players can earn BTFD coins while having fun, making it an engaging way to invest. This gamified approach not only brings in gamers but also crypto enthusiasts who want to be actively involved in their investments. The staking rewards are another major draw. Starting on December 2, 2024, holders can stake their BTFD coins for an unbelievable 90% APY. To put it into perspective, if you invest $10,000 at the current price of $0.00016, and the price hits $0.0006 by the end of the presale, you’d see your investment skyrocket to a jaw-dropping $37,500! That’s the kind of return that turns heads and gets people excited. And don’t forget about the referral program. For every friend you bring into the BTFD community, you both earn extra BTFD coins. It’s a win-win situation that encourages community growth. With analysts buzzing about the potential for BTFD’s price to soar, this is the time to act if you want to be part of something big. Just a Chill Guy: Fun but Lacks Substance Now that we’ve covered the exciting aspects of BTFD Coin, let’s turn our attention to Just a Chill Guy. This meme coin has garnered some attention, largely due to its lighthearted branding and community vibe. But can it compete with the groundbreaking features that BTFD Coin is offering? Just a Chill Guy has built a loyal following, but it primarily relies on its meme culture and community engagement. While that’s great for building a fan base, it doesn’t offer the same level of innovative features that BTFD brings to the table. There’s no P2E game or enticing staking rewards that can really boost your investment. Sure, Just a Chill Guy can give you a chuckle, but can it deliver the financial gains that savvy investors are looking for? Analysts have mixed feelings. Some believe it still has potential, but others warn that it may struggle to keep up in an ever-changing market. As the meme coin space evolves, sticking with a coin that lacks fresh features might not be the best strategy. If you’re in the market for the best new meme coins to invest in for short term gains, Just a Chill Guy might be entertaining, but it doesn’t hold a candle to the excitement and potential of BTFD Coin. Conclusion: Seize Your Chance with BTFD Coin In a world where meme coins are capturing headlines and transforming investments, BTFD Coin shines as a beacon of opportunity. With its innovative P2E game, staggering staking rewards, and an engaging referral program, BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a legitimate investment opportunity. As the presale heats up, analysts are predicting that BTFD’s price could skyrocket as we near the finish line. Don’t let the chance to invest in BTFD Coin slip through your fingers. If you’re serious about maximizing your investments this weekend, now’s the time to jump on board. Don’t just sit on the sidelines while others celebrate their gains—become a part of the Bulls and join this thrilling journey. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with the BTFD Coin presale . Your future self will thank you!

The pl atform’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, sounded the alarm on X (formerly Twitter) today. He said , “There are ~1m tokens a week being created now, and growing. He called it a “high-quality problem” but admitted that the company’s traditional approach to token evaluation is no longer sustainable. Coinbase has long reviewed new tokens individually, but Armstrong said that the process is simply unworkable in this environment. He said: “And regulators need to understand that applying for approval for each one is totally infeasible at this point as well (they can’t do 1m a week). It needs to move from an allow list to a block list, and utilize customer reviews/automated scans of on-chain data etc to help customers sift through.” Additionally, Coinbase will continue integrating native decentralized exchange support more deeply. “Customers shouldn’t need to know or care whether the trade is happening on a DEX or CEX,” Brian added. The crypto market is exploding in the wake of Donald Trump’s re-election. Bitcoin surged past $109,000 last week, gaining over 50% since November. Trump fuels crypto frenzy with new policies Just days into his new term, Trump signed an executive order designed to promote the adoption of digital assets in the US. The order outlined key priorities, including protections for bitcoin miners and developers, the promotion of dollar-pegged stablecoins, and a ban on any Federal Reserve-issued digital dollar. In the weekend leading up to his Monday inauguration, both he and First Lady Melania Trump launched meme coins — a first for any president ever. While the decision delighted some investors, others worried that it might reinforce the perception of crypto as speculative and unstable. Trump has since doubled down on his support, floating the idea of establishing a US Bitcoin reserve. Critics argue that such a reserve would be risky, given bitcoin’s infamous price volatility, but Trump appears undeterred. “Trump’s presidency is a dream come true for the crypto industry,” Bill Gurley, a venture capitalist, said in a recent interview. He described the past few days as transformative, saying, “I don’t think they could have imagined a better outcome than they just got in the past 48 hours.” Brian Armstrong, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said, “The last four years, we really felt like we were being attacked by this administration,” referring to Biden’s tenure. Meanwhile, Trump’s executive order has directed agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Treasury, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to form a working group on digital assets. David Sacks, a venture capitalist and close Trump ally, has been tapped as the White House’s AI and crypto czar. He joined Trump in the Oval last week for the signing of the executive order. It was all pretty cool. The order also includes provisions to withdraw an accounting rule that previously forced banks to treat crypto holdings as liabilities on their balance sheets. The SEC announced the change shortly after the order was signed, calling it a “landmark decision” for encouraging institutional crypto adoption.

With Trump signing several executive orders that support the cryptocurrency market, more people are interested in trading. The next week is important for the market because the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and decisions about interest rates, along with other major economic news, will likely influence future trends in the market. Markets Stay Steady and Bullish Under Trump’s New Policies This week, everyone’s been focusing on US President Trump’s policies after he took office, and it looks like the markets are handling it pretty well so far. Instead of causing worry, his announcements are actually making people more bullish. He’s talked about big investments in artificial intelligence (AI), making significant changes in crypto policy, keeping interest rates low, and controlling inflation by reducing oil prices. This has encouraged investors to take more risks, leading to the S&P 500 reaching a new record high. Also read: Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: Will BTC Break $109K and Hit a New All-Time High? As we head into a new week, several important events could shape the future trends of the cryptocurrency market. US 4Q earnings season Next week, big tech companies like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Apple are set to report their earnings. Analysts predict that these major players, along with three other large companies, will see their earnings grow by more than 17% over the next year, which is almost double the 9% growth expected from the other 493 companies. Because these companies are valued so highly, investors will probably look for more than just the usual profit and revenue numbers. US FOMC Meeting It’s widely expected that the Federal Reserve will keep its main interest rate unchanged this Wednesday while they wait for more information showing that inflation is decreasing. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said he would insist on immediate cuts to interest rates globally, revisiting his frequent but ineffective pressure on the Fed during his first term. Early in his second term, Trump has already tightened immigration and announced plans to raise import taxes starting February 1. This creates uncertainty for the Fed, making it tough for them to plan monetary policy. The Fed is meeting soon and is expected to maintain the current interest rate between 4.25% and 4.50%, as recent data supports a gradual approach to reaching their 2% inflation target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his team face the challenge of balancing current monetary policy with uncertainties about the future and deciding how much to reveal about the Fed’s outlook. US Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index In November, the overall PCE prices in the US went up by 2.4% compared to last year, which is an increase from the three-year low of 2.1% seen in September. The core PCE price index, which the Fed uses to gauge underlying inflation, only rose by 0.1%—the smallest increase in six months. This kept the annual core PCE rate steady at 2.8% in December, which was below the expected 2.9%. Looking forward, the overall PCE is expected to rise to 2.6% year-over-year, which will be announced on Friday. The core PCE inflation rate is also expected to stay stable at 2.8%. European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate decision The ECB is expected to cut interest rates by 0.25% at its next meeting on 30 January, bringing the rate down to 2.75%. This would be the fifth rate cut since June 2024, aimed at supporting economic growth. Conclusion With the Fed likely on pause, the ECB poised to cut rates, and Trump’s pro-crypto signals still fresh, the crypto market appears positioned for a generally bullish week ahead.

As other assets in the crypto market make strides, Ethereum’s sideways movement has caused many to question whether it can regain its momentum this year. The prolonged consolidation has dampened sentiment, with some investors beginning to lose patience and faith in ETH’s ability to deliver substantial returns. Related Reading: Cardano Consolidates In A Symmetrical Triangle – Analyst Expects A 40% Move However, optimism remains among technical analysts who see Ethereum nearing a critical inflection point. Top crypto analyst Daan recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting a massive falling wedge pattern forming on Ethereum’s chart. This setup is widely considered a bullish reversal indicator, with the potential to spark significant upward movement if the price breaks out. According to Daan, a breakout from this falling wedge would likely pave the way for Ethereum to test the $4,000–$4,100 level, offering a glimmer of hope for bullish investors. Such a move could reinvigorate market confidence and set the stage for Ethereum to reclaim its status as a leading altcoin. For now, all eyes are on ETH as traders await confirmation of the next big move in this highly-watched range. Ethereum Facing Serious Risks Ethereum has remained in a downtrend since late December, struggling to regain momentum as bearish sentiment continues to dominate the market. The lackluster price action has left investors and analysts increasingly concerned about the possibility of a deeper correction, as ETH consolidates near critical support levels. While some remain hopeful for a turnaround, the current outlook suggests Ethereum faces significant challenges ahead. Top crypto analyst Daan recently shared his insights on X, highlighting a massive falling wedge pattern on Ethereum’s chart. This pattern is often regarded as a bullish reversal signal, with the potential to trigger a significant breakout if confirmed. According to Daan, a successful breakout could propel ETH toward the $4,000–$4,100 range, revisiting its cycle highs. However, he also expressed caution, suggesting that if ETH does manage to reach this level, it may encounter strong resistance, potentially leading to another sharp rejection. Daan emphasized the importance of monitoring the falling wedge trendline, noting that it will play a crucial role in determining Ethereum’s next move. For now, the market remains in a wait-and-see mode, with ETH navigating a precarious balance between bullish breakout potential and the risk of further downside.

A breakout above the falling wedge could breathe new life into ETH and reignite optimism, while failure to hold support may lead to an extended period of consolidation or even a deeper correction. The coming days will be critical in shaping Ethereum’s trajectory, with its performance likely to influence broader market sentiment. ETH Consolidates Above Key Demand Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $3,322 after enduring several days of choppy price action, reflecting the broader uncertainty in the crypto market. The price has struggled to gain momentum as it remains stuck in a tight range, testing the patience of investors and traders alike. To ignite an uptrend, bulls must hold the critical $3,300 support level, which has served as a key demand zone in recent sessions. A decisive push above the $3,500 resistance level, which has capped ETH’s upward movement for weeks, is essential to confirm a bullish breakout. Clearing this level would likely reinvigorate market sentiment and attract fresh buying interest, setting the stage for Ethereum to target higher price levels in the coming days.

If ETH fails to hold the $3,300 mark, it could trigger a wave of selling pressure, leading to a deeper correction.

But do they need restaking? We’re talking taxes here – not death, the other certainty that last time anyone checked, couldn’t be offset through restaking. Tax, on the other hand, might just be. Due to the way capital gains are calculated in most regions, it’s preferable to avoid liquidating crypto assets where possible because doing so creates a taxable event. Hold onto them, however, and while you’ll still be liable for tax on any yield those staked assets generate, you won’t be on the hook for the underlying assets. They’ll remain tax-exempt, at least for the time being, allowing you to defer a big tax bill while capitalizing on the upside of being able to hold your crypto for longer. There are many reasons to explore restaking, from supporting the decentralization of blockchain networks to scooping up those sweet staking rewards. However, in tax minimization, there may be an even more compelling reason to explore this fast-growing on-chain sector. Tax might not be avoidable in life, but if you’re shrewd, it is at least reducible, and that’s a start. Here’s how it plays out when it comes to restaking. Getting a Handle on Crypto Tax A word of advice before we proceed: crypto tax regulations differ not only by country but sometimes even by region within a country. For this reason, the following strategy is intended for broad guidance only. To apply it to your own country, check the applicable laws that govern your tax code, or better still speak to your tax adviser. Hopefully, they’ll also know their crypto, saving you from having to explain such concepts as staking and restaking. Like other dreaded tasks, like cleaning the garage or visiting the dentist, calculating crypto tax is a chore that many are prone to putting off until the last minute. While crypto tax calculators have vastly simplified what was once a labyrinthine process, it would be stretching credulity to say that doing taxes is fun. But with a little forethought, it doesn’t need to be stressful – particularly if you’re still holding the bulk of your net worth in staking protocols. With restaking, you stake an asset such as ETH or BTC into a protocol to earn additional rewards while retaining the underlying token. On Ethereum, for example, EigenLayer enables restaking by allowing staked ETH or liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) like stETH or rETH to be reused across multiple networks. Mantle , an Ethereum Layer 2 network, uses EigenLayer’s restaking to secure its roll-up operations. On Bitcoin, meanwhile, restaking is also taking off thanks to protocols built on top of Babylon, the leading decentralized BTC staking layer. SatLayer , one of the first restaking protocols built on Babylon, enables bitcoiners to stake their BTC and earn rewards for helping to secure other networks. Given the vast potential for unlocking Bitcoin’s trillions of dollars in idle capital, coupled with the wide range of networks – including EVM – that can potentially be staked using the hardest crypto asset ever conceived, it’s evident that Bitcoin restaking will be huge. This brings us back to tax, unfortunately. Understanding how restaking is treated under tax law can make the difference between a modest and a monster tax bill. It’s not because restaking is tax-exempt, but rather because the act of doing so should leave you liable for capital gains tax only which is both lighter and later. But how does this work in practice? Restaking Crypto: Maximizing Gains, Minimizing Taxes From a tax perspective, the distinctions between staking and restaking are immaterial: the basic process is the same, regardless of whether you’re staking a native L1 asset – e.g. ETH – or a secondary LST, such as stETH. In each case, the outcome is the same as far as tax agencies are concerned: you remain in possession of the underlying token, potentially benefiting from its price appreciation, while accruing extra rewards on top. And it’s these rewards only that you should be liable for tax on during the calendar year. You don’t need to be an accountancy whizz to figure that 30% tax on $10K of restaking rewards is going to be a lot less painful than 30% on $100K of underlying. Restaking generally enhances your holdings through additional tokens, which can lead to compounding gains over time. However, the tax treatment of those rewards is crucial. In the U.S., for example, if staking rewards are viewed as taxable income upon receipt, you may owe taxes in the year you earn them. Later, if you sell those staking rewards for a profit, you incur capital gains tax on that difference. In the U.K., if considered income, staking rewards can be taxed according to your income bracket but upon disposal, any further appreciation is subject to capital gains tax. Delay, Defer One of the biggest levers crypto holders have for managing their tax liability is not selling their crypto assets prematurely. Restaking can be a powerful strategy for crypto investors seeking to grow their portfolios without incurring frequent tax events. By staking tokens like BTC or ETH, you remain exposed to potential price appreciation and accumulate additional rewards on top. In many jurisdictions, you are not liable for capital gains tax until you dispose of the asset. By simply holding onto your tokens, you defer the point at which capital gains tax is triggered. From a tax perspective, that is essentially the bull case for restaking. It gives you a way to delay and defer your tax obligations. Leaving more money in your pocket or crypto in your wallet in the here and now. Which is never a bad thing. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

But do they need restaking? We’re referring to taxes here—death, the other certainty, isn't something restaking can offset. Taxes, on the other hand, might be reducible. Since capital gains are calculated in many regions based on asset liquidation, it's best to avoid selling crypto assets when possible, as this triggers a taxable event. By holding onto these assets, you’ll still owe taxes on any income generated from staking, but the assets themselves remain free from tax liability, at least temporarily. This allows you to postpone a hefty tax payment while still benefiting from holding your crypto longer. There are several reasons to consider restaking, from supporting the decentralization of blockchain networks to earning valuable staking rewards. However, when it comes to minimizing taxes, there’s an even stronger reason to delve into this rapidly growing area of blockchain. While taxes are unavoidable, they can be reduced with some smart planning, and that's a good place to start. Here’s how restaking can help with that. Understanding Cryptocurrency Taxation Before we proceed, here’s a tip: tax rules for crypto vary not just by country but sometimes by region. Therefore, the advice here is for general guidance only. To tailor it to your own situation, consult your country’s tax laws or, even better, talk to a tax professional. Ideally, they’ll be familiar with crypto, so you don’t have to explain concepts like staking and restaking. Much like other dreaded tasks, such as cleaning out the garage or going to the dentist, figuring out crypto taxes is something many avoid until the last minute. While crypto tax calculators have made what used to be a complicated process much easier, it's still a stretch to call tax preparation enjoyable. But, with some foresight, it doesn't have to be stressful, especially if you’re holding a significant portion of your wealth in staking protocols. With restaking, you invest an asset like ETH or BTC into a protocol to earn extra rewards while keeping the original token intact. On Ethereum, for instance, EigenLayer allows restaking by letting staked ETH or liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) like stETH or rETH be reused across multiple networks. Mantle , an Ethereum Layer 2 network, utilizes EigenLayer’s restaking to secure its roll-up processes. On the Bitcoin side, restaking is gaining traction through protocols built on Babylon, a leading decentralized BTC staking layer. SatLayer , one of the initial restaking protocols on Babylon, allows Bitcoin holders to stake their BTC and earn rewards for securing other networks. Considering the immense potential to unlock Bitcoin’s trillions in idle capital, alongside the numerous networks—including EVM—that can be staked using the most robust crypto asset ever created, it's clear that Bitcoin restaking is poised to become significant. And this brings us back to the topic of taxes. Knowing how tax laws treat restaking can be the difference between a small and a substantial tax bill. Restaking isn’t tax-free, but the process generally only subjects you to capital gains tax, which tends to be less burdensome and delayed. So how does this work in practice? Restaking Crypto: Boosting Returns, Cutting Taxes From a tax standpoint, the differences between staking and restaking aren't significant: the fundamental process remains the same whether you're staking a primary L1 asset—like ETH—or a secondary LST, such as stETH. In both cases, tax authorities see the same outcome: you still own the original token and might benefit from its value increase while earning additional rewards. During the year, you should be taxed only on these rewards. You don’t need to be a financial expert to realize that a 30% tax on $10K in restaking rewards is far less painful than 30% on a $100K asset. Restaking typically increases your holdings with extra tokens, potentially leading to compounded gains over time. However, how those rewards are taxed is crucial. In the U.S., for example, if staking rewards are taxed as income when received, you may owe taxes for that year. If you later sell those rewards at a profit, you face capital gains tax on the difference. In the U.K., if considered income, staking rewards might be taxed according to your income level, but any further increase in value upon sale is subject to capital gains tax. Hold and Delay One of the key strategies for crypto holders to manage tax liability is to avoid selling their crypto assets too soon. Restaking can be a powerful method for investors looking to expand their portfolios without triggering frequent taxable events. By staking assets like BTC or ETH, you remain open to potential price growth while earning more rewards. In many regions, capital gains tax is only due when you sell the asset. By holding onto your tokens, you postpone the point at which this tax is applied. From a tax perspective, this is essentially the bullish case for restaking. It offers a way to delay and defer your tax responsibilities, leaving more funds in your wallet or crypto holdings in your portfolio. And that’s always a good thing.

39524745,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=123945,1737889493,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Japan’s Central Bank Raises Interest Rate to 0.5%, Highest Since 2008",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japan-central-bank-interest-rate-hike-2025/,"The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points , moving from 0.25% to 0.5% , according to Bloomberg . This adjustment marks the highest interest rate since October 2008 , a period closely tied to the global financial crisis following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The decision reflects the BOJ’s gradual shift away from ultra-loose monetary policies, signaling an important development in Japan’s economic strategy amidst ongoing inflation and global economic uncertainty. Key Highlights of the Rate Hike From 0.25% to 0.5% The 25 basis-point increase represents a significant step toward normalizing monetary policy, moving away from years of near-zero or negative interest rates. Highest Rate Since 2008 The last time Japan’s interest rates were at this level was in October 2008 , during the fallout from the Lehman Brothers collapse . Global Context The rate hike aligns Japan’s monetary policy more closely with other major economies, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank , which have also raised rates in response to inflationary pressures. Why Did Japan Raise Its Interest Rate? Addressing Inflation Japan has experienced higher-than-expected inflation, with the core consumer price index (CPI) consistently exceeding the BOJ’s target of 2%. The rate hike is aimed at curbing inflation while maintaining economic stability. Yen Stabilization The yen has faced significant volatility in recent months. A higher interest rate could strengthen the currency by attracting foreign investment. Gradual Policy Normalization After years of ultra-loose monetary policies, the BOJ is taking cautious steps toward policy normalization to address structural challenges in the Japanese economy. Impacts of the Rate Hike Domestic Economy Borrowing Costs : Higher interest rates will increase borrowing costs for businesses and households, potentially slowing domestic spending and investment. Savings Growth : Savers may benefit from improved returns on deposits, encouraging higher savings rates. Currency Markets The yen could strengthen as higher interest rates make Japanese assets more attractive to foreign investors. A stronger yen could reduce import costs but might also impact export competitiveness. Global Financial Markets Japan’s rate hike could influence global bond markets, especially as one of the largest holders of U.S. Treasury bonds adjusts its policy stance. Historical Context: Japan’s Interest Rate Policies Year Interest Rate Economic Context 1999-2008 Near-zero rates Efforts to combat deflation following Japan’s asset bubble collapse. 2008-2016 0.1%-0% Response to the global financial crisis and economic stagnation. 2016-2022 Negative rates BOJ implemented negative interest rates to stimulate growth. 2023-2025 Gradual hikes Inflation and global pressures drive cautious policy normalization. Expert Perspectives John Roberts (Global Economist, Bloomberg) : “This rate hike signals that the Bank of Japan is finally joining the global fight against inflation. However, the BOJ must tread carefully to avoid stifling growth in an economy heavily reliant on exports.” Aiko Tanaka (Tokyo-based Financial Analyst) : “The move will likely bolster the yen in the short term, but it’s a delicate balance. Exporters may face challenges, especially as Japan’s key trading partners, like China, deal with their own economic uncertainties.” Challenges Ahead for the BOJ Balancing Growth and Inflation While the rate hike addresses inflation, it could dampen economic growth, especially in a country with high public debt and an aging population. Export Competitiveness A stronger yen could make Japanese goods more expensive abroad, impacting the country’s export-driven economy. Global Economic Risks Geopolitical tensions and slowing global growth could complicate Japan’s economic recovery efforts. Conclusion The Bank of Japan’s decision to raise its interest rate to 0.5% , the highest level since 2008, marks a significant shift in the country’s monetary policy. While the move addresses rising inflation and yen volatility, it also poses challenges for economic growth and export competitiveness. As Japan cautiously transitions away from ultra-loose policies, the global financial markets will closely monitor the implications of this decision. For domestic and international stakeholders, this rate hike is a pivotal moment in Japan’s economic trajectory, reflecting its response to evolving global and domestic pressures.

FAQs What is the new interest rate set by the Bank of Japan? The Bank of Japan raised its interest rate from 0.25% to 0.5% , marking a 25 basis-point increase. Why is this rate hike significant? This is the highest rate since October 2008 , signaling a shift in Japan’s ultra-loose monetary policies amid inflationary pressures. How will the rate hike impact the Japanese yen? The rate hike could strengthen the yen by making Japanese assets more attractive to foreign investors, potentially reducing import costs but impacting export competitiveness. What are the risks of higher interest rates in Japan? Higher rates may increase borrowing costs for businesses and households, potentially slowing economic growth and affecting Japan’s export-driven economy. How does Japan’s rate hike compare to global trends? The BOJ’s move aligns with central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, which have also raised rates to combat inflation. What challenges does the BOJ face after this hike? Key challenges include balancing inflation control with economic growth, managing export competitiveness, and navigating global economic risks.

The significant reduction came during the final year under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler , whose tenure saw aggressive regulatory oversight of the cryptocurrency industry. Key Highlights from the Report Decline in Enforcement Actions The SEC’s crypto-related enforcement actions dropped from 47 in 2023 to 33 in 2024 , representing a 30% decrease . This decline is notable after 2023 marked the agency’s peak enforcement activity against cryptocurrency firms and projects. Concentration of Actions in September Over 50% of the SEC’s 2024 enforcement actions occurred in September , indicating a focused crackdown toward the latter part of the year. Shifts in Regulatory Priorities Cornerstone Research observed that the SEC’s declining enforcement activity aligns with shifting priorities under new leadership and evolving industry dynamics. Possible Reasons for the Decline Leadership Transition Gary Gensler’s tenure as SEC Chair ended in 2024, marking a potential shift in policy priorities under new leadership. Speculation suggests a possible move toward a more collaborative approach with the crypto industry. Court Rulings and Legal Challenges High-profile legal challenges, such as cases involving Ripple (XRP) and Grayscale , may have influenced the SEC’s enforcement strategy and resource allocation. Evolving Industry Standards Increased compliance by crypto firms in response to prior enforcement actions may have reduced the need for regulatory intervention. Focus on Other Financial Sectors The SEC may have redirected its attention to other financial sectors , including traditional markets, during this period. Historical Comparison of SEC Crypto Enforcement Actions Year Number of Enforcement Actions Key Context 2021 20 Increased focus following DeFi expansion. 2022 35 Regulatory crackdown amid market volatility. 2023 47 Peak enforcement under Gary Gensler. 2024 33 Decline during Gensler’s final year. Impact on the Cryptocurrency Industry Improved Compliance The crypto industry’s efforts to enhance regulatory compliance may have contributed to the reduction in enforcement actions. Investor Confidence Fewer enforcement actions could signal a stabilizing regulatory environment , boosting investor confidence in the sector. Focus on Collaboration A potential shift in regulatory strategy may encourage greater collaboration between the SEC and crypto firms. Uncertainty Persists Despite the decline in actions, unresolved cases and regulatory ambiguity continue to pose challenges for the industry. Expert Perspectives John Deaton (Crypto Legal Advocate) : “The decline in SEC enforcement actions is a welcome relief for the crypto industry, but it’s crucial to monitor how the agency’s strategy evolves under new leadership.” Laura Shin (Blockchain Analyst) : “This could mark the beginning of a more constructive approach by regulators, balancing innovation with investor protection.” Conclusion The 30% drop in SEC crypto enforcement actions in 2024 marks a significant shift from the regulatory fervor seen during the previous year. While the decline may indicate evolving priorities under new leadership, it also reflects the crypto industry’s increasing focus on compliance. As the regulatory landscape continues to develop, the balance between enforcement and collaboration will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. For industry participants, this period presents an opportunity to engage constructively with regulators and build a more resilient ecosystem.

The micro-scale has also turned positive as the asset recovered its 30-day percentage gain or loss to above 6% at the end of the week. The world’s most prominent cryptocurrency is trading at nearly double its price six months ago. Furthermore, it can be had or sold for more than 100% of its exchange rate 12 months ago. BTC Experts Remain Overwhelmingly Bullish But, most Bitcoin experts surveying the market conditions for blockchain assets today are very bullish on the currency’s prospects for another extended leg up the chart over the coming months in 2025. Some of the main reasons for the strong forward sentiment: First, there’s Donald Trump’s reelection, a new crypto-friendly SEC chair, and plans in Congress to appropriate US tax dollars to buy and hold Bitcoin in a strategic national reserve. Then there’s Bitcoin’s enormous demand, miner network participation, powerful use cases, limited currency supply, and the bullish phase of its four-year supply cycle. Finally, there’s the rapidly expanding US dollar supply under a low interest rate regime, four years of record-setting US budget deficits ahead, and economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Here are three recent Bitcoin price predictions from cryptocurrency experts: 2025 Expert Bitcoin Price Predictions Aquinas Wealth Advisors: $130,000 According to Christopher McMahon, CEO of Aquinas Wealth Advisors and author of “Faithful Finances,” Bitcoin’s price will top $130,000 this year. McMahon’s is the lowest of the three forward targets for BTC in 2025. He argues that institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies will make the numbers go up. Motley Fool: $200,000 According to a cryptocurrency analyst at the popular investment website Motley Fool, $200,000 BTC is “not only possible but also… fairly probable.” He’s tracking Bitcoin’s steep historical trend line, new investors, especially globally, as well as governments and companies joining the blockchain race. BlackRock: $700,000 Meanwhile, of all current expert Bitcoin price predictions, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s stands out most. The Wall Street executive warns Bitcoin’s price could rocket to $700,000 this year. The rocket fuel?

39524897,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=123941,1737889877,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Glassnode Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $150K, Offering Massive Gains for Holders",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-prediction-150k-glassnode/,"Glassnode ‘s lead analyst , James Check , has projected that Bitcoin (BTC) could mirror its 2016-2017 cycle , potentially reaching a peak price of $150,000 , according to Cointelegraph . This optimistic forecast comes as Bitcoin continues to gain traction among institutional and retail investors, supported by bullish market dynamics and historical patterns. If Bitcoin hits this milestone, short-term holders , with an average entry price of $90,349 , could realize a 66% profit , while long-term holders , who entered at an average cost of $24,627 , stand to gain a staggering 509% return . Bitcoin’s 2016-2017 Cycle and Current Market Parallels James Check’s prediction draws comparisons between Bitcoin’s current cycle and the bull run of 2016-2017 : Accumulation Phase The current market reflects a similar accumulation phase observed before Bitcoin’s 2017 peak , characterized by increased wallet activity and growing institutional interest. Supply Dynamics Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins and heightened demand are driving scarcity, mirroring conditions that fueled the 2017 rally. Institutional Participation Unlike 2017, this cycle is bolstered by significant institutional involvement , such as spot Bitcoin ETFs , which enhance market stability and long-term growth potential. Potential Gains for Bitcoin Holders If Bitcoin achieves the $150,000 mark , here’s what holders could expect based on Glassnode’s data: Holder Type Average Entry Price Profit Margin Short-Term Holders $90,349 66% profit Long-Term Holders $24,627 509% profit Short-term holders are those who entered the market during recent bullish trends, while long-term holders have maintained their positions through multiple market cycles. Factors Driving the $150K Prediction Institutional Adoption The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing interest from major financial institutions are driving demand. Regulatory Clarity Improved regulatory frameworks in key markets like the U.S. are reducing uncertainty and attracting large-scale investors. Halving Event The next Bitcoin halving in 2024 is expected to reduce mining rewards, increasing scarcity and boosting the price. Global Macroeconomic Trends Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation and a store of value , especially in uncertain economic times. Challenges to Reaching $150K While the forecast is optimistic, several factors could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory: Regulatory Risks Stricter regulations or delays in ETF approvals could dampen investor sentiment. Market Volatility Bitcoin’s notorious price swings may cause hesitation among risk-averse investors. Global Economic Conditions Economic instability or a downturn in global markets could affect Bitcoin’s adoption and performance. Expert Perspectives on Bitcoin’s Potential James Check (Glassnode Analyst) : “Bitcoin’s current market dynamics strongly resemble the 2016-2017 cycle. With institutional backing and reduced market uncertainty, $150,000 is achievable.” Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy) : “Bitcoin’s fundamentals, coupled with growing institutional adoption, are setting the stage for a historic bull run.” Investor Takeaways Long-Term Perspective Long-term holders stand to benefit significantly, as Bitcoin continues to demonstrate its resilience and growth potential. Diversified Portfolio While Bitcoin offers lucrative opportunities, diversifying across other cryptocurrencies and assets can mitigate risks. Monitoring Key Indicators Investors should watch for ETF approvals, regulatory developments, and market sentiment to refine their strategies. Conclusion The prediction by Glassnode analyst James Check that Bitcoin could peak at $150,000 reflects growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. With parallels to the 2016-2017 cycle , rising institutional interest, and favorable macroeconomic conditions, Bitcoin is well-positioned for substantial growth.

These often-volatile tokens, typically launched on unlicensed platforms , pose significant risks due to their susceptibility to manipulative practices like pump-and-dump schemes and wash trades , according to the advisory published on the NYSDFS official website. Memecoins have gained immense popularity in recent years, often propelled by online hype and cultural trends. However, the NYSDFS emphasizes that these digital assets lack the regulatory oversight and consumer protections necessary to safeguard investors from fraud or financial loss. Key Risks Highlighted by NYSDFS Lack of Regulatory Oversight Most memecoins are issued on unlicensed platforms that fail to comply with New York’s Virtual Currency Regulations , leaving investors vulnerable to fraud. Pump-and-Dump Schemes Memecoins are frequently manipulated by small groups who artificially inflate prices through pump-and-dump tactics , leaving unsuspecting investors at a loss. Wash Trades Some platforms engage in wash trading —a deceptive practice where fake transactions are created to inflate the trading volume, misleading investors about demand. Centralized Control Unlike established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, memecoins are often controlled by a small group , enabling them to manipulate supply and price. What Are Memecoins? Memecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies that often derive their value from social media trends, online communities, or internet memes rather than intrinsic use cases or technical advancements. Examples : Popular memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) gained traction as community-driven projects. Speculative Nature : Their prices are frequently influenced by celebrity endorsements , viral content, or speculative trading. While some memecoins have developed robust communities, the majority lack real-world utility, making them highly speculative and prone to market manipulation. Why Is NYSDFS Warning New Yorkers? Protecting Consumers The NYSDFS’s primary goal is to safeguard consumers from financial losses due to unregulated and risky investments. Preventing Fraud The department aims to educate the public about common schemes in the crypto market, particularly those targeting retail investors. Encouraging Informed Decision-Making By issuing this warning, the NYSDFS hopes to encourage potential investors to conduct thorough research before purchasing memecoins. Tips for Consumers to Avoid Memecoin Risks Verify Platform Licensing Ensure the platform complies with NYSDFS regulations and holds a valid BitLicense for operating in New York. Research the Token Investigate the project’s whitepaper, team credentials, and utility before investing in any memecoin. Avoid Hype-Driven Decisions Do not invest solely based on social media trends or celebrity endorsements. Understand Market Dynamics Be aware of manipulative practices like pump-and-dump schemes and how they can impact prices. Diversify Investments Avoid putting all your capital into a single speculative asset. Instead, diversify across established and regulated investments. Expert Perspectives John Wu (Blockchain Analyst) : “Memecoins attract retail investors due to their low entry price and hype, but the lack of regulation makes them a breeding ground for scams.” Alicia Tan (Crypto Legal Consultant) : “The NYSDFS’s advisory is a timely reminder for investors to approach memecoins with caution and avoid unregulated platforms.” Impact of the NYSDFS Alert on the Crypto Market Rising Awareness The alert is expected to educate retail investors about the risks of speculative investments , fostering a more informed community. Regulatory Scrutiny Increased oversight could push memecoin projects to comply with state regulations, improving transparency and accountability. Market Correction A potential reduction in speculative trading could lead to more stable market dynamics, benefiting long-term investors. Conclusion The NYSDFS consumer alert serves as a crucial reminder for investors to exercise caution when dealing with memecoins . While these tokens may offer lucrative opportunities for short-term gains, their unregulated nature and vulnerability to manipulative practices make them a high-risk investment. By emphasizing the importance of due diligence , platform licensing , and market education , the NYSDFS aims to protect New Yorkers from falling victim to financial fraud. For potential investors, this advisory is an opportunity to make informed decisions and prioritize financial security over speculative trends.

In fact, large whales are now in the mood to hold on to their Bitcoin investments for the long term, meaning prices could see a further move upwards in the coming months. With Bitcoin poised for a whale-driven rally, the crypto space across the board is also expected to follow suit and cough up some mind-boggling returns for those who invest smartly and in high-potential cryptocurrencies. To help you out, here are the top 5 cryptos to invest in to become a millionaire in 2025. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Overall Best Crypto for First-Time Investors With over $60M in presale funding and recent whale purchases of $115K , $82K , and $66K – all in the last couple of weeks, by the way – Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is undoubtedly one of the best crypto presales to invest in in 2025. What’s more, a whale gobbled up nearly $170K worth of $WEPE last December . Although $WEPE’s PEPE inspiration has a fair bit to do with its popularity, it is its unique mission of empowering small traders that makes it the next 100x meme coin , according to analysts. Wall Street Pepe aims to create a vibrant community of retail crypto traders and arm them with insider information, unique market insights, alpha trading calls, and even investing strategies. This way, token holders will finally have a real shot at crypto profitability, which was earlier almost impossible due to manipulation by crypto whales. If you want to flip the script on crypto whales, consider investing in $WEPE, which is available for just $0.0003665 at the time of writing. However, hurry up because the presale can end any moment now. If this is your first time investing in a crypto presales, check out our guide on how to buy $WEPE for step-by-step instructions. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s Layer-2 Solution for Fast & Reliable Transactions Solaxy ($SOLX) aims to breathe new life into the Solana network, which is already a heartthrob of crypto enthusiasts, seeing as it’s gearing up for the next leg higher and expected to reach new all-time highs in the coming few weeks. As the first-ever Layer 2 solution on the Solana network, Solaxy will not only eliminate Solana’s issues, such as failed transactions, congestion, and scalability limitations, but also double down on its own strengths, like low fees and lightning-fast speed, to revolutionize blockchain technology. With significant purchase orders in its ongoing presale, such as $67K and $50K (this one was just 5 days ago), $SOLX is setting up to be one of the most promising crypto presales of our time. Moreover, a whale bought $122K $SOLX during the end of December. The project has already raised over $15M so far, with 1 $SOLX priced at $0.001616 right now. 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Cutting-Edge AI Technology for Crypto Profitability MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is another frog-inspired meme coin that has been making waves in the crypto market with its one-of-a-kind AI-powered functionality. Simply put, it’s a self-evolving AI agent that exists and grows on online platforms like X, where it interacts with crypto influencers, imbibing all that’s being said.

If you want to join the AI crypto bandwagon, visit the official $MIND website and buy the token for $0.0032016. Here’s how to buy $MIND . 4. YourTrump ($YTP) – Meme Coin Celebrating Donald Trump’s Popularity Official Trump ($TRUMP) has by far been the best-performing meme coin of 2025 so far, generating over 300% returns in less than 10 days from its launch a couple of weeks ago. However, if you missed out on $TRUMP, consider investing in YourTrump ($YTP). $YTP is based on the exact same concept, i.e., Donald Trump’s popularity, more specifically his follower count on X (Twitter). As Trump’s X followers reach the 100M mark, $YTP’s current expected listing price sits at around $8.6453, meaning early investors can yield up to a 30,440% return. Speaking of whale interest in $YTP, there have been small but noteworthy purchases almost every single day for the past two weeks. For instance, an investor bought over 300,000 YTP tokens on 23rd January , with a total purchase value of around $10K. 5. Rexas Finance ($RXS) – Transforming Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance ($RXS) has seen some massive whale purchases in the month of January. For instance, purchases of $179K and $158K were made on January 15 and January 22, respectively. Furthermore, the token’s recent purchase history is also laced with a lot of sizable buys, including amounts of $52K , $38K , and $89K . $RXS’s demand is for a good reason. It’s a very interesting project, seeing as it aims to tokenize real-world assets, such as commodities, art, gold, and even real estate. Rexas Finance is currently in presale, where it has already sold over 438M tokens and raised more than $43M. Interested buyers can get 1 $RXS for $0.200. Bottom Line Although following the footprints of crypto whales for your personal investments is a tried-and-tested strategy, it’s worth remembering that the crypto market is pretty volatile, meaning even the best cryptos to invest in can be filled with ups and downs. Additionally, none of the above is a replacement for financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing your hard-earned money in any crypto asset.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-26 11:15:26

As cited by Cointelegraph in a recent markets report, Thielen highlighted the potential for decentralized finance (DeFi) services to thrive, positioning Ethereum as a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. The removal of SAB 121—a controversial accounting rule that imposed restrictive requirements on crypto custodians—paves the way for expanded Ethereum adoption by financial institutions and broader participation in DeFi. What is SAB 121? SAB 121 was a guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , requiring crypto custodians to account for digital assets held for clients as liabilities on their balance sheets. Impact on Custodians : This rule increased compliance costs, limiting the ability of banks and institutions to offer crypto custody services. Crypto Industry Response : The rule faced criticism for stifling innovation and adoption, particularly in the rapidly expanding DeFi sector . How Ethereum Benefits from SAB 121’s Abolition Increased Institutional Participation With the elimination of SAB 121, financial institutions can more easily participate in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols without burdensome accounting liabilities. This could attract institutional capital into Ethereum’s ecosystem, boosting liquidity and adoption. DeFi Expansion Ethereum’s leading position as the foundation of DeFi services positions it to benefit from the abolition of rules that previously hindered development in this space. Thielen noted, “This could be a pivotal moment for Ethereum, as it can potentially drive the expansion of DeFi services.” Improved Custody Solutions Crypto custodians will face fewer regulatory hurdles, enabling them to support Ethereum staking , tokenized assets, and other blockchain innovations. Growth of Layer-2 Solutions The reduced compliance burden could accelerate the adoption of Ethereum’s Layer-2 scaling solutions , further enhancing transaction efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The Role of DeFi in Ethereum’s Growth Ethereum serves as the backbone of the DeFi industry , hosting a wide range of protocols for lending, borrowing, and trading digital assets. Uniswap, Aave, and Compound : These flagship DeFi platforms rely on Ethereum’s blockchain to enable decentralized financial services. Tokenization of Assets : The abolition of SAB 121 could spur the growth of tokenized real-world assets (RWA), such as bonds and real estate, on Ethereum. Institutional Entry : With a clearer regulatory path, institutions may embrace Ethereum-based DeFi as a legitimate alternative to traditional finance. Challenges Ethereum Must Overcome While SAB 121’s abolition provides a significant boost, Ethereum still faces challenges: Scalability Issues Despite advances like Ethereum 2.0 and Layer-2 networks , scalability remains a concern for handling increased transaction volumes. Regulatory Ambiguity Although SAB 121’s removal is a step forward, broader regulatory clarity is still needed to ensure sustained institutional interest. DeFi Risks Ethereum-based DeFi protocols must address concerns around security , liquidity risks , and user education to build trust among mainstream users. Expert Perspectives on Ethereum’s Future Markus Thielen (10x Research) : “Ethereum stands to gain immensely from the removal of SAB 121, as it eliminates barriers for institutional participation in DeFi. This moment could define Ethereum’s growth trajectory.” Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy) : “Ethereum has proven its value in decentralized finance. With fewer regulatory obstacles, it has the potential to attract significant institutional capital.” Laura Shin (Crypto Journalist) : “DeFi’s growth on Ethereum is inevitable, but aligning the ecosystem with institutional needs will be key to its long-term success.” Implications for the Crypto Industry The abolition of SAB 121 could have ripple effects across the cryptocurrency market: Enhanced Credibility A regulatory shift of this magnitude boosts the credibility of Ethereum and DeFi, paving the way for mainstream adoption. Market Growth Increased participation from banks and financial institutions could catalyze a bullish market cycle , benefiting Ethereum and related ecosystems. Competitive Edge for Ethereum With a strong DeFi foundation, Ethereum is well-positioned to outpace competitors in attracting institutional users. Conclusion The abolition of SAB 121 signals a turning point for Ethereum, with the potential to drive DeFi growth , attract institutional capital, and solidify its position as a leader in the blockchain space. While challenges like scalability and security remain, the removal of restrictive accounting rules creates a more favorable environment for Ethereum’s expansion. As the regulatory landscape evolves, Ethereum’s ability to adapt and capitalize on these changes will be crucial in shaping the future of decentralized finance.

In an interview with CoinDesk , Brogan emphasized the structural and operational differences between prediction markets and traditional gambling platforms. He highlighted that prediction markets function as neutral intermediaries , unlike sportsbooks, which profit from user losses. Key Differences Between Prediction Markets and Gambling Neutrality of Prediction Markets Unlike sportsbooks, which take one side of a bet, prediction markets serve as facilitators . They profit from transaction fees , ensuring no conflict of interest with participants. Regulation and Oversight In the U.S., federally registered prediction markets fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) . This oversight preempts state-level gambling laws , ensuring transparency and compliance. Core Purpose Prediction markets are designed to aggregate crowdsourced insights about future events, often serving as tools for data-driven forecasting rather than pure entertainment. What Are Prediction Markets? Prediction markets allow participants to trade contracts tied to the outcomes of specific events, such as elections, financial trends, or sports results. Examples : Popular platforms include Polymarket and Augur , which operate on blockchain technology for enhanced transparency. How They Work : Users buy and sell shares in a particular outcome, with prices fluctuating based on market sentiment and probabilities. Why the Gambling Label Is Misleading Transparency and Decentralization Many prediction markets operate on Web3 infrastructure , leveraging blockchain for transparency in transactions and outcomes. Smart contracts automate the settlement process, reducing the possibility of manipulation. Focus on Probabilities Prediction markets aim to predict the likelihood of events, often attracting participants interested in data analysis rather than recreational gambling. Non-Exploitative Model These platforms do not rely on user losses for revenue, distinguishing them from casinos and sportsbooks. CFTC Oversight and Legal Standing Federal Oversight In the U.S., prediction markets registered with the CFTC comply with federal regulations, offering a level of legitimacy and trust . This federal regulation often supersedes state gambling laws , providing clarity for platform operators and users. Distinction from Gambling Laws By focusing on market dynamics and data aggregation , prediction markets avoid the exploitative characteristics associated with traditional gambling. Use Cases for Prediction Markets Political Forecasting Platforms like Polymarket allow users to speculate on political outcomes, such as elections or policy changes, offering a real-time gauge of public sentiment . Economic Indicators Prediction markets can aggregate insights on financial trends, such as interest rate changes or stock market performance. Scientific Research Researchers use prediction markets to gather data on innovation probabilities, clinical trial outcomes, and more. Challenges and Misconceptions Regulatory Ambiguity Despite CFTC oversight, prediction markets face scrutiny from state regulators, leading to misconceptions about their legality. Perception as Gambling The casual use of the term “betting” to describe user participation often leads to incorrect comparisons with gambling. Complexity for New Users The technical aspects of blockchain-based prediction markets can deter mainstream adoption. Expert Perspectives Aaron Brogan (Crypto Attorney) : “Prediction markets are not gambling—they’re neutral, data-driven platforms designed for forecasting. Comparing them to sportsbooks misrepresents their purpose and functionality.” Laura Shin (Crypto Journalist) : “As blockchain technology evolves, prediction markets will likely play a key role in fields like political analysis, finance, and even climate research.” Conclusion Prediction markets are far from being Web3 gambling platforms . With their focus on neutral facilitation , data-driven insights , and compliance with CFTC regulations , they represent a legitimate and innovative use of blockchain technology. While misconceptions persist, experts like Aaron Brogan emphasize the need to differentiate between prediction markets and traditional gambling. As the adoption of decentralized technologies grows, prediction markets could play a pivotal role in reshaping how individuals and organizations approach forecasting and decision-making.

Instead of announcing a Bitcoin-specific Strategic Reserve, the administration proposed a broader evaluation of a “strategic national digital assets stockpile.” The decision has led to skepticism among traders and analysts, with many questioning the immediate market impact. Traders Unimpressed by Lack of Bitcoin Reserve Plans Nick Forster, founder of the onchain options protocol Derive, highlighted the dampened sentiment in a January 25 analyst note. “The market sees limited upside for the asset in the short term, likely due to the absence of a specific BTC reserve announcement,” Forster wrote. His analysis revealed a significant bearish signal—83.3% of Bitcoin options contracts on January 24 were “calls sold,” indicating traders’ lack of confidence in a price surge. Forster added, “Traders were expecting concrete actions, not vague promises, and the market is now making it clear that hype alone isn’t enough to drive lasting impact.” Ripple’s Multi-Coin Proposal Adds to the Debate President Trump’s January 23 executive order tasked a working group with developing strategies to position the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset space, including the controversial evaluation of a digital asset reserve. However, this move has sparked debate within the crypto community. Ripple has openly supported a multi-coin reserve approach, further dividing opinions on the best path forward. While Bitcoin’s price has seen historic highs in recent months, reaching $105,100 as of January 25, it remains 3.8% below its all-time high of just over $109,000. The lack of a Bitcoin-specific reserve announcement has caused some traders to hit the brakes on their bullish outlook. Veteran trader and analyst Filbfilb echoed these concerns, stating , “The market isn’t trading at $100,000 because people believe the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would happen right away.” However, he remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential, maintaining his 2025 target of $180,000—a level he first identified in early 2023. Hype vs. Action The executive order, while signaling the government’s growing interest in digital assets, highlights the divide between policy aspirations and market expectations . For now, Bitcoin’s traders appear to be in a holding pattern, awaiting actionable steps to translate government interest into tangible market drivers. Whether this initiative will serve as a stepping stone or a missed opportunity remains to be seen.

39525565,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=123927,1737891110,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,MicroStrategy May Face 15% Tax on $19.3B Unrealized Bitcoin Gains,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microstrategy-15-percent-tax-on-bitcoin-gains/,"MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) , the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC) , may owe federal taxes on its $19.3 billion in unrealized BTC gains due to a provision in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act , according to a report by Cointelegraph . This could subject the company to a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) , even though it has not sold any of its Bitcoin holdings. The news, reported by the Wall Street Journal on January 24 , raises questions about how unrealized gains on digital assets like Bitcoin might be taxed under this new framework. What Is the 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax? The corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) was introduced in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to ensure that large corporations pay a minimum tax rate of 15% on their book income —a measure of income reported to shareholders rather than the IRS. Targeted Corporations : The tax applies to corporations with average annual earnings exceeding $1 billion over the previous three years. Unrealized Gains : While CAMT primarily focuses on realized earnings, unrealized gains, particularly on digital assets , may fall under scrutiny due to the lack of explicit guidelines. How This Could Impact MicroStrategy MicroStrategy, which holds over 152,300 BTC as of January 2025, has seen the value of its Bitcoin holdings rise significantly since it began accumulating the cryptocurrency in 2020 . Massive Unrealized Gains MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings are worth approximately $19.3 billion at current market prices, representing substantial unrealized gains. Despite not selling any of its Bitcoin, the company’s balance sheet could trigger taxation under the CAMT. Potential Tax Liability If the IRS deems unrealized Bitcoin gains as part of the book income , MicroStrategy could face a 15% tax on these gains. This could translate to billions in tax liabilities, significantly impacting the company’s financial position. Legal and Regulatory Ambiguities The taxation of unrealized gains on digital assets remains a grey area: IRS Guidance The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not yet issued clear guidelines on whether unrealized gains from assets like Bitcoin qualify as book income under the CAMT. An official interpretation is expected to address these uncertainties in the near future. Potential Exemptions Legal experts speculate that the IRS may create exemptions for unrealized gains on certain assets, including cryptocurrencies. Without such exemptions, companies like MicroStrategy could be forced to restructure their holdings to avoid massive tax burdens. Impact on the Cryptocurrency Market Institutional Adoption The potential taxation of unrealized gains could deter other corporations from adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets , slowing institutional adoption. Market Volatility Concerns about taxation could trigger selling pressure on Bitcoin, potentially leading to short-term market volatility . Policy Precedent How the IRS handles this issue could set a precedent for how cryptocurrencies are taxed in the U.S., impacting both corporate and retail investors. MicroStrategy’s Response MicroStrategy has not publicly commented on its potential tax liability under the CAMT. However, the company is known for its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, with Executive Chairman Michael Saylor frequently advocating for Bitcoin as a long-term store of value . Resilience Amid Challenges : In the past, MicroStrategy has navigated regulatory and financial challenges related to its Bitcoin holdings without altering its strategy. It remains to be seen whether the CAMT could force a change in its approach. Expert Perspectives John Deaton (Crypto Legal Advocate) : “Taxing unrealized gains sets a dangerous precedent, especially for volatile assets like Bitcoin. This could have far-reaching implications for corporations and individual investors alike.” Michael Saylor (Executive Chairman, MicroStrategy) : “Bitcoin is a long-term asset. Regardless of short-term regulatory hurdles, we believe it will continue to provide value to our shareholders.” Laura Shin (Crypto Analyst) : “The IRS’s interpretation of CAMT in the context of Bitcoin could define how digital assets are treated under U.S. tax law for years to come.” What’s Next for MicroStrategy and the IRS? IRS Clarifications The IRS is expected to release formal guidelines on how CAMT applies to digital assets, potentially clarifying the treatment of unrealized Bitcoin gains. Industry Advocacy Crypto industry leaders may lobby for exemptions or revised tax policies to prevent undue burdens on companies holding digital assets. Impact on Corporate Strategies Companies with significant Bitcoin holdings may consider diversifying their portfolios or reclassifying their assets to mitigate potential tax liabilities. Conclusion The possibility of a 15% tax on MicroStrategy’s $19.3 billion in unrealized Bitcoin gains highlights the regulatory challenges facing the cryptocurrency market. As the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy’s situation underscores the need for clear and fair tax policies that address the unique nature of digital assets. How the IRS handles this issue could have a profound impact on institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For now, all eyes are on the agency’s next steps and the potential legal battles that could arise. To learn more about the latest developments shaping the crypto landscape, explore our articles on regulatory updates and corporate strategies in the cryptocurrency sector. FAQs What is the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT)? The CAMT, introduced under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, ensures corporations earning over $1 billion annually pay a minimum tax of 15% on their book income. How does CAMT affect MicroStrategy? MicroStrategy may owe taxes on its unrealized Bitcoin gains, even though it hasn’t sold any BTC, due to the CAMT’s broad definition of taxable income. Why are unrealized gains controversial in tax policy? Unrealized gains are not actualized profits, making it burdensome for companies to pay taxes on assets they haven’t sold. What role does the IRS play in this issue? The IRS is responsible for interpreting whether unrealized Bitcoin gains qualify as taxable book income under the CAMT. How might this impact Bitcoin adoption? If unrealized gains are taxed, it could deter other corporations from holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, slowing institutional adoption. What is MicroStrategy’s position on Bitcoin? MicroStrategy remains committed to Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, with Executive Chairman Michael Saylor frequently advocating for its benefits.

39525683,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=123925,1737891263,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Canada’s FINTRAC Warns of Increasing Crypto Use in Illegal Drug Trade,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fintrac-crypto-drug-trafficking-warning/,"The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) has issued a warning regarding the growing use of cryptocurrencies in laundering proceeds from synthetic opioid trafficking. The Jan. 23 alert, as reported by Cointelegraph , outlines new risk factors for identifying illicit activity, including large crypto-to-fiat conversions and deposits originating from high-risk regions . This warning is part of Project Guardian , FINTRAC’s broader initiative to combat financial crimes in the cryptocurrency space by enhancing collaboration with virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and financial institutions. Key Risk Factors Identified by FINTRAC Large Crypto-to-Fiat Conversions Criminal organizations are increasingly converting large volumes of cryptocurrency into fiat , a common method of laundering illicit funds. Deposits from High-Risk Regions Deposits originating from regions associated with high levels of drug trafficking and weak regulatory enforcement are raising red flags. Synthetic Opioid Trafficking Cryptocurrencies are being used to facilitate payments and obscure financial transactions linked to the trafficking of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl . Unregulated Virtual Asset Platforms Criminals are exploiting unregulated crypto exchanges and peer-to-peer platforms to bypass regulatory oversight and conceal their activities. Project Guardian: Strengthening the Fight Against Crypto Crimes Project Guardian is a FINTRAC initiative aimed at addressing the misuse of cryptocurrencies in financial crimes, including drug trafficking. Collaboration with VASPs : FINTRAC calls on virtual asset service providers and financial institutions to adopt enhanced due diligence practices to identify and report suspicious activity. Public-Private Partnerships : By fostering partnerships with industry stakeholders, FINTRAC seeks to improve intelligence-sharing and strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) measures. Why Cryptocurrencies Appeal to Criminal Organizations Anonymity and Pseudonymity Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer a degree of pseudonymity , making it harder to trace transactions compared to traditional banking systems. Cross-Border Transactions The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies facilitates cross-border payments , often bypassing regulatory scrutiny. Unregulated Platforms Criminals exploit unregulated or poorly regulated exchanges to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies without triggering alarms. Rapid Transactions Cryptocurrencies allow for instant transfers , enabling quick movement of funds that makes detection more difficult. Impact of Crypto Use in the Drug Trade Synthetic Opioid Epidemic The misuse of cryptocurrencies has contributed to the global opioid epidemic , with synthetic opioids like fentanyl posing significant public health challenges. Regulatory Gaps The lack of consistent global regulations on cryptocurrency use has created loopholes that criminal networks exploit. Increased Scrutiny on VASPs Virtual asset service providers now face greater pressure to enhance AML and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols. How FINTRAC Aims to Mitigate Risks Risk-Based Approach FINTRAC advises VASPs and financial institutions to adopt a risk-based approach , focusing on high-risk transactions and customers. Enhanced Reporting Requirements Businesses dealing in virtual assets must report suspicious transactions and comply with stricter monitoring standards. Education and Awareness FINTRAC is working to raise awareness about the risks associated with cryptocurrency misuse, both among industry participants and the public. Challenges in Combating Crypto-Related Financial Crimes Rapid Evolution of Technology Criminals quickly adapt to technological advancements , making it difficult for regulators to stay ahead. Global Jurisdictional Differences Disparities in cryptocurrency regulations across countries hinder international cooperation and enforcement. Sophisticated Money Laundering Techniques Techniques such as chain-hopping (moving funds between blockchains) and the use of privacy coins make tracking illicit transactions more challenging. Expert Perspectives Aaron Brogan (Crypto Legal Expert) : “FINTRAC’s proactive stance on cryptocurrency regulation is essential, but more international cooperation is needed to address cross-border financial crimes effectively.” Laura Shin (Crypto Journalist) : “The growing use of cryptocurrencies in illicit activities underscores the importance of balancing regulation with innovation to protect the broader ecosystem.” Conclusion FINTRAC’s warning about the rising use of cryptocurrencies in laundering funds from the illegal drug trade highlights the need for robust anti-money laundering measures and stronger collaboration between regulators and industry stakeholders. As criminal networks exploit the anonymity and speed of crypto transactions, initiatives like Project Guardian play a crucial role in identifying and mitigating risks. However, addressing this challenge will require global coordination, enhanced regulatory frameworks, and continued vigilance from the crypto industry. For those operating in the digital asset space, compliance with FINTRAC’s recommendations is not only a regulatory obligation but also a vital step in ensuring the integrity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

FAQs What is FINTRAC’s role in regulating cryptocurrencies? FINTRAC is Canada’s financial intelligence unit, responsible for monitoring and mitigating financial crimes, including the misuse of cryptocurrencies. What are the key risk factors identified by FINTRAC? Key risks include large crypto-to-fiat conversions , deposits from high-risk regions , and the use of unregulated platforms for laundering funds. What is Project Guardian? Project Guardian is a FINTRAC initiative aimed at combating financial crimes involving cryptocurrencies through enhanced collaboration with VASPs and financial institutions. Why are cryptocurrencies attractive to criminals? Cryptocurrencies offer pseudonymity , cross-border transaction capabilities , and access to unregulated platforms, making them appealing for illicit activities. What can VASPs do to mitigate risks? VASPs should adopt enhanced AML and KYC protocols , monitor high-risk transactions, and report suspicious activity to regulatory authorities. How can international cooperation help combat crypto crimes? Global coordination ensures consistent enforcement, addresses jurisdictional gaps, and facilitates the tracking of cross-border transactions linked to financial crimes.

As reported by Reuters , Cipollone emphasized the risks that global stablecoin development could pose to Eurozone banks , including the loss of fee revenues and shrinking client bases. This statement follows Trump’s recent executive order promoting stablecoin innovation, positioning the U.S. as a global leader in digital currency development . Meanwhile, the ECB continues to experiment with a central bank digital currency (CBDC) , but its launch hinges on legislative approval . Why a Digital Euro is Critical for the Eurozone Countering Stablecoin Dominance Trump’s executive order encourages the development of global stablecoins , which could become widely used for cross-border payments and challenge the dominance of fiat currencies like the euro. Protecting Banks from Disintermediation Stablecoins could reduce the role of traditional banks by offering lower transaction fees and bypassing intermediaries. Eurozone banks risk losing significant revenue streams if stablecoins become the preferred means of payment. Maintaining Monetary Sovereignty The widespread adoption of U.S.-backed stablecoins could weaken the euro’s role in the global economy, reducing the ECB’s ability to influence monetary policy. The ECB’s Digital Euro Experiment The ECB has been actively exploring the development of a digital euro , focusing on key areas such as: Retail Payments A digital euro could provide a secure and fast payment method , complementing cash and existing digital solutions. Financial Inclusion The ECB envisions a digital euro that ensures access to financial services for all Eurozone citizens, even in underserved regions. Cross-Border Transactions By reducing transaction costs and delays , a digital euro could improve cross-border payment efficiency, keeping the Eurozone competitive. Trump’s Stablecoin Strategy: A Game-Changer Executive Order on Stablecoins Trump’s recent order promotes the development and regulation of global stablecoins , ensuring that the U.S. leads in blockchain-based financial innovation . Private Sector Involvement Companies like BlackRock and Circle have been instrumental in advancing stablecoin adoption, with assets like USD Coin (USDC) gaining traction in global markets. Global Influence By fostering stablecoin innovation, the U.S. could solidify the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency , even in a digital economy. Challenges Facing the Digital Euro Legislative Approval The launch of a digital euro requires approval from European lawmakers , a process that could take years. Policymakers must address concerns about privacy , cybersecurity , and potential disruptions to the banking system. Public Acceptance The success of a digital euro depends on widespread consumer trust and adoption , which may require significant public education efforts. Competition from Private Stablecoins Stablecoins like USDC and Tether (USDT) already have a strong foothold in the market, posing a challenge for new entrants like the digital euro. Potential Impacts on Eurozone Banks Revenue Losses Banks could lose significant income from transaction fees as stablecoins and digital currencies reduce reliance on traditional payment systems. Reduced Intermediation If stablecoins bypass banks entirely, institutions could face reduced client bases and diminished roles in the financial ecosystem. Increased Competition The introduction of a digital euro could also introduce competition for private banks, forcing them to adapt their business models. Expert Perspectives Piero Cipollone (ECB Board Member) : “The euro’s role as a global currency is at stake. A digital euro is essential to counter the disruptive potential of U.S.-backed stablecoins.” Aaron Brogan (Crypto Legal Expert) : “Trump’s executive order is a wake-up call for the Eurozone. If the ECB doesn’t act quickly, stablecoins could erode the euro’s global influence.” Christine Lagarde (ECB President) : “We’re committed to exploring a digital euro that enhances financial inclusion while safeguarding the stability of the banking system.” Conclusion The competition between the digital euro and U.S.-backed stablecoins reflects the growing importance of digital currencies in shaping the future of global finance. While Trump’s executive order positions the U.S. as a leader in stablecoin development, the ECB faces pressure to accelerate its CBDC initiatives to maintain the euro’s relevance and protect Eurozone banks from disintermediation. However, the successful launch of a digital euro will require overcoming legislative hurdles, addressing public concerns, and ensuring compatibility with existing financial systems. For the Eurozone, this is not just a technological challenge but a matter of economic sovereignty in an increasingly digital world.

FAQs What is the purpose of the digital euro? The digital euro aims to complement cash and digital payment systems while safeguarding the euro’s role in the global economy. Why does the ECB see stablecoins as a threat? Stablecoins could reduce the role of traditional banks, lower fee revenues, and challenge the euro’s global dominance. What is Trump’s stablecoin strategy? Trump’s executive order promotes the development of global stablecoins to position the U.S. as a leader in digital currency innovation. What challenges does the digital euro face? Challenges include legislative approval, public trust, privacy concerns, and competition from established stablecoins like USDC and USDT. How could stablecoins impact Eurozone banks? Stablecoins could disintermediate banks by bypassing traditional payment systems, leading to reduced revenues and client bases. When will the digital euro launch? The ECB is still in the experimental phase, and the launch depends on legislative approval and further development.

Zhao first asked his followers if they had made a profit from memecoins, and reached 121,000 voters out of a total of 9.5 million followers. 44% of the users said they had lost money on memecoins, while 33% voted that they had made a profit from memecoins. The remaining users voted that they had not purchased any memecoins so far. Afterwards, 39 thousand people voted for the question of whether they had made a profit from Bitcoin. 50.4% of them stated that they had made money from BTC, 23% said they had lost money, and the remaining users shared that they had never bought BTC before. In his third survey, Zhao asked users if they had ever made a profit from NFTs, and the most dramatic results came in this survey. Only 15% of users said they had made a profit from NFTs, while 36% said they had lost money, and a majority of 48% said they had never purchased an NFT. Related News: Analytics Firm Assesses Solana's Next Price Targets from its Chart Finally, Zhao asked his followers the same question about BNB and the survey concluded that 31% made a profit, 27% made a loss. 41% said they had never bought BNB. Zhao, who evaluated the survey results, admitted that the results could be biased because his followers are already interested in cryptocurrencies. He attributed the fact that there are so many people making profits in Bitcoin to the fact that the BTC price is near an all-time high. *This is not investment advice.

Remarks by Armstrong came on Jan. 24 via X, formerly known as Twitter, when the crypto world was experiencing a high influx in token creation, with almost 1 million tokens being launched every week. Challenges in the Present System The current listing process at Coinbase includes extensive reviews and compliance checks, but this has become increasingly unsustainable with the number of new tokens emerging. Armstrong says it’s time to move away from the traditional “allow list” to a more scalable “block list” system. He further emphasized the need to incorporate customer reviews and automated on-chain data analysis as a way of filtering tokens for listing. We need to rethink our listing process at Coinbase, Armstrong stated, emphasizing the current system couldn’t keep up with the growth of the industry. Backlash from within the Industry Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, lashed out at Coinbase’s listing policy to indicate that TRX, a top-10 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been in review for seven years without getting listed. Sun further alleged that Coinbase had asked for extreme fees to list TRX, including $330 million in assets, a claim that has sparked controversy in the crypto space. “This is not about TRX itself; it’s about Coinbase losing its sense of fairness and sound judgment,” Sun said in a response to Armstrong’s post. Reformist Appeals Crypto influencer Ansem suggested that Coinbase hire industry veterans to smoothen the process for token listings. “Experienced individuals could easily pinpoint the 10 tokens out of a million which deserve immediate listing,” he said, emphasizing practical industry experience for token selection. To the Hybrid Model Armstrong also announced Coinbase’s plans to integrate more deeply with decentralized exchanges. He envisioned a future where customers would have a smooth trading experience, whether the transactions occurred on centralized or decentralized platforms. This hybrid approach aligns with the exchange’s broader mission to adapt to industry shifts. These comments come at a time of optimism for crypto regulation under President Donald Trump’s presidency. During a World Economic Forum appearance in Davos, he focused on how regulative clarity has set the tone and could potentially turn the fate of the crypto industry; hence, the same changes await Coinbase, whose operations go international.",Blockchain|Coinbase|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|REGULATION|TRX|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-26 11:43:15

Why? The cryptocurrency market saw Mantra ( OM ) reach a new record high Sunday, while Optimism ( OP ) plans a $53 million token unlock. Sui ( SUI ), currently on a bearish trajectory, is set to unlock $138 million in tokens this week. Read on for a more detailed look at the technicals and what the trajectory of each token shows. You might also like: Litecoin price rises as LTC ETF approval odds jump Mantra : The top crypto project in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization industry jumped to a record high of $5.08. That rebound was in line with our recent OM price prediction . Mantra soared because of the recent call by BlackRock’s CEO for regulators to approve the tokenization of stocks and bonds. It also reached a deal to tokenize DAMAC’s real estate projects in Dubai. The daily chart reveals that the Mantra price has formed a bullish flag chart pattern, a popular continuation sign. This pattern comprises a long vertical line and a rectangle pattern, and is then followed by a bullish breakout. Mantra’s flag pole is at least 156% tall. As such, measuring the same distance from $4.53 means the coin is expected to rise to $11 in the long term. Mantra price chart | Source: crypto.news Optimism : The third-biggest layer-2 network prepares to unlock tokens worth over $53 million or 1.48% of the float. It now has over 1.35 billion tokens in circulation against a total supply of 4.29 billion. Optimism’s unlock comes when the token has been under pressure in the past few months. It has dropped to a low of $1.6295, down by 40.7% from its highest level in November. Optimism is hovering at the key support at $1.6076, where it failed to move below since Dec. 20. It has also formed a symmetrical triangle pattern. Therefore, a break below that level will likely point to more downside, potentially to $1.30, its lowest swing in November last year. Optimism price chart | Source: crypto.news Sui : Like Optimism, Sui will also have a big unlock worth $138 million or 1.1% of the float on Thursday. Only 37% of all SUI tokens have been unlocked , with the final one expected to happen in 2069. Sui’s token unlock comes when it is in a technical bear market after falling 22% from its highest level this year. It has moved below the lower side of the ascending channel. The coin has moved below the 50-day moving average, while the Relative Strength Index and the MACD have continued falling. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling, with the next point to watch being at $2.9415, its lowest point on Nov. 26. Sui price chart | Source: crypto.news The other top coins to watch this week will be Pi Network, Ethereum, and dYdX. Pi Network’s know-your-customer verification deadline will end on Jan. 31. Ethereum will be in the spotlight as the market watches the controversy with the Ethereum Foundation . DYdX will unlock tokens worth $9.6 million on Wednesday.

According to reports shared on X (formerly Twitter) , major investors increased their Bitcoin holdings from 16.2 million BTC to 16.4 million BTC during this period. Conversely, individual investors saw their holdings drop from 175 million BTC to 169 million BTC , indicating a redistribution of assets as Bitcoin prices climbed. Key Findings from the Analysis Large-Handed Investors Lead the Charge CryptoQuant data shows that large-handed investors , often institutional players or whales, significantly increased their holdings post-election. The increase from 16.2 million BTC to 16.4 million BTC suggests bullish sentiment and strategic accumulation during a critical period. Decline in Retail Holdings Individual investor holdings dropped by 6 million BTC , decreasing from 175 million BTC to 169 million BTC . This decline may reflect profit-taking by retail investors or a shift toward institutional ownership. Market Impact The actions of large investors provided price traction , supporting Bitcoin’s post-election rally and reflecting confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. What Drove the Post-Election Bitcoin Rally? Market Optimism Post-Election The U.S. presidential election often triggers volatility across financial markets. For Bitcoin, the post-election period saw increased institutional confidence and speculation about crypto-friendly policies under the new administration. Institutional Accumulation Institutions capitalized on the opportunity to accumulate BTC, signaling increased adoption and long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value . Retail Profit-Taking Individual investors may have opted to sell at higher prices , leading to a redistribution of BTC from retail to institutional holders. The Role of Large Investors in Bitcoin’s Market Dynamics Whales as Market Movers Large-handed investors , often referred to as whales , have the ability to influence Bitcoin’s price trends due to their significant holdings. Their strategic actions, such as accumulation or distribution, can create market momentum. Institutional Impact Major financial institutions, funds, and corporate investors contribute to Bitcoin’s price stability and growth by providing liquidity and reducing volatility. Redistribution of Wealth The decline in individual holdings suggests a transfer of Bitcoin wealth from smaller players to large investors, reflecting shifts in market structure. Retail Investors’ Role in the Decline Profit-Taking Strategy Retail investors may have sold off Bitcoin to capitalize on price surges , leading to a reduction in their collective holdings. Psychological Factors Fear of volatility or market corrections often prompts smaller investors to sell during price rallies, contributing to short-term redistributions. Impact on Market Trends While retail investors add liquidity to the market, their actions can also amplify volatility during periods of high trading activity . Bitcoin Price Traction: A Long-Term Perspective The post-election surge highlights a broader trend of institutional adoption and market maturation : Growing Institutional Interest As institutions accumulate Bitcoin, it reinforces the narrative of BTC as a legitimate asset class for diversification and hedging. Market Confidence Increased holdings by large investors signal confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamentals , such as its finite supply and decentralized nature. Reduced Volatility Institutional participation reduces speculative swings, stabilizing Bitcoin’s price over time and fostering wider adoption. Expert Perspectives Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy Executive Chairman) : “Institutional accumulation signals a paradigm shift in how Bitcoin is perceived—as digital gold and a hedge against fiat currency devaluation.” John Wu (Blockchain Analyst) : “The redistribution of BTC from retail to institutional holders underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market and the increasing role of big players.” Aaron Brogan (Crypto Legal Expert) : “The post-election rally shows how macroeconomic events and policy expectations influence Bitcoin’s adoption and market structure.” Conclusion The post-election Bitcoin rally highlights the growing influence of large-handed investors in shaping market trends. As institutional holders increased their BTC holdings from 16.2 million to 16.4 million , retail investors reduced their positions, reflecting profit-taking and redistribution of assets. This shift underscores Bitcoin’s evolving market dynamics, where institutional adoption continues to drive growth and stability. With a favorable macroeconomic environment and increasing confidence in Bitcoin’s value, the asset is poised for sustained long-term momentum.

To emphasize his point, Kiyosaki referenced two key economic principles—Gresham’s Law and Metcalfe’s Law—highlighting Bitcoin’s growing dominance in an X post on January 25. Kiyosaki explained Gresham’s Law, which states that “bad money drives good money into hiding,” by noting how gold and silver have historically been hoarded as the U.S. dollar depreciates. He added that Bitcoin has joined this “good money” category, further challenging the “fake U.S. dollar.” “When BAD money enters a system GOOD money goes into hiding. Good money gold and silver have been hiding from FAKE US dollars for years. Today, Gold, silver, and Bitcoin are forcing the fake US dollar into hiding,” he said. Turning to Metcalfe’s Law, which quantifies the power of networks, Kiyosaki likened Bitcoin’s expanding adoption to the success of global franchises like McDonald ‘s (NYSE: MCD ). The author stressed that network power lets smaller players gain influence and wealth, urging the adoption of capitalism through assets like Bitcoin. TWO LAWS THAT GIVE BITCOIN POWER 1: GRESHAMS LAW: When BAD money enters a system GOOD money goes into hiding. Good money gold and silver have been hiding from FAKE US dollars for years. Today, Gold, silver, and Bitcoin are forcing the fake US dollar into hiding. 2:… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 25, 2025 Kiyosaki’s pessimistic dollar outlook Kiyosaki’s sentiments align with his long-held pessimism about the dollar, which he has labeled as ‘fake money.’ In this context, he has consistently championed alternative investments over traditional financial tools. As reported by Finbold, Kiyosaki recently thanked Bitcoin investors for not trusting the U.S. government, Treasury, and Federal Reserve, which he referred to as a ‘Den of Thieves.’ With the investor maintaining a controversial outlook and predicting an impending economic crash , he continues to advocate for Bitcoin, gold, and silver as ideal assets for wealth preservation in such an environment. Additionally, with Bitcoin rallying to new highs above $100,000, Kiyosaki has stressed that accumulating the leading digital asset is not too late. He has projected that Bitcoin could reach approximately $500,000 by 2025, describing it as a coin “designed to make everyone rich,” whether early adopters or latecomers. Interestingly, Kiyosaki has maintained that whenever Bitcoin’s price crashes, it should be welcomed as an opportunity to accumulate more of the asset. Which asset is better? Amid this outlook, Kiyosaki considers all three alternatives equal, dismissing the debate between Bitcoin and gold as a distraction. He suggests that such comparisons serve as a smokescreen to divert attention. Overall, Kiyosaki’s criticism of traditional finance, particularly the dollar, potentially overlooks the currency’s strength as the current global reserve currency. While there may be a chance for the dollar to be dethroned by Bitcoin, gold, or silver, which offer diversification, the currency remains a dominant player in the financial landscape despite possible erosion from inflation.

This represents a 4-point drop from the previous day, indicating a shift in market dynamics favoring Bitcoin over altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index compares the performance of the top 100 coins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A score closer to 100 indicates an Altcoin Season , while a score below 25 suggests a Bitcoin Season . What Does an Altcoin Season Index of 44 Indicate? Neutral Zone Leaning Toward Bitcoin Season With a score of 44 , the index remains in the neutral zone , but the decline suggests that Bitcoin’s performance is outpacing most altcoins in recent months. Altcoins Lag Behind Bitcoin For the market to enter an Altcoin Season , at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins must outperform Bitcoin’s rate of growth over the past 90 days. The current score implies that fewer altcoins are exceeding Bitcoin’s gains , shifting sentiment toward Bitcoin Season dominance . How Is the Altcoin Season Index Calculated? The Altcoin Season Index evaluates market trends by comparing the performance of Bitcoin against altcoins: Top 100 Coins : Only the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are considered, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. Performance Benchmark : The index analyzes whether 75% of these coins have risen more than Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Scoring System : A score closer to 100 indicates an Altcoin Season , where most altcoins outperform Bitcoin. A score closer to 0 signals Bitcoin Season , where Bitcoin dominates market performance. Why Did the Altcoin Season Index Drop? Bitcoin Price Momentum Bitcoin has experienced a significant price rally in recent months, reducing the relative performance of altcoins. Altcoin Underperformance Many altcoins have struggled to keep up with Bitcoin’s gains, contributing to the decline in the Altcoin Season Index. Market Sentiment Investors may be shifting capital back into Bitcoin amid market uncertainty, further impacting altcoin performance. Implications for the Market Bitcoin Dominance A declining Altcoin Season Index indicates that Bitcoin continues to dominate market sentiment, attracting more investment and attention. Altcoin Recovery Potential While altcoins are lagging, they could regain momentum if market conditions shift, such as a decline in Bitcoin’s dominance or major altcoin project developments. Investment Strategies Investors may adopt a more Bitcoin-centric strategy during periods of Bitcoin Season, while monitoring altcoin opportunities for future growth. Expert Perspectives John Wu (Blockchain Analyst) : “The current Altcoin Season Index score reflects a market environment where Bitcoin is outperforming due to increased institutional interest and reduced altcoin momentum.” Laura Shin (Crypto Journalist) : “A score of 44 suggests a transitional phase. Altcoins may still have potential, but Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the market for now.” Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy Executive Chairman) : “Bitcoin’s dominance is a testament to its position as the ultimate store of value. Altcoin fluctuations often reflect short-term sentiment rather than long-term adoption.” What’s Next for Altcoins and Bitcoin? Market-Wide Trends If Bitcoin continues to outperform, the Altcoin Season Index could decline further, signaling a prolonged Bitcoin Season . Potential Catalysts for Altcoins Developments in DeFi , NFTs , or specific altcoin ecosystems could reignite interest and push the index toward an Altcoin Season. Long-Term Outlook Over time, market cycles tend to balance out, with periods of Bitcoin dominance alternating with strong altcoin rallies. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s drop to 44 highlights a shift toward Bitcoin dominance , with fewer altcoins outperforming the leading cryptocurrency in recent months. This change reflects broader market trends, where Bitcoin’s strength is driving investor sentiment and shaping investment strategies. While the index remains in the neutral zone, a continued decline could signal a prolonged Bitcoin Season. However, altcoin enthusiasts should not lose hope, as market dynamics could shift with new developments in the cryptocurrency space.

Amid the market consolidation phase XRP traders have been spotted making strategic moves that could potentially trigger another major breakout, in the near-term. XRP Holds $3.1 Support as Traders Anticipate Fresh Bullish Triggers Ripple (XRP) price action has been relatively muted in recent days as crypto markets digest developments from President Trump’s first week in the White House. The launch of Trump’s memecoins has drawn significant investor attention, while discussions about the U.S. adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve currency pushed Bitcoin prices above $105,000 on Sunday. This surge in Bitcoin dominance, coupled with memecoins dominating social sentiment, has limited traction for mega-cap altcoins like XRP. Ripple (XRP) Price Action |Source: TradingView The XRP price chart above reveals that XRP is consolidating within a tight range after a significant breakout earlier this month. The consolidation zone spans between $3.3695 and $2.8277, reflecting a stalemate between buyers and sellers. This breakout, observed in the week leading up to Trump’s inauguration, coincided with the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin, which provided a notable liquidity boost. Ripple executives’ attendance at a pre-inauguration dinner at Mar-a-Lago further strengthened ties between XRP and the new administration, driving bullish sentiment. The current consolidation phase could act as a potential launchpad for further gains if market sentiment remains positive. A break above the $3.3695 resistance could resume the rally, while failure to hold $2.8277 might signal a retracement. XRP ETF Speculations Could Spark $4 Breakout as Binance Outflows hit $450M Ripple (XRP) may require another significant catalyst to break above the $4 threshold. Recent speculations surrounding altcoin ETF approvals, including fresh filings in the first week of Trump’s presidency, have fueled optimism. Reports indicate that [insert company] is progressing with an XRP Spot ETF, further lifting sentiment. While XRP’s price action remains relatively stagnant, CryptoQuant’s on-chain exchange reserves data reveals strategic movements by traders on Binance. Savvy investors appear to be positioning for long-term gains, anticipating bullish triggers like an XRP ETF approval. Ripple (XRP) Exchange Reserves vs. Price | Source: CryptoQuant As of January 16, traders on Binance held a cumulative balance of 3.04 billion XRP in exchange wallets. Since then, persistent outflows have reduced the balance to 2.89 billion XRP as of January 26. This 10-day outflow of 150 million XRP, valued at approximately $450 million, has contributed to a tightening of immediate market supply. This supply contraction has helped XRP maintain its support above $3 despite heightened altcoin market volatility during the first week of Trump’s presidency. Historically, large outflows from exchange wallets indicate traders are moving coins into cold storage, signaling long-term bullish expectations. With speculations around altcoin ETF approvals and institutional interest from the new Bitwise Dogecoin ETF filing, it’s possible that institutional players are acquiring XRP from retail traders, driving these substantial Binance outflows. XRP Price Forecast: More consolidation ahead before $4 breakout XRP’s price forecast hinges on its performance within a crucial consolidation range between $2.8 and $3.4, a zone that has defined its recent trading activity. The Ichimoku Span Intersection (ISI) pinpoints critical levels, with $2.9 acting as support and $3.6 as resistance. This tight trading range has left the market looking for directional cues, as mixed technical signals suggest both opportunities and risks. TradingView ‘s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator also affirms this dual narrative, with its latest reading of 0.22 hinting at emerging bullish momentum. However, a minor negative divergence of -0.0043 suggests underlying fragility in the current setup. A decisive move outside this consolidation range could dictate XRP’s trajectory in the coming weeks, making it a pivotal point for traders and investors alike. XRP Price Forecast | XRPUSD On the bullish side, a breakout above $3.3695, the upper boundary of the consolidation ceiling, could pave the way for a rally toward the ISI resistance at $3.5985. Should buying pressure persist, the $3.5995 ISO1 upper bound becomes a near-term target, while sustained momentum could fuel aspirations for $3.7000. The $450 million exchange outflows, and institutional accumutation, evidenced by XRP’s rebound from the multi-month low of $2.1373, adds weight to the bullish scenario and emphasizes the potential for a $4 breakout. Conversely, failure to maintain support above $2.8277 risks a retest of the ISI support level at $2.8679. A breach below this floor could accelerate selling pressure, potentially driving XRP toward $2.5000 and the ISO1 lower bounds near $2.1674.

Set Profit-Taking Goals Define clear profit-taking strategies to lock in gains during bullish periods. Expert Insights John Wu (Blockchain Analyst) : “The Fear and Greed Index at 75 reflects strong bullish sentiment, but investors should prepare for potential corrections as greed phases often precede pullbacks.” Laura Shin (Crypto Journalist) : “A sustained greed phase suggests optimism in the market, but caution is advised as excessive greed can lead to increased volatility.” Michael Saylor (Executive Chairman, MicroStrategy) : “Bitcoin’s resilience during greed phases underscores its value as a store of wealth, even amid speculative market trends.” Conclusion The Crypto Fear and Greed Index holding steady at 75 highlights the ongoing optimism in the cryptocurrency market. While this sustained greed phase suggests potential for further price growth, it also raises the risk of market corrections driven by overbought conditions. Investors should approach the market with caution, balancing optimism with risk management strategies.

Why Yeti Ouro is a top pick for investors Ethereum vsv Yeti Ouro Conclusion This is shaping up to be an eventful year for the crypto market, with 2025 predicted to be a bullish year for cryptocurrency. Ethereum (ETH) has had a shaky month so far, and Yeti Ouro (YETIO) has performed well ever since the launch of its successful presale. Yeti Ouro is distinguished as a great investment with high growth potential. Ethereum’s current performance As of January 22, 2025, Ethereum price is at $3,274.55, down 2.93% over the past month. The high over the last 24 hours was $3,362, and the low was $3,268. Ethereum Price Chart: CoinMarketCap What’s affecting ethereum’s price? Leadership Issues: The ongoing issues within the Ethereum Foundation have spooked some investors. These have slowed down progress and created uncertainty, and Ethereum is underperforming against Bitcoin and Solana. Regulatory Uncertainty: The approval of spot Ether ETFs in July 2024 was a big boost. However, the exclusion of staking from these ETFs due to unclear regulations limited the impact, and Ethereum couldn’t fully capitalize on this milestone. Market Volatility: Ethereum is still benefiting from institutional adoption and technological advancements, but its price is still sensitive to market conditions. You might also like: XRP could reach $30 by end of 2025, meanwhile Yeti Ouro thrives Yeti Ouro: Meme virality and gaming, a good match?

Deflationary Tokenomics: Yeti Ouro has a 1 billion token supply with a burn mechanism that reduces supply over time. This scarcity model means long-term price appreciation. Strong Community and Dev: Yeti Ouro’s active community and transparent team means trust and engagement, which is key to long-term growth and adoption. Ethereum vsv Yeti Ouro Growth: Ethereum is a giant in blockchain tech but is currently limited by internal and regulatory issues.

The analysis revealed that 500,000 BTC , valued at approximately $500 billion , has moved out of long-term holder wallets since November 2024 . This trend indicates a substantial shift in market dynamics, raising questions about the motivations and implications of long-term holders’ decisions to sell. Key Findings from Intuderblock’s Analysis Massive Outflow from Long-Term Holders Since Trump’s election, 500,000 BTC has exited addresses belonging to long-term holders (LTHs) . The cumulative value of these BTC holdings is estimated at $500 billion , reflecting a significant shift in the market. Accelerated Selling Activity Intuderblock’s report highlights a sharp uptick in selling activity following the election, breaking the typical pattern of hodling behavior. Impact on Bitcoin Market Dynamics The exit of such a large volume of BTC from LTH wallets could signal a change in market sentiment, affecting price trends and liquidity. Why Are Long-Term Holders Selling? Post-Election Uncertainty Political events, such as Trump’s election, often trigger market uncertainty , prompting LTHs to liquidate holdings as a precaution. Profit-Taking Behavior With Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs in recent months, long-term holders may be capitalizing on profits accumulated over years of hodling. Fear of Market Volatility Concerns over potential regulatory changes or macroeconomic instability may have influenced LTHs to reduce exposure. Shift to Other Assets Some long-term holders might be reallocating funds into stablecoins , altcoins , or traditional investments to diversify their portfolios. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin? Increased Selling Pressure The movement of 500,000 BTC out of LTH wallets introduces significant selling pressure , which could result in short-term price corrections . Liquidity Boost While selling pressure can impact prices, the release of such a large volume of BTC into the market could improve liquidity , attracting new buyers. Potential for Market Redistribution The shift from long-term holders to new investors or institutions may signal a redistribution of wealth within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Historical Context: Hodler Behavior During Major Events Long-term holders often adjust their strategies in response to significant market or political events: 2017 Bull Run Many hodlers sold during Bitcoin’s surge to $20,000 , leading to profit-taking and market corrections. 2020-2021 Institutional Boom The entry of institutional investors prompted hodlers to hold onto their BTC, expecting further price appreciation. 2024 Post-Halving Rally The recent bull run following Bitcoin’s halving event created ideal profit-taking opportunities for LTHs. Community Reactions The crypto community has expressed mixed opinions on the accelerated selling by long-term holders: Bullish Optimism Some believe the selling activity is temporary and will pave the way for new investors to enter the market. Bearish Concerns Others worry that the selling pressure could lead to a prolonged price correction or signal declining confidence in Bitcoin. Strategic Neutrality A section of analysts argues that profit-taking is a natural market cycle and doesn’t necessarily indicate bearish sentiment. Expert Insights John Wu (Blockchain Analyst) : “While the volume of BTC sold by long-term holders is significant, it’s important to consider this within the broader context of Bitcoin’s market cycles and macroeconomic factors.” Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy Executive Chairman) : “Selling activity from hodlers is part of Bitcoin’s natural market evolution. Long-term value remains intact, especially as institutions continue to adopt Bitcoin.” Laura Shin (Crypto Journalist) : “The movement of 500,000 BTC is noteworthy but not unprecedented. It highlights the need to monitor market sentiment and political developments closely.” What’s Next for Bitcoin? Market Stabilization As new buyers absorb the BTC sold by hodlers, the market could stabilize, reducing volatility in the medium term. Institutional Entry The influx of BTC into the market may attract institutional investors , providing long-term support for Bitcoin prices. Monitoring Political Developments Investors will likely keep a close eye on the Trump administration’s stance on crypto regulations , which could influence market sentiment further. Conclusion The accelerated selling of 500,000 BTC by long-term holders following Trump’s election highlights a critical shift in market dynamics . While this move introduces selling pressure, it also signals potential opportunities for new investors and reflects the natural cycles of Bitcoin’s evolving ecosystem. As the market adapts to this redistribution, the focus will remain on Bitcoin’s ability to maintain price resilience and its growing role as a store of value . Investors should monitor key developments, including regulatory policies and market sentiment, to navigate this transitional period effectively.

DOGE is still loved by many but now the Dogecoin price is facing some ups and downs. Ripple (XRP) is picking up speed with its advanced payment tech, but DTX Exchange , a new DeFi token, is getting lots of attention for its smart and easy-to-use trading platform. Let’s see why these three coins could be the top picks this year. Dogecoin Price Potential: Could DOGE Deliver Another Stellar Run? Dogecoin price is trading at nearly $0.36, and it is staying close to the lower edge of its rising channel. While the Dogecoin price holds above support levels, weak buying activity raises questions about whether it can sustain its current trend. If DOGE drops further, it might test support near $0.31, which could determine its next move. Interest in DOGE continues to grow, with Bitwise recently filing for a Dogecoin ETF, signaling a push for institutional recognition. This could increase confidence in DOGE among traditional investors. Meanwhile, the connection between Dogecoin and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) agency has sparked further speculation, adding fuel to the Dogecoin price recovery. With a market value above $53 billion, DOGE is at a crucial stage. If the Dogecoin price can move above the $0.4 resistance zone, it could regain its bullish momentum. However, failure to hold its support levels may lead to further decline. But DTX, on the other hand, is growing steadily with its successful presale and features. Why Ripple (XRP) Could Skyrocket in 2025 Ripple (XRP) is set to see more institutional interest as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) plans to launch XRP futures in February 2025. Following this news, the Ripple (XRP) price saw a rise of around 3%, reflecting growing optimism in the market. Ripple’s (XRP) legal battle with the SEC is also reaching a turning point. A settlement or victory could clear up years of uncertainty and allow Ripple (XRP) to expand its payment network globally. Experts believe a positive outcome could attract even more investors, solidifying XRP’s position as a major crypto asset. With XRP trading near $3.20 and a market cap of $184 billion, traders are closely watching its next move. If institutional adoption and legal clarity align, Ripple (XRP) could surge to 250%, making 2025 a pivotal year. DTX Exchange: 250% Potential with DeFi Capabilities Other cryptos like Dogecoin price and Ripple (XRP) have been in the spotlight for years, but DTX Exchange is bringing itself up as a different type of platform. It offers access to a wide range of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, and forex, giving traders flexibility. Built on the VulcanX blockchain, it focuses on privacy with its no-KYC policy, setting it apart from traditional exchanges. DTX contains rational features like fractional trading which means traders don’t need a lot of money to start investing. Traders can also use copy trading tools to follow experienced investors and learn their strategies. Source: DTX Exchange While DOGE and Ripple (XRP) are known for their strong communities, DTX is slowly building trust through its performance. Its token price has increased from initial $0.02 to $0.16, and the platform has raised over $12.8 million during its presale stages. DTX Exchange shows how new platforms are trying to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional trading. With its focus on offering diverse assets and practical tools, DTX could attract traders looking for something different in 2025. Final Thoughts As the Dogecoin price remains stable, Ripple (XRP) is growing in the payment sector. DTX Exchange is getting noticed for its new ideas. These three viral altcoins DOGE, XRP, and DTX could surge 250% this year, highlighting why they are attracting attention in 2025.

You see the clues, the subtle shifts in the plot, and BOOM – it plays out exactly as you predicted. Well, that’s exactly how BTC and XRP whales feel about Rollblock. These crypto giants are accumulating copious amounts of Rollblock based on its massive potential. They realize RBLK can fetch early investors as much as a 100x ROI this year. Read on to find out why they think so. Rollblock: A GambleFi disruptor poised for explosive growth Imagine Vegas-level excitement over 7,000+ AI-powered games and on-chain sports betting that are verifiable on the blockchain. That is what Rollblock is. A cutting edge online crypto casino, it leverages blockchain to promote trust and transparency, offering a provably fair gaming experience to all and sundry. This innovative approach to online gaming sets it apart in the GambleFi industry, a market that is worth just about half a trillion dollars. In addition to that, it sports a revenue-sharing model in which a fraction of the funds it realizes each week is distributed amongst RBLK holders. The numbers don’t lie: already, more than $1.75 million was wagered on Rollblock in December alone and analysts are predicting that figure to double this month. Close $10 million has been raised in the presale so far from over 45,000 early investors, returning a staggering 330% return to early backers. At $0.047 per token, getting in on Rollblock’s presale is like getting in on Apple before the iPhone. That’s why crypto whales are accumulating the token in droves. Bitcoin is digital gold, but is that enough? Everyone knows that Bitcoin is the king of cryptocurrencies. In many quarters, BTC is seen as a sort of digital gold standard. A store of value, hedge against inflation, and so on. But let’s be real, who really is expecting 100x ROI in Bitcoin this year? Probably nobody. Bitcoin matured, getting less volatile day by day, which is great for the ones holding it but not that great a case for people with high growth-seeking appetites. Crypto whales have Bitcoin as a cornerstone of their portfolio, but they are also looking for ways to multiply their wealth. And right now, Rollblock provides them that unique opportunity. Ripple’s potential marred by a never-ending regulatory rollercoaster Ripple has been on a wild ride in recent times, hitting a new all-time high that has drawn more attention to it. However, XRP’s never-ending issues with the SEC puts a lid on things. These legal battles have created uncertainty and volatility for XRP. While the new US government promises regulatory clarity for XRP, it is still a gamble. And smart investors do not base their investments on speculation alone. This limits XRP’s potential to make gargantuan returns, and that’s why XRP whales have their eyes on Rollblock. The bottom line Rollblock is where the smart money is going. This doesn’t mean dumping BTC or XRP is the way to go, the main idea here is to pay closer attention to Rollblock. BTC and XRP whales are diversifying their portfolios, recognizing the immense potential of this new project. It’s a disruptive force in a big industry and the presale is a unique chance to get in early before the rest of the market catches on. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

39528410,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=683297,1737896429,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Solana Active Addresses Surge To 832K Per Hour Outpacing Ethereum Amid TRUMP Meme Coin Hype,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-active-addresses-surge-to-832k-per-hour-outpacing-ethereum-amid-trump-meme-coin-hype/,"Solana has been navigating a highly volatile market environment ever since the launch of the TRUMP meme coin, which has brought unprecedented attention to its ecosystem. Price action has been erratic, leaving many investors uncertain about the network’s short-term direction. While some are predicting a broader market retrace, the Solana ecosystem’s underlying metrics tell a different story of growth and resilience. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Keep Buying As Price Struggles – Expert Discloses Massive Accumulation According to key data from Glassnode, the TRUMP meme coin launch has sparked a surge in activity within the Solana network. The number of active addresses on Solana has skyrocketed, reaching an impressive 832,000 addresses per hour. This is a remarkable milestone, showcasing Solana’s ability to handle and attract significant user engagement. This surge in activity highlights Solana’s growing appeal as a go-to blockchain for high-speed, high-volume applications, particularly in the meme coin sector. As the market continues to speculate on Solana’s price movements, its strong network fundamentals suggest a foundation that could withstand current volatility and drive long-term growth. Investors and analysts are closely watching whether this surge in activity can sustain Solana’s momentum in the weeks ahead. Solana Network Growing Fast After a period of market consolidation, Solana remains strong, just below its all-time high, positioning itself as a leading force poised for a massive rally. Analysts and investors are closely monitoring Solana’s price action, anticipating that a breakout into price discovery could serve as the catalyst for the next altseason. As the debate around Solana versus Ethereum intensifies, recent metrics reveal compelling insights into the evolving dynamics between the two networks. Glassnode recently shared a report on X that underscores Solana’s impressive network activity, fueled in part by the launch of the TRUMP meme coin. Since this event, the Solana ecosystem has seen a surge in user engagement, with active addresses reaching an extraordinary 832,000 per hour. This figure dwarfs Ethereum’s activity, which currently averages just 31,000 active addresses per hour—a stark contrast highlighting a significant shift in user focus toward Solana. This data not only showcases Solana’s scalability and capacity to handle high transaction volumes but also cements its reputation as a preferred network for emerging projects, particularly in the meme coin sector. As investors continue to assess Solana’s potential, its robust fundamentals and growing ecosystem suggest it is well-equipped to lead the next phase of market growth. Related Reading: Cardano Consolidates In A Symmetrical Triangle – Analyst Expects A 40% Move If Solana manages to break past its all-time high and enter price discovery, it could ignite widespread enthusiasm across the altcoin market. With strong user activity and a growing base of developers and projects, Solana appears ready to solidify its position as a major player in the cryptocurrency space, rivaling Ethereum’s dominance. The coming weeks will be crucial as Solana strives to maintain its momentum and deliver on investor expectations. Price Action Details: Key Supply Levels Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $256, maintaining its position above a key demand level that has provided strong support in recent sessions. This resilience has kept bullish sentiment intact, with traders eyeing further upside potential. However, the focus now shifts to critical supply zones, particularly at $266 and Solana’s all-time high (ATH) of $295. A successful push above $266 could act as a stepping stone for SOL to retest its ATH, signaling renewed momentum and attracting further buying interest. Breaking and holding above $295 would not only confirm the bullish trend but also likely send Solana into price discovery, potentially igniting enthusiasm across the altcoin market. Despite the promising outlook, maintaining support above $240 remains crucial for sustaining the bullish thesis. Losing this level could trigger increased selling pressure, potentially pushing Solana into a deeper consolidation or correction phase. Such a move would challenge the current upward momentum and dampen short-term investor sentiment. Related Reading: XRP Forms A Bullish Pattern In 4-Hour Chart – Analyst Expects $4.20 After Breakout For now, Solana appears well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory, provided bulls can defend key levels and reclaim important supply zones. The next few trading sessions will be pivotal in determining whether SOL can sustain its rally and deliver on the market’s optimistic expectations.

Even with regulatory hurdles, XRP has stayed significant by enabling almost instant, low-cost international transactions. Its trajectory has become a model for other projects aiming to bridge the divide between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Currently, a new player is capturing attention in the crypto world— DTX Exchange (DTX) . With its innovative technology and potential to disrupt the $10 billion TradFi market, DTX is quickly gaining momentum and might become the next major altcoin by 2025. Will XRP Surpass the $3.40 Resistance and Start a Bullish Trend? XRP is famous for its volatile price changes, and 2025 is shaping up to be no exception. The cryptocurrency has recently experienced its most significant Bollinger Bands expansion, exceeding the fluctuations seen during the 2017 bull market. This indicates heightened market activity and possible major price shifts, with XRP currently stabilizing around $3.17 after a minor 4% drop over the week. Source: Tradingview The $3.40 resistance level is under close scrutiny from traders, as breaking through could trigger a bullish surge. Analysts believe overcoming this barrier could drive XRP to short-term goals of $4.20, with longer-term possibilities reaching up to $6.60. Despite current uncertainties, XRP remains robust within its main support range of $2.52 to $2.94, boosting hopes for an imminent breakout. Ripple's expanding role in cross-border payments and the buzz around a possible spot XRP ETF are adding to its positive outlook. DTX Exchange: The Leading $0.16 Utility Altcoin Transforming the Market DTX Exchange is rapidly gaining attention in the crypto community. Its VulcanX blockchain hit a groundbreaking 200,000 transactions per second (TPS) during its test phase, far outpacing rivals like Solana and Ethereum. This technological superiority, paired with its user-centric ecosystem, positions DTX as a game-changer in the $10 billion trading sector. Phoenix Wallet, part of the platform, has been downloaded over 330,000 times, offering secure, decentralized management for a broad array of assets, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex, and tokenized real-world assets. By connecting TradFi and DeFi, DTX aims to provide unmatched convenience and scalability. In its final presale phase, the DTX Token is available for $0.16, with analysts predicting a possible 5,000% increase after its public debut. The nearly $13 million raised in presales highlights growing trust in DTX's ambitious goals. Reasons DTX Might Surpass XRP in 2025 While XRP maintains its reputation as a leader in cross-border payments, DTX offers a novel approach with its emphasis on practical utility and multi-asset trading solutions. Its 200,000 TPS capability, along with its successful presale, positions it as a formidable contender in the Layer-1 blockchain arena. Additionally, the buzz around DTX’s final presale round enhances its attraction. Early investors are keen to acquire tokens before the platform’s public release, drawn by its cutting-edge features and high ROI prospects. Market Forecast As XRP stabilizes around pivotal resistance points, its capacity to maintain momentum will be crucial in reaching its long-term price aspirations of $6.60 or more. In contrast, DTX Exchange presents a distinct chance for investors aiming for the next significant market opportunity. With its final presale phase wrapping up and an expanding ecosystem ready to make waves, DTX could potentially mirror XRP's past success, delivering substantial gains for early supporters.

Despite facing regulatory challenges, XRP has maintained its relevance by offering near-instant, low-cost cross-border transactions. Its journey has set a benchmark for other projects aspiring to bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Now, a new contender is making waves in the crypto space— DTX Exchange (DTX) . With its cutting-edge technology and disruptive potential in the $10 billion TradFi market, DTX is rapidly gaining traction and could position itself as the next big altcoin of 2025. Can XRP Price Break Through $3.40 Resistance and Ignite a Bullish Rally? XRP is known for its dramatic price swings, and 2025 is proving no different. The cryptocurrency recently recorded its largest-ever Bollinger Bands expansion, surpassing even the volatility seen during the 2017 bull run. This signals increased market activity and the potential for significant price movements, with XRP currently consolidating around $3.17 after a slight weekly decline of 4%. Source: Tradingview Traders are closely watching the critical $3.40 resistance level, which could serve as a launchpad for a bullish breakout. Analysts suggest that surpassing this level could push XRP toward short-term targets of $4.20, with long-term projections reaching as high as $6.60. Despite short-term uncertainty, XRP continues to hold strong within its primary support range of $2.52 to $2.94, reinforcing optimism for an upcoming breakout. Ripple’s growing adoption in cross-border payments and speculation surrounding a potential spot XRP ETF are further fueling its bullish outlook. DTX Exchange: The $0.16 Utility Altcoin Leading a Market Shift DTX Exchange is quickly becoming the talk of the crypto space. Its VulcanX blockchain achieved a record-breaking 200,000 transactions per second (TPS) during its testnet, putting it leagues ahead of competitors like Solana and Ethereum. This technological edge, combined with its user-focused ecosystem, positions DTX as a revolutionary platform in the $10 billion trading industry. The platform's Phoenix Wallet, now with over 330,000 downloads, provides secure, decentralized custody for a diverse range of assets, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex, and tokenized real-world assets. By bridging traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi), DTX aims to offer unparalleled convenience and scalability. Currently in its final presale round, the DTX Token is priced at $0.16, with analysts forecasting a potential 5,000% surge following its public launch. With close to $13 million raised, the presale success underscores growing confidence in DTX’s ability to deliver on its ambitious vision. Why DTX Could Outperform XRP in 2025 While XRP’s legacy as a pioneer in cross-border payments remains strong, DTX brings a fresh perspective with its focus on real-world utility and multi-asset trading solutions. Its 200,000 TPS performance, coupled with its viral presale success, positions it as a strong competitor in the Layer-1 blockchain race. Moreover, the excitement surrounding DTX’s final presale round adds to its appeal. Early investors are eager to secure tokens before the platform’s public launch, drawn by its innovative features and massive ROI potential. Market Outlook As XRP consolidates near critical resistance levels, its ability to sustain momentum will determine whether it can achieve its long-term price targets of $6.60 or higher. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange offers a unique opportunity for investors seeking the next moonshot. With its final presale round nearing completion and a growing ecosystem poised for disruption, DTX could very well mirror XRP’s historic rise, delivering exponential gains for early adopters.

The appeals court has asked both parties to comply with the schedule order, failing which may result in the dismissal of the appeal . Ripple Labs and CEO Brad Garlinghouse by April 7, 2025 . US Appeals Court Sets Schedule in XRP Lawsuit In the latest court filing, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a docketing notice for appeals related to In re Ripple Labs Inc Litigation rulings by the district court. In addition, the court issued a scheduling order with the Sostack v. Ripple Labs case title. The appellant filed an individual claim against Ripple , XRP II and CEO Brad Garlinghouse in the XRP lawsuit regarding violations of securities laws. Notably, the district court has ruled in favor of Ripple and CEO Brad Garlinghouse, but it is now challenged in the appeals court. Furthermore, the court asked parties to file any motions seeking relief from this court separately. The motions filed along with the notice of appeal in the district court are not automatically transferred to this court for filing. Time Schedule Order in Ripple Lawsuit As per the scheduling order by the appeals court, appellant Bradley Sostack needs to file the Mediation Questionnaire due by January 29 . Also, the court has given the March 6 deadline for submitting the appeal opening brief. This provides exact arguments against Ripple Labs, XRP II and CEO Brad Garlinghouse in the XRP lawsuit. The ruling in this case may create a binding precedent for the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit. Ripple Labs, XRP II and CEO Brad Garlinghouse will submit an appeals answering brief by April 7, 2025 . Notably, the company will file its brief in Ripple vs SEC case by April 16 , as per a filing in the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. Also, the optional reply may be filed within 21 days from the submission of the answering brief, as per the time schedule order. Latest Developments in XRP Lawsuit Meanwhile, Ripple and CEO Garlinghouse are pushing to end the lawsuit , urging Sostack and the plaintiff class to pay for expenses incurred in the irrational arguments. The crypto company submitted the ‘bill of costs’ after the district court ruled in favor, seeking funds for time wasted and expenses incurred in the lawsuit for securities violations. In the latest court filing in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, lead plaintiff Bradley Sostack has appealed against costs taxed in the amount of $210,591.52 against class plaintiffs.

As a long-standing project, Litecoin is often referred to as digital silver to Bitcoin’s digital gold. However, while Litecoin’s resurgence has captured attention, analysts are increasingly favoring Lightchain AI , a blockchain project poised for exponential growth. With a presale that has already raised $12.9 million and tokens priced at just $0.005625, Lightchain AI offers a unique opportunity for early investors seeking high returns. Litecoin - Solid Performer but Limited Growth Potential As of January 25, 2025 litecoin (LTC) trades at about $113.99. New news, like Canary Capital's changed S-1 paper for a litecoin ETF, makes people hopeful, causing a 17% jump in price and a 300% rise in trading amount. Experts think LTC can͏ go over $150 in 2025 with some guesses hitting up to $200. Yet, even with these good signs, Litecoin's chance to grow might be small next to new coins that have better features and wider uses. Its strong place and steadiness make it a safe choice but the fast change of the crypto market brings troubles for big lasting value. Lightchain AI - Next Big Opportunity Lightchain AI stands out by combining blockchain and artificial intelligence to address key challenges like data privacy, scalability, and efficiency, setting it apart from payment-focused projects like Litecoin. During its presale, Lightchain AI raised an impressive $12.9 million, with tokens priced at just $0.005625, highlighting strong investor confidence. A $200 investment at this price secures 35,556 tokens, which could grow to $17,778 if the token value reaches $0.50. Analysts even predict a 300X growth potential as adoption increases. With applications spanning industries, Lightchain AI offers real-world utility that drives demand for its technology. As a rising star in the crypto space, it presents significant growth potential compared to more established projects. Why Analysts Favor Lightchain AI Analysts are turning their attention to Lightchain AI because of its potential to deliver life-changing returns. While Litecoin’s gains are notable, its growth is inherently capped by its position as an established cryptocurrency. Lightchain AI , on the other hand, is still in its early stages, offering investors the opportunity to get in before the project gains mainstream attention. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s focus on solving real-world problems ensures it has a long-term growth trajectory. By addressing issues like data privacy and scalability, it’s positioning itself as more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s a technological platform with wide-reaching applications. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Known as digital silver in comparison to Bitcoin’s digital gold, Litecoin has been a staple in the crypto world for years. Despite Litecoin's recent surge in popularity, analysts are increasingly turning their focus to Lightchain AI , a blockchain initiative set for substantial growth. Already having attracted $12.9 million in its presale phase, with tokens priced at a mere $0.005625, Lightchain AI presents a promising avenue for early investors seeking significant returns. Litecoin - A Reliable Option but Growth is Limited As of January 25, 2025, Litecoin (LTC) is trading around $113.99. Recent developments, such as Canary Capital's amended S-1 filing for a Litecoin ETF, have sparked optimism, leading to a 17% price increase and a 300% surge in trading volume. Experts believe LTC could surpass $150 in 2025, with some forecasts even reaching $200. Nevertheless, despite these encouraging indicators, Litecoin's growth potential may seem limited when compared to newer cryptocurrencies that offer enhanced features and broader applications. While its established position and stability make it a secure option, the rapidly evolving crypto landscape poses challenges for achieving substantial long-term value. Lightchain AI - A Promising New Prospect Lightchain AI distinguishes itself by integrating blockchain and artificial intelligence to tackle essential issues like data privacy, scalability, and efficiency, carving a niche distinct from payment-centric projects like Litecoin. During its presale phase, Lightchain AI secured an impressive $12.9 million, selling tokens at just $0.005625, indicating strong investor interest. With this price point, a $200 investment could acquire 35,556 tokens, potentially growing to $17,778 if the token value climbs to $0.50. Analysts are predicting a possible 300X increase as adoption grows. With applications across various sectors, Lightchain AI offers practical utility that fuels demand for its technology. As an emerging leader in the crypto domain, it shows significant growth potential compared to more established ventures. Reasons Analysts Prefer Lightchain AI Analysts are increasingly drawn to Lightchain AI due to its potential to offer transformative returns. Although Litecoin has experienced notable gains, its growth is somewhat restricted because of its status as a well-established cryptocurrency. In contrast, Lightchain AI is still in its infancy, providing investors the chance to engage before the project captures widespread attention. Moreover, Lightchain AI’s emphasis on addressing real-world challenges ensures it has a sustainable growth path. By tackling issues such as data privacy and scalability, it’s positioning itself not just as a cryptocurrency, but as a technological platform with extensive applications. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The market, which attracted $120 million in trading volume, was resolved to “Yes” on January 20 after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a law banning the app due to national security concerns. The controversy stems from the timing and interpretation of the ban. On January 19, TikTok began displaying a notice to U.S. users stating the app would no longer be accessible, coinciding with the Supreme Court’s decision. Biden Administration Cites ByteDance as National Security Threat in TikTok Ban The Biden administration justified the ban, citing ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese parent company, as a national security threat for allegedly collecting user data on behalf of a “designated foreign adversary.” However, complications arose when President Donald Trump intervened just a day later, granting TikTok a 75-day extension to negotiate terms with ByteDance. This led many Polymarket users to argue that the app was not effectively banned, as it remains operational for most Americans. Dissent within the Polymarket community was immediate. A user named Sky questioned the outcome, stating, “The ban didn’t happen, and TikTok is working fine for most Americans. Trump gave it an extension literally live. So why is it 99% Yes?” I need explanation please @Polymarket In your about info it says: This market will resolve to ""Yes"" if the TikTok app is banned for download and/or use by the majority of Americans in the United States by April 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to… — Sky (@SkyVVIP) January 21, 2025 Others, like silkroad69, defended the resolution, noting that the law banning TikTok officially went into effect on January 19, regardless of temporary extensions. The uproar escalated as some bettors accused Polymarket of manipulating the result. A user named Spot called the decision “disgusting” and labeled the platform a “scam.” A petition demanding accountability for alleged manipulation has since surfaced, though it has garnered fewer than 100 signatures. Polymarket relies on UMA’s Optimistic Oracle (OO) to resolve disputes in its prediction markets. However, in this case, the process bypassed UMA’s Data Verification Mechanism (DVM), a move that further fueled accusations of unfair practices. This is not the first controversy Polymarket has faced. In 2024, disputes over the resolution of Ethereum ETF and Barron Trump-related prediction markets drew similar backlash, with accusations of inconsistency and manipulation. Polymarket Seeks $50M in Funding to Enhance Operation Despite the criticism, Polymarket is reportedly seeking $50 million in funding to enhance its operations and introduce tokens that allow users to validate outcomes. In August, leading financial data and news service provider Bloomberg LP revealed that it aims to incorporate election odds data from the crypto betting platform Polymarket into its widely used Terminal. Polymarket, a blockchain-based prediction market operating on the Polygon network, has become a prominent platform for tracking real-time election odds. The platform allows users to bet on a wide range of event outcomes, leveraging transparent on-chain data and smart contracts for trade execution and payouts. Last year, five United States Senators and three House representatives called for a ban on betting activities linked to the upcoming 2024 presidential election.

According to recent reports, casinos and online gambling could be legalized and carried out using digital assets. The move, which the authorities claim will boost investment and tourism, is backed by the former Prime Minister of Thailand Thaksin Shinawatra. According to the former PM, legalizing online gambling could turn out big for the country, with his estimates putting the country’s annual revenue from the activities at 100 million baht (approximately $2.89 billion). The country has also approved a draft law to that effect, trying to use the law to establish online gambling and casinos as powerhouses and revenue generators in the future. For now, underground gaming and gambling will remain illegal and culprits will be prosecuted. Thai residents oppose gambling legalization The Thai government officially oversees state-controlled horse races and its lottery. However, soccer betting and other kinds of underground gambling are still rampant, an aspect that the country will be looking to benefit from. This is majorly because of the vast sums of money that exchange hands in the sector. Meanwhile, in a poll launched by the National Institute of Development Administration, about 69% of the respondents were against legalizing online gambling, with about 59% strongly opposing entertainment complexes and casinos. 29% of the respondents favored both. The poll was carried out on Monday and Tuesday, and about 1,310 respondents, both males and females, were interviewed. There have been arguments concerning the draft law, with most proponents highlighting the benefits that it could bring to the country. Aside from the revenue generated by the country annually, there have also been arguments about boosting job creation and making these gambling locations easily accessible to tourists. There has also been the mention of using digital assets, which has also been boosted by Trump’s emergence as US president. There has also been the issue of surrounding countries, including Cambodia, the Philippines, Myanmar, Singapore, and Laos having large casino complexes, ones that they have put to good use. The Thai government argues that opposing the bill will not only mean that the country is ignoring potential revenue, it also means it may not reach its potential as a tourist destination. Former PM advocates for crypto and gambling Former Thailand PM Thaksin Shinawatra is also a big crypto advocate, always highlighting the benefits it could have on the economy of Thailand. In a recent post, he urged Thai citizens to embrace the asset, noting that it has the potential to rise to $850,000 in the future. He also mentioned that a crypto sandbox will be launched in the country before the end of the year. This will enable tourists to spend more digital assets during their visits, which is a win for the country, according to Shinawatra. Shinawatra mentioned in a recent statement that the country will try to create a system that will help to monitor and control the excesses of the industry. One feature he highlighted is creating a system that will prevent underage use while helping to monitor addicts. While Thailand is currently struggling with crypto regulation, it is likely that once the draft law is officially passed, it could open up the country to look into crypto regulation, boosting global adoption.

Pi Network’s KYC deadline is nearing The Pi Network (PI) coin, which is available only on HTX, was trading at $43.22 on Sunday, a few points above the double-bottom point at $38. According to the Pi Network’s developers, the KYC deadline for the pioneers will end on January 31. Verified pioneers hope that the deadline will not be extended again since it has already been postponed two times. The extensions were because, while over 13 million pioneers were verified, only 8 million of them had transferred their coins to the mainnet. As such, the KYC verification will likely end if at least 10 million of these members have moved their coins to the mainnet. The KYC verification is an important process since it is one of the three conditions that needs to happen before the mainnet launch. The other condition is that the network needs to have at least 100 mainnet-ready applications. You might also like: Pi Network mainnet launch is coming: will Pi coin rise or fall? In the last update, the developers noted that there were about 80 apps, meaning that 20 more needs to be ready before the mainnet launch happens. The third condition on the external environment has already been met. Therefore, the Pi coin price will likely surge if the developers confirm that the mainnet launch will happen this quarter. This launch will be important because it will let pioneers who have been mining the coin for over six years sell their holdings for fiat. As part of preparing for Open Network in Q1 2025, Pi Network made Mainnet Pi apps accessible through the Ecosystem Interface on the Pi Browser.

For example, coins like Hamster Kombat ( HMSTR ), Catizen ( CATI ), and DOGS have all crashed by double digits after their airdrops. Pi Network price analysis Pi Network chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the Pi coin price plunged to the key support at $38 last week. This was a crucial level since it coincided with the lowest level in October last year. That is a sign that it has formed a double-bottom pattern whose neckline is at $91.50. A double-bottom is a highly popular bullish reversal sign. Therefore, Pi Network price may jump by over 110% if the developers confirm when the mainnet launch will happen. Such a price action happened in October last year when it jumped from $37 to $100 within a few days. However, another deadline extension will likely lead to a strong breakdown, potentially to $30, the lowest swing in September. Please note: Pi Network’s IoU is not affiliated with the real Pi project. Instead, it is an ERC token that is only available on HTX and is often seen as a proxy for the main project.

As of January 10, 2025, DOGE was trading at $0.335 per token, just slightly rising 1.07% from the previous day. Though one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies, with a market valuation of about $49.44 billion, Dogecoin's potential for exponential expansion seems limited compared to its early years. The crypto market has evolved significantly, and Dogecoin is no longer the ""baby token"" it used to be. Its price has stagnated, and experts see modest increases in the next few years. Especially in front of its explosive 14,000% increase, the same fervour that propelled its rise in 2021 has faded as the coin aged. Though Dogecoin is currently the seventh-largest cryptocurrency, it is obvious that the age of sharp, rapid price swings for DOGE is past. A new coin is taking the stage in its place: Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance (RXS): The New Contender Rexas Finance, a Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenizing platform, is an altcoin with great interest from investors looking for high development. Launched in September 2024, Rexas Finance has transformed the tokenization of assets, including real estate and commodities, facilitating personal creation, management, and trading of asset-backed tokens. Rexas Finance offers a creative answer to a major asset management issue and has a clear use case, unlike Dogecoin. Rexas Finance has had an amazing presale. Initially priced at just $0.03 per token, the project has seen its token value surge to $0.175 in its 11th presale stage, marking a 483% increase. This development much exceeds Dogecoin's current performance. All without support from significant venture money, Rexas Finance has raised $38,080,636 from selling 408,315,633 overall. This great grassroots support shows the platform's rising credibility. Why Rexas Finance is Set to Surpass Dogecoin’s Gains The possible expansion of Rexas Finance is enormous. Unlike Dogecoin, which has already reached a significant market cap, Rexas Finance is still in its early stages, leaving room for substantial price increases. Analysts project that Rexas Finance might see a 17,000% price increase by the end of 2025. Particularly with forthcoming listings on major exchanges, the demand for the platform's token, RXS, is projected to rise quickly, given its distinctive approach to tokenized asset management. The platform's recent Certik audit, which has given investors more confidence by guaranteeing that the token is safe and dependable, further fuels the increasing curiosity about RXS. Rexas Finance plans to introduce a suite of tools that could revolutionize real-world asset investment, further adding to its value proposition. Rexas Finance gives individuals who missed the boat with Dogecoin a new chance to profit from the positive momentum of the contemporary crypto industry. For investors searching for the next great gain, Rexas Finance is an interesting token since analysts predict a comparable, if not greater, increase in value relative to Dogecoin's all-time high. How to Buy Rexas Finance (RXS) Here's how you may get in on the presale activity and invest in Rexas Finance . You will first need a suitable wallet, such as Trust Wallet or MetaMask. As you must connect to the Rexas Finance platform, ensure your wallet is configured to enable Wallet Connect. To pay for gas expenses—required for transaction processing on the Ethereum blockchain—you must add Ethereum (ETH) to your wallet. See the official Rexas Finance website at rexas.com once your wallet is ready. Click the ""Connect Wallet"" button to connect your wallet to the website platform. After connecting, on the Rexas dashboard, choose your desired payment method, ETH or USDT. Enter the money you wish to invest to determine how many RXS tokens you will receive in return. Once you confirm the transaction, your wallet will ask you to verify the specifics. Once the transaction is verified on the Ethereum network, your RXS tokens will be delivered straight to your wallet, where you can monitor their development. Conclusion Rexas Finance has a long way to go before it reaches its full potential; it is still in the presale stages. Rexas Finance presents an interesting prospect for early investors with its creative approach to asset tokenization, great community support, and forecasts of notable price gains. Although early investors may have profited greatly from Dogecoin, Rexas Finance holds the key to future explosive expansion and could yield profits above what DOGE has achieved.

Despite being one of the top cryptocurrencies with a market value of around $49.44 billion, Dogecoin's chances for rapid growth appear restricted compared to its early days. The crypto landscape has changed a lot, and Dogecoin is no longer the ""newcomer"" it once was. Its price has hit a plateau, and experts predict only slight gains in the coming years. While it had a spectacular 14,000% jump at its peak, the enthusiasm that fueled its 2021 surge has waned as the coin has matured. Although Dogecoin still stands as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency, it's clear that the era of dramatic, swift price changes for DOGE has passed. Taking its place is a new player: Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance (RXS): The Fresh Challenger Rexas Finance is making waves as a Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenizing platform, attracting investors eager for substantial growth. Since its launch in September 2024, Rexas Finance has revolutionized how assets like real estate and commodities are tokenized, enabling individuals to create, manage, and trade tokens backed by tangible assets. Unlike Dogecoin, Rexas Finance offers a practical solution to a significant asset management challenge and has a defined use case. Its presale has been remarkable; starting at just $0.03 per token, the value surged to $0.175 by the 11th presale stage, marking a 483% increase.

Without any major venture capital backing, Rexas Finance has impressively raised $38,080,636 through the sale of 408,315,633 tokens overall, highlighting the growing trust in the platform. Why Rexas Finance Could Eclipse Dogecoin’s Achievements The growth potential for Rexas Finance is immense. Unlike Dogecoin, which has already reached a considerable market size, Rexas Finance is still in its infancy, suggesting room for significant price hikes. Analysts anticipate that Rexas Finance could experience a 17,000% increase in value by the end of 2025. With upcoming listings on major exchanges, the demand for RXS tokens is expected to escalate rapidly due to its unique method of handling tokenized assets. The recent Certik audit, which assured investors of the token's security and reliability, further boosts the growing interest in RXS. Rexas Finance is set to launch a suite of tools that could transform real-world asset investments, enhancing its value proposition. For those who missed out on Dogecoin's meteoric rise, Rexas Finance offers a new opportunity to capitalize on the positive momentum in today's crypto market. Analysts predict that RXS could see a comparable, if not greater, rise in value than Dogecoin's historic highs, making it an attractive option for investors seeking the next big gain. Steps to Purchase Rexas Finance (RXS) Here's how you can join the presale and invest in Rexas Finance . First, you'll need a compatible wallet like Trust Wallet or MetaMask.

Key facts about MELANIA meme coin,https://crypto.news/what-is-melania-coin-how-does-it-work/,"Just two days before his inauguration, newly elected U.S. president Donald Trump launched his meme coin, $TRUMP, which shot into the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap within 24 hours. Not to be outdone, the very next day, his wife Melania announced the launch of her own meme coin, $MELANIA. What is Melania coin (MELANIA), how does it work, and what are its prospects in the crypto market? Table of Contents What is Melania Coin? How does Melania coin work? Melania coin price history Risks and future trends FAQs What is Melania Coin? Melania coin is a meme token built on the Solana blockchain. The official website makes it clear that the coin is all about fun and collecting—it’s not intended as a financial tool or investment. What makes the project stand out is its deep connection to the political world and backing from influential figures in the crypto space. This unique mix of traditional politics and cryptocurrency has created a fascinating precedent for how these two worlds can collide.

You can buy $MELANIA now,” she told her followers. Not to be outshined, her husband, newly elected President Donald Trump, quickly reposted her announcement to his massive audience, which contributed to the popularity of MELANIA. How does Melania coin work? As we’ve already pointed out, Melania coin cryptocurrency runs on the ultra-fast, energy-efficient Solana blockchain, which allows for lightning-quick transactions at incredibly low fees. Screenshot from the official Melania coin website | Source: melaniameme.com The total supply amounts to 1 billion MELANIA tokens. Out of these, 15% has been set aside for public distribution, 35% is dedicated to team vesting, and the rest is split between liquidity, the treasury, and community initiatives. One standout feature of the project is its transparent vesting process for the team. It starts with a 30-day lockup period, followed by a gradual, linear release of tokens over the span of a year — keeping things fair and above board. Melania coin price history So far, the price history of Melania coin (MELANIA) is pretty short. On the very first day after its launch on January 19, the token reached an all-time high of $13.73, according to CoinMarketCap . However, by the evening, the price had dropped to around $7.5. Later that night and into the early hours of January 20, the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration, it surged back above $12, but then it plummeted rapidly to about $3.5. In the following days, the price continued to decline. By January 24, Melania meme coin had fallen to approximately $2.7, with a market cap of about $460 million. Risks and future trends According to a report from Chainalysis, a handful of “whales” control much of the MELANIA and TRUMP coins. While many small investors are getting onboard, about 50 wallets have made over $10 million each. Most holders of TRUMP or MELANIA have invested modest amounts — typically under $100. However, a few massive wallets are sitting on hundreds hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of these coins. It’s pretty alarming just how much power the whale investors have over the whole market. Plus, Melania meme coin has seen its price plummet as the initial excitement has begun to fade. Can this coin rise again, or is it headed towards irrelevance? Only time will tell.

Reflecting on his recent time at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Armstrong revealed that conversations with major market leaders were dominated by Trump’s plans for digital assets. “Basically, every conversation I had with major market leaders was focused on what the Trump administration planned to do on crypto,” Armstrong said in a Jan. 24 post on X . Trump is Pushing Industry Players to Step Up He added that Trump’s bold vision is pushing industry players to step up, with many striving to avoid being left behind in the rapidly evolving landscape. During the WEF, Trump pledged to make the United States the “world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto.” This commitment, one of his first public statements since taking office on Jan. 20, has set a transformative tone for the industry. Armstrong praised Trump’s approach, along with the leadership of Argentina’s President Javier Milei and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, for embracing free markets as drivers of prosperity. Among Trump’s speculated plans is the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, though his latest executive order hints at a broader vision. The order calls for the formation of a working group to evaluate a strategic national digital assets stockpile, leaving room for other cryptocurrencies to be included. Armstrong also noted that financial institutions are accelerating their investments in crypto, signaling a surge in competition and innovation. “There are going to be more players and competition than ever in crypto, and we welcome it all,” Armstrong said, emphasizing the potential for crypto to modernize the global financial system. https://t.co/wOhYg1vmzr — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) January 24, 2025 However, regulatory hurdles persist. Traditional finance executives at the WEF, including Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, expressed interest in Bitcoin but acknowledged that regulatory restrictions limit their involvement. “At the moment, from a regulatory perspective, we can’t own, we can’t principal, we can’t be involved with Bitcoin at all,” Solomon said, describing Bitcoin as an “interesting speculative asset.” Trump Frenzy Triggers Inflows of $2.2B into Digital Asset Products Triggered by the Trump inauguration euphoria, digital asset products saw record inflows of $2.2 billion last week. According to the latest CoinShares report, this marked the largest weekly inflows of 2025 so far, pushing year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $2.7 billion. The spike in activity has pushed total assets under management (AuM) to an all-time high of $171 billion. The surge in inflows has not only impacted total assets under management but also global trading volumes. Global trading volumes for exchange-traded products (ETPs) also show there is a rise in interest, with $21 billion traded last week. This accounted for 34% of total Bitcoin trading volumes on trusted exchanges, showing an increase in market engagement. When it comes to regional demand, the U.S. dominated inflows, contributing $2 billion of the total. Switzerland and Canada followed with inflows of $89 million and $13 million, respectively, showing global demand for digital assets, reports CoinShares.

JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley printed $145.68 billion in combined profits last year, largely propelled by stellar performances in investment banking and dealmaking. JPMorgan Chase witnessed a net income of $58.5 billion in 2024, with $14 billion in Q4 alone, due to increased investment and consumer banking activity. Says JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, “The US economy has been resilient. Unemployment remains relatively low, and consumer spending stayed healthy, including during the holiday season. Businesses are more optimistic about the economy, and they are encouraged by expectations for a more pro-growth agenda and improved collaboration between government and business.” Bank of America generated a net income of $27.1 billion last year, driven by strong fee earnings. Wells Fargo had a net income of $19.7 billion in 2024 amid double-digit growth in both trading and investment banking. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs recorded $14.28 billion in net earnings last year as the firm ranked among the top across the globe in terms of completing mergers and acquisitions. Morgan Stanley reported $13.4 billion in net income in 2024 behind “strong results” across the firm’s business segments. As for Citi, the bank posted $12.7 billion in profits last year amid “record years” in the firm’s Services, Wealth and US Personal Banking divisions. Citing data from market analysis firm FactSet, the Financial Times reports that the combined profits posted by the six banks are a 20% increase from the earnings generated in 2023 and represent the second-highest on record in 17 years.

As a result, the emerging AI-powered project is witnessing a surge in new sign-ups after the President-backed memecoin failed to meet expectations. On the flip side, SOL is aiming for new price milestones with upcoming technological developments and $330 on the target. SOL Trading Patterns Signal Price Movement Soon As of January 24, the Solana price experienced a considerable price movement, reflecting a sudden uptick in market interest. SOL's price surged from $150 to $165 within a 15-minute window his morning and secured a 10% increase. This price movement followed a dramatic surge in trading volume, with a recorded volume of 5.2 million SOL traded during the same period. Concurrently, on-chain data showed a rise in active addresses, with a 20% increase from the previous day, reaching 120,000 active addresses. The SOL/BTC trading pair also saw a similar price surge, with SOL/BTC moving from 0.0035 to 0.0038 BTC. This event was likely influenced by a tweet from a prominent trading expert who highlighted past trends in SOL's performance. The implications of this price movement are notable for traders. The rapid increase in SOL's price suggests a potential short-term bullish trend, which could be capitalized on by traders looking for quick gains. The surge in trading volume, as reported by CoinGecko, indicates strong market interest and potential liquidity for those looking to enter or exit positions. President-Backed Memecoin ‘Trump Coin’ Fails To Keep Up President Trump’s memecoin Trump Coin may have kicked off with a lot of attention, but it is now coming down in value. This sentiment may remind investors why they stayed away in the first place. The crypto industry has high hopes for the new Trump administration. Irrespective of the inauguration-day launch strategy, the Trump Coin has disappointed many memecoin investors. According to Trump, he wants to make the U.S. the ‘crypto capital of the planet’ and promised a far lighter regulatory touch than under President Biden. Meanwhile, new investment opportunities such as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have helped renew interest, helping send Bitcoin’s price above $100,000 for the first time in November. Late Thursday, Bitcoin was at $104,800, just below its record high of $109,115. But crypto fans may have gotten more than they bargained for when Trump and his wife (Melania) launched a pair of memecoins last week. The tokens, $TRUMP and $MELANIA, quickly shot up in value soon after launch but failed to sustain short-term success as memecoin giants took over. Trump Coin Loses To IntelMarkets’ $7 Million Presale The failure of Trump Coin to maintain momentum just displayed the risks associated with investing in ‘hype-driven’ tokens. While the memecoin market may appeal to those looking for quick profits, it often lacks the core technology and long-term growth potential required for sustained success. On the other hand, IntelMarkets brings the opposite side of such speculative startups to the table. Its platform combines AI, blockchain, and DeFi to provide tools like autopilot trading robots, up to 1,000x leverage, and dual-chain architecture, which ensures traders benefit from data-driven strategies. Instead of chasing blowing trends, IntelMarkets assists traders looking to build wealth with crypto the ‘simple way.’ IntelMarkets Defies Market Trends With Growing Momentum!

IntelMarkets sets itself apart by providing a comprehensive suite of tools, including customizable AI agents, trading tools, and a proprietary AI blockchain.

Consequently, this new AI-powered initiative is attracting a wave of new registrations after the President-backed memecoin fell short of expectations.

SOL's Trading Patterns Hint at Imminent Price Shifts On January 24, Solana witnessed a significant price shift, indicating a renewed spike in market interest. This morning, SOL's price jumped from $150 to $165 in just 15 minutes, marking a 10% rise. This movement was accompanied by a notable surge in trading activity, with 5.2 million SOL changing hands during the same timeframe.

While both Solana and Avalanche have proven their potential in the crypto space with high scalability and robust ecosystems, Lightchain AI is taking the lead with its innovative integration of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI). This unique combination gives Lightchain AI a competitive edge, addressing the growing demand for decentralized, AI-powered solutions.

In this article, we’ll take a closer look at Lightchain AI and why it is poised for success in the current altcoin season. Altcoin Season Current Landscape The current altcoin season is witnessing a surge in interest, with several projects vying for dominance as the market prepares for explosive growth in 2025. Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), known for their scalability and fast transaction speeds, have made significant strides, but they face stiff competition from newer, innovative projects like Lightchain AI. Lightchain AI is capitalizing on the growing demand for decentralized AI-driven solutions, setting itself apart with its unique combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence. The project’s ability to deliver secure, scalable, and autonomous AI applications positions it to capture market share as industries seek advanced decentralized technologies.

Why Lightchain AI is Set to Outpace the Competition Lightchain AI is re͏ady to move ahead of its rivals in the fast-changing altcoin time because of its fresh mix of smart machines and blockchain tech. While Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) are known names famous for their quickness and growth, Lightchain AI offers something brand new—smart machine-driven shared answers. The plan is using the increasing need for smart blockchain tools, which gives it a big lead. Unlike other chains, Lightchain AI’s special mix of smart tech not only boosts how well it works but also opens up many possible uses, making it very appealing to backers.

How Lightchain AI Lead the Altcoin Season Lightchain AI is rapidly emerging as a leader in the current altcoin season, thanks to its innovative fusion of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike many other altcoins that focus solely on blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI brings AI-driven capabilities into the mix, offering a unique and scalable platform for decentralized applications. This combination of AI and blockchain positions Lightchain AI at the forefront of the next generation of cryptocurrencies. As industries increasingly turn to AI-powered solutions, Lightchain AI stands out by addressing key challenges in scalability, security, and automation. Additionally, its ecosystem provides robust infrastructure for AI tasks, enhancing its appeal to developers and investors alike.

This unprecedented figure highlights a growing wave of enthusiasm for Bitcoin, further fueled by the cryptocurrency maintaining its position above the $100,000 mark for an extended period. Bitcoin ETFs Inflows Reach New Heights According to SoSoValue data , the total net assets held by Bitcoin ETFs reached $123.1 billion as of the close of last week’s trading, marking the second-highest total to date. The surge in inflows coincides with President Donald Trump’s second-term inauguration, which has brought renewed optimism among pro-crypto advocates. The past trading week, shortened due to Martin Luther King Jr. Day, saw $1.76 billion in inflows, extending the streak to seven consecutive trading days. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF led the charge, capturing $1.32 billion of the week’s inflows, maintaining its position as the market leader. BlackRock’s Rule Change BlackRock’s dominance in the Bitcoin ETF market remains unmatched. The fund recently filed a rule change with Nasdaq to allow for in-kind redemptions and creations, which would enable investors to receive Bitcoin directly rather than cash. This shift, if approved, could attract even more institutional investors looking for greater flexibility in managing their holdings. Fidelity’s FBTC fund followed with $202.2 million in inflows last week, while the ARKB fund from Ark Invest and 21Shares secured $172.6 million, rounding out the top three contributors. The recent inflow streak has reversed an earlier outflow trend observed this month, suggesting growing investor confidence as Bitcoin ETFs become increasingly integrated into mainstream portfolios. Pro-Crypto Sentiments Drive Market Optimism The resurgence of interest in Bitcoin ETFs coincides with Trump’s return to the Oval Office. The president has voiced favorable opinions on cryptocurrency, and his ally Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency, is reportedly exploring blockchain adoption to reduce federal costs. These developments have reignited investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin and blockchain technology as a whole. As spot Bitcoin ETFs edge closer to the $40 billion inflow mark, they continue to play a pivotal role in legitimizing the cryptocurrency market. The combination of regulatory advancements and institutional demand may signal a new chapter for Bitcoin’s adoption and long-term prospects.

Some early adopters are now living different lives due to the token. The four coins that could potentially replicate such gains in 2025 are Rexas Finance (RXS), Avalanche (AVAX), Mantra (OM), and Polkadot (DOT). This is how these tokens can be valuable to you. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Presale Powerhouse Rexas Finance has managed to keep the buzz alive around itself in the world of cryptos. Within its presale period, RXS has garnered over $38.5 million and sold over 411 million tokens. It has become quite popular, with a current price of $0.175, simply due to its innovative approaches to decentralized finance (DeFi). RXS attracts retail and institutional investors by offering asset tokenization and staking opportunities. Rexas Finance further brands itself with additional offerings, including the no-code token creation tool within the Rexas Finance space, called Rexas Token Builder or the QuickMint Bot. This tool allows users to toggle between messaging apps like Telegram or Discord to create NFT tokens. The effectiveness of these tools illustrates the platform's objective of providing opportunities for users of all skill levels in decentralized finance. Rexas Finance continues to feature in more news, making it to the listings of CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and establishing itself as a strong investment practice. The predictions for RXS remain bullish. Analysts have predicted that its price could reach $3 during the next bull run because of its strong tokenomics and focus on building liquidity. This would give today's investors an ROI of over 1,500%. With an entry point at the low end, there is no bigger opportunity for exponential growth than RXS, similar to what XRP experienced in its early days. Avalanche (AVAX): Breaking Resistance Levels Avalanche dominates innovative contract platforms. It boasts incredible speed and scalability of the first order. AVAX is trading at $36.40, with a market cap of $14.95 billion. Analysts closely monitor the $44 resistance level because it could help it break even above $50. Furthermore, in addition to institutional interest, AVAX has bullish prospects. Its long-term asset status was confirmed after BlackRock included it in its crypto portfolio. If investors buy now and AVAX attains its target price of $150 in 2025, they may realize returns higher than 300%. With good technicals and fundamentals, AVAX is ready for big moves. Mantra (OM): Embracing the DAO and DeFi Another fascinating token is Mantra DAO. It is a unique proposition in the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) ecosystem. At $3.86, with a market cap of $3.70 billion, OM has its place—platforms like Mantra DAO support staking, lending, and borrowing as DeFi gets widely adopted. According to analysts’ predictions, OM could reach $20 by 2025 as it becomes more accepted and attracts liquidity providers. This would give investors a 400% return on their investments. This provides an attractive entry point for those wishing to gain exposure to the rapidly expanding DeFi sector through Mantra, with plans with significant upside potential. Polkadot (DOT): The Ruler of Interoperability Investors looking for long-term value still find Polkadot particularly appealing. DOT is priced at $6.63 and has a market cap of $10.19 billion, making it the leader in blockchain interoperability. Its capability for para-chain linking across numerous blockchains makes it an important participant in future Web3 developments. The ecosystem of Polkadot keeps expanding more projects utilizing its technology to scale while ensuring security; analysts believe that by 2025, the DOT may trade within the range of $50 to $70, which translates to potential returns of over 600%. Its increasing acceptance and strong framework make any diversified crypto portfolio necessary. Conclusion The crypto market is full of opportunities; however, not all tokens will provide the same potential for huge profits. Rexas Finance , Avalanche, Mantra, and Polkadot make the most substantial cases as leading candidates that can mimic what Ripple's early investors achieved in 2017. These coins could give you a life-changing amount of money by 2025 if you invest $555 combined. Diversification and thorough research will always be essential to maximize your crypto investments.

This scenario could offer investors today a return of over 1,500%. Entering at a lower price point, RXS represents a unique opportunity for exponential growth, akin to the early days of XRP. Avalanche (AVAX): Surpassing Barriers Avalanche stands out as a leader in the smart contract platform sector, praised for its speed and outstanding scalability. AVAX currently trades at $36.40, with a market capitalization of $14.95 billion. Analysts are watching the $44 resistance level closely, as breaking past this could propel it beyond $50. Institutional interest adds to its promising outlook, especially after BlackRock included AVAX in its crypto holdings. If investors buy now and AVAX reaches a target of $150 by 2025, they could see returns exceeding 300%. With solid technicals and fundamentals, AVAX is well-positioned for significant growth. Mantra (OM): Leading with DAO and DeFi Mantra DAO is making waves as an intriguing token in the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) space. Priced at $3.86 with a market cap of $3.70 billion, OM plays a key role in platforms supporting staking, lending, and borrowing as DeFi gains traction. Analysts predict that OM could reach $20 by 2025 as its acceptance grows and it attracts more liquidity providers. This potential would yield investors a 400% return, offering an enticing opportunity for those looking to engage with the expanding DeFi sector through Mantra, which holds significant growth potential. Polkadot (DOT): Champion of Connectivity For those seeking long-term investments, Polkadot remains highly attractive. DOT, currently priced at $6.63 with a market cap of $10.19 billion, leads in blockchain interoperability. Its ability to connect various blockchains through para-chains positions it as a key player in the evolving Web3 landscape. Polkadot's ecosystem continues to grow, with more projects leveraging its technology for scalable and secure solutions. Analysts project that by 2025, DOT could trade between $50 and $70, promising returns of over 600%. Its rising acceptance and robust framework make Polkadot an essential component of any diversified crypto portfolio. Final Thoughts The crypto market is brimming with opportunities, but not all tokens will deliver substantial returns. Rexas Finance , Avalanche, Mantra, and Polkadot stand out as strong contenders that could replicate the success of Ripple's early investors in 2017. By investing a total of $555 in these coins, you could potentially achieve life-changing profits by 2025.

On July 27, 2024, Donald Trump stepped in front of a crowd in Nashville and told them exactly what they wanted to hear. At the Bitcoin 2024 Conference, he promised that, if elected, he would make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and fire SEC chair Gary Gensler immediately. You might also like: US voters gave a ‘pro-crypto’ mandate—what happens now? | Opinion That appearance, along with other pro-crypto moves, rallied a voting bloc that was bigger than some gave it credit for. The Kamala Harris campaign would try to cater to them later with a watered-down message and little success. Trump was, without a shadow of a doubt, the ‘crypto candidate.’ So when he failed to make a single mention of blockchain or crypto in Monday’s inauguration speech, there was some understandable unease. I, too, was looking forward to hearing more details about his plans for blockchain technology. But what I keep coming back to is something else he said to the crowd in Nashville last year: “ We will have regulations, but from now on, the rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry. ” No matter what he said (or didn’t say) during the inauguration, that promise is already proving true. His appointments, nominations, and actions all suggest that common sense regulation is on its way. His ‘golden age’ for America can include—no, be powered by—blockchain technology. The people who love our industry Not everyone involved with crypto gets the chance to negotiate with policymakers. I’ve been lucky enough to be in the room for some of these conversations over the years, and let me tell you—discussion was impossible with the previous administration. It was essentially stonewalling at every turn, painting even innovative solutions with the same brush as scams. Industry leaders were extremely frustrated and either took their operations elsewhere or at least stopped raising their hands to ask questions. It just wasn’t going to happen, even though some party members were pushing internally for a change. So, the industry waited. It waited and watched support for Trump steadily increase among the crypto community, if only because he promised not to stand in the way. When he won re-election, they cheered (quietly, in some cases) because it meant they could chase their ambition once again. They could build the things they dreamed of. In the months since, the incoming administration fortified that faith and support. Just a few weeks after the election, Trump nominated Howard Lutnick, a massive proponent of stablecoins and head of the brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, as commerce secretary. Paul Atkins, a crypto advocate and CEO of Patomak Partners, was picked as Gensler’s replacement at the SEC . In early December, it was David Sacks’ turn, joining the White House as Trump’s ‘AI and crypto czar.’ The former PayPal executive has been publicly pushing for a ‘new world currency’ for decades and believes wholeheartedly in web3 technology. These are the people who love our industry. They’re the people who will not stand in the way of innovation or create rules that box us in. Not all that glitters is gold That innovation—not just investment—will determine whether Trump’s golden age of America comes true. The solutions we have now are limited and still need improvement if they’re to see widespread enterprise adoption. Take stablecoins, for instance. While they are, in theory, the perfect answer for cross-border transactions, treasury management, and trade finance, institutions still hesitate to integrate them. Part of the problem is their inherent anonymity and what that means for regulatory bodies. The chains they exist on were purpose-built to go against a centralized bank, and any contracts you build on top are only band-aids. There needs to be a protocol-level identification layer, like the one found on Concordium, to provide the accountability and compliance necessary to meet regulatory requirements and user trust. With that in place, USD-backed stablecoins built on a transparent, reliable chain would strengthen the dominance of the US dollar even further and remove any need for a CBDC. Trump’s pro-crypto nominee for Treasury Secretary , Scott Bessent, said as much at his recent Senate confirmation hearing. Bessent explained that CBDCs are, in his opinion, reserved for developing nations and dismissed any notion of the US introducing one. A 2025 approach Like many of his peers in the Trump administration, Bessent is focused on innovative policies for innovative technologies. When asked about the darker history of crypto, he simply explained that the US needs “a 2025 approach.” Hear, hear, says the crypto industry. We’ve been trapped in a loop of 20th-century policies for too long. Change is coming, one way or another, and the US appears poised to take the lead. If they stay out of their own way, Trump’s ‘golden age’ will extend to crypto, blockchain, and the web3 revolution.

With its innovative GambleFi platform and impressive public presale, Rollblock is positioning itself as a potential altcoin powerhouse capable of delivering outsized returns to early investors. But what are the factors contributing to this bullish outlook? Find the details below! Is There a Bigger Breakout Ahead for BTC? On January 24, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to upgrade the United States’ role as a crypto champion. The announcement thrilled BTC investors, as BTC jumped 3% and touched the much-anticipated $105,000 mark. While this new BTC price mark is impressive, it isn’t exactly remarkable. This is because BTC has been trading around the $100,000 and $105,000 price range for the past week. Nevertheless, there might be a turnaround for BTC soon with Donald Trump’s newly signed executive order. Can XRP Break $4 After Recent Surge? XRP’s recent price trend reinforces its position as one of the leading altcoin projects in DeFi. Over the past month, XRP has surged by an impressive 38%, outperforming many other crypto tokens. However, XRP analysts believe that XRP requires even more growth before it can leave its consolidation price range of $2-$3. If XRP can manage to cross the $4 resistance level, then it could be set for even greater gains. ETH Might Leaves Stagnant Zone Soon ETH saw one of the most impressive price runs a month ago. However, ETH has been stuck in a consolidation state since then, hovering around $3,300. Despite this stagnancy, some experts are optimistic about ETH’s growth. One of the optimists is X user CRYPTOWZRD . CRYPTOWZRD believes that a breakout above the $3,550 resistance level could drive ETH to $4,000 and beyond. Another analyst called Cold Blooded Shiller also sees potential. According to Shiller, ETH could spike to a new all-time high of $5,000 by March this year. Make The Most Out of Your Gambling Journey With Rollblock Although the traditional gambling sector is a colossal multi-billion-dollar sector, it has suffered from a lot of scams and fraud. Casino owners manipulate game odds and cheat players out of their winnings. Rollblock aims to address this by using blockchain technology. It offers over 150 games from various iGaming providers, all secured on-chain. To remove the risk of tampering, each game result is encrypted and stored on Ethereum. These transaction, powered by RBLK token, are protected by SolidProof’s audited smart contracts. Despite it being a new crypto, analysts believe Rollblock could drive the next crypto bull run. This potential stems from the token supporting Rollblock’s revenue-sharing model. In this model, 60% of the tokens earned are burned, and 40% are given as staking rewards. This approach not only helps the platform grow but also rewards its users. Conclusion Tired of waiting on BTC, XRP, and ETH to leave their stagnant phase? Join Rollblock as it is stealing the spotlight with its RBLK token. In fact, analysts are starting to call it the next big altcoin in the DeFi market. At just $0.047 in presale, this is your chance to grab a future powerhouse before it explodes. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Within 180 days, the group is expected to provide recommendations to the president regarding regulatory and legislative changes concerning the issuance and circulation of digital assets, including stablecoins, in the United States. The group will also assess the potential for creating and maintaining a national digital asset stockpile. One of its tasks is to propose criteria for forming this reserve from cryptocurrencies seized by the government. The order prohibits the issuance and promotion of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the U.S., mandating that government agencies cease all related programs and initiatives. In an interview with FOX Business, Sacks emphasized that the group's goal is to encourage innovation in cryptocurrency rather than push the industry overseas. He noted that clarity in regulation is essential for the sector, which has been lacking under Joe Biden's administration. Regarding the national crypto reserve, Sacks clarified that no decision has yet been made on its creation. “Yes, we are going to evaluate it. We haven't decided to do it yet. We need to study that,” she said. The order disappointed Bitcoin maximalists Some supporters of the first cryptocurrency were disappointed that it is not mentioned directly at all in the document. Commentators recalled Trump's promise to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve; however, the term ”digital assets” used in the order suggests the possibility of including altcoins in the fund. Investor ”Bitcoin Dad” stated that ”the strategic ”digital asset” stockpile should ONLY include Bitcoin.” Vice President of Riot Platforms Pierre Rochard also believes that Trump clearly articulated his goals in his campaign speeches: Prohibit CBDCs; Create a reserve in the first cryptocurrency. Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Action Fund, defended the terminology used in the order as a pragmatic decision that is ”technologically neutral” and reduces political friction. His organization promotes Bitcoin in U.S. political and business circles using a similar approach. According to Arkham Intelligence, the U.S. government holds confiscated cryptocurrencies worth approximately $21.2 billion, with a dominant share consisting of 198,109 BTC valued at $20.76 billion. Mark Yusko, CEO of Morgan Creek, suggested that other assets like XRP, ADA, and HBAR could also be included in the national reserve alongside Bitcoin.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|ADA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-26 13:58:57

Now priced at $0.005625 each, Lightchain AI has secured $12.9 million, showcasing significant backer trust. Unlike trend-focused coins, Lightchain AI’s defined strategy and practical applications distinguish it as a reliable and innovative option for discerning buyers. The Shortcomings of Meme Coins: All Hype, No Substance Meme coins have taken the cryptocurrency world by storm, capturing investor attention with their playful imagery and catchy names. However, after the initial excitement fades, many meme coins lack practical applications and enduring value. Their value is largely driven by social media trends and speculative buying, making them vulnerable to sudden price drops.

LINKing Reality: How Chainlink Connects Blockchain to the Real World Chainlink is revolutionizing the space by linking blockchain technology with the real world. It enables smart contracts to securely access external data, APIs, and systems. This allows smart contracts to respond to real-world events beyond blockchain transactions. Chainlink achieves this through a decentralized network of oracles, which fetch data, verify its accuracy with a reputation system, and deliver it to the blockchain. This three-step process ensures the reliability of data used by smart contracts. By bridging the gap between blockchains and external data, Chainlink enhances the capabilities of smart contracts. In today's market, Chainlink's LINK token appears promising. It's crucial to the Chainlink ecosystem, rewarding node operators and data providers. Users can stake LINK to help secure the network and pay for data services. As more applications require precise real-world data, the demand for Chainlink's services may increase. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, LINK has a well-defined use case that addresses a critical need in the blockchain industry. With the rise of decentralized finance and smart contracts, Chainlink’s importance grows, making LINK an appealing option to explore. Jupiter (JUP): Enhancing DeFi Swaps on Solana Jupiter is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator within the Solana ecosystem. It aggregates various liquidity pools to provide users with the best prices for token swaps, enhancing transaction efficiency. In decentralized finance (DeFi), price disparities across different DEXs can prevent users from getting the best exchange rates. Jupiter addresses this issue by pooling resources from multiple liquidity sources on Solana, ensuring users access the most advantageous prices. It has also ventured into areas like perpetual futures, decentralized stablecoin management, and launched the LFG launchpad to support new Solana projects. Looking ahead, Jupiter plans to roll out its native token, JUP, which will be used for network governance. Users will have the opportunity to vote on key issues like liquidity strategies, token issuance, and other ecosystem projects by staking their JUP tokens and earning rewards. In the current market cycle, a token like JUP seems appealing as it not only fuels a crucial DeFi tool but also provides governance engagement and potential returns. As the DeFi sector expands and users seek platforms offering better rates and more participation, Jupiter and its forthcoming JUP token could stand out among other coins. Market trends favor aggregators that boost efficiency and empower users, making Jupiter an enticing choice for those interested in the Solana ecosystem. Conclusion LINK, JUP, and XYZVerse (XYZ) present promising investment opportunities, with XYZVerse's unique sports memecoin set for substantial growth in the 2025 bull run.

Currently valued at $3.14 on Coinmarketcap, XRP's price is projected to increase five times as regulatory approvals increase and businesses start using it more. Meanwhile, Yeti Ouro's Play-to-Earn gaming ecosystem is in its presale phase, having sold over 133 million tokens, with experts predicting a tenfold price surge. XRP Set to Rise Amid Favorable Progress In 2025, Ripple's native cryptocurrency, XRP, maintains a positive outlook, buoyed by the current market dynamics. As of the end of January 23, XRP was priced at $3.10, reflecting a 6% increase in the past 24 hours and a 19.6% rise over the week. This impressive performance translates to a 459% annual growth, suggesting the asset is well-positioned for further gains amid the ongoing bull market. Enthusiasts point to the Trump administration's supportive stance on cryptocurrencies, with policies aimed at easing regulations and promoting blockchain technology, as a catalyst for XRP's upward momentum. A partial legal win for Ripple against the SEC, which concluded that XRP isn't a security when sold to individual investors, has also contributed to the cryptocurrency's stability. Analysts foresee a forthcoming ruling, and a favorable decision could spark a rally. Source X With more institutions adopting Ripple's payment solutions like RippleNet and a growing interest in XRP ETFs, the outlook for the cryptocurrency appears promising. It's projected that XRP's price might rise to $4.40 in the short term and could even reach $15 if regulatory clarity and increased adoption persist. Yeti Ouro's Potential for 10x Growth Shines Bright Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is a cryptocurrency that merges blockchain principles with entertainment and finance. Drawing thousands of investors during its presale, it has already sold over 133 million tokens. Priced at $0.017 in its second presale stage, Yeti Ouro emphasizes user representation through decentralized governance and the Play-to-Earn model. The buzz around Yeti Ouro's presale has been significant, with predictions of a tenfold price increase post-launch, positioning YETIO as an attractive investment for 2025. Its audit by SolidProof , a trusted security firm, enhances its transparency and security appeal. The project's first game, Yeti Go, is an action-packed racing game developed using Unreal Engine 5. Created in collaboration with industry veterans who have worked on titles like Spiderman, The Witcher, Dead Space, and Call of Duty, Yeti Go offers fast-paced gameplay where players can earn rewards by competing in diverse and thrilling environments. The Yeti Ouro team has shared previews of the Yeti Go game level 1 map. Beyond gaming, Yeti Ouro plans to incorporate staking, yield farming, and global community interaction. Seen as one of the most promising players in the blockchain gaming sector, YETIO is poised for growth in the coming months. Yeti Ouro's appeal as an investment is further heightened by its upcoming launch in Q2. Experts suggest a potential 10x price jump, supported by investor trust from its security audits and a strong community backing. If Yeti Ouro continues to follow its roadmap, it could potentially outpace XRP by 2025.

DOGE has carved out a place as a fun digital asset and a useful medium of trade with a devoted and energetic community.

Nonetheless, not everyone was able to take advantage of these brief trends, prompting many to seek out more reliable and hopeful investment opportunities. Enter Lightchain AI , a blockchain platform that merges artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. With a presale price of $0.005625 and over $12.7 million in funds raised, Lightchain AI is swiftly emerging as the favored option for investors looking for long-term growth, steering clear of the speculative craze surrounding meme coins. The Ups and Downs of Meme Coin Mania Meme coins, driven by internet-inspired themes, have faced considerable market fluctuations. Initially, tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu soared in popularity thanks to social media buzz and celebrity backing, leading to massive market valuations. However, many of these coins lacked real value or practical use, rendering them vulnerable to steep declines once the initial excitement faded. Recently, the introduction of $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens by former President Donald Trump and his wife drew both investor interest and critique. These tokens experienced a swift value surge but were scrutinized for potential conflicts of interest and ethical issues. The rapid ascent and descent of such meme coins highlight the market's speculative nature, emphasizing the need for investors to conduct thorough research and exercise caution. Reasons Behind Lightchain AI's Rising Popularity In contrast to meme coins, Lightchain AI is founded on practical applications and cutting-edge technology. One of its standout features is its Presale Tokenomics , which allocates 40% of its total supply to early supporters. This strategy rewards early investors and establishes a clear trajectory for ecosystem expansion. Another key aspect is its focus on AI-Powered Decentralized Solutions, which allow businesses to integrate blockchain technology without disrupting their current processes. These distinctive qualities make Lightchain AI a notable contender in a market crowded with speculative assets, offering real advantages to both businesses and developers. Investors Leaning Towards Long-Term Value For numerous investors, Lightchain AI signifies a transition from speculative trading to strategic, utility-focused investments. Its presale triumph, along with milestones like a testnet launch scheduled for January 2025 and a mainnet rollout in March, promises steady growth and adoption. Furthermore, its dedication to addressing issues related to data security, scalability, and AI adoption positions it as a leader in the forthcoming phase of blockchain evolution. The token’s robust fundamentals have caught the attention of seasoned investors. Burned by the meme coin bubble, they are now gravitating towards Lightchain AI for its potential to provide both short-term gains and long-term stability. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) , an innovative Bitcoin Layer-2 solution, is drawing the attention of large investors with its pioneering technology. Pepe Coin: Whale Activity Sparks Optimism Recently, there has been a noticeable surge in whale activity for Pepe Coin, with billions of tokens being exchanged. Some experts think that the memecoin could rebound if it surpasses the critical resistance level of 0.000015, which could counteract the low Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the decrease in active addresses. The enthusiasm from major investors highlights PEPE's short-term potential. XRP: Aiming for New Peaks With increasing accumulation by whales, XRP's price is moving upward, currently standing at $2.57. New traders are identifying patterns like the megaphone bottom, anticipating further gains and aiming for the $5 mark. Ripple's ongoing lawsuit with the SEC and recent global financial developments are pushing XRP to aim for breaking past its previous ATH. Solana: Thriving Ecosystem Drives Growth Solana stands at the forefront of blockchain innovation, thanks to its remarkable decentralized exchange (DEX) engagement, which makes up 45% of the market. By offering fresh decentralized applications on the blockchain, Solana continues to attract users. Based on analysts’ insights, hitting its peak of $295 is quite achievable, although maintaining stable network activity is essential. Dogecoin: ETF Rumors Boost Market Sentiment Excitement over token ETFs has pushed Dogecoin's price to about $0.38. With Elon Musk's unwavering support, the original meme coin is experiencing renewed enthusiasm. Despite some sell-offs, Dogecoin might aim for $0.40 and beyond, driven by community and corporate interest. PlutoChain: Transforming Bitcoin with a Hybrid Layer-2 Solution PlutoChain is poised to revolutionize Bitcoin through its hybrid Layer-2 blockchain, which allows for smart contracts and dApp integration. Developers can engage with both Bitcoin and Ethereum-based DeFi and NFT ecosystems via the Ethereum Virtual Machine, opening up new opportunities. PlutoChain's impressive speed and flexibility are demonstrated by over 43,200 transactions daily and 2-second block confirmation times on the testnet . Security is a top priority for the project, having passed triple audits by well-known firms SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi. PlutoChain has the potential to unlock the DeFi sector within Bitcoin, paving the way for advancements beyond Bitcoin's current limitations. This isn't just another project; it's a meticulously designed plan to bring real utility and elevate Bitcoin's capabilities. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as Pepe Coin, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin show strong potential to reclaim their ATHs, driven by whale activity, technical patterns, and ecosystem expansion. Meanwhile, PlutoChain could redefine Bitcoin's capabilities with its hybrid Layer-2 blockchain, offering smart contracts and dApps while ensuring top-notch security. These promising developments could generate significant interest following its mainnet launch. —---------------------------- This article is not financial advice.

Three intriguing options under $1 — Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Ozak AI (OZ) — are starting to gain significant interest due to their unique appeal and potential to surge in 2025. These accessible yet influential cryptocurrencies each offer something different: PEPE remains a trending memecoin, DOGE is a well-loved meme staple, and OZ, driven by AI advancements, is emerging as a promising player for the future. Could these dark horses be the catalysts for the next major market rally? Let’s take a closer look. Pepe (PEPE): A Rising Star In the past year, PEPE has surged impressively, boasting gains exceeding 1,242% and capturing the crypto community's interest. The coin has managed to achieve some stability, demonstrating a positive trajectory and reaching a market capitalization of $7.5 billion. Although the trading volume hasn't reached extremely high levels, it remains consistent, suggesting ongoing support for the project. The price chart reveals significant breakdowns, notably around mid-2024, due to market fluctuations and meme influences. Given its social backing and potential for growth, PEPE stands out as one of the most promising projects under $1. By 2025, this momentum could propel PEPE to new peaks, making it a project to watch. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme with Staying Power Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a remarkable 297% price increase, climbing past $0.40 by the close of 2024, fueled by rising user interest and adoption. DOGE has consistently trended upward, supported by a robust ecosystem and celebrity endorsements. With its expanding utility and strong following, Dogecoin might witness another growth wave in 2025, capturing the attention of investors.

You’re not alone. Many sat on the sidelines, watching in disbelief as SHIB skyrocketed from its meme coin origins to a crypto powerhouse. But here’s the thing—history doesn’t have to repeat itself for you, at least not in a bad way. Say hi to the BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the latest meme coin darling that’s not just riding the meme wave but carving out an entirely new path with cutting-edge features like Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming, staking rewards, and a tightly-knit community vibe. The BTFD presale is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. With over $5.6 million raised, 67 billion coins sold, and a growing base of over 9,500 bullish holders, this is your chance to snag a piece of the pie at just $0.00016 before its listing price of $0.0006. The best part? BTFD doesn’t just promise potential—it delivers it. So, let’s dive into why this could be the best new meme coin to join for long term gains. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution You’ve Been Waiting For First things first—what is BTFD Coin? Inspired by the iconic “ Buy The Dip ” mindset, BTFD is more than just a token; it’s a rallying cry for every trader who knows the value of buying low and riding the highs. But what makes it a true game-changer is its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and the powerful Bulls Squad community. The Play-to-Earn Game: Making Crypto Fun and Profitable Launching on January 1, 2025, the BTFD P2E game lets users immerse themselves in an interactive crypto-gaming world. Players navigate through challenges, earn coins, and level up in a way that’s as rewarding as it is fun. Imagine this: you’re smashing through levels, racking up rewards, and converting in-game coins into BTFD tokens you can stake or cash out. Not bad for a “game,” huh? With features like multiple levels, power-ups, and a social aspect that encourages inviting friends, this isn’t just a side hustle—it’s the main event. For those looking for an edge in the crypto game, the P2E platform offers real earning potential wrapped in a user-friendly package. Staking and Massive APY Rewards Why stop earning in-game? With a staking APY of a whopping 90%, BTFD rewards long-term holders. Imagine staking $5,000 worth of BTFD tokens at the current presale price of $0.00016. When the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, your initial investment would skyrocket to $18,750. Couple that with compounding rewards from staking, and you’re looking at gains that go beyond your wildest expectations with the best new meme coin to join for long term potential. Community Power: The Bulls Squad At the heart of BTFD lies its community—lovingly called the Bulls Squad. Whether it’s the visionary Baby Bull or the tech-savvy Nerdy Bull, every part of this ecosystem is designed to build strength and unity. Together, the Bulls Squad ensures that no one gets left behind in the market’s ebb and flow. Presale Hype and Referral Rewards The 14th presale stage is live, and trust us—it’s hot! With $5.5 million raised, the FOMO is real. Not to mention the BTFD referral program. Share your unique referral code, and both you and your friends get rewarded. Users buying $50+ with your code score an extra 10% in BTFD tokens , while you pocket 10% of their purchase amount. The top 20 referrers even snag leaderboard prizes. It’s a win-win for anyone looking to amplify their crypto game. Shiba Inu: The Meme Coin That Made Millionaires Let’s rewind to Shiba Inu’s story—a meme coin that turned skeptics into millionaires. Launched in August 2020, SHIB had humble beginnings, trading at fractions of a cent. Fast forward to October 2021, and SHIB reached its all-time high of $0.00008845, a staggering rise that gave early investors returns beyond their dreams. To put it into perspective, a $1 investment in SHIB in its infancy could’ve netted you over $10,000. Why People Missed Out Back in 2020, SHIB seemed like just another meme coin riding the coattails of Dogecoin. Most people dismissed it as a joke, failing to recognize the power of its community-driven growth and real-world utility. But those who saw the potential were laughing their way to the bank when SHIB gained mainstream attention, celebrity endorsements, and multiple exchange listings, including Binance. SHIB Today: Still a Titan As of January 2025, Shiba Inu is still a force to be reckoned with. With its thriving ecosystem featuring ShibaSwap, the Shibarium Layer 2 network, and token burns to increase scarcity, SHIB has matured beyond its meme roots. Its metaverse expansion is drawing younger audiences, and even with its price hovering at $0.00001, SHIB continues to evolve. But let’s face it—those once-in-a-lifetime gains? They’re likely behind us for SHIB. This is why BTFD Coin offers a new chance to ride the wave before it crests. Why BTFD Coin Is 2025’s Best New Meme Coin for Long-Term Investors Looking to Win Big BTFD isn’t just following in SHIB’s footsteps—it’s paving its own path. With a presale price of $0.00016, early investors stand to gain a 275% ROI once it hits its listing price of $0.0006. And let’s not forget the additional earnings from its P2E game and staking rewards. This isn’t just a token; it’s an ecosystem designed for long-term growth. If you missed out on SHIB’s rise, don’t let the same happen with BTFD. The presale is your chance to secure a seat before the rocket takes off. With features that cater to gamers, traders, and meme lovers alike, BTFD is shaping up to be the best new meme coin to join for long term potential in 2025 . Final Thoughts: Act Now or Regret Later Crypto is a game of timing and conviction, and BTFD Coin gives you both in spades. Its presale is already making waves, with millions raised and tens of thousands of coins flying off the shelves. Combine that with its innovative P2E game, staking rewards, and community-driven ethos, and you’ve got a recipe for success. So, what’s it gonna be? Sit on the sidelines as you did with SHIB, or jump into the action with BTFD Coin, the best new meme coin to join for long term potential.

In a new interview with Fox Business, US Crypto Czar David Sacks says that Trump’s executive order seeking clear crypto guidelines will help the nation catch up to other countries, such as Singapore, that embraced digital assets earlier. “We’re going to catch up really fast. The innovation was starting to move offshore, there are places in Singapore and even some places in Europe that were ahead of us, but now I think it’s going to change very fast. If you look at Silicon Valley and the technology industry in general, the US leads in virtually every category, with crypto being one of the few exceptions and I think that’s going to be very quickly rectified because of President Trump’s executive order.” Sacks names three key areas of the industry that he says the government will look at to help build a clearer regulatory environment. “Number one – market structure. We need to define what is a security, what is a commodity, what is a digital asset or collectible. There are a few different categories here, so defining the market structure is important. Second area is stablecoins. I think stablecoins are a really interesting area. [They] give us the opportunity to extend the dollar’s dominance internationally, we can basically create a digital dollar that people all over the world will use. And then the third area we’re going to look at us we’re evaluating this national stockpile for digital assets. We haven’t created it yet but we’re going to study that issue.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. The TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins turned $100 into $10k before crashing, sparking interest in FX Guys as a 100x token. The TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins shocked everyone with their incredible rise and dramatic fall, turning $100 into $10,000 before their crash. This rollercoaster has left traders eager to find the next crypto to 100x. Here comes FX Guys (FXG) , a PropFi token that combines real-world utility with innovative features. As meme coins lose momentum, FX Guys emerges as a promising contender, offering stability, transparency, and long-term growth potential. Could it really be the 100x token in crypto trading? Let’s find out! You might also like: FX Guys presale gains attention over Toncoin and The Sandbox TRUMP’s dramatic price swings: What’s the next crypto to 100x? The OFFICIAL TRUMP meme coin grabbed the spotlight in crypto trading with an explosive debut. Starting at a modest $7, TRUMP surged to $75 within 48 hours, offering remarkable returns for early supporters. Although the TRUMP meme coin saw a sharp dip to $31, it rebounded to $47 on January 22, 2025, after Coinbase announced its listing. This development reignited interest in the coin, as many consider it the next crypto to 100x. However, TRUMP’s dramatic price swings have raised questions about its long-term potential in the highly volatile crypto trading market. Meme coins like TRUMP often attract attention for their humor, but their market movements are no joke. TRUMP’s rapid ascent has inspired discussions about finding the next crypto to 100x. While some traders remain cautious, others see an opportunity to ride the wave. As the buzz continues, the spotlight is also on the MELANIA meme coin and FXGuys. MELANIA’s Meteoric Rise and fall: What’s next in crypto trading? The MELANIA meme coin recently turned heads in the crypto trading world with its dramatic price movements. Launched by First Lady Melania Trump, the meme coin’s price surged from $6 to $13 shortly after debuting. The token’s market cap hit $2.2 billion just before the inauguration, signaling massive investor interest. However, optimism quickly faded after Donald Trump’s speech failed to address cryptocurrencies or blockchain. Disappointed traders began selling, causing MELANIA’s market cap to plummet to $847 million, with the price dropping to $4. The unexpected silence on crypto dampened market excitement, highlighting how speculation drives meme coin volatility. Despite the setback, some analysts believe Trump’s future policies could revive interest in digital assets. This has investors seeking the next crypto to 100x. As the search intensifies, all eyes are turning to FX Guys, the PropFi token gaining traction as a more stable and promising alternative in the volatile crypto trading market. Move over meme coins: FX Guys brings real utility to crypto investing FX Guys is redefining crypto trading with a platform built to empower traders. Designed as a decentralized trading ecosystem, FX Guys eliminates intermediaries, offering fair and transparent access to commodities and crypto markets. With this innovative structure, the PropFi token is emerging as the next crypto to 100x. One of the appealing features of the FX Guys platform is its Trade2Earn program, where traders earn FXG tokens with every transaction. This feature drives crypto trading activity, contributing to a rise in platform liquidity. For passive income, FX Guys’ staking rewards program offers up to a 20% APY. This aligns with the platform’s mission to benefit long-term holders. Another standout feature of the FX Guys platform is its no buy-or-sell tax policy. Paired with same-day deposits and withdrawals in fiat or crypto, the platform ensures stress-free user experiences. Adding to FX Guys’ appeal is its utility token, FXG, which ensures price stability through its self-sustaining ecosystem.

SHIB, PEPE, and This Altcoin Are Gaining Ground",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/will-dogecoin-doge-finally-be-overtaken-shib-pepe-and-this-altcoin-are-gaining-ground,"Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, has maintained its dominance in the crypto world for years, thanks to its strong community and endorsements from influential figures like Elon Musk. However, competitors such as Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and the emerging altcoin Lightchain AI are rapidly gaining ground. These challengers offer innovation, community-driven growth, and in some cases, tangible utility—leading many to wonder if Dogecoin’s reign is coming to an end. Let’s explore how these three contenders are positioning themselves to potentially overtake DOGE. Shiba Inu (SHIB) vs. Pepe (PEPE) - Meme Coin Giants Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) are popular meme-based cryptocurrencies with distinct features. Launched in 2020, SHIB operates on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and has built an ecosystem that includes ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and Shibarium, a Layer-2 network that has processed over 600 million transactions since 2023. These enhancements boost SHIB's utility and scalability. PEPE, launched in 2023 and inspired by the ""Pepe the Frog"" meme, features deflationary tokenomics and a no-tax policy. While PEPE has seen major price surges, it lacks significant real-world uses. As of January 7, 2025, SHIB trades at $0.00002381, and PEPE at $0.00002034. Analysts suggest SHIB's ecosystem may offer more sustainable growth compared to PEPE's meme-driven appeal. Lightchain AI - Utility-Driven Challenger Unlike meme tokens like SHIB and PEPE, Lightchain AI is all about purpose and innovation. It merges blockchain and artificial intelligence to solve real-world issues like data privacy, scalability, and efficiency—bringing real utility to the crypto space. With cutting-edge architecture, Lightchain AI creates a unified, decentralized platform built to handle the unique demands of AI workloads. It prioritizes scalability, security, and privacy, paving the way for collaboration and breakthroughs in the decentralized AI ecosystem. Its tokenomics are just as smart, with a 10 billion supply strategically allocated - 40% for presale, 28.5% for staking rewards, 15% for liquidity, 5% for marketing, 6.5% for the treasury, and 5% for the team. By tackling critical challenges and seamlessly blending AI with blockchain, Lightchain AI isn’t just another token—it’s shaping the future of decentralized intelligence with real-world impact. Will Dogecoin Be Overtaken? Dogecoin, as the original meme coin, enjoys a loyal fan base but lacks innovation, leaving it open to competition from projects offering more value. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and PEPE are rising stars in the meme coin trend, while Lightchain AI sets itself apart by bringing utility and innovation to the crypto space. For investors, the choice depends on their goals. Those seeking short-term gains might find PEPE appealing due to its high-risk, high-reward potential. For a balanced growth strategy, SHIB’s expanding ecosystem makes it a strong option. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI stands out as a long-term investment opportunity, focusing on delivering real-world utility and positioning itself as a leader in the future of cryptocurrency. So bright your future with Lightchain AI . https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

SHIB, PEPE, and an Emerging Altcoin Are Gaining Traction",https://bitzo.com/2025/01/could-dogecoin-doge-lose-its-top-spot-shib-pepe-and-an-emerging-altcoin-are-gaining-traction,"Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, has maintained its dominance in the crypto world for years, thanks to its strong community and endorsements from influential figures like Elon Musk. Yet, rivals like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and the promising newcomer Lightchain AI are quickly making strides. These contenders bring innovation, community-focused growth, and sometimes real-world utility, prompting speculation about whether Dogecoin’s leadership might be challenged. Let's delve into how these three are positioning themselves to potentially surpass DOGE. Shiba Inu (SHIB) vs. Pepe (PEPE) - Battle of the Meme Coins Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) are popular cryptocurrencies rooted in memes, each with unique characteristics. Introduced in 2020, SHIB is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, and it has developed an ecosystem featuring ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and Shibarium, a Layer-2 network that has already processed more than 600 million transactions since 2023. These advancements enhance SHIB's usability and scalability. Launched in 2023, PEPE draws inspiration from the ""Pepe the Frog"" meme and is known for its deflationary tokenomics and no-tax policy. Although PEPE has experienced significant price increases, it is yet to establish substantial real-world applications. As of January 7, 2025, SHIB is priced at $0.00002381, while PEPE stands at $0.00002034. Analysts predict that SHIB's ecosystem could support more stable growth compared to the meme-centric appeal of PEPE. Lightchain AI - The Practical Contender In contrast to meme coins like SHIB and PEPE, Lightchain AI focuses on functionality and innovation. It combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to tackle real-world challenges such as data privacy, scalability, and efficiency, providing genuine utility to the crypto market. With its advanced architecture, Lightchain AI forms a cohesive, decentralized platform designed to accommodate the specific demands of AI workloads. It emphasizes scalability, security, and privacy, paving the way for collaboration and advancements in the decentralized AI sector. Its tokenomics are thoughtfully planned, with a 10 billion token supply distributed strategically - 40% for presale, 28.5% for staking rewards, 15% for liquidity, 5% for marketing, 6.5% for the treasury, and 5% for the team. By addressing key challenges and seamlessly integrating AI with blockchain, Lightchain AI is more than just another token—it is pioneering the future of decentralized intelligence with significant real-world impact. Could Dogecoin Be Surpassed? As the founding meme coin, Dogecoin has a devoted following, but its lack of innovation makes it vulnerable to projects that provide greater value. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and PEPE are gaining popularity in the meme coin sector, Lightchain AI distinguishes itself by offering utility and innovation in the cryptocurrency arena. Investors face a choice based on their objectives. Those in search of short-term profits might be drawn to PEPE for its high-risk, high-reward nature. For a more balanced growth approach, SHIB’s expanding ecosystem presents a compelling option. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI emerges as a promising long-term investment, with a focus on delivering practical utility and establishing itself as a leader in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Members of the crypto dev community showed their support. My name is Roman Storm, and I am one of the founders of Tornado Cash, a non-custodial privacy protocol. I am being prosecuted for writing open-source code that enables private crypto transactions in a completely non-custodial manner. This prosecution represents a terrifying… — Roman Storm 🇺🇸 🌪️ (@rstormsf) January 22, 2025 Over the years, Tornado Cash has whipped up a storm of legal trouble. This decentralized privacy tool, which allows users to keep their crypto transactions hush-hush, turned into a destination for bad actors to launder ill-gotten gains, the U.S. Treasury alleged. But Tornado Cash isn’t the only privacy-focused crypto project targeted by the U.S. government. Read on for a deeper look at the various legal battles involving such projects as Monero and other privacy-focused coins. Table of Contents Storm’s speech and public reaction Why do many expect the case to be closed? A history of legal clashes Storm’s speech and public reaction Storm, Tornado Cash co-founder, is believed to have spent over a million dollars in legal costs and still has to continue the battle. Tornado Cash’s other co-founders, Roman Semenov and Alex Pertsev, faced prosecution, too. But on Jan. 22, Storm spoke out, claiming that prosecuting him for his work on the open-source code for a non-custodial protocol that enables private transactions is a criminalization of privacy. In the post, Storm warns that this prosecution creates a precedent for criminalizing software developers. He provides details, saying that he’s facing up to 45 years in prison for operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, conspiracy to commit money laundering and sanction evasion. On top of Storm’s own words, he included statements by multiple professionals from the blockchain industry, lawyer Keri Axel, and politician and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who called the sanctions against Tornado “illegal and unconstitutional.” (On Jan. 21, a court ruling seemingly overturned the U.S. sanctions, ruling Tornado’s smart contracts are not “property” under U.S. law.) Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also raised his voice in support of Tornado Cash. “You created Tornado in significant part because of my suggestion that it is something worth building,” Buterin said. “It would violate basic honor for me to do that, and then fail to support you in your hour of need. In Ethereum we protect our own, and uphold our honor.” The Tornado Cash transaction data mixer works via the Ethereum Virtual Machine. You created Tornado in significant part because of my suggestion that it is something worth building. It would violate basic honor for me to do that, and then fail to support you in your hour of need. In Ethereum we protect our own, and uphold our honor. Milady — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 22, 2025 Why do many expect the case to be closed? Some observers of the case expressed confidence that prosecutors may drop the charges. After all, newly sworn-in U.S. President Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht — founder and operator of Silk Road, an infamous online black market that operated on the dark web from 2011 to 2013. Storm and other crypto professionals currently facing charges hope that the Trump administration will be especially lenient toward their own. Elon Musk, for example, told X users that he would speak to Trump on behalf of early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, who is currently facing charges from the U.S. Department of Justice on mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. There is another reason why, under the new Trump administration, Storm could hope for a favorable outcome. On Jan. 23, Trump issued an executive order banning federal agencies from pursuing work on a central bank digital currency, or CBDC. This move signals the White House’s support for private transactions over those that might be fully auditable by regulators, bodes well for Tornado. Read more: Trump signs executive order related to crypto A history of legal clashes Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, mixers, and private crypto wallets have a history of clashes with regulators like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) who often view such projects as money-laundering tools. For instance, in 2024, the Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill were charged with money laundering and unlicensed money-transmitting business. The wallet website was seized. According to U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, the founders of the Samourai Wallet knowingly participated in laundering millions of dollars associated with the Silk Road and Hydra black markets. Critics of the case argue that their role was solely in creating and maintaining the wallet that conceals the transaction data. Samourai Wallet founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill face up to 25 years in prison. Just like Tornado Cash, Samouri Wallet was non-custodial. In the past, the government has taken down the largest custodial mixers as well. The list includes Bitcoin Fog, Helix, Blender, Sinbad, and Chip Mixer. As for digital money, analysts at Kaiko revealed last year that market liquidity for privacy tokens — including Monero ( XMR ), Zcash ( ZEC ), and DASH — has reached all-time lows as crypto exchanges keep removing these assets from their listings due to the ongoing crackdown on crypto projects using mixing tools. Zcash was created with the help of former National Security Agency contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden. As of today, it is hard to tell if the narrative and treatment of privacy coins and mixer services under the Trump administration will change. Storm’s next court date is April 14, 2025.

As a result, AI is also now being integrated into blockchain and cryptocurrency systems on a broader scale. This could open doors to increased efficiency, security, and innovation in the crypto market. For this reason, AI-powered crypto projects like IntelMarkets are currently leading the industry. This has left investors wondering if more traditional altcoins like Litecoin (LTC) and ADA can keep up with the game-changing AI innovations. Litecoin (LTC) Declines Following Network Stagnancy Litecoin (LTC) continues to be a top choice for crypto traders because of its fast transaction times and low trading fees. However, the project’s lack of new updates has held its chance to match other Layer 1 and Layer 2 projects. This stagnation has led users to explore alternative options, as on-chain data reveals that Litecoin whales have been actively selling off their holdings. For this reason, the token has taken a huge hit, falling victim to a nearly 20% drop in the coin's peak price from earlier this year. Additionally, other on-chain metrics indicate a decline in Litecoin's hash rate, which fell from a weekly high of 1.94 TH/s to 1.83 TH/s. Currently trading around $120.62, Litecoin (LTC) has declined by 5% over the past week. As a result, Litecoin (LTC) is trading 71% below its all-time high, with high price volatility of 8.19% in the last 30 days. Plomin Hard Fork Launch Announcement Influences Cardano Price Rally Unlike Litecoin (LTC), Cardano (ADA,l is making an effort to keep up with the recent updates in the crypto space through upgrades. In the past two weeks, the Cardano price has seen significant increase over 7% to its current price level of $0.99. This Cardano price rally was influenced by the announcement of the Plomin hard fork, introducing new governance structures and enhanced network capabilities for ADA. The upgrade was officially approved by Input Output Global (IOG), marking a significant milestone that could impact Cardano price outlook. While investors are still interested in a Cardano price increase, they express concerns over ADA's slow transaction times, particularly as they look towards AI altcoins known for their scalability. Nevertheless, ADA experts predict a 114% rise for the Cardano price by mid February, if Plomin takes off.

Consequently, AI is being increasingly integrated into blockchain and cryptocurrency systems on a large scale. This integration could enhance efficiency, security, and innovation within the crypto landscape. Due to this trend, AI-driven crypto projects, such as IntelMarkets, are at the forefront of the industry. This situation is prompting investors to question whether long-standing altcoins like Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) can keep pace with these game-changing AI developments. Litecoin (LTC) Faces Challenges Due to Network Inactivity Litecoin (LTC) remains a favorite among crypto traders due to its quick transaction processing and low fees. However, the project's lack of recent updates has hindered its ability to compete with newer Layer 1 and Layer 2 projects. This stagnation has led users to seek alternatives, with on-chain data indicating that Litecoin whales have been offloading their holdings.

As it stands, Litecoin (LTC) is trading 71% below its all-time high, with a significant price volatility of 8.19% in the last 30 days. Cardano Price Surge Triggered by Plomin Hard Fork Announcement In contrast to Litecoin (LTC), Cardano (ADA) is actively working to stay abreast of the latest crypto developments through upgrades. Over the past two weeks, Cardano's price has surged by over 7%, reaching its current level of $0.99. This price increase for Cardano was spurred by the announcement of the Plomin hard fork, which brings new governance structures and enhanced network capabilities to ADA. Officially approved by Input Output Global (IOG), this upgrade marks a significant milestone that could influence Cardano's price trajectory. Despite interest in Cardano's potential price growth, investors are concerned about ADA's slow transaction speeds, especially as they look to AI altcoins known for their scalability. Nevertheless, ADA specialists forecast a potential 114% increase in Cardano's price by mid-February if the Plomin upgrade is successful.

Investors Are Eyeing Lightchain AI's Promise,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/missed-out-on-the-trump-coins-craze-investors-are-eyeing-lightchain-ais-promise,"Recently, the excitement surrounding Trump-themed meme coins, like $TRUMP Coin and $MELANIA Coin, drew in many early investors eager to take advantage of the trend. However, not everyone was able to benefit from the meme coin surge, and as their values begin to stabilize, numerous investors are now searching for more dependable opportunities with lasting potential.

With a presale price set at $0.005625 and over $12.9 million already raised, Lightchain AI is proving to be a compelling alternative to the speculative nature of meme coins. The Ups and Downs of Trump Coins In January 2025, Donald Trump introduced the $TRUMP coin, which quickly soared to a $7 billion valuation. However, following the launch of a similar $MELANIA coin by First Lady Melania Trump, the value of $TRUMP plummeted by more than 40%, now standing at approximately $400 million. These fluctuations have raised concerns within the crypto community about the inherent volatility and speculative nature of meme coins. Some observers believe that the popularity of these tokens could undermine the credibility of cryptocurrency as a genuine investment, highlighting issues of hype and regulation. Moreover, ethical questions have arisen regarding potential conflicts of interest, given that the Trump family benefits from these ventures while potentially influencing market regulations. Lightchain AI - A Utility-Driven Option In sharp contrast to the speculative aspect of meme coins, Lightchain AI is grounded in practical utility and cutting-edge technology. Among its most notable features is its AI-powered blockchain ecosystem, allowing businesses to securely process and analyze data while taking advantage of blockchain's transparency and decentralization. This innovation makes Lightchain AI especially attractive to sectors like logistics, data analytics, and AI-driven automation. Additionally, the success of Lightchain AI's presale speaks volumes about its potential. Having raised over $12.9 million, the project has drawn significant interest from both early adopters and seasoned investors. Its roadmap, featuring a testnet launch in January 2025 and a mainnet rollout in March, outlines clear milestones for development and adoption, distinguishing it from mere hype-based tokens.

However, not everyone managed to ride the meme coin frenzy, and as prices cool, many investors are looking for more stable opportunities with long-term potential. Lightchain AI , a blockchain platform that integrates artificial intelligence into decentralized systems, is becoming the focal point for those seeking innovation and sustainable growth. With its presale price at $0.005625 and over $12.9 million raised, Lightchain AI is emerging as a strong alternative to speculative meme coins. Rise and Fall of Trump Coins In month of January 2025, leader Donald Trump showed the $TRUMP coin, which fast rose to a worth of $7 billion. But, after the start of a like $MELANIA coin by First Woman Melania Trump, $TRUMP's worth fell by more than 40%, now at around $400 million. These ch͏anges got people worried in the crypto group about the possible shakiness and guessing traits of those meme coins. Some folks say that the fame of these tokens might harm the trustworthiness of crypto as an investment, pointing out problems with excitement and control. Also, some moral questions have come up about possible clashes of interest since the Trump family gains from these jobs while shaping market rules. Lightchain AI - Utility-Driven Alternative In stark contrast to the speculative nature of meme coins, Lightchain AI is built on a foundation of real-world utility and advanced technology. One of its standout features is its AI-Powered Blockchain Ecosystem, which enables businesses to securely process and analyze data while leveraging blockchain’s transparency and decentralization.

Most of Armstrong’s conversations with financial leaders centered on what the administration was planning for digital assets, he said. “Every single conversation I had with any major market player was about the Trump Administration’s crypto plans,” Armstrong said in a Jan. 24 X post. One of the first public speeches that Trump gave as President was a promise to make the US the “world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto.” The bold statement only created more interest, and it cemented crypto’s place in the future of finance. Crypto Leaders and Institutions React Armstrong said that competition among the crypto companies is getting more heated as they race to stay ahead. “There’s going to be more players, more competition than ever in crypto, and we welcome it,” he said. Financial institutions such as banks and asset managers are accelerating investments in digital assets amid the rapidly changing landscape. Meanwhile, traditional finance heads showed cautious optimism. Goldman Sachs’ CEO David Solomon acknowledged that there could be “real potential,” yet regulatory constriction was huge. “We can’t own or be involved with Bitcoin due to regulations,” was his words that generally reflected that of the whole banking sector. Speculation Around Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Armstrong also referred to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve reportedly to be created by Trump, part of the national digital assets stockpile. Trump’s executive order to study digital assets, considering how much more BTC-focused many Bitcoin proponents had hoped it would be, shows his interest in the space more generally. The development has led to speculation that other cryptocurrencies might be involved, reflecting a strategic effort to incorporate blockchain technology into national economic policies. A Global Shift to Free Markets Armstrong also praised world leaders such as Argentina’s Javier Milei and El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele, trumpeting their pro-market stance as drivers for prosperity. He added that “socialism is on its way out,” signaling a wider shift in global economic ideologies. As the blending of political and economic ambitions continues to build momentum, this could shape up to be an era of unprecedented change in the financial world-and Trump’s crypto vision may very well lead the charge.",Blockchain|DonaldTrump|Web3,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-26 15:49:00

Leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance reported that wallets in this category surged 25% this past year, from 24 million in January 2024 to nearly 30 million in 2025. Bitcoin Wallets Follow 2017 And 2021 Trend The Binance report noted that the trend reflects the massive influx of new participants into the crypto market. In hindsight, this also suggests increased interest and optimism for the flagship digital currency amongst investors. Such occurrences are not abnormal in the crypto sector, specifically during the bull run season. The crypto sector saw a similar incident in late 2017 and 2021. After the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, the coin hit an ATH around the middle of the year. This triggered a spike in Bitcoin wallets holding $100 or more. Bitcoin Price Surge Past $100,000 Bitcoin has surpassed $100,000, as it trades at $104,929.22 . At this price level, it is logical that many investors would want to take a share of the growing price action of BTC. This does not negate that many may be investing due to Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). Significantly, institutional adoption of Bitcoin is on the high side, attributed largely to BTC ETFs. US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Records Milestone Most investors, especially those on Wall Street, are exploring spot Bitcoin ETFs as a less risky option. In return, these funds have recorded a sizable growth in their net inflows. In less than one year of launch, ETF holdings went as high as 1.25 million Bitcoin. Out of these holdings, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) boasts $50 billion in assets. It was reported that US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs are about to surpass a major milestone , with cumulative net inflows reaching $39.94 billion since their launch. The surge in inflows coincides with President Donald Trump’s second-term inauguration, which has renewed optimism among pro-crypto advocates.

Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC continues to create uncertainty, impacting investor sentiment and XRP’s market performance. At the same time, analysts project a promising future for Bitcoin and Ethereum, with bold price targets driving market speculation. Amid these discussions, Web3Bay presents a structured and transparent opportunity through its 3BAY token presale. By offering a tiered pricing model that rewards early participants, Web3Bay not only incentivizes timely investments but also integrates real-world utility and governance rights, setting itself apart as a practical investment option. How Early Supporters Benefit from Web3Bay’s Tiered Pricing Model The 3BAY token presale is structured to reward early adopters through a 28-stage tiered pricing model, offering significant advantages to those who act quickly. Specifically, each stage progressively increases the token price, creating a system that incentivizes early participation while fostering long-term value appreciation. Currently, in Stage 4, the presale has raised $920,000 in funding and sold 338 million tokens at a price of $0.004562625 per token. Consequently, investors who join now still benefit from the relatively low pricing, positioning themselves for potential gains as the presale progresses and prices rise in subsequent stages. In the initial stages, participants could acquire tokens at the lowest prices, maximizing their return on investment as the token value climbs. Moreover, this progressive structure not only incentivizes early participation but also reflects growing market confidence in Web3Bay’s vision. Furthermore, purchases made with the 3BAY token grant users a 5% discount on transactions within Web3Bay, further enhancing the token’s utility and creating additional value for holders. Additionally, beyond potential financial returns, early buyers gain governance rights tied to 3BAY ownership, enabling them to actively shape the platform’s future. In light of this, the presale’s success, with over $920,000 raised so far, demonstrates strong investor interest in Web3Bay’s blockchain-based e-commerce platform. For investors, joining early means securing a stake in a project designed to redefine e-commerce, with the most substantial rewards reserved for those who act quickly during these early stages. Analysts Predict Bitcoin at $200K and Ethereum at $10K in 2025 As 2025 unfolds, financial experts are forecasting significant gains for leading cryptocurrencies. For instance, Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick anticipates Bitcoin reaching $200,000 and Ethereum hitting $10,000 by year’s end. This optimism is fueled by expectations of crypto-friendly policies under President Trump’s administration, which are likely to attract increased institutional investments, particularly through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Although potential short-term market fluctuations may occur, the overarching sentiment remains bullish. Specifically, analysts highlight key events influencing the crypto landscape, including the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions and the implementation of anticipated regulatory frameworks. As a result, the market is closely monitoring the administration’s actions, especially regarding the potential establishment of a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve, which could further elevate cryptocurrency valuations. Ultimately, 2025 is poised to be a transformative year for digital assets, with substantial growth anticipated in the sector. Ripple vs. SEC: Legal Battle Intensifies XRP Market Uncertainty Ripple’s ongoing legal clash with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has created a wave of market uncertainty. Specifically, the SEC’s appeal against the ruling that XRP sales to retail investors were not securities has reignited concerns about regulatory overreach in the cryptocurrency space. Consequently, this legal ambiguity has directly impacted XRP’s market performance, leading to an 11% price drop before stabilizing at $0.52, reflecting investor unease over the potential implications for Ripple and the broader crypto industry. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) has also faced headwinds, slipping below key psychological levels amid declining investor confidence. Notably, contributing factors include ETF outflows and apprehensions surrounding Bitcoin’s role as a strategic reserve asset. Ultimately, both XRP and BTC’s price fluctuations underscore the sensitivity of crypto markets to regulatory actions and judicial outcomes. For investors and industry stakeholders alike, these developments remain critical to the evolving landscape of digital asset regulation. Last Say Ripple’s legal uncertainties and projections for Bitcoin and Ethereum highlight the diverse challenges and opportunities within the crypto sector. Web3Bay, through its tiered 3BAY token presale, offers a clear framework for early adopters to benefit from competitive pricing, real-world utility, and governance rights. By combining practical incentives with long-term potential, Web3Bay presents an alternative for investors seeking stability and utility amidst broader market shifts. This approach underscores the importance of structured opportunities in navigating the complexities of cryptocurrency investments.

The APT token has struggled to achieve any sustained upward momentum since the turn of the new year. After making a play above $10 in early January, the Aptos price has been in steady decline, falling to around $8 in the past week. Unfortunately, these performance woes for the APT token seem far from over, with the possibility of an even deeper correction on the cards. The Reasoning Behind APT’s Potential 50% Correction In a new post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared a worrying prediction for the price of Aptos over the next few weeks. According to the popular trader, the altcoin is currently in a bearish setup, putting its price at risk of a severe correction. Related Reading: SUI Inches Closer To $3.9 Support Under Growing Bearish Influence The rationale behind this bearish forecast is the formation of the head-and-shoulders pattern on the Aptos 12-hour chart. The head-and-shoulders formation is a pattern used in technical price analysis marked by three price highs, including a higher “head” set between two lower “shoulders.” This chart formation usually signals a potential bearish reversal, indicating a possible shift from an upward price trend to a downtrend. This setup can be confirmed when the asset’s price breaks below the neckline, a trendline connecting the troughs (swing lows) between the head. As highlighted in the chart above, the Aptos price has already established the right shoulder following rejection around the $10.5 mark. After testing the neckline — set around the $8 mark — in mid-January, the price of APT bounced back toward $9.5. However, the price of Aptos seems to be approaching the neckline again. While there is no certainty that the neckline will give way this time, it is worth noting that the more times a price level is tested, the more it is likely to get breached. According to Martinez, if the Aptos price successfully breaks and closes beneath the $8 mark, the altcoin could be at risk of a significant drop to $4.30. This would represent a nearly 50% decline from the current price point. However, Martinez provided an alternative scenario for the price of Aptos. According to the crypto analyst, a sustained close above the right shoulder at $10.50 could be needed to invalidate the bearish outlook. Aptos Price At A Glance As of this writing, the APT token is valued at around $8.13, reflecting an almost 2% decline in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the price of Aptos is down by more than 11% in the past week. Related Reading: Is Toncoin Price Gearing For A Rebound At $5?

In light of these security challenges, a growing number of traders are turning to secure crypto wallets that provide outstanding protection, boosting their trading confidence. Plus Wallet is a preferred choice among them, noted for its cross-chain capability, unlimited rewards, and secure storage of private keys directly on users’ devices.

Simultaneously, Uniswap has confirmed the launch of its version 4 (v4) in 2025, a delay from its initially scheduled Q3 2024 release. This update is expected to introduce essential advancements that will significantly enhance the Uniswap ecosystem. CoinsDo Wallet Cautions Against Emerging Scams CoinsDo Wallet, a decentralized Wallet-as-a-Service provider, has publicly warned its users about ongoing scams including fake emails, counterfeit websites, and phishing attempts under its name. Scammers have crafted deceptive email addresses such as agents.support@coinwallet-info.help to trick users and access their personal information. Moreover, a false website resembling the official CoinsDo Wallet site has been identified, urging users to verify that they are visiting coinsdo.com, the only legitimate site. There are also phishing emails circulating from “CoinWallet,” offering payouts for minimal fees. CoinsDo is advising its users to remain vigilant and bypass these fraudulent activities. Uniswap Ecosystem Anticipates Major Enhancements with V4 Update Uniswap has slated its version 4 (v4) release for 2025 after a slight postponement from its original Q3 2024 timeline. Announced on January 2, this forthcoming update promises substantial improvements across the Uniswap ecosystem, including the introduction of Hooks, which facilitate the execution of custom code around swap events. These developments are set to introduce functionalities such as limit orders, customized oracles, improved fee management, and automated liquidity strategies. Although the exact release date is still to be announced, the platform has undergone extensive testing throughout 2024. Furthermore, Uniswap has launched a bug bounty program to secure the integrity of this new version. Plus Wallet Elevates Security and Convenience for Crypto Traders In 2024, the crypto community faced over $2 billion in losses due to increased hacking incidents, highlighting the critical need for more secure trading solutions. Plus Wallet has responded by providing a secure crypto wallet that ensures users can operate with utmost confidence. Plus Wallet distinguishes itself by keeping private keys on user devices rather than on its own servers, ensuring no third party, not even Plus Wallet, can access sensitive information. To enhance security further, the wallet integrates PIN codes and biometric authentication, setting a new standard in data protection. Moreover, Plus Wallet simplifies the trading experience by offering seamless cross-chain access to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Tron through a single application, eliminating the inconvenience of managing multiple wallets. Recently, it has expanded its service to include networks like Arbitrum and Base, responding to community demand. The combination of top-tier security, user-friendly features, and the opportunity to earn unlimited rewards makes Plus Wallet an attractive choice for traders. By downloading the app, users can effortlessly earn passive income with each transaction, making Plus Wallet a comprehensive solution for secure and rewarding cryptocurrency trading.

In an era where digital security is paramount, Plus Wallet shines as one of the most adaptable and secure options available, offering unparalleled freedom and safety to its users.

Among these, Dogecoin (DOGE), Tron (TRX), Rexas Finance (RXS), and Hedera (HBAR) stand out. These tokens, all priced under $0.40, present investors with a chance to multiply their holdings dramatically within a month. Here’s a closer look at each of these promising altcoins. Dogecoin Regains Footing Dogecoin has long been recognized as a market mover in the meme coin category. After a recent dip to $0.33, it shows signs of resilience. Despite an 18% decline earlier this month, DOGE managed a modest recovery to $0.35, reflecting steady investor interest. Open interest in DOGE futures has surged by $310 million in three days, signaling traders’ anticipation of a bullish breakout. The price remains below key resistance levels, partly due to broader market uncertainty surrounding events like Bitcoin liquidations. However, with speculative traders holding firm ahead of significant market developments, Dogecoin could see renewed momentum soon. Its current consolidation offers an entry point for those eyeing potential price gains. Tron Targets The $0.50 Milestone Tron continues to capture attention with its upward trajectory. Trading at $0.23, it has entered an ascending channel, a technical pattern suggesting prolonged bullish trends. Analysts project TRX could reach $0.50 in the near term, with further potential to climb as high as $2.20 under favorable conditions. Tron’s growing ecosystem and its focus on decentralized applications position it for steady growth. This combination of technical and fundamental strengths makes TRX a compelling option for those seeking a reliable altcoin with upside potential. Rexas Finance Revolutionizes Real-World Assets Rexas Finance (RXS) is reshaping how real-world assets interact with blockchain technology. It offers investors unparalleled access to asset tokenization, enabling ownership or fractional investment in properties, gold, and more—all with a click. By tokenizing real-world assets, Rexas Finance opens doors to passive income opportunities, such as owning a fraction of an apartment complex or a commercial property overseas. The project’s ecosystem includes tools like the Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad, streamlining the process of creating and funding tokens tied to tangible assets. Additionally, its Quickmint Bot and GenAI-powered solutions bridge gaps between traditional assets and blockchain, transforming industries. RXS operates on Ethereum (ERC-20), with 1 billion tokens in circulation. The presale has achieved remarkable success, raising $38.8 million so far. Initial stages sold out swiftly, pushing the token price from $0.03 to $0.175, a near sixfold increase. Investors can participate in the ongoing presale to capitalize on further growth as the token targets $10 by early 2025. Further cementing its credibility, RXS has been audited by CertiK and listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. This has not only boosted visibility but also strengthened community engagement and investor confidence. With plans to launch on three Tier 1 exchanges, RXS is positioned for exponential growth. To excite its community further, Rexas Finance has launched a $1 million giveaway. Twenty winners will receive $50,000 USDT each, with extra chances awarded for referrals and completing specific actions.

Among these, Dogecoin (DOGE), Tron (TRX), Rexas Finance (RXS), and Hedera (HBAR) are noteworthy. Priced below $0.40, these tokens provide investors with the possibility of significantly increasing their investments within just 30 days. Let’s delve into what makes each of these altcoins so promising. Dogecoin Finds Its Balance Again Dogecoin has established itself as a key player within the meme coin sector. After dipping to $0.33, it now shows signs of bouncing back. Despite experiencing an 18% drop earlier this month, DOGE has slowly regained to $0.35, indicating continued investor interest. Open interest in DOGE futures has increased by $310 million over three days, reflecting traders’ expectations of a bullish surge. The price is still below important resistance levels, partly due to broader market uncertainties like Bitcoin sell-offs. Yet, with speculative traders holding their positions before major market events, Dogecoin might soon experience renewed energy. Its current price consolidation offers a potential entry point for those looking for future gains. Tron Aims for the $0.50 Mark Tron is gaining attention with its upward movement. Currently trading at $0.23, it has entered an ascending channel, a technical pattern that suggests a continued bullish trend. Analysts predict TRX could hit $0.50 shortly, with the potential to reach up to $2.20 under favorable circumstances. Tron's expanding ecosystem and its focus on decentralized applications position it for consistent growth. This blend of technical and fundamental strengths makes TRX an attractive choice for investors seeking a stable altcoin with growth potential. Rexas Finance Transforms Real-World Assets Rexas Finance (RXS) is changing the way real-world assets integrate with blockchain technology. It provides investors with unparalleled access to asset tokenization, allowing them to own or invest fractionally in properties, gold, and more—all with ease. By tokenizing tangible assets, Rexas Finance creates avenues for passive income opportunities, such as owning a portion of an apartment complex or a commercial property abroad. The project's ecosystem includes tools like the Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad, simplifying the process of creating and funding tokens linked to real assets. Moreover, its Quickmint Bot and GenAI-powered solutions connect traditional assets with blockchain, revolutionizing industries. RXS operates on Ethereum (ERC-20), with a circulating supply of 1 billion tokens. The presale has been a huge success, raising $38.8 million to date. Early stages sold out quickly, boosting the token’s price from $0.03 to $0.175, an almost sixfold increase. Investors can still join the ongoing presale to seize further growth opportunities as the token aims for $10 by early 2025. Adding to its credibility, RXS has been audited by CertiK and is listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which has increased its visibility and strengthened community ties and investor trust. With plans to launch on three Tier 1 exchanges, RXS is set for significant growth. To further engage its community, Rexas Finance has initiated a $1 million giveaway. Twenty winners will each get $50,000 USDT, with additional entries available through referrals and specific actions. This move demonstrates the project’s commitment to inclusivity and rewarding active participation. Hedera (HBAR) Maintains Steady Growth Hedera Hashgraph concludes this list with its robust infrastructure and long-term potential. Currently priced at $0.3150, HBAR has maintained a strong technical stance, staying above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The recent emergence of a golden cross indicates possible bullish momentum. HBAR has also developed a bullish pennant pattern, suggesting potential upward price movement. Analysts believe the coin could rally towards $1, bolstered by its expanding use cases and growing adoption across various industries. Conclusion For those looking to transform $10,000 into $100,000, these four altcoins—Dogecoin, Tron, Rexas Finance , and Hedera—offer exciting possibilities. While Dogecoin and Tron provide stability through their market positions and technical patterns, Hedera’s consistent growth points to its long-term potential.

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) dropped to the key support level at $0.000020, its lowest level since December 20. There is a risk that the SHIB coin will have a strong bearish breakdown soon as it forms numerous risky chart patterns. Shiba Inu is about to form a death cross Shiba Inu is about to form a death cross pattern. That’s when the 200-day and 50-day weighted moving averages cross each other. The distance between the two has continued narrowing. SHIB previously formed a death cross on June 20, 2024. The price crashed by over 40%, moving from $0.000017 to a low of $0.000010. It then formed a golden cross pattern on Oct. 20, leading to an 80% surge to the November high of $0.00003340. Shiba Inu price has also formed a small double-top chart pattern, which is characterized by twin peaks and a neckline. The double-top is at $0.00002488, and the neckline at $0.00001970. Like the death cross, a double-top is a popular bearish reversal pattern. Therefore, a clear break below the strong, pivot, reverse point at $0.00001788 will point to more downside. Such a move points to more downside, with the next target being at $0.00001192, the ultimate support of the Murrey Math Lines.

According to IntoTheBlock, the new and active addresses have dropped by 27.5% and 25% in the last seven days. This decline likely happened as many traders sold their coins, potentially for the newer Solana meme coins like Fartcoin and Official Trump ( TRUMP ). Shiba Inu daily active addresses have fallen | Source: IntoTheBlock Other data shows that the daily Shiba Inu burn rate has crashed by almost 94%. Just 656,468 coins worth just $15 were burned on Sunday. This decline is likely because of the falling momentum on Shibarium, its layer-2 network. According to ShibariumScan , the average transaction fee has dropped to 0.0001 BONE from 0.0003 BONE in November. The sum of BONE spent on gas fees has also continued falling — a sign that the network is not growing. Several newer meme coins have also overtaken Shiba Inu’s daily volume. Its daily volume was $160 million, while Official Trump had $4.56 billion. Pudgy Penguins had $188 million, while Fartcoin had $226 million. That is a sign that investors are rotating from older meme coins to newer ones.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. This January, investors are eyeing Monero, Dogecoin, and 1Fuel as leading picks for massive gains, with 1Fuel drawing the most attention. Table of Contents Monero surges above 2-year high Dogecoin’s recent surge boosts $1 predictions 1Fuel’s unique features make OFT the best pick for massive gains This January, investors are searching for the cryptos that could be the best pick for massive gains. While the crypto market offers many promising options, three stand out: Monero, Dogecoin, and 1Fuel . 1Fuel, in particular, has seen massive investor interest as its ICO funding crossed the $1.4m mark. But which of these cryptos is the best pick to supercharge investors’ investment portfolios? Let’s find out! You might also like: 1Fuel hits $1.5m in presale, steals spotlight from SHIB Monero surges above 2-year high Monero’s current value shows strong bullish momentum as it crosses the 2-year high of $211. Although after surging above $230 on January 17, Monero has retracted and now trades at $219. This represents a drop in value of about 1%, which hasn’t affected holders’ optimism about Monero’s bullish prospects. The recent Monero uptrend has been linked to improvements to the altcoin’s ecosystem. To improve network privacy, Monero has implemented some serious cryptographic updates. These updates give traders total transactional anonymity, making Monero a bus stop for privacy-focused traders. Analysts believe this is just the beginning and forecast that Monero will reach $400 before the end of 2025. Dogecoin’s recent surge boosts $1 predictions On-chain data shows Dogecoin’s value surged by a remarkable 19% last week and 8% over the previous month. Dogecoin ’s price peaked at $0.41 on January 17 before pulling back to $0.39. Nevertheless, the meme coin is still flying high, and analysts expect DOGE to reach the coveted $1 mark by Q3 2025. Dogecoin’s surge is primarily influenced by the massive whale acquisitions, with over 500 million DOGE purchased since the start of January. This signals strong investor confidence, and Dogecoin could be on the verge of an extended bullish run. Should Dogecoin reach $1, experts forecast that it could rise further, pushing its price to an ambitious $3 target. 1Fuel’s unique features make OFT the best pick for massive gains Inconsistencies have affected the P2P crypto exchange market. Traders and businesses usually have to navigate several blockchains and network fees to conduct transactions. This has led to frustrations from users looking for a platform to manage their assets and execute trades securely. 1Fuel solves this problem by introducing a one-click feature in cross-chain transactions. With 1Fuel’s wallet, users can effortlessly manage their assets across several blockchains and make one-click cross-chain transactions. There’s also an integrated P2P exchange where users can trade assets securely. These features make 1Fuel a standout among several protocols offering similar services. 1Fuel emphasizes fundamental principles regarding privacy. The project features a privacy mixer for investors who want their transactions to be anonymous; this enhances the flow of transactions by preventing the tracking of traders’ wallets. 1Fuel’s cold storage solution also offers additional security, enabling users to safely store their assets offline and eliminating threats of online hacks. Prioritizing its community, 1Fuel holders can earn passive income up to 30% APR by staking their OFT tokens.

Expert Explains,https://timestabloid.com/does-ripple-dump-xrp-on-retail-investors-expert-explains/,"The topic of XRP releases from escrow and their impact on market dynamics remains one of the most debated aspects of the XRP ecosystem. CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto), a well-known crypto expert on X, recently shared insights regarding the digital assets tokenomics and Ripple’s sales strategy. His post highlights how token distributions affect retail holders and compares methods across the crypto industry. He also clarified the notion of Ripple “dumping” tokens on the community, which detractors often turn to when criticizing Ripple and XRP. The Practice of Token Distribution CrediBULL Crypto emphasized that every cryptocurrency with tokens not yet in full circulation must release its supply. These mechanisms often involve incentives for participants, and regardless of the approach, the result is similar: tokens enter the market and are sold for profit. “At the end of the day, holding a token that isn’t fully circulating will almost always result in someone getting ‘dumped on,'” he stated. This is an inherent aspect of introducing tokens into circulation, as there are limited ways to expand a network’s supply while ensuring utility and adoption. Comparing Methods of Token Release CrediBULL Crypto outlined several approaches that projects use to release tokens: Grants to Developers: Tokens are provided to builders, which may later be sold to fund development. Staking and Liquidity Rewards: Participants are rewarded with tokens for staking or providing liquidity, which they often sell. Airdrops: Tokens distributed for free to communities frequently end up being sold. Mining Rewards: Tokens earned through mining are typically sold for operational costs or profit. These practices, while necessary, often lead to criticism from retail holders who feel they bear the brunt of these sales. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Strategic Approach to XRP Sales Ripple’s distribution of XRP has often been criticized by some for allegedly dumping on retail . However, CrediBULL Crypto argued that Ripple’s sales differ significantly from anonymous projects or individual holders selling for personal gain. He explained that Ripple’s XRP sales are used to grow the ecosystem and increase adoption and are not being spent on personal luxuries. The company uses its XRP sales to fund initiatives, partnerships, and ecosystem development. This strategy ensures that proceeds are reinvested to promote the token’s long-term success. While token sales may temporarily affect the market, they are a crucial aspect of ensuring network development and growth. According to CrediBULL Crypto, Ripple’s vested interest in XRP’s success ensures that these sales align with expanding the token’s adoption and utility. He believes this is a better option for the ecosystem than allowing retail users to trade all tokens themselves without benefiting the ecosystem.

While headlines focus on the Toncoin market cap drop and the latest Cardano price analysis, this emerging project, Rollblock, has been drawing in new investors with its focus on blockchain-powered gaming. Below, we’ll look at what’s going on with TON and ADA, and why Rollblock growth potential might be the sleeper story of the year. Toncoin Market Cap Drop: What’s Causing the Slide? For a while, Toncoin (TON) seemed poised to become a top-tier crypto asset. It gained attention for its messaging app roots and fast transaction speeds, which appealed to both early adopters and large communities looking for user-friendly blockchain solutions. Recently, however, the Toncoin market cap drop has sparked concern among investors, prompting some to reevaluate their TON holdings. Several factors may be contributing to this downturn. A mix of broader market volatility and increased competition from other layer-1 networks has made it tougher for Toncoin to maintain its previous rankings. Some experts believe TON could recover if market sentiment improves, but others think new projects could overtake it, especially if they offer compelling utility and strong community support. Cardano Price Analysis: A Steady Decline Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) has also seen better days. Although it once ranked among the top blockchains for staking and smart contract development, the past few months have been marked by price drops that left ADA holders uneasy. According to the latest Cardano price analysis, the coin has struggled to find stable ground, bouncing between short-term rallies and sudden dips. Part of the issue could be tied to the long roadmap for Cardano’s upgrades. While the network is known for its academic approach and peer-reviewed research, some investors have grown impatient waiting for more significant user adoption. If ADA can attract major projects or partnerships, its outlook could shift—but for now, many are keeping a close eye on more immediate opportunities. Rollblock Growth Potential: The New Kid on the Block As Toncoin slides and Cardano stumbles, Rollblock appears to be seizing the moment. Built as a GambleFi platform, Rollblock merges blockchain transparency with online gaming—offering more than 7,000 casino-style games and a community-driven rewards system. With an emphasis on fair play, Rollblock aims to tap into a massive global market, estimated at around $450 billion. The Rollblock growth potential lies in its token mechanics and tangible use cases. Instead of relying solely on speculative hype, Rollblock employs a model with token buybacks, burns, and staking rewards to keep its economy balanced. Early backers see a clear path to adoption as the project capitalizes on the booming iGaming sector, which continues to expand even when other parts of the crypto world cool off. Could Rollblock Really Surpass TON and ADA? If Rollblock delivers on its vision, it might indeed surpass Toncoin and Cardano, especially given the Toncoin market cap drop and the lukewarm results from the latest Cardano price analysis. Investors often look for projects with strong user engagement and a transparent plan for long-term growth, and Rollblock seems to check those boxes. Still, it’s important to remember that the crypto space can shift quickly. Toncoin may rebound if it executes key upgrades or signs notable partnerships. Cardano could stage a comeback if its development milestones speed up and attract new dApps. That said, Rollblock’s user-focused approach and big-picture strategy could make it one of the top contenders heading into 2024. The Final Word on This Year’s Contenders As Toncoin (TON) battles a sliding market cap and Cardano (ADA) contends with ongoing price dips, Rollblock emerges as a fresh alternative with clear utility in the iGaming world. Whether you’re a dedicated TON supporter, a longtime ADA holder, or someone seeking new opportunities, it’s worth keeping Rollblock on your radar. With its presale success already showing promise, this GambleFi newcomer could very well be the story of the year for those ready to invest in a project that blends entertainment, transparency, and real-world rewards.

While the spotlight is on Toncoin's dip in market cap and the recent analysis of Cardano's price, Rollblock, a new entrant focusing on blockchain-driven gaming, is capturing investor interest. Let's explore the current situation with TON and ADA, and consider why Rollblock's growth potential might be the unexpected highlight of the year. What’s Behind Toncoin’s Market Cap Decline? Toncoin (TON) was once on track to become a leading cryptocurrency, gaining momentum thanks to its origins in messaging apps and swift transaction capabilities, appealing to early adopters and large groups seeking user-friendly blockchain solutions. However, the recent drop in Toncoin's market cap has raised alarm bells for investors, causing some to reassess their TON investments. There could be multiple reasons for this decline. A combination of overall market instability and heightened competition from other layer-1 networks has made it challenging for Toncoin to retain its former position. Experts are divided; some suggest TON could bounce back with improved market sentiment, while others believe new projects offering significant utility and robust community backing may surpass it. Analyzing Cardano’s Price: A Gradual Descent Cardano (ADA), on the other hand, is also facing challenges. Once a top choice for staking and smart contract development, ADA has experienced a series of price decreases recently, unsettling its investors. Current analyses of Cardano's price reveal its struggle to stabilize, oscillating between brief surges and abrupt declines. This instability may be linked to the lengthy timeline for Cardano's upgrades. Despite its reputation for rigorous academic research and peer-reviewed studies, some investors have grown weary of waiting for widespread user adoption. If ADA can secure significant projects or partnerships, its future prospects might improve—but for now, many are focusing on more immediate prospects. Rollblock’s Potential: A Rising Star in the Crypto World With Toncoin losing ground and Cardano faltering, Rollblock could be capitalizing on the opportunity. Designed as a GambleFi platform, Rollblock combines blockchain transparency with online gaming—offering over 7,000 casino-style games and a community-centric rewards model. By prioritizing fair play, Rollblock aims to capture a share of the vast global gaming market, valued at approximately $450 billion. Rollblock's potential for growth is rooted in its token dynamics and practical applications. Instead of relying solely on speculative excitement, Rollblock uses a model that includes token buybacks, burns, and staking incentives to maintain economic stability. Early supporters see a clear path to growth as the project taps into the expanding iGaming industry, which continues to thrive even when other crypto sectors slow down. Is Rollblock Set to Outpace TON and ADA? Should Rollblock fulfill its ambitions, it might indeed outshine Toncoin and Cardano, particularly in light of Toncoin's market cap decrease and the mixed results from recent Cardano price analyses. Investors often seek projects with high user engagement and transparent long-term growth strategies, and Rollblock appears to meet those criteria. However, the cryptocurrency landscape is ever-changing. Toncoin might make a comeback if it implements crucial upgrades or secures significant partnerships. Cardano could also rebound if it accelerates its development milestones and attracts new decentralized applications. Nonetheless, Rollblock's user-focused strategy and comprehensive vision might position it as a leading candidate going into 2024. A Look at This Year’s Crypto Contenders As Toncoin (TON) struggles with a declining market cap and Cardano (ADA) faces persistent price drops, Rollblock emerges as an intriguing alternative with clear utility in the iGaming sector. Whether you are a steadfast TON advocate, a veteran ADA investor, or someone exploring new ventures, Rollblock deserves attention. With its successful presale showing promise, this GambleFi newcomer could be the year's standout for those ready to invest in a project that blends entertainment, transparency, and tangible rewards.

According to The Block Data, Pump.fun’s single-day record of $15.38 million was followed by the popularity of the Vine Coin. The meme coin was created by Rus Yusupo, co-founder of the defunct Vine video platform. Elon Musk also made positive gestures about integrating Vine into X’s functionality, which generated intrigue among the user base. An X employee revealed that the platform may switch its video section title to Vine. Pump.fun has become the fastest crypto app to hit $100 million Pump.fun was launched on January 19, 2024, just over one year ago. It introduced radical changes to the meme coin world and has attracted “sentiment-based virtual currencies,” according to the New York State Department of Financial Services. It has achieved $100 million in revenue on the Solana blockchain, making it the fastest cryptocurrency application to accomplish this feat after only 217 days. The platform’s most popular meme coins include Moo Deng and Fartcoin, which cash in on internet culture movements but suffer occasional accusations of exploiting their investors. It relied exceptionally well on its unconventional method to establish reliable token launches, which served as an important foundation for its market growth. Rising competition from Jupiter’s Moonshot acquisition Following the launch of Vine Coin, the new cryptocurrency achieved an impressive market cap of $425 million after a mild drop. However, its viral gains enabled Pump.fun to smash its financial records during that day. The platform has recorded more than $4 billion in trading volume over the recent two weeks, and SOL token fees, based on Dune’s report , are advancing toward 2.5 million tokens . Overall, meme coins make an irresistible impression on cryptocurrency enthusiasts, but they present substantial financial risk. Law firm actions have begun analyzing losses suffered by investors as they decide whether to file legal complaints against Pump.fun. Meanwhile, The Solana DEX aggregator Jupiter announced its acquisition of Moonshot, which threatens to challenge Pump.fun’s position as a market leader. Pump.fun maintains its leadership position because of strong current performance data, but competition could arise soon.

Prominent figures like Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano , have shown strong support for the initiative, which could revolutionize how government finances are managed by offering real-time data access, minimizing corruption, and ensuring effective use of public funds. Blockchain’s decentralized and transparent nature is seen as a perfect tool for tracking government expenditures, securing sensitive data, and improving overall accountability. This move aligns with D.O.G.E’s broader mission of cutting inefficiencies in governance and aligns with the Trump administration’s growing interest in digital assets and emerging technologies. D.O.G.E, established through an executive order on January 20, is tasked with modernizing government systems. It works alongside the White House Office of Management and Budget to develop proposals for reducing costs and improving operations. The department is expected to present its first recommendations by July 4, 2026. While Musk has not officially announced a detailed blockchain plan, the initiative has gained significant attention from the crypto industry. Charles Hoskinson has even offered to integrate Cardano, Bitcoin, and Midnight blockchains into the project for free. Other key figures, like Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s former CEO, have highlighted blockchain’s potential to provide transparent records of public spending. A Bloomberg report suggests that D.O.G.E is evaluating blockchain applications in areas such as monitoring expenditures, securing data, managing payments, and tracking federal properties. This effort could set a new standard for integrating advanced technologies into government systems, reducing costs, and boosting transparency. The initiative reflects a larger trend within the Trump administration, which has shown increasing interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency. Recent actions include creating a dedicated crypto task force to establish clear regulations and explore opportunities in the digital asset space. This could mark a transformative step for public administration in the U.S., potentially improving efficiency and restoring public trust. Crypto leaders are rallying behind D.O.G.E’s push, seeing it as an opportunity to showcase blockchain’s benefits. Hoskinson emphasized that a combination of blockchains would be ideal for addressing government inefficiencies, offering his expertise and tools free of charge. He called on Musk to collaborate, underscoring the enthusiasm from industry leaders for this groundbreaking project.

Lightchain AI is transforming decentralized applications by melding blockchain with artificial intelligence, providing practical utility and opportunities for sustained growth. Currently in its presale stage at $0.005625 per token, Lightchain AI has already amassed $12.9 million, reflecting strong confidence from investors. Experts suggest this pioneering project may rival WLD as a leading cryptocurrency by 2025. WLD's Journey to $380 - Can It Meet Expectations? Worldcoin (WLD), launched by Sam Altman, aims to create a global digital ID system through biometric verification. As of January 25, 2025, WLD is trading at approximately $2.26. To reach $380, it would require an enormous increase of over 16,700%. Current projections are more conservative; for instance, 2025 estimates suggest it might peak at $5.03, with an average around $4.86. While Worldcoin's innovative approach has attracted interest, it faces regulatory scrutiny and privacy concerns that could hinder its adoption and market performance. Given these challenges, reaching a value of $380 in the short term appears highly improbable. Why Lightchain AI Might Surpass WLD by 2025 Lightchain AI is set to eclipse WLD by 2025 due to its innovative strategy in decentralization, transparency, and privacy. Unlike conventional AI systems that suffer from bias and centralized control, Lightchain AI decentralizes model training and decision-making, minimizing risks of biased results and concentrated power. By promoting inclusivity, the platform ensures fairness in AI applications. With its decentralized and transparent AI framework, Lightchain AI offers verifiable and traceable AI computations, fostering trust and accountability within its network. Its privacy-preserving data usage utilizes cutting-edge cryptographic techniques like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), ensuring data security while enabling efficient processing.

Currently in its presale phase at $0.005625 per token, Lightchain AI has already raised $12.9 million, signaling strong investor confidence. Experts believe this innovative project could rival WLD as a top-performing cryptocurrency by 2025. WLD’s Path to $380- Can It Deliver on the Hype? Worldcoin (WLD), started by Sam Altman, wants to create a worldwide digital ID system using body checks. As of January 25, 2025 WLD trades at about $2.26. To hit a price of $380 it would need a huge jump of over 16,700% . The present guesses are much more careful; for example, outlooks for 2025 say it could reach a top value of $5. 03, with an average around $4. 86. Worldcoin's new͏ way has caught eyes, but it also runs into rules checks and worries about privacy which might hurt its use and market flow. With these things in mind, getting to a $380 value seems very unlikely in the near time. Why Lightchain AI Could Outshine WLD by 2025 Lightchain AI is poised to outshine WLD by 2025 due to its groundbreaking approach to decentralization, transparency, and privacy.

Will We See A Breakout?",https://bitzo.com/2025/01/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-consolidates-around-105000-will-we-see-a-breakout,"Bitcoin (BTC) spent the weekend fluctuating between $104,000 and $106,000 as momentum waned after encountering resistance around the $107,000 level. The flagship cryptocurrency is trading at around $105,000, having registered only a marginal increase over the past 24 hours. BTC has also witnessed a drop in trading volume, indicating indecision as traders await a potential catalyst that could send the price surging. Intraday traders could take advantage of BTC’s current oscillation between $104,000 and $106,000. Bitcoin (BTC) At a Pivotal Moment Bitcoin (BTC) crossed $100,000 following Donald Trump’s election victory and hit a new all-time high following his inauguration. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has stated that with a crypto-friendly administration in place, several sovereign wealth funds are looking at BTC . Now, with the Federal Reserve facing a dollar crisis, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has predicted that BTC could flip Gold’s $100 trillion. Armstrong predicted while responding to criticism of plans to establish a national Bitcoin reserve. “Any country with gold reserves should be holding at least 11% of that amount in bitcoin reserves. And I believe in the next five to 10 years bitcoin's market cap will likely surpass gold. So these reserves should grow to exceed gold.” President Trump has been following through on campaign promises to overhaul crypto policy and has ordered the creation of a cryptocurrency working group to draft a new regulatory framework for crypto and explore the creation of a national cryptocurrency stockpile. Bitcoin Wallets With $100 Surge To Record Levels According to an analysis of on-chain data, Bitcoin wallets holding at least $100 have surged to record levels. Wallet addresses holding at least $100 have surged from 24 million in January 2024 to almost $30 million in January 2025, a 25% year-on-year increase. Spikes in wallets holding $100 have typically been recorded during bull runs and were also seen in 2017 and 2021. “This trend reflects an influx of new participants into the market, signaling renewed interest and optimism for the cryptocurrency.” Additionally, Bitcoin’s hashrate has also surged to an all-time high, crossing 800 exahashes per second in January 2025, up 33% since last year. Binance stated in its blog post, “Bitcoin’s hashrate has recently reached an all-time high, surpassing the combined computing power of tech giants such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, which together contribute less than 1% of Bitcoin’s total network capacity.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) faces a stubborn resistance level of around $107,000 as buyers struggle to build momentum.

Buyers made another attempt to push above $107,000 on Friday as BTC reached an intraday high of $107,038.

Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is catching investors’ attention with its low-cost presale price of $0.0420 and predictions that it might outshine Shiba Inu (SHIB) in this bull run. Crypto experts say the token will see over 50,000% growth in Q1 2025. Crypto Experts Pick WallitIQ (WLTQ) Over Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) concluded 2024 with high hopes, but its performance has stumbled entering 2025. Trading at $0.00002058 as of January 21, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) value has fallen short of the community’s aspirations to reach $0.00005. Hence, crypto experts move on to WallitIQ (WLTQ), a $0.0420 token poised to skyrocket 50,000% shortly. Crypto experts note a steady reduction in whale activity for Shiba Inu (SHIB), with major holders selling portions of their holdings and joining the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale. Due to its remarkable growth potential, the AI token is becoming traders’ and investors’ go-to Shiba Inu (SHIB) alternative. Crypto experts predict the token could grow by over 50,000% in Q1 2025. Additionally, its affordable price allows investors to accumulate substantial holdings with relatively small capital. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has already experienced significant price appreciation. The token has grown about 147.06% from its first presale stage price of $0.0171, and early investors are now enjoying 261% gains. What Sets WallitIQ (WLTQ) Apart Many crypto experts have noted that while SHIB’s value is tied to speculative hype, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is underpinned by a solid platform and features that enhance its long-term viability. The AI token is the native coin of a project designed to revolutionize user interaction with cryptocurrencies. The evolved DeFi wallet behind the token focuses on delivering practical value to users. It addresses real-world challenges in the DeFi community. Crypto experts have named the DeFi wallet the most secure crypto wallet in the market. This is unsurprising as the wallet employs multiple layers of security, including an AI anomaly detector , biometric authentication, and a rigorous audit of one of its smart contracts by a top auditing firm, SolidProof. The MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management App was recently launched. This advanced crypto wallet combines real-time cryptocurrency price tracking powered by the CoinGecko API, interactive candlestick charts for market insights, and an intuitive interface for managing ETH and USDT wallets. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) DeFi wallet app makes transactions hassle-free, generating QR codes for each wallet address to complete transactions in a scan. The wallet supports trading across 1,500 cryptocurrencies and allows users to pay transaction fees directly from their wallets using its native token. WallitIQ (WLTQ) also incentivizes user engagement, offering staking rewards of up to 180% APY, referral bonuses, and other special features and rewards. The token’s low-cost presale price of $0.0420 has attracted many crypto experts who understand the value of this new token even in its early stages. The token’s CoinMarketCap listing has further solidified its credibility in the crypto market. Many investors eagerly anticipate its listing on major exchanges very soon. The Gateway To Financial Freedom Crypto experts unanimously agree that WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the token to watch in 2025. One of the token’s most appealing features is that it is in the early stages. Even then, it has already grown by 147.06%. Crypto experts believe that it has the potential to surpass Shiba Inu (SHIB) and multiply by over 50,000% in Q1 2025. As Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) path to $0.00005 faces significant roadblocks, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers a better opportunity to build wealth in this bull run. This new AI token is more than just a token; it is your gateway to financial freedom. Act now, and join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale before it’s too late.

This action triggered other altcoins like XRP, which saw a 40% rally due to the meme coin’s momentum. However, an emerging crypto in its viral presale has raised over $7.4 million, and holders expect a 100x rally post-launch. Find out why investors are backing this new crypto to outpace XRP in 2025. XRP's Price Steady Above $3 Amid Ripple Ecosystem Developments The XRP price has remained above $3 recently due to developments in the Ripple ecosystem and the positive sentiment in the broader crypto market. Notably, Bloomberg stated that the CME Group would start offering future ETFs for XRP and Solana by February 10, indicating optimism about institutional investment. CME Group's involvement is essential for XRP as a prominent derivatives trading platform. Source: CoinMarketCap Due to these developments, the XRP price stays stable between $3 and $3.20 as the market awaits clearer signals for larger moves. A sharp reduction in XRP's exchange supply also supports the positive outlook. Over 100 million XRP worth $300 million have moved from Binance wallets to cold storages since Jan 16, a move that signals long-term bullish sentiment. Experts highlight that growing utility will push the XRP price to $10 by Q2 2025, making it a top pick for high yields. Trump Coin Drops to $25, but Analysts Predict a Return to $75 Trump Coin (TRUMP) is trading at $25 today, reflecting a 25% drop in value over the past week. Despite the recent dip, TRUMP has seen impressive growth on the all-time chart, with gains of 300% since its launch—a surge that propelled its price from $7 to an all-time high of $75. Source: CoinMarketCap In the last few days, Trump Coin has recorded a modest 10% increase, even as debates continue about its impact on the crypto market. Critics argue that the rise of politically themed assets like Trump Coin may pose risks to the industry's long-term stability. However, some analysts remain optimistic about the future of TRUMP. They believe that positive regulatory developments and the continued influence of Donald Trump’s brand could drive its price back to its ATH of $75, making it a coin to watch closely in the coming months.

This comment, made during a 2009 email exchange between Nakamoto and developer Mike Hearn, sheds light on Ripple’s early significance in the blockchain space. Satoshi Nakamoto’s View on Ripple The email, dated April 12, 2009, reveals Nakamoto’s recognition of Ripple as a standout system. Hearn shared his excitement about Ripple and what it was building. Nakamoto wrote, “Ripple is interesting in that it’s the only other system that does something with trust besides concentrate it into a central server.” SATOSHI NAKAMOTO, FOUNDER OF BITCOIN IN 2009: ""RIPPLE IS THE ONLY SYSTEM THAT DOES SOMETHING WITH TRUST BESIDES CONCENTRATING IT INTO A CENTRAL SERVER."" #XRP THE NUMBER 1 DIGITAL ASSET MADE IN AMERICA! pic.twitter.com/gXxfhk3EnP — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) January 24, 2025 This acknowledgment from Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator emphasizes Ripple’s innovative model, which differs from centralized systems by distributing trust across a decentralized network. Amelie’s post highlights the importance of Nakamoto’s observation, aligning it with XRP’s reputation as a groundbreaking digital asset. Nakamoto’s recognition of XRP was also highlighted in a recent list shared by a crypto expert to fight FUD and misinformation from Bitcoin maximalists in the XRP ecosystem. Ripple’s Decentralized Model Ripple’s core innovation lies in its consensus mechanism, which provides an alternative to centralization while maintaining trust and efficiency. Unlike the Bitcoin proof-of-work model, Ripple relies on validators to ensure transaction accuracy. This design has drawn comparisons to Nakamoto’s vision for decentralized networks, as Ripple eliminates the need for a single controlling entity. While some have questioned XRP’s decentralization, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz continues to counter this claim. He once described it as incredibly stupid . This recognition further solidifies XRP’s decentralized nature. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Nakamoto’s acknowledgment of Ripple’s decentralized trust model also suggests its potential to coexist alongside Bitcoin, offering complementary use cases. Ripple’s primary focus on cross-border payments and institutional adoption has further differentiated it in the cryptocurrency space. XRP’s Growing Relevance Amelie’s post highlights growing enthusiasm within the XRP community for the asset’s unique attributes. The efforts of Ripple and XRP to comply with regulations both in the U.S. and abroad, the digital asset’s energy efficiency, and strategic partnerships strengthen its standing in the crypto ecosystem. As highlighted by Amelie, Nakamoto’s recognition of Ripple’s distinct model reaffirms its relevance in the decentralized financial landscape. Ripple has positioned itself as a transformative force in the crypto industry, by addressing trust without relying on centralization. According to Amelie, this has made XRP the number one made-in-America digital asset. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Onyx is a fully decentralized protocol powered by the governance and utility token Onyxcoin (XCN). The primary reason behind this massive uptrend is the resolution of the long-standing issue with HTX Global and Justin Sun. Onyxcoin (XCN) Price Sees No Signs of Stopping Onyxcoin (XCN) has extended its rally to nearly 2000% in a month after an 800% surge in its price in just two weeks. XCN price is currently trading at $0.0467, up over 70% in the last 24 hours. The 24-hour low and high are $0.0263 and $0.04839, respectively. The trading volume has jumped immensely over the last week, with a 98% further jump in the past 24 hours. Notably, the trading volume increased to $1.60 billion today from just $100 million a week ago. XCN has even taken over XRP, SOL and even BTC in trading volume on Coinbase crypto exchange in the last 24 hours. Coinbase tops other crypto exchanges for XCN trading volumes, recording 38% of market share in terms of volumes. Furthermore, Onyxcoin (XCN) futures open interest also saw a 45% massive jump over the last 24 hours. As per Coinglass data , Bybit saw 46% increase in XCN futures open interest and signals a price rise further. Source: Coinglass Reasons Why Onyxcoin Saw Massive Gains For clarity, Onyxcoin or Onyx has no relation to banking giant JPMorgan. Onyx blockchain by JPMorgan was rebranded to Kinexys to distinguish it from unrelated entities and protocols in the crypto market. The massive pump recently in Onycoin (XCN) price came from the resolution of a dispute from the year 2022 related to XCN with Justin Sun and HTX Global. OIP-51 proposal was deployed passing which makes Sun and HTX part of the DAO, with XCN locked for 2 years and a public acknowledgment of the major news by Justin Sun. Moreover, Onyx has partnered with several platforms including blockchain infrastructure platform Chain. They announced a 30% discount for Chain clients who utilize Onyxcoin (XCN) for payments towards products. The decentralized Web3 platform also announced incentivizing running Onyx Core node operators with a proposal due early February. It said, “Preference will be given to those already running nodes at the time of the OIP and technical enough to operate a node with high uptime.” Onyxcoin (XCN) price also rallied as the platform offers gas refunds on staking, voting and rewards. OnyxDAO is on a major marketing push and an incoming proposal on a community burn initiative. The @onyxDAO is looking for feedback on a community burn initiative. Monthly, the DAO would analyse the burn wallet with AI and randomly choose a burn wallet, skewed by its tokens burned.

What sets # PEPETO apart from other meme tokens is the decentralized ecosystem. The meme token delegates power and decision-making to the community, making its community the backbone. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency token that set the foundation of the cryptocurrency market. This token continues to dominate as the leading cryptocurrency token in the space. BTC is pegged for a 10x gain before summer due to its massive investor adoption and as digital gold. With recent developments, governmental bodies regard this token as a means of legal tender, using it as a form of exchange, creating more value for the token. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is the second largest crypto token by market cap in the cryptocurrency market, making it one of the strongest tokens in the space. With the token built on a decentralized ecosystem and smart contract, the coin is pegged for a 10x gain before summer. With its massive adoption, just like BTC, Ethereum is well-positioned for massive growth. As investors continue to invest in ETH, the token may continue its bullish run, with the possibility of a 10x return by the summer, which will be a massive gain for investors and the market at large. PEPETO POTENTIAL AS A MEME TOKEN As the summer approaches, investors interested in making massive profits should buy the best meme coin, PEPETO. As a newly introduced token in the crypto space following its success and massive gains in its presale, it is forecasted to see a bullish run, gaining 10x profit over the summer. The presale stage of #Pepeto offers early investors the chance to buy the PEPETO tokens at a deeply discounted price of just $0.00000010. As the presale progresses, prices are likely to rise, creating the fear of missing out among investors who are eager to capitalize on this opportunity.

Nowadays, the crypto world operates at breakneck speed, with innovative projects like Lightchain AI aiming to deliver substantial returns much faster. Having gathered $13.1 million during its presale and with a token price set at $0.005625, Lightchain AI is emerging as a revolutionary force in the blockchain sector, drawing in investors who are keen on rapid financial growth. Bitcoin’s Initial Journey - A Gradual Route to Riches In its formative years, Bitcoin experienced slow beginnings with a gradual increase in value. Starting in 2009, it was mostly swapped among cryptography fans and held little financial worth. A notable milestone came in 2010 when Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer, bought two pizzas using 10,000 BTC, a sum that would be valued over $600 million by April 2021. By February 2011, Bitcoin matched the value of the U.S. dollar at $1.00. That year, it soared to approximately $31 but concluded around $3. Bitcoin's price continued to fluctuate, reaching about $13.50 by the end of 2012. These early ups and downs highlighted the cryptocurrency’s early stage and the market's hesitancy about its future possibilities. Lightchain AI - A Swift Path to Cryptocurrency Fortune Lightchain AI distinguishes itself in the crypto space by combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence. Its real-time AI-driven platform empowers businesses to perform complex calculations with ease, making it a versatile tool for sectors such as logistics, healthcare, and finance. This functionality has captivated the interest of significant institutional investors and large-scale traders. What really differentiates Lightchain AI is its presale triumph, having already secured $13.1 million. The platform’s ability to operate across multiple chains and its emphasis on scalability allow for smooth integration with existing systems, encouraging widespread use. For investors, Lightchain AI presents a chance to engage with a cutting-edge project with enormous potential for growth in a short span. Reasons Investors Are Backing Lightchain AI for Quick Returns Unlike Bitcoin's early phase where practical use was scarce, Lightchain AI offers tangible applications right from the start. Its developer-centric environment promotes creativity by offering resources and tools for crafting decentralized applications (dApps). This cultivates a dynamic community of developers, speeding up the platform’s growth and acceptance. Moreover, Lightchain AI’s sustainable tokenomics balance rewarding the network while ensuring long-term value retention. These aspects make it an appealing option for investors targeting significant returns swiftly, as its distinctive advantages meet the market's need for scalable, AI-enhanced blockchain technologies. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Today, the crypto market moves at lightning speed, with new projects like Lightchain AI promising to deliver exponential returns in a fraction of the time. With $13.1 million raised in its presale and a token price of $0.005625, Lightchain AI is positioned as a game-changer in the blockchain space, capturing the attention of investors eager for rapid growth. Bitcoin’s Early Years - Slow Path to Wealth Bitcoin's early years were marked by modest beginnings and gradual value appreciation. Launched in 2009, Bitcoin held negligible monetary value, primarily exchanged among cryptography enthusiasts. In 2010, the first real-world transaction occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas for 10,000 BTC, an amount that would surpass $600 million if held in April 2021. By February 2011, Bitcoin reached parity with the U.S. dollar, trading at $1.00. The same year, it experienced a surge to around $31 before ending the year near $3. This period of volatility continued, with Bitcoin reaching approximately $13.50 by the end of 2012. These early fluctuations underscored the cryptocurrency's nascent stage and the market's uncertainty about its potential. Lightchain AI - Fast-Track to Crypto Wealth Lightchain AI stands out in the crypto market for its unique blend of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. Its real-time AI-powered ecosystem allows businesses to execute complex computations efficiently, making it a versatile solution for industries like logistics, healthcare, and finance. This utility has attracted significant attention from institutional investors and whales alike. What truly sets Lightchain AI apart is its presale success, which has already raised $13.1 million. The platform’s multi-chain compatibility and focus on scalability ensure it can seamlessly integrate with existing networks, fostering broad adoption. For investors, Lightchain AI offers an opportunity to capitalize on an innovative project with massive growth potential in a condensed time frame. Why Investors Are Betting on Lightchain AI for Rapid Gains Unlike Bitcoin’s early days, where utility was limited, Lightchain AI comes equipped with practical applications from the outset. Its developer-focused ecosystem encourages innovation by providing tools and resources for building decentralized applications (dApps). This fosters a thriving community of contributors, accelerating the platform’s growth and adoption. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s sustainable tokenomics model balances ecosystem rewards with long-term value preservation. These features make it a compelling choice for investors seeking exponential returns in a short period, as the platform’s unique value propositions align with market demand for scalable, AI-integrated blockchain solutions. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

XRP investors are eyeing a potential 50% rise, while Propichain’s AI-powered real estate solutions could outpace XRP’s gains. Table of Contents XRP holders look forward to a massive rally in February Propichain: Solving Critical real estate investing problems with artificial intelligence Why Propichain could outpace XRP in 2025 XRP investors are gearing up for a potential 50% increase over the next few months as altcoin traders seek tokens with high return potential. Propichain has emerged as a formidable challenger as its AI investing solutions could transform the housing sector. Read on to see why analysts say Propichain could offer better returns than XRP. XRP holders look forward to a massive rally in February XRP has risen in recent weeks as Bitcoin ‘s new ATH dominates market headlines. The altcoin sector has been in the green zone since late Q4 2024, as top assets like XRP have risen to 2-year highs. XRP now trades at $3.19 after an 18.99% rise over the past seven days. Its 30-day chart also shows a 43.28% increase. In addition, analysts are optimistic about XRP’s growth due to the potential for pro-crypto laws under the Trump administration. This could create a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets, further driving demand and adoption. While XRP’s growth prospects are impressive, Propichain’s real estate ecosystem offers an exciting alternative, potentially generating higher returns due to its unique blend of blockchain and AI-powered tools for fractional property investments. Read more: Shiba Inu whales rotate into PropiChain, bet on its AI edge Propichain: Solving Critical real estate investing problems with artificial intelligence Propichain is the game-changer in the modern housing market arena. Its combination of complex blockchain technology and artificial intelligence makes it a new player that overcomes all the classical barriers that affect investors in the housing sector. Propichain aims to overcome these challenges while providing access to global housing investments. One of the greatest hindrances to participating in the housing sector is costliness. Over the years, many investors have shied away from this highly capital-intensive market, leaving most of the profits to an ultra-wealthy minority. However, Propichain solves this issue directly by bringing tokenization into its investment ecosystem. Propichain’s asset tokenization model allows investors to buy fractional shares of properties, democratizing access to high-value investments for individuals with smaller budgets. The ownership model further allows investors to earn rental income on the property fractions they own. These tokens can also be used as collateral to secure blockchain-based loans, providing additional financial flexibility. Propichain doesn’t just make investments affordable; it simplifies the process further with cutting-edge AI tools, enhancing investor confidence and decision-making. Propichain’s AI tools empower investors with real-time data, helping them to pinpoint promising deals through automated market analysis and property valuations. This removes a great deal of guesswork and some of the risks involved with traditional investing. Propichain’s AI tools also come with predictive analysis that consumes large amounts of data to help investors spot emerging opportunities. These AI tools help traders to better adapt to market fluctuations by making informed decisions that help maximize profit. Users can also leverage customizable search filters to further narrow down property searches, tailoring results to meet individual investment goals. Another important feature of Propichain’s AI tools is the auto-trading system. This service enables users to close housing deals using set conditions that act as triggers to buy or sell housing assets. These preset conditions could be certain price thresholds or ROI potential. When these conditions are achieved, trades are automatically executed, saving time and enhancing efficiency. Beyond AI-powered insights, Propichain extends its technological edge by leveraging metaverse tools to offer virtual property tours. By leveraging metaverse technology, Propichain introduces virtual property tours that give users an up-close view of desired housing assets without leaving their homes. These tours offer 3D visualization of properties, providing a more thorough and precise assessment. By bridging physical distances with virtual tours, Propichain allows investors to find more opportunities. Smart contracts form another cornerstone of the Propichain ecosystem. These smart contracts make cross-border transactions easier and more secure. Investors can also leverage Propichain’s smart contracts to build tailored agreements that suit their rental or leasing deals. Finally, the recent security audit by BlockAudit confirms that Propichain’s smart contracts meet high standards for safety and reliability. Why Propichain could outpace XRP in 2025 With its game-changing technology, Propichain is already drawing attention from early investors, positioning itself for massive growth in the coming years. It goes beyond being a simple token to become a robust platform for real estate investment. This distinction positions Propichain as an attractive alternative to popular cryptocurrencies like XRP. Propichain has also been listed on CoinMarketCap, a move usually associated with long-term growth and stability. Many investors have flocked to Propichain’s ecosystem, seeking to capitalize on its strong growth potential. Its ongoing presale represents a unique opportunity to acquire PCHAIN tokens before its post-listing price boom. Propichain has already had quite some attention in the presale stage, having raised $2 million in token sales. Early birds have also already received substantial returns as round one investors received 208.17% as the presale entered its second round. Now trading at $0.011, round two of Propichain’s presale offers the opportunity to buy PCHAIN at one of its lowest-ever prices. Furthermore, buying now will help investors secure a 108.93% ROI when PCHAIN rises to its round three value of $0.023. PCHAIN will also get listed when its value jumps to $0.032. With predictions that PCHAIN could take a $2,000 investment to $100,000 in 2025, now is the best time to join its ongoing presale. For more on PropiChain, visit their website or online community .

With around 1 million new tokens being created every week, Armstrong argues that the traditional “allowlisting” approach, where each token is manually reviewed, is no longer sustainable. Instead, it advocates a “blocklist” model that leverages user reviews and automated on-chain data scans to help users identify high-quality tokens. Armstrong, speaking about the challenges of the exponential growth of the token creation process, said, “We need to rethink our listing process at Coinbase because we are currently creating ~1 million tokens per week and that number is growing. This is a high-quality problem, but it is no longer possible to evaluate each one individually.” He also emphasized that regulatory approval for each token is impractical, saying, “Regulators need to understand that applying for approval for each one is completely impractical at this point, they can’t evaluate 1 million tokens per week.” Related News: Binance Founder CZ Asked His Followers: Did They Profit or Lose from Bitcoin, BNB and Memecoins? Under the proposed “blocklist” system, Coinbase will focus on identifying and blocking malicious or fraudulent tokens rather than manually approving each one. This approach will rely on community-driven feedback, such as user reviews, and advanced automated tools to analyze on-chain data for transparency and security. Armstrong believes this change will enable users to make informed decisions while providing a safer trading environment. In addition to rethinking token listings, Armstrong also noted the ongoing integration of decentralized exchanges (DEX) with centralized exchanges (CEX). He envisions a future where users will no longer need to distinguish between trading on a DEX or CEX, as the lines between the two continue to blur. “We will continue to integrate native DEX support more deeply. Customers should not need to know or care whether the transaction is happening on a DEX or CEX,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Notably, these will have zero capital gains tax, while others not based in the U.S. must pay approximately 30% capital gain tax. Encouraging Crypto Innovation Through Tax Incentives This claim suggests that these projects in the U.S. will not pay capital gain tax, which serves as an incentive for investors in the industry. This could encourage investment in these U.S.-linked crypto projects. Analysts say, if true, this might indicate the new policy direction of the new administration to encourage U.S.-based blockchain innovation. Such a policy could influence investment decisions as more investors shift towards these “zero capital gains tax” entities to the disadvantage of foreign-origin cryptos. Ted Cruz Targets IRS Rule and Centralized Crypto Policies Meanwhile, a report states that Senator Ted Cruz would introduce a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn an existing IRS rule on crypto tax. The IRS rule requires DeFI brokers to provide user data, including their names and addresses, and report gross proceeds. Many who oppose the IRS rule, including Cruz, maintain that it compromises user privacy, hinders innovation, and complicates tax reporting. This is particularly due to the decentralized nature of the crypto space. The Texas lawmaker, a crypto enthusiast, argues that the rule specifically targets the DeFi sector. Cruz has also been vocal against the Central Bank of Digital Currency (CBDC), preferring decentralized alternatives such as Bitcoin. Political commentators believe Cruz’s move could gain support given that Republicans dominate Congress. Additionally, the submission is within 60 days, as stipulated in the guidelines that allow for an overturn of a regulation. Ripple Case and SEC Leadership Crypto analysts consider this a sign of a favorable move for the industry. Given the pro-crypto stance of the President Donald Trump-led administration, the crypto sector may see policies that allow it to thrive and innovate. Many stakeholders look forward to a notable case between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple . Although the SEC recently filed another lawsuit on an earlier ruling, many hope for a more crypto-friendly regulation with the new SEC chair, Paul Atkins .

Current data shows that over 170k ETH have moved to exchanges, a sign that investors are losing faith in Ethereum (ETH). On the other hand, analysts forecast the value of IntelMarkets (INTL) might surge to $1 after it has impressed investors with a rally of 810%. IntelMarkets is an AI coin that seeks to revolutionize crypto trading using advanced tools and trading bots. Also, the value of Shiba Inu (SHIB) might rally to $0.000051863. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Could Pump To $0.000051863 Soon Shib Spain told his followers in a recent tweet that the Shiba Inu coin is looking bullish after multiple retests of the $0.00002 resistance. The analyst noted that the memecoin is getting prepared for a potential bounce to higher levels. Another expert called Solberg Invest forecasts the value of Shiba Inu (SHIB) might rally to $0.000051863. In the meantime, this memecoin’s price has declined by 9.5% in the weekly timeframe. The Shiba Inu crypto has been consolidating between $0.00001966 and $0.00002485. Looking ahead, the token has a major resistance at the 50-SMA ($0.00002410). Technical indicators like the Williams Percent Range (14) and Stochastic Fast (14) are in the buying territory. These indicators support an uptrend in the coming weeks. In other news, the number of Shiba Inu tokens burnt has dropped by 48% in the past week. This fall in burn mechanism reveals a drop in trading activity which is bearish. 170K Ethereum (ETH) Moved To Crypto Exchanges According to data from Santiment, there has been a massive increase in selling pressure for the Ethereum crypto. Ali Martinez who quoted information from the platform revealed that over 170k ETH has been moved to exchanges in the last three days. This move has affected the price of the Ethereum coin. CoinMarketCap price information shows the value of the altcoin has been consolidating between $3.1k and $3.5k in the past week. This poor price movement has caused investors to turn to more promising altcoins like IntelMarkets which has given holders up to 810% returns. Looking ahead, Crypto Caesar says the value of Ethereum (ETH) might rally to $13,500 in the coming months. The analyst believes Trump’s World Liberty Financial current ETH accumulation is a good sign. Meanwhile, technical analysis shows the Ethereum token is under bearish pressure. The relative strength index is below 50. Why The IntelMarkets (INTL) Token is a Must-Have Coin in 2025 IntelMarkets (INTL) is a new-generation trading system that utilizes AI and blockchain to transform the cryptocurrency trading market. Meanwhile, the native token of the platform is INTL, which has a significant function in the system. Token holders get to enjoy lower trading fees, voting rights in the platform’s operations, and early access to new features. The cryptocurrency ICO of INTL has been very successful and early investors have made up to 810% profits. Also, IntelMarkets has attracted a lot of attention, raising over $7.3 million. Currently priced at $0.082455, the INTL coin is a good cryptocurrency to buy for massive gains in the coming months. IntelMarkets provides dual-chain capabilities, which means it works on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains. This dual-chain structure gives the users an option to decide between Ethereum’s rich DeFi network and Solana’s fast and cheap transactions. IntelMarkets also presents AI-driven trading bots that allow users to set definite trade objectives. The bots carry out trades that are in line with these goals, making it easy for both small and big traders to trade.

But, after its growth, investors are now looking for alternative opportunities with higher upside potential. An AI blockchain project, IntelMarkets (INTL) , has emerged as one of SHIB whales’ recent favorite investments, with over $7.3 million raised in presale and their bid for a place among the top players in crypto trading. IntelMarkets (INTL): Redefining AI-Powered Crypto Trading In the most recent development in the AI-DeFi revolution, IntelMarkets (INTL) aims to disrupt the $36 billion global crypto trading market with advanced technology. Unlike the less dynamic conditions of traditional exchanges, IntelMarkets has actually incorporated AI at each stage that enables users to obtain profit from automatic algorithms of self-learning, equipped to the millions in the live-time data. The project was developed by MIT and Open AI alumni, who have shown expert talent while creating the Intell-M trading bots. The trading advantage comes from this unique approach, which grants retail traders access to institutional-grade trading tools that, until now, have only been available to hedge funds and large institutions. The entry price in the INTL presale is an attractive $0.082, and IntelMarkets industry experts shared that the post-launch price is expected to soar to 75x. It’s this potential for exponential growth that makes many SHIB investors want to get themselves into INTL to get higher returns and sustainability in the long term. Shiba Inu Price: A Once-Hot Meme Coin Now Struggling for Relevance Shiba Inu (SHIB) enjoyed an earth-shattering ascent over the 2021 bull run, with its fan base bolstered by reach from social media and mass community involvement. In October 2021, SHIB became the life changer as the Shiba Inu reached its ATH of $0.00008845. But it hasn’t panned out too well in this market cycle. The Shiba Inu price is down by a hefty 76.7% from its All-Time High, trading at $0.00002061 at the time of writing. The SHIB token has had some short-term gains, with a 3.50% increase in the Shiba Inu price today and now a market cap of $12.14 billion, but the questions of its long-term prospects remain. With the impending launch of Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution that promises to cut transaction fees and speed up transactions dramatically, SHIB was set to reignite the interest and Shiba Inu price it has garnered over the years. But the project’s hype has faded into the background and those seeking something more substantial than a meme coin are turning towards something with real world utility and credible fundamentals. This pivot has the potential to bring up the Shiba Inu price, especially with the launch of ShibOS. This has driven Web3 adoption in the SHIB community, as experts predict that the Shiba Inu price could rise to $0.00003217 during the next cycle. Is IntelMarkets the Smartest Investment Choice for 2025? SHIB is a growing favorite with meme coin fans, but as a popular choice for a considerable increase in the Shiba Inu price, it grows scarcer. With the AI-powered blockchain project of IntelMarkets becoming more popular, investors now have a much more promising alternative that provides both innovation and profitability. With $7.3 million in presale funding and an ambitious road map, there are indications that IntelMarkets will be a success over the long haul.

Meanwhile, DTX Exchange, a $0.16 altcoin, is quickly gaining attention after achieving 700% growth in its presale. Investors are closely watching its hybrid protocol and rising token sales, which have already raised $12.8 million. As the market evolves, understanding these developments is crucial. In this article, we will discuss the growth of SUI, XRP, and the explosive potential of DTX Exchange . SUI: Built for Speed and Scalability In the world of blockchain, speed isn’t just nice to have, it’s essential. That’s where SUI comes in. It’s designed to process a huge number of transactions quickly, with almost no delays. Unlike other platforms that handle transactions one by one, SUI uses a unique method to process them in parallel. This makes it faster than many of its competitors. But SUI isn’t just about being fast. It’s also built to make life easier for developers. The platform provides tools and a system that developers from around the world are finding easy to use. Imagine a small team in Latin America creating an app to improve the gig economy. With SUI, they can make that idea happen without worrying about slow networks or scaling problems. Recent improvements to SUI’s protocol have made it even stronger. It’s now even better at handling complex decentralized apps while staying fast and secure. For businesses, this means they can grow without worrying about performance issues. DTX Exchange Surges with 600% Growth As SUI competes in the battle of Layer 1 blockchains, another project, DTX Exchange, is making big waves. In 2025, DTX is expected to grow quickly thanks to its unique hybrid protocol. Since its launch a few months ago, the value of its token has already risen by 600% during the presale. Now in Stage 8, each token is priced at $0.16. So far, over 170 million tokens have been sold, raising $12.8 million. Ripple’s XRP Drops 3% as Bulls Lose Momentum Ripple’s XRP fell by 3% during early trading on Friday. On-chain and technical data show that buyers are losing strength. Short-term holders of XRP appear to be selling, with investors taking over $500 million in profits. Despite positive news, such as former President Donald Trump signing an executive order to create a Presidential Working Group on digital assets, XRP showed no signs of recovery. The market’s weakness may also be due to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) clarifying that it hasn’t decided to launch XRP futures contracts. This news disappointed many in the XRP community, who had hoped the launch would support possible SEC approval of XRP ETFs. As a result, XRP remained in a consolidation phase. Short-term holders appeared to be selling, as shown by increases in dormant circulation over the past 90, 180, and 365 days. In addition, XRP’s open interest (OI) , the total value of outstanding contracts in the derivatives market has decreased. OI dropped from an all-time high of 2.34 billion XRP to 2.14 billion XRP, suggesting that traders are closing their positions. DTX Exchange: A Fast and Versatile Hybrid Trading Platform DTX Exchange combines the benefits of both decentralized and centralized exchanges into a single hybrid platform. This approach makes trading more accessible and convenient for users. The platform supports 120,000 financial assets, including cryptocurrencies, tokenized ETFs, stocks, bonds, and forex. DTX also offers leverage, making it an attractive option for high-stakes traders aiming to maximize their profits. The exchange is built on the VulcanX blockchain, which can handle over 200,000 transactions per second. This speed gives DTX an edge over blockchains like Cardano, allowing traders to act on opportunities instantly.

Notably, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has dropped another bullish prediction on Dogecoin suggesting the token’s potential register a 10,000% price gain. Related Reading: Think Dogecoin Has Topped Out? Two Factors That Say ‘No Way’ Could Dogecoin Repeat Bullish Feat? In a recent post on X, Martinez shared a positive analysis of Dogecoin based on historical price data. According to the crypto pundit, DOGE experienced a 10,000% price gain in the last bull cycle in 2021. During this period, the memecoin’s value increased from around $0.007 to $0.700 within 98 days. Looking at DOGE’s current trading chart, the cryptocurrency presents a similar situation to when the price surge began in 2021. Martinez’s predictions indicate if Dogecoin is able to mirror such robust bullish movement, it could attain a market price of $14.78 by May 2025. As earlier stated, bullish sentiments around Dogecoin are currently heightened creating significant potential for this highly favorable scenario. A substantial portion of this positive market sentiment is centered around the possibility of a Dogecoin Spot ETF. Amidst the many developments in the past week, prominent asset manager Bitwise has filed a proposal for a “Bitwise Dogecoin ETF” to the Division of Corporation, US Department of State, Delaware. NewsBTC reports that Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has also confirmed the authenticity of the proposed DOGE Spot ETF which “is likely coming soon”. Interestingly, Ali Martinez previously predicted the Dogecoin spot ETF can serve as a positive market driver pushing DOGE’s prices to around $15 in line with his most recent price forecast. These projections are based on the nature of the Spot ETF which is designed to attract institutional demand as seen with Bitcoin. Related Reading: Still Waiting For An Altcoin Season? These Metrics Show Why It Might Never Happen DOGE Price Overview At press time, Dogecoin is valued at $0.354 after a 1.72% gain in the past day. On the other, its daily trading volume is down by 30.09% indicating decreasing investor activity. On larger timeframes, DOGE reflects an 11.43% loss on its 7-day chart but an impressive 13.96% profit on its monthly chart indicates an overall positive performance In recent weeks. For short-term traders, a crypto analyst with X username Kev_Capita_TA believes Dogecoin may be entering an upward consolidation phase that is likely to last till early February. During this period, the market expert warns it is important for market bulls to avoid a price breakdown as DOGE could potentially fall as low as $0.26. Dogecoin, with a market cap of $52.43 billion, holds the title of the largest memecoin and is the seventh-largest cryptocurrency globally.

This marks the very first time he has had a direct role in narrating his experience. Known for creating what was dubbed “the Amazon for Drugs,” the Silk Road facilitated hundreds of millions in illegal sales, leading to a dramatic FBI manhunt and his 2013 arrest at a San Francisco library. Ulbricht was later sentenced to two life terms plus 40 years for his role in the site’s operation. From Prison to Pardon In an unexpected turn, Ulbricht was pardoned by US President Donald Trump and released from federal prison on January 21st. The pardon, fulfilling a pledge Trump made at the Libertarian National Convention last May, has been welcomed by the crypto community which has rallied behind Ulbricht. Now free, Ulbricht collaborated with filmmakers to provide a firsthand account of his journey, reflecting on the creation of the Silk Road, its downfall, and the implications of his case, as per the latest reports . Since his 2015 conviction, Ulbricht avoided media interviews, maintaining a low public profile despite intense interest in his case. Behind the scenes, however, filmmakers Jonah Tulis and Blake J. Harris began compiling Ulbricht’s story in 2019, recording over 60 hours of interviews. Their efforts are now culminating in a nearly completed documentary set to debut in 2025, with Submarine taking charge of both production and global distribution. Media Attention Over the Years The media has revisited Ulbricht’s story on several occasions. In November 2020, CBS aired a documentary titled The FBI Declassified: The Dangerous Journey on the Silk Road, offering an in-depth look at the FBI investigation that dismantled the dark web marketplace. The documentary included an exclusive interview with Julia Vie, Ulbricht’s former girlfriend. Vie painted a contrasting image of Ulbricht, asserting that he was not motivated by wealth and reportedly did not even own a car while denying that he was a drug pusher. In 2021, Ulbricht’s story was brought to the silver screen with the release of ‘Silk Road,’ a film directed by Tiller Russell and starring Nick Robinson. Since Ulbricht’s release from federal prison, donations have steadily poured in to support him. For instance, the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken made a sizeable contribution of $111,111. Data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that his wallet has received a total of 2.78 BTC, which is worth approximately $288,270, including Kraken’s donation.

Dogecoin: A meme to major cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative in the crypto world, featuring a Shiba Inu meme logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin has no cap, with 10,000 new coins produced every minute. Initially seen as a joke, its value skyrocketed in 2021, joining the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market value surpassing $50 billion. This rise was driven largely by social media and figures like Elon Musk. The creation of Dogecoin by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer illustrates how community and social media can influence financial markets. While still playful in spirit, Dogecoin has demonstrated resilience and significant market engagement, making it a noteworthy player in the crypto landscape. Conclusion As the bull run unfolds, coins like DOGE show less short-term potential. Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero, offering a 700% ROI during its presale from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages. With governance, incentives, and staking features, it unites crypto enthusiasts to fight for financial freedom and overcome outdated systems.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong – who just met with numerous world and business leaders at the World Economic Forum conference in Switzerland – says that the “floodgates are opening” for the digital assets industry as blue-chip investors express their intention to boost their crypto presence.. “Corporate leaders – banks, asset managers, payment services firms, etc – made clear that they are all accelerating investments in crypto. Crypto allocations are going to go up, as are their efforts to build on the blockchain. There are going to be more players and competition than ever in crypto and we welcome it all. We need crypto to update the entire global financial system to bring these benefits to everyone.” According to Armstrong, President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance – including the possibility of creating a national Bitcoin ( BTC ) and crypto reserve – has forced others to “up their game.” He also noted that Trump, crypto and artificial intelligence (AI) were the most discussed topics at the conference. “President Trump is forcing everyone to up their game. Basically, every conversation I had with major market leaders was focused on what the Trump Admin planned to do on crypto – eg on a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve – and how they can avoid being left behind. As the company best positioned to help governments create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (through our custody and trading services), these were valuable touch points.” Last week, Trump signed an executive order to study the potential impact of establishing a national Bitcoin and crypto stockpile. Entitled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” the order creates a new working group that will coordinate and propose a unified regulatory approach to crypto within six months.

Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could gain more attention as a Layer-2 solution that potentially enhances Bitcoin’s ecosystem with DeFi, NFTs, and AI-powered applications. Now, let’s take a closer look at PEPE’s potential path to $2, its technical analysis, and see what could potentially be in store for PlutoChain. Can Pepe Coin (PEPE) Reach $2? Technical Charts and Price Movements Give Us a Glimpse Pepe Coin (PEPE) is currently hovering around the $0.000015 mark with a 2.5% increase in the last 24 hours. From a technical standpoint, PEPE recently dropped below key support levels, with some users identifying $0.00001100 as the next major buy zone. While short-term volatility remains a factor, a recovery above resistance could trigger a strong upward move. Traders are closely monitoring the RSI and volume trends, which indicate a possible trend reversal. Pepe Coin (PEPE) has been actively enhancing its ecosystem through various developments and strategic partnerships. The project has introduced advanced features, including a zero-fee cross-chain bridge and an exchange tailored for next-generation memecoins, aiming to increase utility and user engagement. Additionally, PEPE has been exploring collaborations to expand its reach and functionality within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. AlchemistOG69 predicts that 1 billion PEPE could soon be worth between $60,000 and $85,000, which reinforces the idea that PEPE has room for significant price appreciation. Meanwhile, Trader Haris highlights the recent breakdown but points to a potential recovery if PEPE reclaims its key levels. These projections suggest that despite short-term corrections, PEPE could be setting up for a major surge. PlutoChain Could Be the Most Promising Layer-2 for Bitcoin and Expand Its Use Cases and Functionalities PlutoChain could redefine what Bitcoin’s Layer-2 solutions can achieve. While many Layer-2 networks focus solely on scalability, PlutoChain may introduce decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and AI-powered applications directly into Bitcoin’s ecosystem. PlutoChain could bring new technological opportunities while preserving Bitcoin’s core decentralization and security. One of PlutoChain’s most impressive features is its seamless cross-chain interoperability. With full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility , Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps) could migrate effortlessly onto Bitcoin’s network. This means developers may access Bitcoin’s liquidity while still leveraging the smart contract flexibility that Ethereum offers. PlutoChain could pave the way for greater blockchain interoperability and efficiency by potentially bridging these two major ecosystems. Beyond its cross-chain capabilities, PlutoChain is built for speed and reliability. The network processes 43,200 transactions per day and boasts ultra-fast 2-second block times. Unlike Layer-1 networks that often struggle with congestion and high fees, PlutoChain’s optimized architecture might ensure smooth and efficient performance. Security remains a top priority, as PlutoChain has successfully completed rigorous audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , which reinforces trust in its infrastructure. Final Thoughts Pepe Coin (PEPE) continues to gain momentum, with some users pointing to its meme dominance, strong community backing, and increasing activity as potential drivers for a surge to $2. Meanwhile, PlutoChain could become a Layer-2 solution that potentially extends Bitcoin’s utility beyond transactions. With its high-speed transactions, cross-chain interoperability, and security-focused design, PlutoChain might play a major role in shaping the future of BTC and decentralized applications. – – – This article does not offer financial advice.

In the bustling world of cryptocurrency, where investors are always searching for the next big hit, emerges Web3Bay (3BAY) . This remarkable cryptocurrency combines the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi) with the ever-expanding e-commerce industry. It emerges as an attractive option for investors looking for a stable and utility-based alternative to the usual meme coin frenzy, driven by hype and volatility. What Makes Web3Bay Unique? Web3Bay transcends the typical digital currency; it underpins a decentralized e-commerce platform that revolutionizes online buying and selling. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that centralize control, Web3Bay uses blockchain technology to enhance transaction transparency, security, and user autonomy. With its token, 3BAY, Web3Bay integrates flexible cryptocurrency payments with secure blockchain technology, creating a user-friendly and safe global marketplace. Since its launch, Web3Bay has shown significant potential in its presale stages, raising an impressive $920K, and is now in its fourth phase. The token began at just $0.003 and has risen to $0.004562, demonstrating robust growth in a brief period. This trend signals strong investor confidence and suggests potential for substantial price growth once the platform fully launches and gains wider recognition. Web3Bay’s Technological Advantage Web3Bay’s tech infrastructure features a blend of blockchain layers, smart contracts, and decentralized storage options like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), providing a scalable and secure setting. This system not only handles large volumes of transactions swiftly but also secures a seamless user experience by integrating well with popular crypto wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have built their reputation on community support and viral marketing, they lack the practical utility that Web3Bay offers. Both started more as cultural phenomena than serious cryptocurrencies, thriving on speculative trading and social media buzz. Conversely, Web3Bay brings practical use by enabling e-commerce transactions within a decentralized system, adding genuine value to its token and fostering a stable growth path. Market Potential and Benefits for Users The e-commerce sector is poised for a shake-up through blockchain innovation. Web3Bay’s platform serves a worldwide market, enabling users from any location to engage in commerce without traditional banking barriers. The platform also rewards active participation and engagement via the 3BAY token, offering purchase discounts, community rewards, and governance through a DAO model, cultivating a devoted user base and continuous platform activity. As Web3Bay continues to evolve and broaden its services, the prospect of 3BAY achieving 10x returns becomes more tangible, especially when compared to meme coin alternatives. With the platform’s trajectory and strategic market position, an initial $1,000 investment in 3BAY tokens could potentially multiply tenfold within a year, considering the platform’s growing user base and enhanced functionality. Ensuring Security and User Governance Web3Bay prioritizes security, employing thorough smart contract audits and top-notch encryption to safeguard user transactions and data. Its governance structure is community-led, with token holders voting on key proposals, enhancing user trust and empowerment. This decentralized approach aligns with blockchain’s foundational principle of democratizing influence. Looking forward, Web3Bay plans to integrate Layer-2 scaling solutions to support greater transaction volumes and reduce costs. Its roadmap includes more partnerships with major payment processors like PayPal and new features that bridge traditional finance and cryptocurrencies, likely boosting the platform’s growth and the 3BAY token’s value. Final Thoughts! With a robust tech foundation, practical utility, and a forward-thinking approach to decentralized e-commerce , Web3Bay distinguishes itself as an appealing investment opportunity that could outperform well-known yet less substantial cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. For those aiming to tap into the next significant crypto trend, Web3Bay presents a mix of stability, growth potential, and real-world usability, making 3BAY a top pick for strategic crypto investors.

39540912,https://nulltx.com/?p=141135,1737918038,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Breaking News: Justin Sun’s Proposal and Trump’s ETH Move Could Skyrocket Ethereum to $10,000 — Is the U.S. Behind This?",https://nulltx.com/the-breaking-news-justin-suns-proposal-and-trumps-eth-move-could-skyrocket-ethereum-to-10000-is-the-u-s-behind-this/,"Justin Sun, the controversial founder of TRON, recently sparked a heated debate in the crypto community with his vision for Ethereum. In a tweet, Sun outlined how he would propel Ethereum’s price to $10,000 if he were in charge of the Ethereum Foundation (EF) and the Ethereum ecosystem. His proposals aim to reshape Ethereum’s economic model, governance structure, and scalability strategy. These ideas come at a critical time, as the Ethereum Foundation faces scrutiny after selling 4,666 ETH—roughly $13 million—to fund its operational costs. On the other side, an ambitious project PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might enhance Bitcoin’s functionality by introducing smart contract capabilities to its secure network. This could transform Bitcoin from a simple store of value into a highly versatile platform. An Ambitious Four-Point Plan for Ethereum in the First Week These proposals emerge as the Ethereum Foundation faces scrutiny after selling 4,666 ETH — approximately $13 million — to cover operational costs. Sun emphasized four key initiatives for the first week, focusing on: Halting ETH sales and optimizing revenue Imposing strict taxation on Layer-2 solutions Streamlining the Ethereum Foundation’s operations Adjusting rewards and increasing fee burns The plan begins with an immediate stop to ETH sales by the Ethereum Foundation for at least three years, aiming to preserve supply, align the system with deflationary goals, and boost market trust. During the sales freeze, Sun proposes leveraging DeFi protocols like AAVE for loans, maximizing staking yields, and utilizing stablecoin loans to cover operational costs. A controversial element of the plan involves imposing substantial taxes on all Layer-2 projects built on Ethereum, with the goal of generating at least $5 billion in annual tax revenue. These tax revenues, collected in stablecoins or tokens, would be used to buy back ETH and completely decentralize its burning process. Sun also called for a drastic reduction in the Ethereum Foundation’s staff, retaining only the most capable team members. He envisions transforming the EF into what he describes as “a purely performance-based system that rewards results and efficiency.” Finally, he emphasized the need to focus more on fee-burning mechanisms while reducing node rewards. This would reinforce Ethereum’s deflationary nature and solidify its role as a reliable store of value. Sun predicts that with these decisive measures, ETH could surpass $4,500 within the first week of implementation and eventually reach $10,000. Implications of the Proposal The most controversial suggestion—taxing Layer-2 solutions—might stifle innovation and drive developers toward competing platforms. Moreover, restructuring the Ethereum Foundation by reducing its workforce could centralize decision-making power, which raises concerns about governance. Reducing node rewards could discourage validators from supporting the network, especially at a time when decentralization remains critical. Even though it is unlikely that Sun will take the reins of Ethereum, his bold proposals shed light on three central issues: A deflationary token economy to position ETH as a store of value Balancing efficiency and decentralization by streamlining the Ethereum Foundation’s operations Prioritizing Layer-1 scalability over Layer-2 solutions While Sun’s ideas may not align with Ethereum’s current direction or priorities, they raise important questions about scalability, governance, and value creation in an increasingly competitive crypto landscape. How PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Make Bitcoin Faster and Smarter Bitcoin’s slow transactions, high fees, and network congestion often limit its ability to meet modern blockchain needs. These issues come from its original design, which processes only a small number of transactions per second. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might offer a solution. This hybrid Layer-2 project could improve speed, lower costs, and expand Bitcoin’s capabilities without altering its core principles. It could act as a bridge between Bitcoin’s secure blockchain and the growing demand for faster, more flexible applications. One of Bitcoin’s main limitations is its 10-minute block time, which slows transaction processing significantly. PlutoChain addresses this by providing block times of just 2 seconds on its blockchain, which matches the speeds of Ethereum and Solana. By adding smart contracts, PlutoChain could open new possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and AI-powered applications. Its EVM compatibility could also make it easier for developers to adapt Ethereum-based projects for the Bitcoin ecosystem. On its testnet, PlutoChain reportedly handled 43,200 transactions daily without delays, suggesting it could be ready for real-world use. Security remains a priority, with audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , as well as regular stress tests and reviews, adding an extra layer of trust. The project’s governance model might allow users to influence its direction by proposing and voting on key decisions. With its focus on improving speed, scalability, and usability, PlutoChain might transform Bitcoin into a more versatile blockchain, supporting applications far beyond simple transactions. Final Thoughts Justin Sun’s bold plan for Ethereum definitely stirs the pot, offering plenty to think about when it comes to reshaping Ethereum’s governance and scalability. Ideas like halting ETH sales and imposing taxes on Layer-2 solutions are controversial, no doubt. While it’s unlikely these proposals will see the light of day anytime soon, they do raise some valid questions about Ethereum’s future. Can it stay competitive in an increasingly crowded crypto space? Only time will tell. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) , on the other hand, could bring a fresh approach to Bitcoin’s limitations. Tackling slow transactions, high fees, and scalability bottlenecks isn’t exactly a small task, but PlutoChain’s 2-second block times and smart contract functionality could open the door to new possibilities. ————— Remember, this article is not financial or trading advice.

Some believe Ripple may soar to $5 in the near future if current trends continue. Meanwhile, a fresh contender called Remittix is grabbing attention for its possibility of hitting 50x gains by April. Below, we explore how Ripple (XRP) and Remittix (RTX) stack up—and why many think Remittix could become the best pick among newcomers. Ripple’s Path Toward $5 Over the past month, Ripple has climbed by +39.77%, placing it back in the spotlight. The token, known as XRP, recently dipped -2.36% for the week but still shows daily growth of +4.25%. Investors say if big institutions keep supporting Ripple, hitting $5 might be easier than it seems. A friendlier regulatory climate also boosts the chance for a next big crypto breakout in this established token. Despite some hurdles, Ripple (XRP) remains favored by many crypto fans. They point to its strong network for global payments and ongoing legal successes. However, newer projects may offer better risk-reward ratios. That’s why an increasing number of traders are checking out Remittix, which aims to rival Ripple in cross-border transactions. Some predict it could quickly overshadow older coins if adoption surges. Remittix Poised for 50x Gains Looking beyond Ripple, some experts see Remittix as the next big crypto breakout thanks to its focus on low-fee remittances. The token, known as Remittix (RTX), targets people and businesses wanting cheaper money transfers worldwide. Since it addresses everyday problems, Remittix stands out from projects that rely mostly on hype. If it keeps drawing attention, it could be the top gainer in 2025. Early supporters claim Remittix can jump 50x by April. They say real-world utility makes Remittix (RTX) ideal for travelers, freelancers, and cross-border merchants who can’t afford high wire fees. This approach differs from how Ripple focuses on major banks. Because of that, some believe Remittix might bring faster returns. If more users adopt it, the surge could surpass anything seen with older coins. Why Remittix Could Outperform While Ripple already has institutional partnerships, Remittix chases a broader market of everyday users. By offering near-instant currency swaps and reduced fees, Remittix (RTX) may become a staple for those seeking fast, cost-effective transfers. Fans say this practical focus could push Remittix ahead, even if Ripple (XRP) reaches $5. This mass appeal might make Remittix the next big crypto breakout rather than just another altcoin. Moreover, Remittix arrives at a time when many are wary of tokens that promise big gains with no real plan. Observers praise Remittix (RTX) for having a clear mission—solving real payment problems. Although Ripple still shows promise, some investors want a coin that can climb rapidly from a lower base. With 50x growth predicted, Remittix might outperform older assets, making it a favorite among those seeking swift returns. Conclusion Whether Ripple hits $5 soon or not, a fresh opportunity lies in Remittix. Many see Remittix(RTX) tackling vital issues in cross-border finance, giving it a unique advantage. While Ripple (XRP) enjoys strong backing, Remittix might spark faster, more dramatic gains if user adoption grows as forecasted. For those hunting the next big crypto breakout, it could be the ultimate altcoin—ready to revolutionize global payments and possibly deliver outstanding profits in the coming months.

Some speculate that Ripple might leap to $5 soon if the current trends persist. Meanwhile, a new player called Remittix is catching attention for its potential to achieve 50x gains by April. We take a closer look at Ripple (XRP) and Remittix (RTX) to understand why many think Remittix could become the top choice among new contenders. Ripple’s Journey to $5 In the last month, Ripple has surged by +39.77%, putting it back in the limelight. Although XRP experienced a -2.36% decline over the week, it still boasts a daily increase of +4.25%. Investors believe that if major institutions continue to back Ripple, reaching $5 could be more achievable than it appears. A more favorable regulatory environment also enhances the prospects for the next significant crypto rise with this established token. Despite facing obstacles, Ripple (XRP) remains a favorite among many crypto enthusiasts. They highlight its robust network for global payments and recent legal victories. However, some newer projects might offer more attractive risk-reward ratios. This is why an increasing number of traders are turning their attention to Remittix, which aims to compete with Ripple in the realm of cross-border transactions. Some forecast it could quickly outshine older coins if its adoption rate increases. Remittix Set for 50x Gains Looking past Ripple, some analysts view Remittix as the upcoming major crypto breakout due to its emphasis on low-cost remittances. The token, known as Remittix (RTX), is aimed at individuals and businesses seeking affordable global money transfers. Since it tackles everyday issues, Remittix distinguishes itself from projects that mostly depend on hype. If it continues to attract interest, it could become the leading gainer in 2025. Early backers assert that Remittix could increase 50x by April. They argue that its real-world utility makes Remittix (RTX) perfect for travelers, freelancers, and cross-border merchants who cannot bear high wire fees. This strategy contrasts with Ripple’s focus on large banks. Consequently, some believe Remittix could deliver faster returns. If more users embrace it, the growth could exceed anything experienced with older coins. Why Remittix Might Outshine Others While Ripple already enjoys institutional partnerships, Remittix is targeting a wider market of everyday users. By providing near-instant currency swaps and reduced fees, Remittix (RTX) could become essential for those looking for quick, cost-efficient transfers. Supporters claim this practical focus might propel Remittix to the forefront, even if Ripple (XRP) achieves $5. This broad appeal may position Remittix as the next major crypto breakout rather than just another altcoin. Additionally, Remittix emerges at a time when many are cautious of tokens that promise substantial gains without a solid plan. Observers commend Remittix (RTX) for having a clear objective—addressing real payment challenges. Although Ripple still holds potential, some investors are seeking a coin that can rise swiftly from a smaller base. With a projected 50x growth, Remittix might outperform older assets, making it a popular choice among those looking for quick returns. Conclusion Whether Ripple reaches $5 soon or not, a new opportunity awaits with Remittix. Many view Remittix(RTX) as addressing crucial issues in cross-border finance, providing it with a distinct advantage. While Ripple (XRP) has strong support, Remittix could trigger faster, more dramatic gains if user adoption grows as expected. For those in search of the next significant crypto breakout, it might be the ultimate altcoin—poised to transform global payments and potentially offer significant profits in the coming months.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cardano faces bearish trends, while Remittix gains buzz with unique payments and a presale promising major potential. Table of Contents Cardano price analysis threat of $0.20 Remittix spells a new era for global payments Why RTX could be the investment opportunity of the year Cardano’s price analysis is always making the news in the constantly changing cryptocurrency space and for good reason. Being one of the top cryptocurrencies, Cardano’s success is a bellwether for the larger market as well as a standard for blockchain innovation. However, recent technical indications point to a potential storm cloud forming for ADA, with bearish patterns suggesting a substantial price decline. Remittix (RTX) , an upcoming phenomenon in the cryptocurrency world, is creating a buzz with its unique payment options and presale. Is this going to be the next big thing in online finance? Cardano price analysis threat of $0.20 Technical experts have long enjoyed studying Cardano’s price analysis and current trends are presenting an uncertain scenario. At $0.882, ADA established a double bottom earlier this month, which set off a bullish reversal that momentarily raised the price to $1.16. But the momentum was fleeting. At $1.152, a double-top pattern formed with the neckline anchored at a crucial support level of $0.882. The ominous atmosphere is heightened by the development of a bearish crossing between the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. Additionally, Cardano has dropped below the psychological $1 threshold, which has traditionally been a warning of future drops. The next stop, which is a 20% decline from the present levels, would be $0.762 if the price breaks $0.882. The long-term forecast for Cardano is still positive in spite of these obstacles. A bullish pennant formation on the weekly chart indicates that, if ADA maintains its position above $0.807, it may finally recover. A breakout above $1.326 could reignite momentum, potentially propelling the coin toward its all-time high of $3.15. For now, however, ADA bulls are in a fight for survival.

The ability to send out cryptocurrency payments that instantly convert into fiat currencies and deposit to recipients’ bank accounts is Remittix’s unique value proposition. Its crypto-to-fiat payment system combines the greatest aspects of decentralized finance with conventional payment methods. Thinking of sending $100 to a family member overseas using ETH? Through Remittix, that $100 arrives in their bank account without hidden fees or poor exchange rates. They won’t even know the transaction began as a crypto payment. This level of simplicity and transparency sets Remittix apart from competitors like Stripe, Wise and Coinbase Wallet, none of which allow for such a seamless crypto-to-fiat payment system. The RTX token, currently priced at $0.0350 during its presale, has already raised over $7 million. With forecasts predicting a 25x multiplier in the presale phase and 5,000% gains post-launch, Remittix is quickly capturing the imagination of investors. However, Remittix’s adaptability is what really makes it unique. The network, which supports more than 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies, enables people and businesses to transfer money internationally without the hassles of conventional methods. Freelancers, e-commerce sites and multinational corporations may all benefit from the Remittix Pay API’s simple method of accepting cryptocurrency payments while settling in fiat. With daily cross-border payment volumes exceeding $5 trillion, Remittix is positioning itself to capture a share of this $190 trillion industry. Its transparent, flat-fee model ensures that what you send is exactly what your recipient gets. This is a feature that could disrupt traditional banks and payment platforms plagued by hidden charges. Why RTX could be the investment opportunity of the year The possibility of enormous profits is causing just as much of the frenzy around Remittix as its cutting-edge features. In a market that is sometimes attacked for its lack of transparency, RTX is gaining credibility with team tokens and liquidity locked for three years, as well as a passing complete smart contract audit. As the presale aims to raise $36 million, the uniqueness of the project and its rapid traction suggest it could sell out within eight weeks. The coin will become even more accessible after launch by making its debut on Uniswap and other significant centralized exchanges. RTX makes an outstanding case for investors wishing to diversify beyond well-known currencies like Cardano and Ethereum . Its compelling combination of practical application and blockchain innovation in its crypto-to-fiat payment system is especially appealing in a sector that is desperate for change.

After establishing contact with Sinanian, the scammer was able to gain remote access to his computer, and then made it appear as if he had accidentally sent Sinanian $100,000 rather than $100. Over the course of 10 days, the scammer then persuaded Sinanian to withdraw $109,000 in cash from his bank accounts, stuff the cash into boxes of books and then ship the boxes to an unknown address in New York. Says Sinanian, “I don’t want to use profanities, but I was very unhappy I was stupid enough to continue.” Debra Stokes, executive director of the Georgia Council on Aging, a state-funded senior advocacy group, told ANF that “there are hundreds of cases like that across the county,” and thousands of reported cases statewide each year. In the its 2023 Elder Fraud Report , the FBI said that elders had lost $3.4 billion to scams alone, though the number most likely grossly underestimates the true scope of the problem. An 85-year-old woman’s life savings was recently drained by fraudsters posing as JPMorgan and the US government. Annette Manes, a widowed social worker, was a victim of a scheme that drained $1.4 million over the course of 279 days, but JPMorgan refused to reimburse her. Late last year, Françoise Schorosch fell victim to the “Hi dad” scheme where the scammers pose as an elderly person’s grandchild asking for help. In Schorosch’s case, hackers were able to access her emails while she was in the process of buying her first home. “I was sharing discussions about working with solicitors, surveyors and estate agents. I had been keeping him abreast of all of the financials, and getting his advice because this was my first purchase. I suspect that someone managed to access our email exchange and then reach out to him directly.” By using Schorosch’s email address – but with “email.com” instead of “gmail.com” – the fraudsters were able to contact her dad without raising suspicion, ultimately convincing him to wire €7,000 or about $9,100 from Deutsche Bank to a Nationwide bank account.

As usual, Saylor’s post normally signals an impending BTC purchase on the following Monday. MicroStrategy made its latest purchase on January 21, buying 11,000 BTC at an average cost of $101,191 per coin. According to Saylor Tracker, MicroStrategy has reserved 461,000 BTC, with a market value of about $48.4 billion, which exceeds the total Bitcoin holdings of the United States government. The company has continued to amass Bitcoin despite its fall from the recent all-time high of $108,786 on January 20, when American President Donald Trump mentioned the likelihood of including other digital assets in the United States strategic reserves. Trump’s order on digital asset stockpile draws mixed reaction On January 23, the US President signed an executive order strengthening America’s leadership in digital financial technology. The order established the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, which will be overseen by crypto and AI czar David Sacks. The executive order mandated that the Working Group explore and develop a “national digital asset stockpile” without mentioning Bitcoin. What followed the announcement was the drop in BTC prices from a daily high of $106,848 to a low of $101,233. The executive order was received differently within the crypto corridors as some people saw it as fulfilling President Trump’s promise during the campaigns. However, BTC maximalists were not impressed by the potential inclusion of other digital assets in the US strategic reserve. Bitcoin evangelist Max Keiser wrote in a January 26 X post: Trump has nothing to do with Bitcoin, but he can destroy America by embracing shitcoins. Max Keiser Ripple and XPR are the greatest obstacles to the US strategic Bitcoin reserve According to Pierre Rochard , the VP of research at mining company Riot Platforms, Ripple and XRP are the biggest hindrances to the strategic Bitcoin reserve. He absolved the Fed, banks, treasury, and even Elizabeth Warren. Rochard didn’t take it easy on Ripple, whom he accused of pushing the US government to adopt an approach of accommodating different altcoins in its strategic reserves rather than BTC alone. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse didn’t dispute the accusations. He stated that any digital asset reserve would also factor in Bitcoin . BTC traders are experiencing a limited short-term surge due to the possibility of a policy shift from a purely Bitcoin strategic reserve to a more diverse crypto reserve.

However, a crucial element could play a role in achieving this target. What is this element, and how could it influence Dogecoin's valuation? Alternatively, if Dogecoin doesn't meet this target, Panshibi ($SHIBI) , a new cryptocurrency memecoin, might offer lucrative opportunities for investors. Continue reading to discover more about $SHIBI and the latest updates that could impact DOGE's price. Dogecoin's recent surge sparks optimism for 2025 Dogecoin made waves recently when its value suddenly climbed on January 21.

Even though the logo was quickly removed, the price jump captured the interest of crypto enthusiasts. Many are now curious if DOGE remains one of the leading memecoins to consider for 2025. Elon Musk, a longstanding advocate of Dogecoin, heads D.O.G.E. His involvement has sparked speculation that more announcements could elevate the token's worth. Investors are closely monitoring any actions from Musk that may influence the DOGE’s price. Analysts like Ali Martinez suggest Dogecoin's price could climb significantly. They predict it might even exceed $1.4 if an exchange-traded fund (ETF) receives approval. This potential has ignited excitement among supporters who are optimistic about Dogecoin’s prospects. Several ETF submissions, including one from Bitwise, are waiting for the SEC's approval. If one gets approved, it could alter Dogecoin’s trajectory. The crypto community is keenly observing to see if Dogecoin will fulfill the expectations.

According to Brazilian media outlet Blocknews, the startup aims to use associated gas produced during oil extraction to power Bitcoin mining operations. The approach is expected to increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, aligning with the company’s transition to low-carbon solutions. The R&D project will cover multiple areas within Petrobras and external institutions, focusing on blockchain applications across the company’s value chain. Marcelo Curi, Application Champion and Deputy Coordinator led by Rodrigo Chaves, explained that the project’s goals include tokenization, developing new business models, and exploring consensus mechanisms beyond Bitcoin mining. The initiative brings together Petrobras’ Leopoldo Américo Miguez de Mello Research, Development and Innovation Center (Cenpes), Universidade Petrobras and Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) Ledger Labs. These collaborations aim to integrate blockchain technology into various aspects of Petrobras’ operations.

Russian oil company Gazpromneft has partnered with BitRiver to use electricity from oil operations for mining operations. Petrobras is testing blockchain technology in various projects. For example, it has partnered with GoLedger on a marketplace for biomethane. The company launched its first public blockchain initiative in late 2023 in partnership with the Cardano Foundation and issued 500 dynamic non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for employee training purposes. *This is not investment advice.

While Qubetics focuses on tackling the pressing issue of blockchain interoperability with cutting-edge solutions, Cardano’s missed ICO highlights its unconventional yet highly successful journey. Both projects exemplify why they are among the top crypto assets for investors seeking promising returns and robust innovation. Qubetics: Elevating Blockchain Interoperability and Security Interoperability is a cornerstone for the future of blockchain technology, yet its absence presents vulnerabilities such as double-spending attacks and data manipulation. Qubetics addresses these challenges head-on, emphasizing the need for robust security frameworks and best practices in cross-chain interactions. By prioritizing integrity and security, Qubetics creates a foundation of trust essential for the widespread adoption of blockchain-powered applications. At the heart of Qubetics’ ecosystem lies the $TICS token, which is making waves in the cryptocurrency community. In its 18th presale stage, Qubetics has already raised an impressive $10.8 million. With the token currently priced at $0.0551, over 441 million $TICS tokens have been purchased by 16,400 investors, showcasing strong community support and confidence in the project’s vision. Early adopters stand to benefit significantly, as the presale price is set to rise to $0.25 by its conclusion, delivering a remarkable 353.46% ROI. Beyond the presale, experts anticipate even greater rewards, forecasting post-launch values between $10 and $15 per token. This momentum positions Qubetics as one of the top crypto assets poised to revolutionize the blockchain industry. Cardano: A Missed ICO That Transformed into Success Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) served as a popular fundraising method in the early days of blockchain. However, Cardano took a different approach, bypassing a public ICO in favor of private funding rounds targeted at select investors, particularly in Asia. This decision left many retail investors unable to participate in Cardano’s early-stage funding. Despite this missed ICO opportunity, Cardano has grown into one of the most prominent names in the blockchain space. Its commitment to scientific research, rigorous peer-reviewed development, and layered architecture has set it apart as a scalability, security, and sustainability leader. Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, ADA , has delivered substantial returns for investors, proving that a missed ICO doesn’t equate to a missed opportunity for growth. Cardano’s innovative features, including its smart contract capabilities and ongoing advancements such as the Hydra scaling solution, continue to drive its adoption across various sectors. From decentralized finance (DeFi) to supply chain solutions, Cardano’s impact spans a wide array of real-world applications, reinforcing its status as one of the top crypto assets in the market. The Future of Blockchain Investment As blockchain technology matures, the demand for projects that tackle scalability, security, and interoperability will only grow. Qubetics and Cardano are at the forefront of this evolution, offering investors opportunities to capitalize on transformative innovations. Qubetics’ focus on enhancing cross-chain interactions and its ongoing presale provide a chance for early-stage participation in a project poised for substantial returns. Meanwhile, Cardano’s proven track record and commitment to sustainability make it a reliable choice for long-term investment. Both projects exemplify the potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize industries and redefine digital interactions. Conclusion: Why Qubetics and Cardano Are Top Crypto Assets For investors seeking opportunities in the cryptocurrency market, Qubetics and Cardano stand out as two of the top crypto assets with the potential for massive returns. Qubetics’ innovative solutions for interoperability and its highly successful presale demonstrate its ability to address critical challenges in the blockchain space. Meanwhile, Cardano’s unique journey and continued focus on scalability and sustainability highlight its long-term value. Whether you’re drawn to the groundbreaking promise of Qubetics or the established success of Cardano, both projects represent exciting opportunities to be part of the blockchain revolution. With the cryptocurrency industry poised for continued growth, now is the time to secure your stake in these transformative assets and unlock the potential of blockchain’s future.

The current value of Shiba Inu (SHIB) stands at $0.00001998 while analysts predict two target points: $0.00023 and $0.0000298. While everyone debates Shiba Inu’s chances of a massive breakout, a different altcoin called Remittix(RTX) has soared in popularity. Early presale numbers show over $7M raised, and 335 Milliontokens sold at $0.0350, pushing a next price of $0.0364. This leaves many wondering if Shiba Inu (SHIB) can repeat its history or if Remittix (RTX) might steal the spotlight. Reflecting on SHIB’s 2021 Gains Anyone who followed Shiba Inu(SHIB) in 2021 remembers the extraordinary bull run that turned small stakes into fortunes. Critics call it a fluke powered by social media mania, while supporters cite factors like token burns, community engagement, and evolving use cases like ShibaSwap. Today, skeptics note that Shiba Inu(SHIB) is no longer the shiny new meme coin. Still, dedicated holders argue that improved fundamentals could spark another rally. If the market flips bullish and the overall sentiment swings upward, a 100x rally for Shiba Inu(SHIB) might not be totally off the table. Key Levels to Watch for SHIB On the technical side, Shiba Inu(SHIB) hovers at $0.00002036, with support around $0.000019 to $0.000021. Losing that zone could lead to a downturn, while a break above $0.0000298 might open the path toward bigger gains. Some watchers point to ongoing token burns as another catalyst, gradually reducing supply. Even so, doubts linger about Shiba Inu’s chances of a massive breakout without fresh hype or a compelling reason to hold. Meme culture can keep a coin afloat, but big institutions typically want more tangible use cases. What Is Remittix(RTX) All About? Meanwhile, Remittix(RTX) presents a different story, focusing on real-world cross-border payment solutions. By enabling users to convert crypto into fiat and send funds worldwide, it addresses a common frustration: slow, expensive remittances. Observers note that this concept resonates with people far beyond crypto circles. That could explain why Remittix(RTX) has raised over $7M so quickly, with over 335M tokens sold. If the team delivers a functional platform that outperforms traditional remittance services, many think Remittix(RTX) could leap in value. Its presale momentum hints that a strong user base might fuel even higher prices, especially if everyday people adopt the coin for direct transfers. Which One Has the Better Shot at 100x? Predicting whether Shiba Inu (SHIB) repeats a 2021-style rally or Remittix (RTX) hits epic gains is no simple task. In the fast-moving crypto market, one tweet can send a coin soaring or plummeting. Shiba Inu (SHIB) might explode again if widespread interest returns, while Remittix (RTX) could jump if mainstream remittance firms back its model. Ultimately, each token has big upside potential—SHIB through meme-driven momentum, RTX via real-world utility. In a market filled with unpredictable swings, positioning oneself early in either coin might pay off, as long as investors manage the risks. Conclusion Whether you’re a firm believer in Shiba Inu (SHIB) or ready to place your bets on Remittix(RTX), it’s clear that these are two very different projects vying for attention. Shiba Inu (SHIB) relies on an existing fan base and the hope it can reclaim past glory. Remittix (RTX) banks on practical solutions for cross-border money transfers, which could draw a broader user base. With new developments in both camps, the next few months could reveal which token stands a better chance at massive gains—or if the crypto market surprises us all once again.

Currently, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is valued at $0.00001998, with analysts setting two potential targets: $0.00023 and $0.0000298. As discussions continue about Shiba Inu's potential for a large breakout, another altcoin, Remittix(RTX) , is gaining traction. Early presale figures indicate over $7M raised, with 335 million tokens sold at $0.0350, setting the next price at $0.0364. This leads many to question whether Shiba Inu (SHIB) can replicate its past success or if Remittix (RTX) will become the new center of attention. Recalling SHIB’s 2021 Success Those who tracked Shiba Inu(SHIB) in 2021 will remember the incredible bull run that transformed modest investments into substantial gains. Critics dismiss it as a stroke of luck fueled by social media hype, whereas supporters highlight elements like token burns, community involvement, and new applications such as ShibaSwap. Today, detractors argue that Shiba Inu(SHIB) has lost its novelty as a meme coin. Nevertheless, loyal investors maintain that enhanced fundamentals might ignite another rally. If the market turns bullish and overall sentiment improves, a 100x increase for Shiba Inu(SHIB) could still be a possibility. Critical Levels to Observe for SHIB From a technical perspective, Shiba Inu(SHIB) is currently around $0.00002036, with support between $0.000019 and $0.000021. Dropping below this range could trigger a decline, whereas surpassing $0.0000298 might pave the way for significant gains. Some analysts believe that ongoing token burns could further drive momentum by slowly decreasing supply. Despite this, there are concerns about whether Shiba Inu can achieve a major breakout without renewed excitement or a compelling reason to invest. While meme culture can sustain interest, larger institutions typically seek more concrete use cases. Understanding Remittix(RTX) In contrast, Remittix(RTX) is carving its path by focusing on real-world cross-border payment solutions. It allows users to convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency and send money globally, tackling the common issue of slow and costly remittances. Observers note that this concept resonates with a wider audience beyond just crypto enthusiasts. This could explain why Remittix(RTX) has quickly raised over $7M, with more than 335M tokens sold. If the team can provide an effective platform that surpasses traditional remittance options, many believe Remittix(RTX) could see a significant increase in value. The momentum from its presale suggests that a robust user base might drive prices even higher, especially if everyday people start using the coin for direct transactions. Which Has a Higher Potential for 100x Growth? Determining whether Shiba Inu (SHIB) will see a rally similar to 2021 or if Remittix (RTX) will achieve substantial gains is challenging. In the rapidly evolving crypto market, a single tweet could cause a coin to skyrocket or crash. Shiba Inu (SHIB) might experience another surge if it regains widespread interest, while Remittix (RTX) could rise if mainstream remittance companies endorse its approach. Ultimately, both tokens have considerable upside potential—SHIB through its meme-powered momentum and RTX via its practical utility. In a market characterized by unpredictable changes, making an early investment in either coin could be beneficial, as long as investors carefully manage risks. Conclusion Whether you're a staunch supporter of Shiba Inu (SHIB) or inclined to invest in Remittix(RTX), it's evident that these two projects are distinctly different in their approach. Shiba Inu (SHIB) depends on its loyal fan base and the hope of regaining past heights. Remittix (RTX), on the other hand, focuses on offering tangible solutions for cross-border remittances, which could attract a broader audience. With ongoing developments in both fields, the upcoming months might reveal which token is more likely to achieve massive gains—or if the crypto market will surprise us yet again.

Meanwhile, many are discreetly increasing their holdings in Rollblock (RBLK) , an emerging contender in the GambleFi sector. Having experienced a 600% rise in new registrations and nearly $10 million in ICO fundraising, Rollblock is gaining traction as an intriguing alternative to meme coins. With the potential for 20x growth, Rollblock is shaping up to be a top investment choice for the next wave of crypto millionaires. Reasons Behind Crypto Whales' Interest in Rollblock Rollblock (RBLK) stands out as a pioneering GambleFi initiative, merging blockchain technology with the gaming industry. Utilizing Ethereum's platform, Rollblock has created a decentralized gaming hub featuring over 7,000 classic games. These offer a variety of options, from live tables to sports betting, encompassing soccer, golf, basketball, and MMA. The rising fame of Rollblock is clear from its impressive user adoption. In December alone, $1.75 million was wagered within its GambleFi ecosystem. Additionally, recent data indicates a 600% jump in new registrations, signaling heightened interest from both investors and gamers. At the heart of Rollblock’s operations is the RBLK token. Players can acquire tokens through successful bets, while investors have the opportunity to stake their RBLK for up to 30% annual percentage yields. Token holders benefit from Rollblock’s revenue-sharing model, which allocates up to 30% of its weekly revenue to buying RBLK from the open market. Following this, 60% of the repurchased tokens are burned, with the remainder used for staking rewards. Despite being launched only a few months prior, Rollblock's potential for growth has attracted thousands of investors. Its presale has already amassed over $9 million from more than 40,000 investors. With the current price at $0.047, this marks a 300% increase since its inception, and another price rise is anticipated soon. Analysts Stay Positive on Shiba Inu's Price Forecasts Even though Shiba Inu's price has been steady lately, crypto analysts maintain a positive outlook. Market analyst Alan Santana forecasts that Shiba Inu could climb to $0.000139671 on CoinMarketCap from its present price of $0.0000205, indicating a potential 3,150% increase. Despite this, market sentiment is mixed. The market cap of Shiba Inu has decreased, reflecting a drop in speculative interest. Moreover, updates within the ecosystem, like Shibarium advancements and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) integration, haven't yet sparked widespread enthusiasm. Nevertheless, many analysts think Shiba Inu might experience a resurgence due to renewed interest in the crypto space under Donald Trump. Additionally, the activity of crypto whales around Shiba Inu has raised eyebrows. Just last week, an active whale address moved 220 billion SHIB tokens, worth $4,630,000, from Binance. This significant transfer underscores continued interest from large holders despite broader market uncertainties. Dogecoin ETF Could Propel DOGE to $10 Dogecoin remains in the spotlight due to Bitwise's application for a Dogecoin ETF, fostering optimism. Approval from the SEC could attract institutional investors and enhance Dogecoin's mainstream acceptance. Dogecoin surged to $0.38 after President Donald Trump signed the DOGE into law on Wednesday. This newly established department, under the guidance of tech visionary Elon Musk, aims to revamp the federal government's IT infrastructure. While the coincidence of the Dogecoin name and logo created market excitement, no official confirmation ties this initiative to Dogecoin. Dogecoin has risen by 0.87% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.35. Analysts, including X user Ali, suggest that the Dogecoin ETF could elevate its price to $10. Historical patterns back this prediction, as similar trends have previously led to significant price increases, such as last year's triple rally following a period of consolidation. Rollblock Could Offer Up to 10,000% Returns for Investors Rollblock is surpassing major meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin with its practical applications. This groundbreaking project is expanding at an exceptional pace with over $9 million raised during its ICO. RBLK has provided remarkable returns for early investors and could potentially soar another 100x once it becomes available on mainstream exchanges!

However, many are quietly accumulating Rollblock (RBLK) , a rising star in the GambleFi space. After a 600% surge in new registrations and almost $10 million raised in ICO funds, Rollblock is drawing attention as a promising alternative to meme coins. With its 20x growth potential, Rollblock is positioned as one of the best investment options to make the next wave of crypto millionaires. Why Crypto Whales are Accumulating Rollblock Rollblock (RBLK) is an innovative GambleFi project that integrates blockchain technology into the gaming market. With Ethereum's infrastructure, Rollblock has developed a decentralized gaming platform with over 7,000 classic games. These include live tables and sports bidding options which cover everything from soccer and golf to basketball and MMA. Rollblock’s growing popularity is evident from its high adoption rate. In December, users wagered $1.75 million on its GambleFi ecosystem. Recent reports also show a 600% surge in new registrations, reflecting increased interest from investors and gamers alike. The RBLK token powers Rollblock’s ecosystem. Players can earn tokens by winning bets, while investors can stake their RBLK to earn up to 30% APYs. Token holders are also granted to Rollblock’s revenue share model. Each week the project reinvests up to 30% of its revenue to buy RBLK from the open market. It then burns 60% of repurchased tokens while using the remaining 40% for staking rewards. Although Rollblock launched only a few months ago, its growth potential has drawn thousands of investors. Its presale has already raised over $9 million from over 40,000 investors. The current price of $0.047 represents a return of over 300% gain from its debut, with another price increase expected imminently. Analysts Remain Optimistic about Shiba Inu's Price Predictions Despite its current stagnation, crypto analysts remain confident about Shiba Inu's price. Market analyst, Alan Santana, predicts that Shiba Inu could rally to $0.000139671 on CoinMarketCap from its current price of $0.0000205, signalling a potential 3,150% surge. Market sentiment, however, shows mixed signals. Shiba Inu’s market cap has dropped, reflecting reduced speculative interest. Furthermore, ecosystem developments, such as Shibarium upgrades and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) integration, have yet to generate widespread excitement. Nonetheless, many analysts believe that Shiba Inu could rebound due to renewed interest in the crypto sector under Donald Trump. Additionally, whale activity around Shiba Inu has gained attention. Last week, an active whale address transferred 220 billion SHIB tokens, valued at $4,630,000, from Binance. This significant movement highlights ongoing interest from major holders despite the broader market's uncertainty. Dogecoin ETF Could Push DOGE to $10 Dogecoin continues to attract attention with Bitwise’s filing for a Dogecoin ETF sparking optimism. Approval by the SEC could bring institutional investors and boost mainstream adoption of Dogecoin. Dogecoin jumped to $0.38 after President Donald Trump signed the DOGE into law on Wednesday.

While the name and coincidence of the Dogecoin logo excited the market, no official confirmation links the initiative to Dogecoin.

The global crypto market cap saw a slight uptick, reaching $3.61 trillion, while the crypto fear and greed index remained neutral at 60. Here’s a breakdown of the top stories from this week. Trump’s Inauguration Speech Miss Crypto The week started with Donald Trump’s swearing-in ceremony as the 47th President of the United States. Many had called him the “crypto president” during his campaign due to his pro-crypto stance and plans to make the U.S. a crypto hub. However, during his inauguration speech, Trump did not mention cryptocurrencies . This caused Bitcoin’s price to fall to $103,000, with $430 million worth of liquidations hitting the market. Gary Gensler Resigns; Mark Uyeda Steps In Just before the inauguration, Gary Gensler stepped down as SEC Chairman. President Trump appointed Mark Uyeda, a pro-crypto advocate, as interim chairman. This change has raised hopes for a more crypto-friendly regulatory approach in the U.S. Ripple’s Legal Fight: SEC Appeal Might Fail The SEC filed an appeal against the 2023 XRP ruling, arguing that XRP sales should not be treated differently between institutional and retail investors. Legal expert John Deaton believes the SEC’s appeal is weak. He noted that Judge Torres, who ruled in Ripple’s favor last year, would likely deliver the same outcome if the case returned to her. MicroStrategy Buys More Bitcoin Michael Saylor’s company, MicroStrategy, purchased 11,000 Bitcoin for $1.1 billion this week. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 461,000 BTC, bought at an average price of $63,610 each. Kenya Plans New Crypto Laws Kenya introduced a new bill , the Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill 2025, which requires crypto companies to set up offices in the country. This move aims to regulate the growing digital asset industry and ensure greater transparency. Ross Ulbricht Receives Trump’s Pardon In a major decision, President Trump granted a full pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road marketplace. This fulfills a campaign promise and has drawn mixed reactions from the crypto community. Bank of Japan Hikes Interest Rates The Bank of Japan raised its interest rates by 25 basis points, marking its first big hike since 2007. This decision comes as Japan faces rising inflation, with core CPI growing by 3% year-over-year in December. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs See Strong Inflows Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.757 billion in inflows this week, led by companies like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Investment. Ethereum ETFs also saw inflows of $154.3 million, highlighting the growing interest from institutional investors. Top Weekly Gainers : Onyxcoin (XCN): +265%, now priced at $0.039.

Notably, ETH’s performance has sharply contrasted with the rally of other cryptocurrencies, leading some to jokingly call it a “stablecoin” due to its repeated failure to breach critical resistance levels, like $3,160. While assets such as XRP and Solana have surged, with impressive gains of 42.7% and 34.4% to their market caps over the past month, Ethereum has fallen by 2.2% in the past month. This underperformance has led to growing frustration among traders, especially as the broader cryptocurrency market saw significant gains in recent months, partly fueled by optimism surrounding Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. Earlier this week, Brianq, an analyst at Santiment, suggested that shifting investor sentiment is to blame for Ethereum’s lackluster performance. “ The crowd has been slowly but surely turning against Ethereum in favor of more exciting and outperforming assets like XRP and Solana,” he wrote . According to him, this shift in sentiment has created a negative feedback loop, where Ethereum’s poor performance fosters pessimism, further dragging prices down. Social media discussions, often driven by emotions rather than data, have only worsened the situation. Ethereum has also faced criticism for concerns around centralization risks, particularly the concentration of staking power among major entities like Coinbase, Binance, and Lido Finance. Adding to Ethereum’s woes , co-founder Vitalik Buterin has faced backlash for selling large amounts of ETH. Notably, Buterin sold 90,000 ETH worth over $100 million in May 2021 and another $12 million in March 2023, citing personal expenses and funding for Ethereum-related projects. These sales have fueled concerns about market stability. On Saturday, CryptoQuant analysts warned that Ethereum could be headed for a “horror” decline, with 64% of traders currently operating at a loss. They pointed to internal challenges within the Ethereum Foundation and the asset’s inability to find a stable bottom amid its ongoing pullback, which could lead to a “free fall.” The analysts also highlighted a significant 84% drop in spot market trading volumes, from $52 billion in January 2021 to just $8 billion today, signaling a sharp decline in demand and increased caution among traders. Despite the ongoing price decline, some promising signs exist for Ethereum’s future. On Saturday, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that these whales had purchased over 1.14 million ETH in just the past 48 hours, valued at approximately $3.7 billion. Earlier on Sunday, the pundit highlighted that Ethereum has consistently surpassed the 3.2 MVRV Pricing Band during previous bullish cycles, which currently sits at $6,770. Meanwhile, other analysts also remain optimistic about Ethereum’s potential. “Ethereum $7,000 is inevitable,” tweeted Titan of Crypto, sharing a weekly chart pattern of a broadening triangle. Elsewhere , analyst Virtual Bacon was even more bullish, predicting that ETH could reach $14,000 by year-end, driven by factors like Federal Reserve liquidity, pro-crypto policies, and ETF inflows. ETH traded at $3,331 at press time, reflecting a 0.35% drop in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE|SOL,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-26 19:34:38

Apart from coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), and Floki (FLOKI), several new tokens have also been doing well. Out of all the new competitors, one is catching up quickly. This new competitor may also surpass them this year. This token is Rollblock. It is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency initiative that is gaining popularity. What makes Rollblock (RBLK) the best altcoin to buy in 2025 is the question at hand. Why Rollblock (RBLK) Is Poised for Success With a range of features aimed at both investors and players, Rollblock is revolutionizing the online casino market. In contrast to conventional platforms, Rollblock only takes cryptocurrency, allowing for quick deposits in a variety of currencies and instant withdrawals. Since players can easily follow their betting history, transparency is yet another game-changer in this situation. Rollblock's ecology of profit-sharing is what makes it unique. Investors who own $RBLK tokens have access to a revenue-sharing plan and buy-back functionality, which increases demand for the token and raises its price. Rollblock is a serious candidate for the top cryptocurrency for long-term returns in 2025 because of its unique combination of reward and usefulness. Here are a few reasons why Rollblock is different from other altcoins: Utility-Driven Growth: The ecosystem of Rollblock directly benefits players and investors, in contrast to meme currencies that profit from hype. Profit-Sharing Incentives: A clear revenue-sharing arrangement provides $RBLK investors with actual returns. Transparency and Speed: Rollblock guarantees efficiency and confidence by offering instant withdrawals and transparent betting analytics. Community-Focused Approach: Rollblock's incentive program promotes token holder loyalty as well as player participation. Stable Ecosystem: Rollblock's buyback and profit-sharing plans guarantee steady demand, which lowers volatility. Can Dogecoin (DOGE) Sustain Its Momentum? Dogecoin has been the most popular meme coin for a while, but it hasn’t been doing well recently. However, Bitwise recently for the first U.S. DOGE ETF. This is exciting but it might not be able to sustain DOGE long-term. Pepe (PEPE): A Risky Rebound? Pepe is still a popular meme coin thanks to its strong whale backing and listings on major exchanges. But for now, the coin is consolidating inside a parallel channel that is rising, which is indicative of a larger downward trend. Due to its recent decline from $0.00002125 to $0.00001741, PEPE is now approaching a crucial support barrier. Although this has historically been a zone of recovery, there is a chance that it may break down, which could cause the token to drop much lower than $0.00001450. Unlike Rollblock's approach to sustained growth, PEPE's prospects are at best uncertain. Although general patterns point to caution, whale activity implies some confidence. Rollblock offers a safer investment due to its obvious value and steady demand. Floki (FLOKI): A Bold Move or a Gamble? The most recent proposal from the Floki DAO to provide liquidity funding for a Floki exchange-traded product (ETP) has generated attention. The project, which has 16.3 billion FLOKI tokens set aside for it, intends to increase liquidity while burning the remaining supply indefinitely. Demand may rise as a result of this action, but it is highly dependent on market acceptance and perfect implementation. Long-term investors find Rollblock's buyback and profit-sharing strategy more appealing than Floki's unclear path. Although token burning might lead to scarcity, they are not always indicative of sustained growth. Rollblock's practicality makes it a more environmentally friendly option. Rollblock (RBLK) Is the Top Altcoin to Invest in 2025 Rollblock (RBLK) is becoming an obvious choice for investors looking for the finest altcoin for long-term gains as the cryptocurrency industry develops. It is the best cryptocurrency to invest in in 2025 because of its innovative approach to tokenomics and online casinos.Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Dogecoin has long been a favorite meme coin, but its recent performance has been lackluster. The launch of the first U.S. DOGE ETF by Bitwise brings excitement, though it might not be enough to sustain DOGE's momentum in the long run. Pepe (PEPE): Is It a Risky Comeback? Pepe remains popular as a meme coin thanks to significant whale backing and listings on major exchanges. However, it's currently consolidating within a rising parallel channel, suggesting a broader downward trend. PEPE has recently dipped from $0.00002125 to $0.00001741, nearing a critical support level. While historically a recovery zone, there's a risk of a breakdown, potentially driving the token below $0.00001450. In contrast to Rollblock's sustainable growth strategy, PEPE's future appears uncertain. While whale activity suggests some confidence, overall trends advise caution. Rollblock's clear value proposition and stable demand make it a safer investment. Floki (FLOKI): A Daring Move or a Gamble? Floki DAO's latest proposal to fund liquidity for a Floki exchange-traded product (ETP) has attracted attention. With 16.3 billion FLOKI tokens allocated for this initiative, the project aims to boost liquidity while indefinitely burning excess supply. Although this could spark demand, it heavily relies on market acceptance and flawless execution. For long-term investors, Rollblock's buyback and profit-sharing approach is more appealing than Floki's uncertain path. While token burning may create scarcity, it doesn't guarantee sustained growth. Rollblock's practicality offers a more sustainable option. Rollblock (RBLK) Emerges as the Top Altcoin for 2025 Investment As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, Rollblock (RBLK) is becoming the clear choice for investors seeking the best altcoin for long-term growth. Its innovative approach to tokenomics and online casinos makes it the top cryptocurrency to invest in for 2025.Explore the exciting possibilities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Dump Shiba Inu (SHIB) for these 4 Tokens, All Under $0.50",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/want-to-make-crypto-millions-in-2025-dump-shiba-inu-shib-for-these-4-tokens-all-under-050,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) has dominated headlines in the past, but its potential to deliver exponential gains in 2025 is diminishing. Investors are now exploring alternatives that promise substantial returns at affordable prices. Among the contenders, TRON (TRX), Dogecoin (DOGE), Rexas Finance (RXS), and Kaspa (KAS) stand out. Each token is priced below $0.50, but their innovative features and market potential make them strong candidates for remarkable growth. Here's a closer look at why these tokens are the next big thing. TRON's Growing Ecosystem TRON (TRX) has demonstrated resilience, even as it currently trades at $0.2648. Its price history shows a staggering 24,166% increase from its all-time low, proving its capability for long-term growth. Analysts predict TRON could surpass $1 by mid-2025 if it continues its upward momentum. The crypto's expanding ecosystem is driving this optimism. A strategic partnership with Bitget and the launch of the T3 Financial Crime Unit highlight its focus on innovation and security. By freezing over $100 million in criminal assets since 2024, TRON has enhanced its credibility in the blockchain sector. With key resistance levels set between $0.60 and $0.73, TRON is positioned for significant gains. Dogecoin (DOGE) Stays in the Spotlight Despite its origins as a meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to attract attention. Currently consolidating around $0.33, its price reflects broader market trends but retains potential for upward movement. Speculative traders are holding firm, with open interest in DOGE futures climbing by $310 million in just three days. The meme coin’s community-driven approach remains its strength, sustaining investor confidence even during market fluctuations. While DOGE has seen its share of volatility, its appeal as a low-cost entry point into crypto remains strong. Upcoming events could act as catalysts, further fueling its price recovery. Rexas Finance Revolutionizes Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) is transforming the crypto market by bridging blockchain technology with real-world asset tokenization. This ERC-20 token empowers users to own or fractionalize assets like real estate or gold with just one click. RXS boasts a suite of advanced tools that make this transformation seamless. The Rexas Token Builder simplifies asset tokenization for everyone. Meanwhile, the Rexas Launchpad allows projects to raise funds efficiently. The platform also features Rexas Quickmint Bot, GenAI, and AI Shield, which ensure security and streamline asset management. The token's performance speaks volumes. Stages 1 to 10 of its presale sold out rapidly, raising $33.1 million. The current Stage 11 price of $0.175 represents a sixfold increase from its initial price of $0.03. With $38.89 million raised so far, RXS is attracting massive investor interest. Its $1 million giveaway further enhances its appeal, offering 20 lucky winners a chance to claim $50,000 each in USDT. Rexas Finance is also listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, boosting its visibility and credibility among the crypto community. A CertiK audit assures investors of the security and trustworthiness of its smart contracts. With plans to debut on three of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges, RXS is solidifying its position as a game-changing investment. Kaspa’s Steady Growth Potential Kaspa (KAS) stands out for its simplicity and consistent performance. Currently trading at $0.11, the token is in a consolidation phase. Analysts expect its bullish momentum to resume by the end of 2025, with a potential to reach $1.06 by 2030. With a market cap of $2.9 billion, Kaspa ranks as the 22nd-largest crypto token, highlighting its growing prominence. Its strong fundamentals and technical outlook make it an attractive option for long-term investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Final Thoughts In the quest for crypto millions, dumping Shiba Inu for these four tokens under $0.50 could be a strategic move. TRON’s ecosystem, Dogecoin’s resilience, Rexas Finance’s revolutionary real-world asset tokenization, and Kaspa’s steady growth all present unique opportunities for 2025 and beyond. Among these, Rexas Finance stands out with its unmatched utility and rapid presale success. Don’t miss your chance to secure these tokens early—2025 could be a year of exponential returns.

Investors are now turning to other options that offer high returns without breaking the bank. Notable among these are TRON (TRX), Dogecoin (DOGE), Rexas Finance (RXS), and Kaspa (KAS). Each of these tokens is valued at less than $0.50, yet their innovative features and market potential make them strong contenders for extraordinary growth. Let's dive into why these tokens are poised to make waves. TRON's Expanding Universe TRON (TRX) continues to show resilience, currently priced at $0.2648. Its historical performance reflects a remarkable 24,166% rise from its lowest point, underscoring its potential for sustained growth. Experts forecast that TRON might exceed $1 by the middle of 2025 if its current trajectory persists. The crypto's growing ecosystem fuels this optimism. Noteworthy developments include its strategic alliance with Bitget and the unveiling of the T3 Financial Crime Unit, emphasizing innovation and security. With over $100 million in criminal assets frozen since 2024, TRON has fortified its reputation in the blockchain industry. Positioned between resistance levels at $0.60 and $0.73, TRON is set for substantial gains. Dogecoin (DOGE) Remains a Fan Favorite Originally launched as a joke, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to capture attention. Currently stabilizing around $0.33, its price mirrors broader market movements but still holds promise for growth. Enthusiastic traders remain committed, with a $310 million surge in open interest for DOGE futures over just three days. The coin’s community-driven ethos is its core strength, maintaining investor trust even amid market swings. Despite experiencing volatility, DOGE's appeal as an affordable entry into the crypto world remains strong. Upcoming events may act as triggers, potentially boosting its price further. Rexas Finance: Pioneering Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) is reshaping the crypto landscape by integrating blockchain technology with the tokenization of real-world assets. This ERC-20 token enables users to own or fractionally invest in assets like real estate or gold with ease. RXS offers a range of sophisticated tools to facilitate this transition.

A CertiK audit reassures investors about the security and reliability of its smart contracts. With plans to list on three of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges, RXS is cementing its status as an impactful investment. Kaspa: Consistent and Reliable Growth Kaspa (KAS) is recognized for its straightforward approach and steady performance. Currently trading at $0.11, the token is in a consolidation phase. Analysts predict that its bullish trend will pick up by the end of 2025, potentially reaching $1.06 by 2030.

Its solid fundamentals and technical prospects make it an appealing choice for long-term investors seeking to diversify their portfolios.

Notably, the crypto asset has been trading in a tight range after facing significant resistance around the $107,000 level, further pressured by profit-taking from retail investors following Trump’s pre-inauguration surge. Despite this, bullish sentiment remains strong, supported by the ongoing accumulation of Bitcoin by whales in the past month, which appears to be helping stabilize the market. On Saturday, analysts from CryptoQuant highlighted this development noting, “Large investors are driving Bitcoin price gains since the US election. Holdings grew from 16.2 million to 16.4 million BTC, while small investors reduced theirs from 1.75 million to 1.69 million.” Additionally, on-chain data from Santiment corroborates the influence of these whales. Earlier this week, the firm reported that Bitcoin whales have been picking up steam, particularly following the US inauguration and the new all-time high of $109.3K. “Key stakeholder participation has played a major role in bull cycles seen in crypto over the past two years, and the context of these spikes appear to be bullish.” Wrote Santiment. On-chain data also shows that long-term Bitcoin holders are exerting minimal selling pressure. Only 18% of Bitcoin deposits on Binance come from long-term holders (typically those who have held BTC for more than 155 days 0, indicating that seasoned investors are largely avoiding significant selling. This highlights a strong HODLing sentiment in the market despite the volatility. Furthermore, Binance’s Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric, which measures the movement of older coins, is at its lowest level. This suggests minimal activity from older coins being spent or moved into exchanges, reinforcing the stability and patience of long-term holders. In line with these trends, US President Trump’s recent crypto executive order has also sparked increased discussion about Bitcoin’s role in the broader digital asset landscape. While the order rescinds prior regulations, it has stirred excitement about Bitcoin’s regulatory future and its potential as a strategic reserve asset . That said, various analysts have also weighed in on the asset’s potential price movements. Analyst Ali Martinez suggests that Bitcoin could surge as high as $200,000 as it looks to complete the final phase of the Wyckoff pattern. “ According to the Wyckoff Method, BTC could be approaching its final leg up before entering the Distribution Phase,” Martinez tweeted early Sunday, echoing the views of fellow analyst Titan of Crypto. On the other hand, Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading, has suggested the possibility of a short-term correction, predicting that Bitcoin could dip to the $95,000-$97,000 range before resuming its upward trajectory. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see a correction towards $95-97K on BTC, taking liquidity and continuing the upside from there,” Poppe wrote . Bitcoin was trading at $105,075 at press time, reflecting a 0.39% increase in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|BNB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-26 19:45:22

This announcement received much support as industry participants thought the move would have a greater impact than expected. Nuffle Labs co-founder Altan Tutar thinks it is a “smart move.” Commenting on the news, WolvesDAO founder Sam Steffanina explicitly noted that the integration is “bigger than most realize.” Furthermore, Steffanina spoke about the multichain and 2025, describing the former as the future and the latter as the year of cross-chain expansion. Virtuals Protocol to Utilize Base And Solana Currently, Virtuals Protocol is on Base, an Ethereum Layer-2 network. Its integration with Solana could bring more ecosystem participation and attract developers and users from the network. Judging by Solana’s precedence, it has the potential to increase scalability while easing network congestion. “Solana, known for its speed, scalability, and vibrant community, is the perfect place for us to grow and bring our vision to life,” Virtuals Protocol wrote in its January 25 X post. Features of Virtuals Protocol’s Integration With Solana Virtuals Protocol’s integration with the Solana ecosystem will include a few new features, including a Strategic Solana reserve. For this reason, 1% of trading fees will be converted to SOL to build a reserve to “support and reward agents” and creators, all within the ecosystem. The AI agent platform intends to launch a Meteora pool. The goal is to improve liquidity and an expanded grants program that will support early-stage Solana builders. SOL Price Skyrocket With TRUMP Meanwhile, the Solana blockchain has been receiving a lot of attention recently. Within the last three days leading up to the inauguration of Donald Trump, his family launched Official Trump (TRUMP) on the Solana ecosystem. This move immediately led to a frenzy in the crypto space, especially as SOL prices skyrocketed. The overwhelming enthusiasm surrounding the TRUMP token propelled SOL . SOL reached new highs and did many other Solana-based large-cap tokens. The price hit over $275, and trading volumes surged from $3 billion to over $26 billion in just one day. The integration of Virtuals Protocol with the network may bring more price rally.

In a letter addressed to Uniswap Labs CEO Hayden Adams, Andreessen Horowitz partner Marc Andreessen, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Lightspark co-founder David Marcus, Kraken CEO Dave Ripley and Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith, the committee says it wants to ensure that Americans can participate in US markets without worrying about any potential backlash from financial institutions or regulators. “The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is investigating improper debanking of individuals and entities based on political viewpoints or involvement in certain industries such as cryptocurrency and blockchain. The Committee is interested in engaging with individuals and entities debanked by their financial institutions regarding their experience and the impact of debanking on their business operations.” In a 2024 interview with Joe Rogan, Marc Andreessen said that over 30 founders had been de-banked over the past four years after being politically targeted. Coinbase’s Armstrong backed up the claim, saying, “Warren and Gensler tried to unlawfully kill our entire industry, and it was a major factor in the Democrats losing the election. The Democratic party should realize Warren is a liability and further distance themselves if they want to have any hope of rebuilding… Can confirm this is true. It was one of the most unethical and un-American things that happened in the Biden administration, and my guess is we’ll find Elizabeth Warren’s fingerprints all over it (Biden himself was probably unaware).” Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell also said that Choke Point 2.0, or the operation that aimed to stifle the crypto industry, has been in effect over the past four years. “Fed Master accounts for new banks perceived to be crypto-friendly have been unlawfully denied.

Paris prosecutor’s office further revealed that the couple was abducted from their residence during the early hours of Tuesday, January 21, and transported to an undisclosed location. Bloomberg report stated that the kidnappers demanded a substantial ransom in cryptocurrency. Law enforcement successfully located and freed Balland during an operation late Wednesday night. While details about the rescue remain limited, emergency services are providing medical care to the victim. The incident, which shocked the tech community, comes amid rumors of another alleged kidnapping involving Eric Larchevêque, who happens to be Ledger’s other co-founder. However, Grégory Raymond, co-founder of crypto news outlet The Big Whale, dismissed these claims, confirming Larchevêque was not involved. Founded in 2014, Ledger is renowned for its hardware wallets that secure digital assets offline, protecting users from cyber threats. The company, valued at €1.3 billion (approximately$1.42 billion), raised €100 million ($109 million) in 2023 and employs around 700 people. According to the “Known Physical Bitcoin Attacks” archive , maintained by Casa’s co-founder Jameson Lopp, there have been at least six attacks cataloged in 2025 alone just before Balland’s incident. As reported earlier, Dean Skurka, CEO of Canadian cryptocurrency firm WonderFi, was kidnapped in Toronto during rush hour in November. The exec was released unharmed after paying a $720,000 ransom. In a statement, Skurka assured users that WonderFi’s funds and data were unaffected. The incident coincided with WonderFi’s earnings report, which highlighted a 153% revenue increase year-over-year.

IntelMarkets Surges 500%,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/can-trump-surpass-elon-musk-as-richest-man-after-memecoin-rally-intelmarkets-surges-500,"As the Trump Coin entered the crypto market, it gained all the focus through its rally. This surge has started speculations about whether Donald Trump could surpass Elon Musk's wealth accumulation, who supports DOGE. While the upward momentum of the Trump Coin and Dogecoin price continues, IntelMarkets stands out, surging 500% in value. IntelMarkets could bring disruptive changes to crypto markets through its proprietary blockchain technology. Let’s learn more about these projects. Trump Coin: A Political Meme Coin with Financial Firepower Beyond political expressions, the Trump Coin acts as a powerful financial asset. With a 428% surge during the past week, Trump Coin is now trading around $34 (As of January 24). The project operates within the Solana blockchain framework. Source: CoinMarketCap The Trump Coin has shown the crypto community how capitalizing on cultural trends can produce financial gain. Moreover, the fast growth of Trump Coin raises concerns about maintaining its marketplace position and security. Whether Trump will surpass Elon Musk's wealth or not? The answer rests on the ability of Trump Coin and the Dogecoin price stable growth. Potentially challenging these memecoins, this $0.08 AI altcoin, IntelMarkets , is the new thing in the crypto world, which could increase in value by 500%. DOGE: Elon Musk’s Legacy in the Crypto World DOGE has maintained its significance as a major market force in the crypto world. The Dogecoin price is currently at $0.36 (as of January 24) and has grown around 8% in the last month while reaching a market value of $52 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap The impact Elon Musk makes on DOGE extends way beyond simple estimation. Through his history of influential tweets and social backing, Elon Musk established DOGE as the foundation of the memecoin. Technical indicators now show that the Dogecoin price could experience an upward price movement based on the appearance of a TD Sequential buy signal. Experts observe the DOGE capacity to overcome the $0.36 resistance level to reach fresh peaks for Dogecoin price. Market optimism about a Dogecoin ETF is also increasing as financial experts predict a $15 target for Dogecoin price.

IntelMarkets Surges 500%,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/could-trump-overtake-elon-musk-as-the-wealthiest-person-following-memecoin-boom-intelmarkets-surges-500,"Trump Coin has captured considerable attention in the crypto market with its significant rally. This rise has fueled discussions about whether Donald Trump could outstrip Elon Musk, an advocate of DOGE, in terms of wealth. While both Trump Coin and Dogecoin continue their upward trends, IntelMarkets has become a standout, soaring 500% in its market value. IntelMarkets is poised to shake up the cryptocurrency landscape with its unique blockchain technology. Let's dive deeper into these innovative projects. Trump Coin: A Meme Coin with Political Influence and Financial Muscle Besides its political implications, Trump Coin serves as a robust financial tool. Experiencing a 428% increase in just the past week, Trump Coin is currently valued around $34 (as of January 24). This project is built on the Solana blockchain. Source: CoinMarketCap Trump Coin has demonstrated to the crypto community how leveraging cultural phenomena can lead to financial success. However, its rapid rise also brings challenges regarding its market position and security. Will Trump ultimately become wealthier than Elon Musk? This depends on the sustained growth of both Trump Coin and Dogecoin. Entering the competition, this $0.08 AI altcoin, IntelMarkets , is gaining traction in the crypto arena, with a potential 500% value increase. DOGE: Elon Musk's Crypto Legacy DOGE has retained its importance as a key player in the crypto market. Dogecoin is currently valued at $0.36 (as of January 24) and has seen an 8% increase over the last month, reaching a market cap of $52 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap Elon Musk's influence on DOGE extends far beyond simple speculation. His impactful tweets and vocal support have solidified DOGE's position as a leading memecoin. Technical analyses suggest that Dogecoin might experience a price uptick, as indicated by a TD Sequential buy signal. Experts are watching DOGE's ability to break past the $0.36 resistance level and reach new heights. Optimism is also growing about a potential Dogecoin ETF, with financial analysts forecasting a possible $15 price target. While Elon champions DOGE and Trump supports his Trump Coin, IntelMarkets is backed by an AI-driven framework. This platform utilizes a proprietary system for comprehensive analysis, providing real-time data from over 10,000 sources. IntelMarkets' Ambition to Transform Crypto Growth with AI Innovations IntelMarkets is poised to lead a revolution in crypto trading by integrating blockchain technology with AI systems.

The platform incorporates Rodeum-AI as a fundamental aspect, granting traders the benefits of dependable automation.

Furthermore, IntelMarkets distinguishes itself through an AI-powered trading system that performs comprehensive data analysis.

Whale Alert tracked the transfer, which involved 29,532,534 XRP from an unknown wallet to Coinbase. Although large transfers like this often signal the intention to sell, the true reason remains unclear. The transfer could be aimed at boosting liquidity for Coinbase, especially during periods of increased trading demand. Another possibility is that it’s simply a reshuffling of funds for diversification.

Speaking on the Good Morning Crypto show earlier this week, Yusko, who oversees over $3 billion in digital assets, expressed optimism about these cryptocurrencies being included in the U.S. reserve assets under a Trump administration, in addition to Bitcoin. “There’s some talk that XRP could be utilized and ordered to be used for a central bank digital currency or as the base layer for national banking,” Yusko said . Once a critic of XRP, he joined a growing list of industry veterans who acknowledged Ripple’s utility in reshaping the financial landscape. Cardano’s ADA also featured prominently in Yusko’s vision. He commended ongoing efforts by blockchain leaders to engage with U.S. policymakers. “There’s a lot of talk that they’ll expand beyond just Bitcoin to include XRP and Cardano,” he said, pointing to the budding collaboration between blockchain innovators and government officials. That said, if realized, including XRP and ADA in the U.S. reserve would mark a historic shift in monetary policy. XRP often referred to as the “bridge currency,” is celebrated for enabling fast, cost-effective cross-border transactions. On the other hand, Cardano’s proof-of-stake blockchain stands out for its focus on scalability, sustainability, and technological innovation. Meanwhile, Yusko’s optimism comes amidst increasing tensions within the cryptocurrency community. Over recent weeks, a rift has grown between the XRP and Bitcoin communities. Some Bitcoin advocates have accused Ripple’s leadership, led by CEO Brad Garlinghouse, of promoting a centralized financial system that contradicts Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. Last week , Ryan Selkis, founder of blockchain analytics firm Messari, criticized Ripple, accusing the company of allegedly prioritizing political influence over crypto principles an d labeling it a threat to Donald Trump’s proposed crypto agenda. On Saturday, January 25, Jack Mallers, CEO of Bitcoin payments company Strike, also blasted Ripple, accusing it of undermining the principles of American prosperity, freedom, and Bitcoin itself. “ Ripple is actively lobbying to stop a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in the U.S. while pushing their centralized, corporate-controlled token. We will not stand for it,” Mallers stated. In contrast, the XRP community has fiercely defended Ripple, dismissing claims of centralization and accusing Bitcoin maximalists of spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). “XRP is deflationary. It’s decentralized. Ripple isn’t anti-Bitcoin, and Brad Garlinghouse himself holds BTC,” an XRP community member tweeted, emphasizing the cryptocurrency’s significant use cases and adoption by banks worldwide. As the debate intensifies, the question arises whether XRP and Cardano could eventually become part of U.S. reserve assets. Notably, while President Trump has yet to announce a Bitcoin reserve policy as anticipated, recent steps, such as signing a pro-crypto executive order on Thursday, have been seen as a step in the right direction.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cardano|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|ADA|BTC|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-26 19:53:11

39543178,https://thecoinrise.com/why-web3bay-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-in-2025-over-tron-and-kaspa/,1737921613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/39543178.jpeg,Why Web3Bay Is the Best Crypto to Buy in 2025 Over TRON and Kaspa,https://thecoinrise.com/why-web3bay-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-in-2025-over-tron-and-kaspa/,"With Donald Trump’s inauguration fueling bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market, investors are racing to identify the next big opportunities. TRON, Kaspa, and Web3Bay are making waves, each offering unique value to the market. TRON (TRX) is gaining attention with its high-speed blockchain and innovative use cases, while Kaspa (KAS) appeals to blockchain enthusiasts with its novel BlockDAG technology. However, it’s Web3Bay (3BAY) that stands out as the best crypto to buy in 2025, thanks to its revolutionary approach to decentralized e-commerce. Amid market optimism and growing institutional interest in blockchain, Web3Bay’s presale success highlights its potential to redefine global commerce. With $920,000 already raised and more than 215 million tokens sold, Web3Bay is emerging as the top pick for those seeking high-growth investments in the evolving digital economy. TRON: Expanding Use Cases But Facing Centralization Concerns TRON has positioned itself as a leader in high-speed blockchain solutions, capable of handling thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees. The blockchain has become a hub for decentralized applications, gaming, and digital content sharing. TRON recently made headlines with the launch of the TRUMP memecoin, which quickly gained traction, showcasing the network’s ability to support viral projects. Despite these advancements, TRON has often been criticized for its centralization. While it boasts impressive speed and scalability, its reliance on a limited number of super representatives raises questions about decentralization and long-term resilience. Web3Bay, by contrast, is fully decentralized, with a community-driven governance model that ensures every token holder has a voice. Unlike TRON, which focuses on blockchain infrastructure, Web3Bay addresses the inefficiencies of traditional e-commerce by eliminating intermediaries, reducing fees, and creating a fair and transparent marketplace for global buyers and sellers. Kaspa: Innovative Technology, Limited Scope Kaspa has gained recognition for its BlockDAG architecture, which enables rapid transaction confirmation and scalability. As one of the few cryptocurrencies that prioritizes both speed and decentralization, Kaspa appeals to blockchain purists who value efficiency. Over the past year, Kaspa has seen significant price growth, cementing its place as a promising player in the market. However, Kaspa’s appeal remains largely technical, with limited applications outside of its core transactional focus. While it excels as a fast, secure blockchain, it lacks the broader use cases needed to drive mainstream adoption. Web3Bay offers a more versatile approach, targeting the $5 trillion e-commerce industry. Its decentralized marketplace empowers small businesses and global consumers by removing traditional barriers like high fees, restricted payment options, and data centralization. With features like NFT integration, staking rewards, and a hybrid payment system, Web3Bay is designed for mass adoption and sustained growth, making it a more comprehensive investment opportunity than Kaspa. Why Web3Bay Is Termed The Best Crypto To Buy Now in Decentralized Commerce Web3Bay is more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s a solution to the longstanding challenges of e-commerce. Traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay charge exorbitant fees, restrict payment options, and monopolize user data. Web3Bay’s decentralized platform flips the script, creating a transparent, low-cost marketplace where buyers and sellers can connect directly. The 3BAY token is the backbone of this ecosystem, offering practical utility and significant rewards for its holders. Token owners enjoy a 5% discount on purchases, staking rewards, and governance rights through the platform’s DAO. Web3Bay’s hybrid payment model supports both cryptocurrency and traditional options like PayPal, ensuring accessibility for users across the globe. Web3Bay’s presale performance has been remarkable, raising $920,000 in its fourth stage with tokens priced at $0.004562625. Early investors are already seeing gains, with the token’s price increasing in each presale stage. When 3BAY launches at its projected price of $0.1959, early participants could achieve an astounding 6,430% ROI . Imagine this: A $1,000 investment in 3BAY tokens at the current presale price could grow to $42,939 by launch. This level of potential return, combined with Web3Bay’s real-world utility, makes it a standout choice for investors looking to make smart money in 2025. Why Web3Bay Outshines TRON and Kaspa While TRON and Kaspa are strong contenders in the crypto market, Web3Bay offers unmatched versatility and growth potential. TRON’s centralization limits its appeal to blockchain purists, while Kaspa’s focus on transactional efficiency lacks the broader applications needed to capture mainstream interest. Web3Bay, on the other hand, addresses a universal need: equitable and accessible commerce. Its roadmap includes exciting developments like an NFT marketplace, cross-chain compatibility, and scalable Layer-2 solutions, ensuring the platform can grow alongside its user base. This makes Web3Bay not just a cryptocurrency but a cornerstone of the future digital economy. For small businesses, Web3Bay removes the need for traditional banking relationships, enabling them to reach global customers without high fees or restrictive terms. For consumers, it offers a secure, borderless shopping experience with real savings. Best Crypto To Buy Today The crypto market is entering a new phase of growth, fueled by bullish sentiment and growing adoption. TRON and Kaspa are strong players in their respective niches, but Web3Bay stands out for its practical utility, scalability, and long-term vision. With $920,000 raised in its presale, a projected ROI of 6,430%, and a platform designed to revolutionize global commerce, Web3Bay is the most promising investment of 2025. Its decentralized e-commerce model offers something unique: a fair, transparent, and inclusive marketplace that benefits buyers, sellers, and investors alike. If you’re looking to make smart money in crypto, Web3Bay is your opportunity to get in early on a project that’s reshaping the future of commerce. Don’t wait for hindsight to tell you what you missed—secure your 3BAY tokens today and join the movement toward a decentralized future.

Vine Coin recently witnessed a 60% price rally, fueled by its Binance Futures listing and increased market exposure. Meanwhile, Ozak AI has gained attention for its innovative use of predictive AI in blockchain, with its presale already raising over $500,000. While Vine Coin's price is expected to approach $0.5, Ozak AI is targeting $1 by 2025. Youtube embed: Vine Coin Rallies 60% After Binance Futures Listing Since January 24, when Binance announced the launch of the $VINE perpetual contract, the price of Vine Coin has been on the rise. The contract, which offers a maximum leverage of 75x, went live at 10:00 UTC, and the crowd was thrilled to the extent of making some purchases. Binance also put the funding rate for $VINE at +2.00%/-2.00%, which is also beneficial for trading. As of this writing, the price of Vine Coin had risen by 60% and was trading at $0.2702. The intraday high was seen at $0.4289 while the low was $0.1264. The token’s bullish run has been attributed to Binance’s listing and rumors of the Vine social media app being brought back. Elon Musk’s tweet about reviving Vine and statements made by app creator Rus Yusupov have only fueled the speculation. With these developments, coupled with Binance’s listing, buyers are confident that the price of Vine Coin may rise to $0.5 in the near future. Source : X Ozak AI Presale Crosses $500,000, Offering $100,000 in Rewards Ozak AI has gained the interest of the crypto space due to the combination of predictive AI and blockchain. The current presale of the project has already achieved more than $500,000, with each token costing $0.002. The buyers are lured by the fact that the platform offers real-time financial information with the help of tools such as customizable prediction agents and the Ozak Stream Network (OSN). In an attempt to encourage early engagement, Ozak AI has put up a $100,000 reward program. The first one will get $50,000, and the next 99 contributors will share the remaining $50,000. This campaign has gained much attention and has placed Ozak AI as a very important project in the current bull market. OZ is the in-house token of the ecosystem, used for trade, governance, and product premium access. Being a limited supply token and having more applications, the token is highly expected to attract more users as the adoption continues to rise. Ozak AI Eyes $1 by 2025, Supported by Audits and Innovative Features Experts claim that Ozak AI can soar to $1 in the near future due to the fact that it is the only project that leverages the combination of AI and the blockchain. The platform has also been through several audits to confirm that the technology is secure and reliable, hence increasing buyers’ confidence. Ozak AI architecture is built to support high-volume data processing with minimum delay, and this makes it ideal for application in financial, health and logistics sectors. The differences lie in scalability and data privacy. This platform empowers users with more control over their information while still giving them valuable information. The roadmap of the project also consists of the intention to have OZ tokens on the top exchanges after the presale in order to increase its exposure in the market. Despite the current bearish market, buyers believe in the token’s long-term prospects and the presale allows them to get in at a good price.

The token, which surged in popularity, with its market cap surging past $3 billion in hours, has raised questions about the SEC’s stance on cryptocurrencies like XRP, especially since it lacks typical securities regulations. Notably, some Ripple advocates now argue that if President Trump can promote a token without SEC oversight, XRP should not be classified as a security, especially since XRP’s sales did not involve post-sale obligations. In a tweet on Sunday, popular crypto lawyer Bill Morgan weighed in, arguing that if President Trump can launch the TRUMP token without SEC registration, XRP should be treated the same way. “The Ripple appeal of Judge Torres’ ruling against the notion that there must be a contract or post-sale obligations is also looking favorable.” Morgan noted . “After all, the President of the United States believes a token with no post-sale obligations can be issued and promoted without SEC registration.” Pro-Ripple lawyer Metalawman echoed Morgan’s sentiments, adding, “At this point, I don’t see any upside for Trump, or for the SEC, in continuing the misbegotten case against Ripple.” These statements follow the SEC’s opening brief earlier this week in its appeal to overturn a ruling that XRP is not a security when sold to retail investors. Additionally, there has been growing speculation that many of the SEC’s ongoing crypto lawsuits could be dropped under President Trump’s leadership. “ As expected, the SEC’s appeal brief is a rehash of already failed arguments –and likely to be abandoned by the next administration, “Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, stated on Thursday, following SEC’s opening brief in the appeal. Meanwhile, XRP has experienced a notable 30% increase in value over the past week despite broader declines in the cryptocurrency market. The rally follows a recent meeting between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, and President-elect Donald Trump on January 8. The meeting has fueled optimism around the project, with analysts speculating that Trump’s influence could help accelerate crypto adoption in the U.S. That said, as Ripple looks to the future, additional developments, such as the potential launch of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) later this year and recent regulatory approvals like Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, are further fueling investor confidence and helping XRP outperform other major cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|trump|XRP News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-26 20:07:41

Ver claimed he could be extradited from Spain earlier this evening, where he could face up to 109 years in prison. The charges stem from allegations that Ver failed to report capital gains from Bitcoin sales in 2017 and underreported the value of his Bitcoin holdings when he renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014. So Ver is not actually a U.S. citizen. Related News: Watch Out: We Are Entering A Very Critical Week! There Are Many Economic Developments and Altcoin Events!

They’re not just fun tokens; they’re creating investment opportunities that can’t be ignored. The latest meme coin to stir excitement is Arctic Pablo, a daring project with a thrilling narrative that’s taking the crypto world by storm. But what about other popular tokens like Shiba Inu and SLERF? Do they offer the same potential? In this article, we’ll compare the best new meme coins to join now and break down the unique opportunities each offers. Arctic Pablo: A Journey Beyond the Ordinary Arctic Pablo is unlike any meme coin you’ve ever seen. This token takes you on an adventure across the frozen wastelands of the earth, where each location unlocks new investment opportunities and phases. Right now, Arctic Pablo is in its sixth location, El Dorado, after successfully completing five others in under two weeks. That’s fast-paced! With a current price of just $0.000038, it’s hard to ignore the massive ROI potential from the sixth phase to the final presale price of $0.0008. But that’s not all—this token burns unsold coins weekly during the presale, fostering scarcity and boosting the long-term value of the remaining tokens. This deflationary mechanism is part of a larger strategy that keeps Arctic Pablo’s value on the rise. To add some heat to this cold journey, t he final presale price of $0.0008 could see early investors gain over 20,918% ROI once the coin hits the launch price of $0.008. The best new meme coin to join now? Definitely, Arctic Pablo. Arctic Pablo’s approach is unique in that it doesn’t follow the typical “stage” model for presales. Instead, the presale is divided by locations, marking the coin’s progression as it “travels” across the earth’s mystical regions. Every location brings a new chapter in the story, giving investors the feeling they are part of an epic quest. With over $475,000 raised in two weeks, the excitement surrounding Arctic Pablo is palpable. And the benefits don’t stop at the presale. The staking program offers a generous 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY), giving investors even more reason to stay engaged. Simply stake your Arctic Pablo tokens, and watch your investment grow while being a key player in this unforgettable adventure. Shiba Inu: The Meme Coin that Made History While Arctic Pablo is forging a new path, Shiba Inu is already a well-known name in the meme coin space. Often referred to as the “Dogecoin Killer,” Shiba Inu has garnered significant attention and attracted a massive community. This meme coin’s rise to fame was swift, and it became a household name for crypto enthusiasts and meme lovers alike. Shiba Inu’s popularity is largely due to its active community and its vision of building an ecosystem of decentralized applications, including ShibaSwap. The tokenomics are structured to support long-term growth, with a vast supply that initially drew a lot of attention from investors looking for low-cost opportunities. However, while Shiba Inu has proven itself as a leading meme coin, it doesn’t come with the same adventurous narrative and excitement that Arctic Pablo offers. Its journey from inception to where it stands now is more about growth through community support and increasing utility within the ecosystem, rather than an epic exploration like Arctic Pablo. SLERF: A New Contender with Strong Potential Next up is SLERF, another new meme coin that’s been generating buzz in the crypto space. SLERF has caught the attention of those seeking a fresh investment in the meme coin market. With a fun, quirky vibe, SLERF has built a niche in the space by engaging with its community through social media challenges and promotions, encouraging people to get involved early. One of the most exciting features of SLERF is its focus on community rewards. A significant portion of the token’s supply is reserved for rewards and referrals, making it a great option for people looking to earn extra tokens by spreading the word. The tokenomics structure is built for inclusivity, with an emphasis on long-term sustainability and growth. Despite its potential, SLERF lacks the same grand adventure and storyline that Arctic Pablo offers. While SLERF has an interesting community-driven approach, Arctic Pablo’s investment potential and storyline provide an experience that feels more unique and immersive. If you’re looking for a meme coin that feels like a treasure hunt and offers strong ROI, Arctic Pablo is hard to beat. That being said, SLERF may still hold value for those who are deeply embedded in the meme coin community and are looking for a solid project with some room to grow. But if you’re in it for the thrill of the ride and the massive investment returns, you might want to join Arctic Pablo’s journey now. Conclusion: Based on Our Research and Market Trends After diving deep into these exciting new meme coins, Arctic Pablo stands out as the clear winner in terms of investment potential, uniqueness, and community engagement. The presale structure is unlike anything we’ve seen, with each location bringing fresh opportunities and a growing sense of excitement.

But for those looking for the ultimate ROI and a chance to be part of something truly adventurous, Arctic Pablo is the best new meme coin to join now. With its story-driven approach, deflationary tokenomics, and staggering ROI potential, Arctic Pablo is poised for success. Don’t miss out on the chance to embark on this journey.

As the market continues to evolve, BTFD Coin is making waves with its presale that’s already raised over $5.7M. Meanwhile, Brett is securing its place as the Base Chain mascot, and Dogecoin is facing fresh hurdles. So, where should your money go this month? Meme coins have gained undeniable traction, growing beyond their origins as digital jokes. Over the years, meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have made their mark, and now, newer projects like BTFD Coin are pushing the envelope. BTFD, with its high staking rewards of 90% APY and its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, is set to take meme coin popularity to the next level. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin is the one to watch, along with Brett and Dogecoin, as the best new meme coins to buy this month . BTFD Coin: The Bull’s Run to Unprecedented Returns Have you ever dreamed of cashing in on a crypto project at just the right moment? BTFD Coin is making that dream a reality. With its presale already in Stage 14 and over $5.7M raised , this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for investors. BTFD is more than just a meme coin—it’s a fully formed community and a movement, fueled by its 90% APY staking rewards and a P2E game that launched in full on January 1, 2025. The Bulls Squad—the passionate community behind BTFD—continues to expand, driving the value of the coin upward. Recently, BTFD made waves by announcing that it has burned all unsold tokens from Stage 13, tightening the supply and increasing demand. This creates a unique opportunity for early investors to get in at the ground level. Let’s break it down: At a current price of $0.00016 per token, an investment of $10,000 will get you 62,500,000 BTFD tokens. If the price jumps to $0.0006 at the end of the presale, you’re looking at a potential return of $37,500. And if BTFD reaches its moonshot prediction of $0.006, that investment could soar to $375,000. This isn’t just a chance—it’s a perfect dip to invest. How do you grab your piece of the pie? Here’s a quick rundown: Set up a wallet on MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Load your wallet with ETH, BNB, or USDT. Head to the presale page , apply the LAUNCH100 bonus code, and double your tokens. BTFD Coin isn’t just a coin; it’s a way to own the dip and ride the bull run. With the P2E game and staking rewards, it’s clear why BTFD Coin is one of the best new meme coins to buy this month. Brett: The Mascot With Base Chain Potential Brett ($BRETT) is making waves on Base Chain, becoming the official mascot of this rapidly growing blockchain. Inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic character from Boys’ Club, Brett’s appeal goes beyond its meme roots. Its integration with the Base Chain makes it a low-cost, high-efficiency token that’s gaining serious traction. Brett’s fixed supply of 10 billion tokens makes it a valuable asset in an ever-growing meme coin market. Combined with its strong ties to the Base Chain’s blockchain, Brett offers low transaction fees and fast execution, setting it apart from other meme coins. The cultural connection to Matt Furie’s artwork also creates a nostalgic and authentic vibe that has drawn a loyal following. Brett’s community is thriving, creating a strong foundation for future growth. The token’s connection to Base Chain’s infrastructure gives it real-world functionality while maintaining its meme charm. If you’re looking to diversify your meme coin portfolio, Brett is certainly a coin to consider as part of the best new meme coins to buy this month. Dogecoin: Challenges and Opportunities in 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE) has undoubtedly been a trailblazer in the meme coin world, but the landscape has changed. In 2025, Dogecoin is facing new challenges, including increased competition from newer coins. Despite these challenges, Dogecoin still holds its place as one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies globally, largely due to its early success and loyal community. Dogecoin’s future looks promising as the community continues to innovate. Dogecoin Foundation is investing in scaling the network, improving transaction speeds, and integrating more use cases. Despite the challenges, the coin’s market presence remains formidable. With its established reputation and continuing community support, Dogecoin remains a solid choice for those looking to invest in a meme coin with staying power. It may not have the same fresh appeal as new meme coin projects, but for long-term holders, Dogecoin is a reliable option among the best new meme coins to buy this month. The Final Words Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Brett, and Dogecoin each bring unique opportunities to the table. BTFD Coin’s $5.7M presale success and high staking rewards make it an attractive choice for anyone looking to invest in the best new meme coins to buy this month. Brett’s cultural relevance and integration with the Base Chain create a compelling case for its future growth. And while Dogecoin faces new challenges, its loyal community and staying power keep it in the running for those looking for stability in the meme coin market. But if you’re ready to run with the bulls, don’t wait— join the BTFD Coin presale now and position yourself for a potential goldmine in the meme coin world. BTFD or get left behind!

According to the tracker, 29,532,534 XRP, valued at approximately $92.7 million, was moved from an unidentified wallet to Coinbase. This marks the first notable XRP whale transaction tracked by Whale Alert since Donald Trump’s second inauguration as President of the United States on January 20, 2025. 29,532,534 #XRP (92,686,314 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbase https://t.co/WdMkrdiJr0 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 25, 2025 Potential Motivations Behind the Transfer While the transaction could be part of Coinbase’s internal wallet reorganizations, the move may also indicate excitement in the broader market. Whale activity often signals upcoming market shifts, and this particular transaction aligns with the ongoing anticipation surrounding XRP’s performance in the aftermath of Trump’s return to office. Trump’s second term has reignited speculation within the crypto community about regulatory clarity and potential adoption of digital assets. His administration has previously shown interest in advancing blockchain technologies and revisiting cryptocurrency policies, fueling optimism among XRP holders. XRP Under the Trump Administration XRP is set to benefit significantly from Donald Trump’s administration. Following Trump’s victory in November 2024, many XRP investors anticipated a rally, particularly as regulatory discussions appeared to gain momentum. With Trump officially in office, experts believe the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will dismiss the lawsuit against Ripple. It is plausible that whales are strategically positioning themselves to capitalize on market developments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, often serves as a gateway for significant trading activity. The movement of such a large amount of XRP to the exchange raises questions about whether the sender intends to sell, trade, or utilize XRP for other purposes. What’s Next for XRP This transaction adds to the growing narrative surrounding XRP’s market dynamics and regulatory clarity. As the crypto sector awaits further developments under the new administration, the actions of whales, such as the transfer reported by Whale Alert, remain closely monitored. Notably, whales have been making major moves within the XRP ecosystem since late 2024, and this massive transaction has increased the speculation on what the whales could be preparing for. Whether this transaction leads to increased trading activity or signals confidence in XRP’s future remains to be seen. XRP has not reacted to this development, trading at $3.12, down 0.02% over the past 24 hours. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Despite this optimistic outlook, savvy traders are still betting on Rollblock’s GambleFi project to deliver higher returns in Q1 with the project recently hitting several major milestones. Rollblock (RBLK) Steals Investor Attention with 600% Increase in New Registrations Rollblock is leveraging the latest Web3 technology to attract thousands of new investors to its viral GambleFi project. This innovation-driven approach helps Rollblock bring new levels of trust and transparency to the half-trillion online gambling market. As Rollblock taps into the GambleFi space with its crypto-native and on-chain casino, analysts predict an 880% pre-launch rally for the native RBLK token. Rollblock offers over 7,000 AI-powered games, including casino classics, live tables, and a newly launched sports betting feature. This huge selection of games led to a 600% increase in new registrations on Rollblock during December 2024, with analysts already projecting an even higher number for January 2025. Rollblock also recorded more than $1.75 million in wagered bets during December. Another major draw for Rollblock players is the platform’s revenue-sharing model which creates a deflationary supply spiral for the RBLK utility token. RBLK’s supply is capped at 1 billion tokens, making it a true hard asset. Every week, Rollblock uses up to 30% of its revenue to repurchase RBLK from major DEXs and distributes 40% of the tokens as rewards to stakers. The remaining 60% of tokens are removed from supply, putting deflationary pressure on Rollblock’s price on the open market. As the hype around Rollblock increases, analysts are becoming optimistic about a massive 100x rally on RBLK’s official launch day. RBLK’s current selling price of $0.047 is an enormous steal, making now the ideal time to invest in Rollblock before it skyrockets to the levels of XRP and Solana in late 2025. XRP (XRP) Poised to Hit $20 Amid Speculations of Failed SEC Appeal XRP recorded impressive growth in January 2025 following renewed optimism among investors. Although XRP was stuck in a legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, market experts believe the longstanding case could finally end during Trump’s administration. If these predictions are true, XRP could rally to $20 during this bull cycle. XRP currently trades for $3.12 after an intraday decrease of 1.20%. After the impressive 39% surge this month, XRP is closing in on its all-time high price of $3.40. Since XRP is still trading above all of its Exponential Moving Averages on the XRP/USDT daily chart, analysts expect XRP to test the critical $3.33 resistance before entering a price discovery phase during this quarter. Solana (SOL) Continues Upward Trend Despite Potential ETF Rejection Solana’s price experienced a sluggish momentum last week after reports of a potential ETF rejection. Despite this setback, Solana bulls have pushed the price above $260 again. Since Solana’s Elliott Wave structure shows a strong rally in progress, analysts are optimistic about Solana re-entering a price discovery phase within the next few weeks. Solana currently trades for $253.68 after an intraday decrease of 5.06%. This price level puts Solana above all of the Exponential Moving Averages on the SOL/USDT daily chart, reflecting a strong upward momentum. Since Solana’s RSI hasn’t reached overbought levels yet, Solana’s price could test the $275 resistance in the short-term before rallying towards the $347 long-term price target. Rollblock Offers More Sustainable Returns Than SOL and XRP Solana and XRP are experiencing impressive upward movements during this quarter, but they still pose no competition for Rollblock’s explosive growth. As Rollblock brings investor attention to the thrilling GambleFi space, the native RBLK token is likely to outshine both SOL and XRP by the end of 2025.

In spite of this encouraging scenario, astute traders are turning their attention to Rollblock’s GambleFi initiative, anticipating greater returns in Q1 as the project achieves several significant milestones. Rollblock (RBLK) Captivates Investors with 600% Growth in New Sign-ups Rollblock is harnessing cutting-edge Web3 technology to draw in a large number of new investors to its popular GambleFi project. By focusing on innovation, Rollblock is enhancing trust and transparency in the $500 billion online gambling sector. With its crypto-centric and blockchain-based casino, analysts are forecasting an 880% surge for the RBLK token even before launch. Rollblock provides over 7,000 AI-enhanced games, including classic casino options, live tables, and a new sports betting feature. This extensive array of games resulted in a 600% rise in new registrations on Rollblock in December 2024, with projections for January 2025 expected to be even higher. Additionally, Rollblock reported wagers exceeding $1.75 million in December. A key attraction for Rollblock users is its revenue-sharing model, which generates a deflationary supply effect for the RBLK utility token. With a cap of 1 billion tokens, RBLK is considered a solid asset. Each week, Rollblock utilizes up to 30% of its revenue to buy back RBLK from major decentralized exchanges and distributes 40% of these tokens as rewards to stakers. The remaining 60% of the tokens are removed from circulation, applying deflationary pressure on Rollblock’s market price. As excitement around Rollblock grows, analysts are increasingly optimistic about a possible 100x surge on the day RBLK officially launches. With the RBLK token currently priced at $0.047, investing now could yield significant returns as it potentially rises to match XRP and Solana's levels by late 2025. XRP (XRP) Set to Reach $20 Amid Hopes of SEC Lawsuit Conclusion XRP saw remarkable growth in January 2025, fueled by a wave of optimism from investors. Despite being embroiled in a legal dispute between Ripple and the SEC, market analysts anticipate a resolution during Trump’s administration. If these projections hold, XRP could soar to $20 in this bullish phase. Currently trading at $3.12 after a 1.20% intraday dip, XRP has made a significant 39% jump this month, nearing its all-time high of $3.40. Since XRP remains above all its Exponential Moving Averages on the XRP/USDT daily chart, experts predict it will challenge the crucial $3.33 resistance before entering a new price exploration phase this quarter. Solana (SOL) Maintains Upward Trajectory Despite ETF Concerns Solana's price showed some sluggishness last week amid concerns over a potential ETF rejection. Nevertheless, Solana supporters have managed to push its price back above $260. Given Solana's Elliott Wave pattern indicating a robust upward trend, analysts are hopeful for Solana to re-enter a price discovery phase in the coming weeks. With Solana trading at $253.68 after a 5.06% daily decline, it remains above all its Exponential Moving Averages on the SOL/USDT daily chart, signaling strong upward momentum. As Solana's RSI hasn't yet hit overbought territory, the price could test the $275 mark in the short term, with a longer-term target of $347. Rollblock Promises More Sustainable Returns Compared to SOL and XRP While Solana and XRP are experiencing notable gains this quarter, they can't rival Rollblock's explosive growth potential. As Rollblock garners attention in the exciting GambleFi realm, the RBLK token is poised to surpass both SOL and XRP by the end of 2025.

33767162,[object Object],1737924915,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,4 Decentralized Crypto Gems to Watch as Tax Laws Tighten,https://bitcoinist.com/4-decentralized-crypto-platforms-to-watch-as-tax-laws-tighten/,"Crypto investors in the U.S. are bracing for impact as tax authorities crack down on reporting. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) will soon have to report crypto transactions to ensure tax compliance. Even MicroStrategy, which holds over $19B in Bitcoin gains, might feel the heat. The rescinding of SAB 121 – a rule requiring crypto custody platforms to separate assets from liabilities – could further complicate the landscape. In this climate, decentralized platforms are becoming a lifeboat for investors seeking greater autonomy. If you’re looking to embrace the latest in decentralized innovation, here are four crypto projects reshaping the landscape right now. $FLOCK $MEMEX $RDNT $UNI $FLOCK – The Decentralized Haven for Meme Fans $FLOCK is soaring into the crypto spotlight, blending the spirit of meme culture with the freedom of decentralized finance. Over $13.9M has been raised during its presale phase, with the total closing in on $14M. $FLOCK’s tokens are available at listing price via its website or the Best Wallet app until the official launch on Monday, January 27th, at 2 PM UTC. As crypto regulations tighten, $FLOCK’s decentralized model offers privacy and independence, appealing to investors seeking refuge from increasing scrutiny. The platform’s governance is community-driven, ensuring decision-making stays in the hands of its dedicated users. If you’re looking for a project with both substance and a playful edge, $FLOCK provides a unique mix of security, privacy, and humor that’s hard to ignore. $MEMEX – The Gateway to Decentralized Media $MEMEX is revolutionizing the way we think about media ownership, raising $2.9 million during its presale with tokens currently priced at $0.0155933. Positioned as a decentralized alternative to traditional media platforms, $MEMEX empowers creators and consumers alike. By cutting out intermediaries, it reduces costs while maximizing rewards. With looming crypto tax reporting requirements, $MEMEX offers a decentralized space for independent content creation and consumption, free from centralized interference. Think of $MEMEX as the crypto answer to Netflix, but with a twist: creators retain ownership of their content, and users directly benefit from their participation. Whether you’re a creator looking for financial freedom or a consumer hungry for fresh, authentic content, $MEMEX is a platform built for the future of media. $RDNT – Bridging Assets Across Chains $RDNT is revolutionizing cross-chain lending and borrowing on Arbitrum. The platform allows users to deposit assets on one blockchain and borrow on another, creating a seamless experience in DeFi. As of January 2025, $RDNT is priced at $0.04981 with a 24-hour trading volume of $6.3M and a market cap of $42M. With over $230M in TVL, Radiant continues to grow in the competitive DeFi market. Amid growing regulatory scrutiny, such as the requirement for centralized exchanges (CEXs) to report crypto transactions, Radiant’s decentralized nature offers a solution for investors seeking to avoid tax reporting and exposure. Additionally, the end of SAB 121, which impacted crypto custody, may push more users to platforms like Radiant, which provides greater privacy and control over assets. $UNI – The OG of Decentralized Exchanges $UNI is like the reliable friend of the crypto world – always there when you need seamless, permissionless trading. As one of the pioneering decentralized exchanges (DEXs) built on Ethereum, Uniswap revolutionized how tokens are swapped without centralized oversight or KYC requirements. With stricter global tax laws looming, this anonymity could become increasingly attractive. Currently trading at $12.01, $UNI has seen a 7-day drop of 17.09% but maintains a robust market cap of $7.21B.

While Bitcoin remains the dominant force, accounting for 57% of the market’s total capitalization and recently breaking the $100,000 barrier, other cryptos are showing signs of explosive potential. Among the top 4 altcoins to watch in 2025 are Solana, Chainlink, Virtuals Protocol, and Web3Bay. These four coins each offer unique innovations that could position them as leaders in their respective fields. 1. Solana: Pioneering Mobile Blockchain Innovation Solana has established itself as the leading challenger to Ethereum, with its lightning-fast transaction speeds and scalability. With a market cap of just under $100 billion, Solana continues to grow, having increased by 900% in 2023 and another 71% in 2024. A key driver for Solana’s success is its focus on mobile crypto technology. In 2023, it launched the world’s first blockchain smartphone, tailored specifically for decentralized applications (dApps). Building on this, Solana plans to release another device in 2025, solidifying its position as the go-to blockchain for mobile-first innovation. Moreover, Solana is expanding its influence in decentralized finance (DeFi), recently surpassing Ethereum in 24-hour trading volume on decentralized exchanges. This development underscores its growing dominance in sectors traditionally led by Ethereum, making Solana a top pick for investors seeking a blockchain with versatility and a strong growth trajectory. 2. Chainlink: Leading the Tokenization Revolution Chainlink is renowned as the premier blockchain data oracle, facilitating the seamless integration of real-world data into smart contracts. While it initially gained fame during the 2020-2021 bull market, Chainlink is now poised for a significant comeback thanks to the rise of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. RWA tokenization involves converting tangible assets, such as real estate and private equity, into blockchain-based digital assets. This shift promises to revolutionize industries by enabling greater efficiency and transparency. Leading financial institutions, including BlackRock, are actively exploring this space, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink calling asset tokenization potentially more transformative than spot Bitcoin ETFs. Consulting firms like McKinsey estimate that RWA tokenization could represent a $2 trillion market by 2030. Chainlink’s pivotal role in this ecosystem positions it as a frontrunner in capitalizing on this emerging trend, making it a compelling investment for 2025. 3. Virtuals Protocol: Combining Blockchain and AI Virtuals Protocol emerged as the best-performing altcoin of 2024, boasting an astronomical 23,000% increase in value. This blockchain project focuses on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with cryptocurrency, allowing users to create and monetize their own AI agents. These agents are designed to perform specialized tasks, such as market analysis and trading, creating entirely new opportunities within the crypto space. The platform has already produced AI agents worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with the most valuable one dedicated to identifying the best meme coin investments. With a market cap of just under $2 billion, Virtuals Protocol is still relatively small compared to major players, leaving ample room for growth. Its position at the intersection of blockchain and AI makes it a fascinating prospect for investors looking to bet on cutting-edge technology. 4. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing E-Commerce with Blockchain Web3Bay is taking the $5 trillion e-commerce industry to new heights by introducing a decentralized marketplace powered by blockchain technology. Unlike traditional platforms like Amazon, which rely on centralized models and charge high fees, Web3Bay connects buyers and sellers directly, reducing costs and improving transparency. The 3BAY token serves as the backbone of the Web3Bay ecosystem, offering practical benefits such as a 5% discount on purchases, staking rewards, and governance rights through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Web3Bay’s hybrid payment model supports both cryptocurrencies and traditional payment options like PayPal, ensuring accessibility for users worldwide. The project’s presale has already raised over $900,000, selling 230 million tokens at a current price of $0.004562625. With a projected launch price of $0.1959, early investors stand to gain a staggering 6,430% ROI. Web3Bay’s roadmap includes features like NFT integration and scalable Layer-2 solutions, making it one of the top 4 altcoins to watch. Top 4 Altcoins To Watch in 2025 While Bitcoin remains the market leader and a symbol of stability, altcoins like Solana, Chainlink, Virtuals Protocol, and Web3Bay are carving out niches that offer significant growth potential. Solana’s focus on mobile innovation, Chainlink’s leadership in asset tokenization, Virtuals Protocol’s integration of AI, and Web3Bay’s disruptive e-commerce model highlight the diversity of opportunities in the crypto market. Each of these projects addresses unique challenges, from decentralizing financial systems to revolutionizing global commerce. While high potential often comes with high risk, these altcoins are positioned to deliver exceptional returns in the months and years ahead. For investors willing to embrace the volatility, 2025 could be the year these hidden gems take center stage.

Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 847,300 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the real-world assets (RWA) crypto sector will hit a $1 trillion market capitalization by 2030 or sooner. RWA is a nascent crypto category that aims to tokenize real-world assets such as bonds and real estate on-chain. The process also enables fractional ownership of assets, allowing individuals to purchase smaller, more affordable units. Says Pentoshi, “Everything will be on-chain and tokenized. The foundation for it already exists.” At time of writing, the RWA category has a market cap of less than $40 billion. Looking at altcoins, Pentoshi says crypto assets other than Bitcoin ( BTC ) have been struggling this cycle largely due to dispersion. “People wonder why this cycle for alts has been so bad… When most of us got in, DeFi (decentralized finance) didn’t even exist. You by definition were early. It could only go up. Total alt market cap combined was like $13 billion… 2% of the US owned crypto. We had like 2,000 total coins to choose from. Now we are a multi-trillion dollar industry and at least 25% of adults in the US own it. It’s way more competitive, diluted, etc. It’s a maturing asset class at the end of the day.” Pentoshi also encourages investors to have a long-term view, highlighting that the stars are aligning for the crypto industry. “Early crypto adopters are now driving politics and soon likely a lot more. We were rewarded for taking chances and taking big risks when nobody else believed. Now nation states are adopting it, everything will be tokenized. The entire world is in a state of change for crypto. We were here before all of them. That is unlikely to ever happen again in our lifetimes broadly speaking. It might take more time than you think, but we are moving in that direction at lightning speed, all things considered.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Panshibi Launches!!!,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/cardano-and-chainlink-investors-flock-to-new-ico-as-stage-one-kicks-off-panshibi-launches,"As 2025 begins, the crypto world is abuzz with activity, with seasoned projects like Cardano (ADA) and Chainlink (LINK) making headlines. Amidst this, Panshibi's ICO in the meme coin sector is grabbing attention for its innovative approach and presale strategy. What lies ahead for these ventures in the first quarter of 2025? Cardano's Price Faces Fluctuations This week has seen Cardano's price experiencing some bumps as it attempts to stabilize. Over the past month, Cardano (ADA) reported a net gain of 9.36%, but last week its price dipped by 10.9%. In the past 24 hours, Cardano (ADA) has undergone a quieter period with a modest increase of 0.37%. The network's daily active addresses have surpassed 50,000, indicating a rise in on-chain activity. Cardano (ADA) has also been the focus of speculation, with President Trump suggesting that Cardano’s founder might join his crypto advisory team. Chainlink Achieves 7% Weekly Growth After a sluggish 2024, Chainlink (LINK) achieved a total 83% gain, which was relatively moderate compared to other blockchains that thrived amid the sector's expansion. However, its growth momentum has picked up over the past week, with a 4% increase in price. In contrast, the past 24 hours saw a minor 5.6% drop for Chainlink (LINK), yet it remains on an upward trajectory. Chainlink (LINK) recently hit $29.40, marking its highest point since November 2021. This rise is likely due to the increased adoption of Chainlink's oracle services across different blockchains. Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $24.81 and appears well-positioned for the remainder of 2025. Panshibi Launches: An Exciting Prospect for Backers Panshibi (SHIBI) is a thoughtfully created meme coin initiative that aims to blend entertainment, community involvement, and solid financial benefits. For investors, the attributes of Panshibi are designed to offer both immediate thrills and sustained value. The ICO incorporates a dynamic pricing structure where token costs escalate as each presale phase concludes. This setup inspires urgency among investors and rewards early participants with more affordable entry points. With a total of 15 stages, entering sooner provides a pricing edge. Panshibi provides staking incentives with annual percentage yields (APYs) reaching up to 1,200% per year. For token holders, this means a potential source of passive income while retaining their investment. Unlike numerous meme coins that thrive solely on enthusiasm, Panshibi offers its community a concrete motivation to remain engaged. Those who participate in the presale gain immediate access to the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. This exclusive club provides advantages like early entry to future token releases, special giveaways, and prioritized involvement in new ecosystem features. These benefits enhance the investor experience, adding extra value to their participation in the project. Beyond financial incentives, Panshibi is committed to supporting panda conservation through global charitable collaborations. For investors, this distinctive aspect brings a meaningful purpose to their investment, making it about more than just financial returns. Panshibi Presale Kicks Off With Great Success Panshibi is crafted with investors in mind, aiming to reshape what meme coins can achieve. Its strong initial showing underscores this potential, as the project secured over $40,000 on its debut day, with tokens available for just $0.002. Analysts predict potential gains of up to 1,200% throughout the presale, with even more substantial growth anticipated post-launch.

Panshibi Goes Live!!!,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/cardano-and-chainlink-holders-rush-to-enter-new-ico-during-stage-one-panshibi-goes-live,"As 2025 kicks off, investors are watching the crypto space closely as several developments unravel for established projects like Cardano (ADA) and Chainlink (LINK). Among the fray, Panshibi's ICO in the meme coin space is seeing broad attention for its unique angle and presale model. So how will these projects fare in Q1 of 2025? Cardano Price Sees Up And Downs This week the Cardano Price has stumbled a bit as it tries to get back on its feet. In the last month, Cardano (ADA) posted a 9.36% net gain, then in contrast, the last week saw the price drop by 10.9%. The last 24 hours has been a calmer phase for Cardano (ADA), with a menial 0.37% rise. Network daily active addresses have passed 50,000, reflecting increased on-chain activity. Cardano (ADA) has also been the subject of increased speculation as President Trump has suggested that Cardano’s founder could join his crypto advisory team. Chainlink Posts 7% Gain In 7 Days A slow 2024 saw Chainlink (LINK) post a net 83% gain in total, which was a fairly mild gain compared with other competitive blockchains that boomed as the space expanded. Nonetheless, its growth has picked up in the last week with a 4% price rise. Likewise, the last 24 hours saw a small decline of 5.6% for Chainlink (LINK), putting it on an upward trend. Chainlink (LINK) recently peaked at $29.40, its highest level since November 2021. This spike was likely caused by more people adopting Chainlink's oracle services across various blockchains. Chainlink (LINK) is now trading at $24.81 and looks in good stead for the rest of 2025. Panshibi Goes Live: A New Opportunity for Investors Panshibi (SHIBI) is a carefully designed meme coin project aimed at combining fun, community engagement, and strong financial incentives. For investors, the features of Panshibi are crafted to deliver both short-term excitement and long-term value. The ICO features a dynamic pricing model where token prices increase incrementally as each presale stage sells out. For investors, this creates a sense of urgency and rewards early participation with lower entry costs. With 15 stages in total, the earlier you enter, the better your price advantage. Panshibi offers staking rewards with APYs of up to 1,200% per annum. For token holders, this translates into a way to generate passive income while holding onto their investment. Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, Panshibi gives its community a tangible reason to stay invested. Presale participants gain instant access to the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. This exclusive club offers perks like early access to future token drops, special giveaways, and priority participation in new ecosystem features. For investors, these perks enhance the overall experience and add extra layers of value to their involvement with the project. Panshibi goes beyond financial incentives by committing to panda conservation efforts through global charity partnerships. For investors, this unique aspect adds a sense of purpose to their investment, making it about more than just profits. Panshibi Presale Starts Off With A Bang Panshibi is designed to be investor-friendly, with a mission to redefine the capabilities of meme coins. Its impressive early performance highlights this potential, as the project raised over $40,000 on its first day, with tokens priced at just $0.002. Analysts anticipate gains of up to 1,200% during the presale, with even more significant growth expected after the launch.

Let's Find Out What The Hype Is All About Surrounding This New Crypto Craze",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/pepe-shiba-inu-and-remittix-lets-find-out-what-the-hype-is-all-about-surrounding-this-new-crypto-craze,"Remittix (RTX), a fresh player in the market is riding on an explosive hype at the moment. This new crypto is gearing up to outrun Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) with its massive returns. Rising as a pathfinder in a $250 trillion sector, Remittix is expected to rank first among cryptocurrency assets in the cross-border payment space. RTX holders are poised for huge returns following the project’s ongoing presale that has raised over $7 million in funding. Read on to learn more about the RTX token and what the hype is all about. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Huge Uptrend is Imminent Shiba Inu is currently in a period of price consolidation. Though it trades on the lower side of its trading channel, it shows continuous signals of an approaching breakout. Major indicators indicate Shiba Inu is tipped to rally towards $0.000030 soon. Over the past month Shiba Inu has been fluctuating between $0.00001998 and $0.00002466. Currently trading at the bottom support of $0.000020, top analysts like John Carter believe that Shiba Inu may have a significant upward turnaround soon. Leaning more toward the bullish side, the Shiba Inu Relative Strength Index (RSI) points to rising Shiba Inu purchase demand, hence the meme currency might perform a bullish reversal in the near future. According to experts, Shiba Inu is in favor of these signs, so wise traders should monitor the token closely to benefit from a probable large return rebound in the next few days. PEPE Gears Up for a Massive Surge Pepe's price has declined by 20% in the past week. The token is currently trading at roughly $0.0000156. Despite the recent dip, analysts expect strong purchasing demand. Pepe's tenacity has been much enhanced by the support of the community. Recently injecting $24.5 million into the coin, a crypto whale generated rumors of a possible surge. Major listings on Robinhood and Coinbase in 2024 drove Pepe's market capital value to an astounding $11 billion, momentarily topping Uniswap (UNI). Prominent experts such as DEFI OMEGA and Jameson are positive and forecast Pepe might reach a market cap of $50 billion in this cycle. Should this happen, the price may soar to $0.0001192 a 6.8x gain from present levels. Remittix Set To Surge Higher In The 2025 Bull Run Emphasizing utility-driven businesses that can challenge established industries, Remittix(RTX) represents the future growth in top crypto coins. The main aim of Remittix is to address inefficiencies in the $190 trillion cross-border payment sector by integrating advanced blockchain technology with traditional banking models. The carefully crafted $RTX token at the center of this platform is absolutely vital for staking, governance and platform rewards. With a limited supply of 1.5 billion tokens, RTX is rapidly becoming a highly sought-after asset. Users of the platform can send money straight to bank accounts all around the globe after converting over forty cryptocurrency assets into fiat money. This seamless process eliminates hidden fees, provides instant transfers, and often offers rates that are more affordable than those of traditional banking methods. Furthermore, companies can benefit from the Remittix Pay API, which lets them accept cryptocurrency payments and helps with fiat settling.

This emerging cryptocurrency aims to surpass Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) with its impressive potential for high returns. Positioning itself as a pioneer in the $250 trillion cross-border payment industry, Remittix is anticipated to lead the pack among crypto assets in this sector. Those holding RTX are set to benefit greatly, with the project's ongoing presale already securing over $7 million in funds. Keep reading to discover more about the RTX token and the excitement surrounding it. Shiba Inu Price Forecast: A Major Uptrend on the Horizon Currently, Shiba Inu is experiencing a phase of price stabilization. While it remains on the lower end of its trading range, there are consistent indications suggesting a breakout is near. Key indicators suggest Shiba Inu could soon climb to $0.000030. In the last month, Shiba Inu's price has oscillated between $0.00001998 and $0.00002466. Now trading at its lower support of $0.000020, leading analysts like John Carter anticipate a significant upward shift soon. With a bullish outlook, the Shiba Inu Relative Strength Index (RSI) reflects growing buying interest, indicating the meme coin might soon experience a bullish reversal. Experts suggest these trends favor Shiba Inu, urging savvy traders to watch closely for a potentially large rebound in the coming days. PEPE Prepares for a Significant Upswing Over the last week, Pepe's price has dropped by 20%, currently trading around $0.0000156. Despite this setback, analysts anticipate a strong buying surge. Pepe's resilience has been bolstered significantly by its community's support. Recently, a crypto whale's $24.5 million investment sparked speculation of a forthcoming rise. Noteworthy listings on Robinhood and Coinbase in 2024 pushed Pepe's market cap to an impressive $11 billion, briefly surpassing Uniswap (UNI). Leading experts like DEFI OMEGA and Jameson are optimistic, projecting that Pepe could reach a $50 billion market cap during this cycle. If this scenario unfolds, its price could jump to $0.0001192, marking a 6.8x increase from current levels.

With a community-driven approach, the platform is focusing on rebuilding trust and functionality. Its stablecoin, USTC, is being revamped to prevent the vulnerabilities that led to the initial crash. Terra Classic’s governance model is also gaining traction, with proposals aimed at improving decentralization and scalability. These updates have sparked renewed interest among developers and investors, particularly in DeFi. While the platform still has a long road ahead, its community’s dedication is hard to ignore.

XRP Value Soars 42% in a Month Ripple remains a trusted choice for many in the cryptocurrency community, known for facilitating quick and affordable global transactions. Over the last month, Ripple (XRP) has attracted significant attention, fueled by growing interest as its legal battle with the SEC approaches a critical stage. This situation has positively impacted XRP's value, showcasing impressive gains throughout the month, although a slight dip occurred over the past week, with Ripple now valued at $3.10. Forecasts for Ripple's price remain a topic of debate among experts, yet some foresee notable growth, largely attributed to Ripple's strategic partnerships with banks and financial institutions. Chainlink Update: Gains Seen Daily and Weekly Chainlink (LINK) continues to engage those interested in blockchain oracle solutions, acting as a crucial link between smart contracts and real-world data. Currently priced at $24.84, LINK experienced a 5.5% decline in the last 24 hours, contrasting with a 3.2% rise over the past week.

In line with this, the organization has initiated a transfer of 50,000 ETH worth approximately $165.3 million into the wallet. The New Multisig Wallet According to a January 20 X post by Hsiao-Wei Wang, recently appointed to a leadership role at the entity, the wallet uses a 3-of-5 multisig configuration and is managed via Safe, previously known as Safe Gnosis. The announcement described Safe as having proven to be secure while also providing “a great user experience.” An initial test transaction has also been sent to Aave, one of the largest lending protocols within the Ethereum ecosystem. This development comes as the foundation faces longstanding concerns regarding its lack of transparency, particularly in its treasury management. Frequent ETH sell-offs by the EF, ostensibly to cover expenses and operational costs, have also drawn criticism for contributing to pressure on the asset. This has resulted in suggestions that the non-profit should explore alternatives, such as staking or deploying a portion of its ETH holdings on-chain to generate returns and meet its financial needs. Participating in the DeFi ecosystem could offer a pathway to boost the establishment’s treasury, which, over the past three years, has shrunk by 39% to $970.2 million as of October 31, 2024. A financial report released last year revealed that $788.7 million, or 81.3% of its total treasury, is held in cryptocurrency, with 99.45% of that amount in ETH. Despite these significant holdings, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin disclosed that the organization has refrained from staking its ETH to earn staking rewards due to concerns about regulatory implications, maintaining neutrality, and the potential challenge of taking sides in the event of a network hard fork. Leadership Reforms In recent weeks, several prominent crypto commentators raised fresh issues, pointing to Ethereum’s market underperformance and increasing competition from Solana as factors justifying scrutiny of the foundation’s leadership. Buterin has acknowledged these concerns, confirming that major changes are underway to reshape the group’s leadership structure. He explained that the planned reforms aim to enhance the technical expertise of the foundation’s senior leadership, strengthen communication and collaboration with key participants in the Ethereum ecosystem, and provide more active support for application developers. He also stressed that the EF does not intend to undergo an ideological shift, aggressively lobby regulators, or move toward a highly centralized governance model. Additionally, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin proposed a dual-leadership structure for its future direction. He suggested Ethereum developer Danny Ryan and Jérôme de Tychey, President of Ethereum France, as candidates to balance technical proficiency with business strategy.

If you’ve been watching closely, Floki Inu is making headlines with its bold leap into Web3 innovation, and Brett is riding a wave of cultural significance on the Base Chain. But the real star of the show? BTFD Coin, which is taking the crypto market by storm, thanks to its $5.7M presale , staking rewards of up to 90% APY, and its bullish community, the Bulls Squad. Meme coins have transitioned from being lighthearted digital jokes to serious investment opportunities. The rise of projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has paved the way for the next-gen meme coins with real-world use cases.

With the predicted listing price of $0.0006, that investment could grow to $11,250. And if the moonshot prediction of $0.006 comes true, you’re looking at a staggering $112,500 .

Floki Inu: More Than Just a Meme Floki Inu has come a long way from its meme coin origins. Named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu pup, “Floki,” this project has transitioned into a serious player in the Web3 ecosystem. Its focus on decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and metaverse integration demonstrates that it’s more than just a playful token. The Floki community, often referred to as the “Floki Vikings,” has shown incredible loyalty and enthusiasm. With projects like the FlokiFi Locker (a DeFi platform offering secure token storage) and plans for Floki’s metaverse, Valhalla, the coin is carving out a unique space in the crypto world. While Floki remains firmly rooted in its meme culture, its development roadmap is packed with real-world applications. Whether it’s NFT marketplaces or its educational initiative, Floki University, this project is laying the foundation for long-term value. With its strong community and evolving utility, Floki Inu is proving that meme coins can be fun and functional at the same time. It’s no wonder investors are keeping a close eye on this one! Brett: The Base Chain Mascot Making Waves Brett ($BRETT), inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic “Boys’ Club” character, has become the Base Chain’s official mascot. This meme coin taps into a nostalgic, cultural niche while delivering serious crypto appeal. With a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens, Brett’s scarcity is a key factor driving its value. Unlike many meme coins that flood the market, Brett’s limited supply ensures a tighter, more valuable token economy. Its ties to the Base Chain, known for low transaction fees and high-speed transactions, add another layer of appeal for crypto enthusiasts looking for efficiency and speed. Brett’s cultural significance also plays a major role in its popularity. The connection to Matt Furie’s work gives it a sense of authenticity and community that resonates with collectors and crypto traders alike. With a strong, supportive community rallying behind it, Brett is solidifying its position as one of the standout meme coins of 2025. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Floki Inu, and Brett are lighting up the crypto world in their own unique ways.
