These Metrics Show Why It Might Never Happen,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/an-altcoin-season-in-sight/,"Bitcoin has yet to relinquish its dominance in this market cycle, leaving many investors still holding onto hopes for the arrival of an altcoin season. Still, there remains a possibility that an altcoin rally might never come to fruition this season, given the recent market trends this cycle. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez echoed this perspective in a recent post on X, claiming that an altcoin season may never return. His observation sheds light on the change in market dynamics and the significant shifts that have occurred since previous alt seasons. Why AltSeason Might Never Happen An altcoin season is defined by a period of rapid price surges across a wide range of altcoins. Furthermore, an altcoin season is characterized by investors cashing out their Bitcoin profits and pouring them into altcoins. This period is always accompanied by social media hype and FOMO from crypto investors as they rush in to get in on the action. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 However, current market conditions have seen the crypto industry grow from its early days into a new market with a close relationship with investors in the traditional finance sector. Additionally, the altcoin market has expanded dramatically since the last major bull run in 2021, and you could argue that it has become somewhat oversaturated. Martinez highlighted a startling statistic: over 36.4 million altcoins are now in circulation. This is a dramatic increase compared to fewer than 3,000 altcoins during the 2017-2018 altcoin season and an even smaller pool of fewer than 500 in the 2013-2014 bull market cycle. The sheer scale of this supply explosion has fundamentally altered the cryptocurrency landscape, diluting attention and capital among an overwhelming number of assets. This oversaturation means that achieving widespread price surges across altcoins has become a far more challenging proposition than in previous market cycles. Furthermore, many of these altcoins have unclear use cases or poor fundamentals and only divert attention from specific altcoins with strong utility. Could The Era Of Altcoin Seasons Be Over? The concept of an altcoin season may be a relic of a less crowded market. Ethereum, the largest altcoin, has largely failed to perform up to expectations this cycle. Known as the primary driver of past altcoin seasons, Ethereum has struggled to gain momentum for over a year, even as other altcoins like Solana, XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin continue to push to multi-year highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dominance And Altcoin Season: What The Sudden Volatility Means For The Market If Ethereum, with its established dominance and utility, cannot deliver, it raises serious questions about the potential of other altcoins to rally. Instead, individual altcoins with strong fundamentals or unique propositions could continue to thrive while the rest of the market remains stagnant. At the time of writing, Coinmarketcap’s dominance data shows that Bitcoin commands 57.9% of the total crypto market cap, increasing by 0.69% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum is steadily losing ground, with its dominance dropping by 1.07% over the same period, now accounting for just 11.1% of the overall market.

BlockDAG , a pioneering blockchain initiative that integrates Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with conventional blockchain traits, stands out as one of the key projects to watch by 2025. As its presale nears the impressive $200 million milestone, the enthusiasm for this transformative venture is clearly justified. Could BlockDAG Climb from $0.0248 to $1? Exploring the Potential for a 3932% Return BDAG coins are currently priced at a mere $0.0248 in the ongoing 27th presale batch. Market analysts anticipate that by 2025, BlockDAG’s valuation might reach $1, presenting an opportunity for a remarkable 3932% ROI. Initial holders have already enjoyed significant profits, with gains up to 2380% from the first batch. For those yet to participate, this is a critical time to get involved before this chance passes. BlockDAG is more than just promising numbers; it represents a bold vision for the future of blockchain technology. Its advanced hybrid framework offers unmatched speed, scalability, and security, appealing to both developers and corporate sectors. Equipped to support Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), BlockDAG enables a robust platform for innovative decentralized applications (dApps). Significant CEX Listings Scheduled for 2025: Key to BDAG’s Valuation Surge A distinct aspect of BlockDAG’s strategy is its detailed roadmap for 2025. Alongside the highly anticipated mainnet debut, there are plans for significant listings on prominent centralized exchanges (CEXs). These listings are poised to greatly boost BDAG’s liquidity and visibility, potentially elevating its market value substantially. Traditionally, tokens that launch on major CEXs see notable increases in value as they attract heightened buyer interest. BlockDAG is strategically positioned to capitalize on this trend, offering early adopters a unique opportunity to be part of a groundbreaking endeavor. The presale itself reflects the project’s expanding influence, with nearly $200 million already secured. This early funding from institutional traders, tech developers, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts signals strong market confidence in BlockDAG’s ability to innovate within the industry. For potential traders, the current presale batch presents a prime buying opportunity. As the presale progresses, prices are expected to rise, making the present the optimal moment to buy at a favorable rate. With the mainnet launch and upcoming CEX listings, BDAG’s price trajectory is set for significant growth. Seize the Opportunity: BDAG Poised for Substantial Growth BlockDAG’s trajectory is defined not just by its ambitions but also by its proven commitment to scalability, speed, and developer friendliness, ensuring its continued relevance in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. As it plans to introduce several hackathons and integrate over 200 Web3 projects, BlockDAG is reinforcing its reputation as a forward-looking platform. In a market where opportunities can disappear as quickly as they emerge, BlockDAG represents a fleeting chance for considerable returns. With the presale almost reaching $200 million and major exchange launches planned for 2025, the window for early buying is narrowing. Don’t miss out on being part of one of the most significant cryptocurrency success stories of the decade—secure your BDAG coins today.

In a recent post, Kiyosaki shared his positive view regarding the crypto and emphasized Gresham’s Law and Metcalfe’s Law as the core principles that support his view. Robert Kiyosaki Explains Why Bitcoin Outshines The US Dollar in Today’s Economy Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the Rich Dad Poor Dad, recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) about Bitcoin becoming bigger than the US dollar. He said that according to Gresham’s Law bad money chases good money out of circulation. Kiyosaki noted that fiat currencies, including the US dollar, have lost credibility due to inflation and excessive money printing. He said that in this case, Bitcoin, gold and silver are the “good money.” According to Kiyosaki, such assets are turning into the safest places for investing, given that people no longer trust paper currencies. He also pointed out that people have been using physical metals like gold and silver as a means of accepting value for a long time, and now digital currency has been accepted. Robert Kiyosaki added, “Good money gold and silver have been hiding from FAKE US dollars for years. Today, Gold, silver, and Bitcoin are forcing the fake US dollar into hiding.” Notably, Binance founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao and “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki have encouraged buying Bitcoin during dips amid rising FOMO. CZ advised responsible investing due to Bitcoin’s volatility, while Kiyosaki emphasized BTC potential for wealth creation, urging individuals to buy for long-term gains. BTC Network Power Using Metcalfe’s Law Kiyosaki also highlighted Metcalfe’s Law, which states that the value of a network grows exponentially with its number of users. He explained that Bitcoin’s expanding network of users and global adoption contributes to its increasing value and influence. This principle has been a key driver in Bitcoin rise as a decentralized asset. He compared Bitcoin’s network growth to established systems like franchise networks and large corporations, which gain power from their scale. Kiyosaki emphasized that BTC decentralized nature allows individuals and businesses to leverage its growing network for transactions and value storage. However, recently, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon reiterated his belief in the US dollar’s dominance, dismissing Bitcoin as a speculative asset and not a threat to global financial stability. While the bank explores blockchain technology for operational efficiency, it remains restricted from directly owning Bitcoin due to regulations. Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver Are Emerging as Alternatives to the US Dollar As the US dollar faces declining global trust, Kiyosaki pointed out that Bitcoin, gold, and silver are challenging its dominance. He noted that the over-reliance on fiat currencies has led to economic instability, prompting individuals to seek alternatives. Bitcoin network, with its limited supply and decentralized nature, is increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation. Kiyosaki emphasized that the transition to these assets is a natural response to the erosion of purchasing power in fiat currencies. He reiterated his belief that tangible assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin network offer a more reliable store of value during uncertain times. Rich Dad Poor Dad author also warned of an ongoing giant market crash fueled by reckless monetary policies and financial mismanagement. He attributed this economic downturn to government decisions to print excessive amounts of money, which devalues fiat currencies. The author reaffirmed his bullish outlook on Bitcoin, gold, and silver, urging individuals to focus on accumulating these assets. According to Kiyosaki, they represent the best tools for preserving wealth and stability during the current economic climate.

The protocol focused on what Ethereum could achieve if the developers and the broader community shunned some ideologies. The research discussed ways to accelerate Ethereum’s development to maximize its resources. Paradigm on Ethereum Shipping Issues According to the firm, the network ships updates slowly, at one yearly upgrade. It is noted that this is not ideal and is masked by two major concepts it identified as “inertia” and “the need to ossify.” He emphasized the latter reason as the belief that Ethereum may only maintain its decentralization if changes to the core chain are slow. Paradigm pointed out that Ethereum is often torn between the need to balance values and innovation. However, the investment giant noted that Ethereum has yet to maximize its technical capabilities to start placing so much emphasis on values. “We think ossification is too risky for Ethereum. It prevents Ethereum from staying competitive as a platform, as applications and users move toward more centralized alternatives. Ossification also poses its own centralization risks to Ethereum.” As Paradigm also noted, there are ways Ethereum can overcome these challenges. One is encouraging client teams to have a say, not a veto, in development affairs. In addition, the firm said it would allocate more resources to R&D and improve the All Core Devs process. Paradigm’s Role In Improving Ethereum According to the firm, it contributes to Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), drawing on its status as researchers and engineers. Beyond this, it also assists the ETH growth with data analysis and code, focusing on EIP-7862. This EIP, as noted, does not conflict with the rest of the protocol’s roadmap. Beyond this, the research firm said it developed Reth as an SDK to help with Ethereum’s experimentation. It said it is building and supporting foundational tooling to cap its role within the ecosystem. These include but are not limited to Foundary, Alloy, and Solar. To summarize its latest take, Paradigm believes the protocol can perform better if it ships faster. Expected Upgrades and Price Outlook Based on its recent call from all core developers, key stakeholders agreed on a mid-March launch timeline for the Pectra upgrade . This upgrade has been in the works for months and will enhance usability for both developers and ushers. Ultimately, experts believe the changes within the ecosystem will positively impact prices. At the time of writing, ETH was changing hands for $3,341.89, up by 0.48% in 24 hours. Per the long-term projection offered by Bitwise, the ETH price could hit $7,000 this year.

The past year has seen many crypto enthusiasts make a fortune. Bitcoin has soared over 220% from its 2024 price of $46,000 to all-time highs of $109,000, and many new cryptocurrencies have followed suit. Cardano and Ripple holders have been on the favorable end of the crypto market in recent years, with the latter benefiting from a favorable verdict in its battle with the SEC. With the hype in the market reaching record highs, investors are seeking better opportunities to maximize their investments. 1Fuel, which has delivered a 1,700% return for its Stage 1 presale investors , has become a major name on the radar. XRP’s 2025 started on a high note XRP’s success story has been nothing short of spectacular. A victory against the SEC, new all-time highs, and talks of an XRP ETF have all put Ripple in the spotlight this year. Its unique proposition as a one-stop shop for low-cost cross-border payments may be debated, but its momentum and positive market sentiment cannot be denied. The question on everyone’s mind is: After this SEC victory, what’s next for Ripple? With the price approaching overbought territory, investors are carefully weighing their options for the next big coin to buy. 1Fuel has already emerged as a clear option. With no multi-wallet concerns, seamless cross-chain interoperability, and a strong, unified community, it stands out as a top contender. What next after Cardano hits $1 Soaring to $1.30 was a landmark achievement for Cardano. The almost three-year wait to reach $1 was worth it, but the question on everyone's mind is: What’s next? Cardano seems to need a catalyst to push higher, and the lack of one is evident in its price chart, which suggests a drop to the $0.55 zone is more likely. While chatter about a potential Cardano ETF is growing, it is unlikely to significantly move the needle. With nearly 10 other cryptocurrencies vying for an ETF, and Bitcoin and Ethereum firmly cementing their status as the leading cryptocurrencies, Cardano faces stiff competition. Cardano holders are now turning their attention to a cryptocurrency that doesn’t rely on an ETF, boasts cutting-edge technology, and prioritizes security and privacy 1Fuel ($OFT). Why the hype on 1Fuel 1Fuel is positioning itself as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency industry. With its disposable wallets and inbuilt mixers, privacy and ease of use are brought to the forefront as key focuses of the technology. However, privacy and ease are just the beginning. The 1Fuel platform integrates a wide range of features into one cohesive ecosystem. The goal isn’t simply to be another name in the crypto market but to redefine what cryptocurrencies stand for and drive global adoption. The hype surrounding 1Fuel is already evident in its presales. From a Stage 1 presale price of $0.01 to its current presale price of $0.17, investors are seeing significant gains. Many cryptocurrency analysts predict that 1Fuel could soar by as much as 50x after it lists on exchanges. The presale is underway, offering you the opportunity to secure 1Fuel ($OFT) at the lowest possible price.

Meow, Jupiter’s founder, shared the acquisition update with the community in a post on X. Notably, Moonshot is an app that enables the purchase of memecoins via Apple Pay. Strategic Acquisition to Enhance Memecoin Engagement According to Meow’s announcement, Jupiter has become the primary owner of Moonshot. Users can, therefore, look forward to Moonshot benefitting from the resources of Jupiter and an alignment of goals going forward. The acquisition could result in a unique blend of both entities, as Meow lauded and complimented the Moonshot team. The team is amongst the most innovative, driven group of people I have ever met,” he wrote in his post. This highlights that Moonshot’s team could add significant expertise and value to Jupiter. Industry stakeholders have suggested that the collaboration focuses on memes, digital culture, or humor-based projects. Moonshot’s Amazing Performance Notably, memecoins remain a viable way of engaging users in the crypto space. A clear example was the surprise launch of Donald Trump’s Official Trump (TRUMP) on January 18, 2025. The token immediately gained traction in crypto and beyond, with many raking in huge profits from the project. Interestingly, Moonshot’s popularity soared after the launch of TRUMP. Although it was launched in July 2024, Moonshot did not make much of a splash, remaining in the 309th position on the U.S. App Store ranking as of January 1, 2025. However, following the launch of TRUMP memecoin, Moonshot jumped to the top spot, buoyed by the sentiments. This saw Moonshot’s trading volume leap by approximately $400 million. This positive effect also rubbed off on Solana and pushed it to a new all-time high (ATH) of $294.33 on January 19. Jupiter’s Planned Airdrops and Ecosystem Growth Meanwhile, Jupiter has plans to carry out a major token airdrop worth $580 million this January. According to the announcement last month, it would distribute about 700 million tokens to stakers, users, and contributors in the community. Aside from using it as a loyalty reward program, the airdrop could also attract new users to the platform.

Why Crypto Traders are Crypto dumping Dogecoin (DOGE) at $0.40 Dogecoin (DOGE) price tumbled towards $0.35 on Saturday, January 25, down 20% within the 7-day timeframe. Market data analysis reveals key reasons DOGE traders are taking on a bearish outlook this week. Profit-Taking Following Trump’s Inauguration Leading up to President Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025, DOGE saw a significant rally, surging from $0.10 to $0.40—a 300% increase. This surge was largely driven by market optimism surrounding Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency stance and the appointment of Elon Musk to lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). The inauguration served as a catalyst for profit-taking, with many investors liquidating their positions to realize gains, contributing to the recent price decline. Dogecoin Price Action DOGE price has experienced a 20% decline over the past week, trading around $0.35 as of January 25, 2025. This downturn coincides with the introduction of new memecoins associated with President Donald Trump on the Solana blockchain.2. 2. Emergence of Trump’s Memecoins on Solana On January 18, 2025, President Trump announced the launch of the $TRUMP token on the Solana blockchain. The token quickly gained traction, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $10 billion shortly after its release. Trump Launches Official Memecoins, January 20 | Source: X.com The rapid ascent of $TRUMP and similar tokens has diverted investor attention and capital away from DOGE, leading to decreased demand and downward price pressure on Dogecoin. 3. Concerns Over Political Associations The establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) and its association with Dogecoin has introduced political considerations for investors. Some market participants are cautious about potential regulatory scrutiny or reputational risks stemming from the cryptocurrency’s perceived alignment with the current administration. Speculators hint Elon Musk could deploy Dogecoin for D.O.GE | Source: X.com Emphasizing this stance, after talks of Dogecoin logo on the official D.O.G.E website, speculations have emerged that Elon Musk might be considering untilzing the Dogecoin blockchain for some of the agency’s activity. This apprehension has led certain investors to reduce or exit their DOGE holdings, further contributing to the recent price decline. In summary, the combination of profit-taking post-inauguration, the rise of competing memecoins like $TRUMP, and concerns over political affiliations has collectively influenced Dogecoin’s recent market performance. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Forecast: Potential Drop to $0.31 Support Dogecoin price forecast chart show that the memecoin currently trades at $0.359, posting modest 2.53% intraday gain. However, the technical indicators suggest a potential bearish shift in the near term. The Keltner Channel highlights DOGE’s price struggling to reclaim the median band at $0.36, with the upper resistance at $0.42 remaining untested since the recent rejection. The Parabolic SAR indicators remain above the price action, signaling bearish momentum dominance. The recent 19.55% price drop over seven days reflects weakening buyer strength, as evidenced by declining volumes post-recovery. Dogecoin Price Forecast | DOGEUSD In a bullish scenario, DOGE would need to reclaim and sustain levels above $0.36 while breaking the upper Keltner Channel resistance near $0.42. A rise in RSI above 55.00 could signal renewed bullish momentum, driven by increased market interest. However, in a bearish case, DOGE risks breaking below immediate support at $0.35, with a potential drop toward the critical $0.31 support. A further RSI dip below 50.00 would confirm overselling pressure, while decreasing trading volumes support this outlook.

Currently in presale, Remittix has sold nearly 3 million tokens, bringing in approximately $6.2 million in total. Positioned to transform the crypto-to-fiat PayFi protocol, this token's growing appeal continues to attract more investors. Dogecoin's Price Surge Utilizing sophisticated AI models, analysts predict Dogecoin's price could reach $1 this year. CoinCodex, a well-known crypto prediction platform, anticipates that Dogecoin could achieve the $1 mark by the end of March 2025. The platform projects that DOGE could hit $1.04 by the end of the first quarter and reach $1.11 by April — a leap of over 215% from its current value. At this press time, Dogecoin is trading at 0.3558, reflecting a 1.0% increase in the past day. However, its performance in recent days has been underwhelming, with an 8.2% decline over the past week. Dogecoin's downturn coincided with the removal of Shiba Inu’s image from the newly launched D.O.G.E. website, created by the Department Of Government Efficiency. Although the site is unrelated to Dogecoin, its name caught the crypto community's attention due to its resemblance to DOGE. This removal also coincided with a significant drop in Dogecoin's trading volume, which decreased by 75%. If this bearish trend persists, RTX could quickly overtake DOGE. Bonk Overtaken by TRUMP Meanwhile, Bonk, a memecoin on the Solana blockchain, has experienced a more favorable price rally recently, with increases of 7.8% and 11.2% over the past week and 14 days respectively. However, its price remains down by 7.2% over the last month. Bonk enjoyed a remarkable surge late last year, reaching a new all-time high of $0.00005916 in November 2024. Bonk is currently trading at $0.00003114, showing a year-to-date growth of 196%. Its market cap stands at $2.3 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $389k. In the meantime, a newcomer in the crypto space, $TRUMP, has surpassed Bonk in market cap, tripling Bonk's figure as it reaches $6.92 billion. Analysts predict that RTX could perform even better upon launch, potentially overtaking Bonk's market cap within a week. Will RTX Surpass Dogecoin and Bonk? With mixed signals affecting Dogecoin's price and the $Trump token overtaking Bonk, analysts are very optimistic about RTX’s price outlook, seeing it as a potential standout in this bull run. Drawing parallels with the early success of Solana, experts believe this token could surpass Dogecoin and Bonk, providing investors with substantial returns. Remittix, the company behind the RTX token, is redefining international payments by merging blockchain technology with fiat transactions. Supporting around 50 cryptocurrencies, Remittix facilitates easy conversion to fiat currencies like USD and EUR, offering a swifter and more economical alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. With a straightforward flat-fee structure, Remittix ensures recipients receive the full amount sent without any hidden fees. Additionally, businesses can leverage the platform’s API for efficient international payroll, converting crypto payments into fiat and directly depositing funds into employees’ bank accounts, simplifying global operations and cutting costs. For transparency, Remittix emphasizes user control and security, removing third-party involvement in transactions. Audited by Solidproof and BlockSAFU, Remittix provides a dependable and trusted framework, with locked team tokens for three years to prevent insider sell-offs and boost investor confidence. Priced at $0.0311 during its presale, the RTX token presents a compelling investment opportunity for ambitious investors; with a limited supply of 1.5 billion tokens and predictions of up to 100x returns by 2025, Remittix is well-positioned to shake up the cross-border payments industry, outperforming Dogecoin and Bonk in terms of profit potential. What makes Remittix particularly notable is the strong investor support for the token. The Remittix presale has already raised $6.2 million, selling over 320 million tokens in total. Participants who joined early have experienced a 100% increase in their holdings, with analysts predicting the price to climb by 800% as the presale progresses.

Currently in its presale, Remittix has seen close to 3 million token sales, generating about $6.2 million in total. Set to revolutionize crypto-to-fiat PayFi protocol, this token’s appeal keeps investors increasing their holdings. Dogecoin's Price Rally Using advanced AI models, analysts forecast Dogecoin's price could reach $1 this year. According to CoinCodex’s prediction, the popular crypto prediction platform, Dogecoin, could hit the $1 milestone by the end of March 2025. The platform forecasts DOGE could attain the $1.04 milestone by the end of the first quarter and even reach $1.11 by April — an over 215% surge from its current price. As of this press, Dogecoin is trading at 0.3558, a 1.0% rise in the past day. However, its price has been far from impressive in recent days, down by 8.2% in the past week. Dogecoin's loss came at the time Shiba Inu’s image was removed from the newly launched D.O.G.E. website —created by the Department Of Government Efficiency. Interestingly, the website is unrelated to Dogecoin but its name garnered attention within the crypto community due to similarity to DOGE. This removal also marked a sharp decline in Dogecoin's trading volume, falling by 75%. If this bearish trend continues, RTX could overcome DOGE in no time. Bonk Loses First Place To TRUMP Meanwhile, Bonk, a Solana memecoin has seen a better price rally in the past few days, with 7.8% and 11.2% rise in the past week and 14 days respectively. However, its price is still down by 7.2% in the past one month. Meanwhile, Bonk had a beautiful run late last year, reaching a new all-time high at $0.00005916 in November 2024. Bonk currently trades at $0.00003114, marking a year-to-date growth of 196%. Bonk’s market cap currently stands at $2.3 billion, with 24 hours trading volume of $389k. As such, a new entrant in the crypto scene $TRUMP has now flipped Bonk in market cap, tripling Bonk’s as it reaches $6.92 Billion. Meanwhile, analysts project RTX to have even a better run when launch, which could see it also flip Bonk's market cap within a week. Can RTX Obliterate Dogecoin and Bonk? With mixed signals dominating Dogecoin's price and $Trump token flipping Bonk, analysts are overly bullish on RTX’s price prediction, a crypto token that could be the hallmark of this bull run. Citing numerous use cases with patterns mirroring the early days of Solana, analysts predict this token could obliterate Dogecoin and Bonk, giving investors monumental returns on their investment. Remittix, the platform behind the RTX token, is transforming international payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions. Supporting about 50 cryptocurrencies, Remittix enables seamless conversion to fiat currencies like USD and EUR.

Priced at $0.0311 during its presale the RTX token offers a promising investment opportunity for any ambitious investors; with a capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens and forecasts of up to 100x returns in 2025, Remittix is well-positioned to transform the cross-border payments sector, obliterating Dogecoin and Bonk in profit potential. What makes Remittix particularly impressive is the way investors are rallying around the token. The Remittix presale has already raised $6.2 million, selling over 320 million tokens in total.

This portends a 90-day restructuring plan into which the protocol appears to be entering. Those familiar with the situation say it has been catalyzed by fears of insolvency. While trading on the platform remains active, the associated token, $RUNE, has not been able to make headway and is down 30%. THORChain halts THORFi lending over insolvency fears, kicking off a 90-day restructuring plan. Trading stays active, but $RUNE is down 30%. This pause feels like a ‘bankruptcy freeze’ to avoid a liquidity crisis. Will they pull through? pic.twitter.com/GvDL01HGEn — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) January 24, 2025 THORFi Lending Halted: A Bankruptcy Freeze in Disguise? Numerous commentators have analogized the decision to stop THORFi lending with a “bankruptcy freeze,” a precautionary measure often taken to prevent a liquidity crisis. THORChain states that the pause allows it to deal with “some structural issues” within its THORFi lending services while it recalibrates the entirety of that operation. The lending service will not be available for three months, according to announcements made by THORChain and on the THORFi website. The financial health of the protocol has come under fire with the sudden suspension. Critics have even gone so far as to accuse it of insolvency. They have raised serious doubts about whether THORChain is able to meet its obligations and, if not, what that means for the growing number of users that rely on it. The situation is putting immense pressure on $RUNE, which has already lost nearly a third of its value over the past few days. Financial Troubles Cast a Shadow Over THORChain A decentralized liquidity protocol that enables cross-chain swaps, THORChain has for some time occupied a vital position within the DeFi sector. Recently, however, it has experienced some financial difficulties that have made some observers raise doubt about its future. A primary concern is whether the platform’s reserves are even sufficient to cover its obligations. Critics point to possible mismatches between the assets that the protocol holds and the liabilities tied to its lending services. If these gaps exist, they’re a ticking time bomb that could lead to significant, not to say catastrophic, liquidity issues. Compounding the problems is the steep drop in the value of $RUNE. As the protocol’s native token, $RUNE has a critical role in the THORChain ecosystem. It serves as a medium of exchange and collateral, underpinning the whole system. When a native token drops significantly in price, it impacts confidence in the system and the ability to attract and retain users. The trending cryptocurrencies getting the highest increases in discussion Friday include: Bitcoin $BTC : US President Trump has made an executive order regarding a national digital asset stockpile, which affects Bitcoin custody by banks. The order rescinds prior… pic.twitter.com/riWOR4400L — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 24, 2025 Market Reaction: $RUNE Takes a Hit The reaction of the market to the news has been quick and intense. The $RUNE price falling 30% clearly shows that investors are deeply concerned about THORChain’s financial stability. There is a clear decrease in both trading volume and confidence in the platform. When something like this happens, what we usually do in the writing community is pull back and look at the facts available to us before moving forward in the narrative. Even in this time of turmoil, THORChain trading proceeds apace. The platform has assured users that it will continue to operate core functions while it restructures. Increased activity on the RUNE token suggests that users are betting on RUNE’s replacement of asset pool balances to keep THORChain itself from stalling. Still, assurances and RUNE token activity haven’t quashed fears that pausing the lending feature signals deeper problems within the protocol. The 90-Day Restructuring Plan: A Path to Recovery? THORChain has announced a 90-day restructuring plan, and it’s a doozy. It’s probably the most significant step that THORChain could take for its platform and its users. Not much is known about the plan yet, but looking at the few details that are available—along with what we know about the impending hard fork—offers some insight into just what might be happening over the next three months. Although some see the restructuring as a necessary step toward recovery, others are skeptical. The platform’s financial position is so unclear that people are speculating up and down about the true extent of its problems. The next three months are going to be critical for THORChain—either it will establish itself as a functioning, sustainable platform, or it won’t. Implications for the Broader DeFi Ecosystem The problems that THORChain has encountered shine a light on the vulnerabilities that still exist in the DeFi ecosystem. Even though decentralized platforms are offering some new and innovative solutions to the kinds of problems that we face in the financial transaction space, they are not risk-free, particularly when it comes to liquidity management and other issues that are related to, or that fall under the umbrella of, market fluctuations. DeFi protocols should heed THORChain’s cautionary tale. They need to be well-planned and financially sound. They also need to be transparent so that users and investors—in this case, daring participants in decentralized finance—can make responsible decisions about the use of and investment in DeFi protocols. DeFi finance is real finance, with a real need for responsible participants. Conclusion: Uncertainty Ahead for THORChain The THORChain lending protocol has had to hit the brakes. It’s now not lending, but THORFi, in recent days, has been too uncertain for the team to go on with lending. And that’s obviously a turbulent situation for the team. It’s a challenge for the protocol and the team to navigate through allegations of insolvency. And when you walk into the allegations of insolvency, it certainly walks directly through user confidence and into the user experience. At this point, the main concentration is on $RUNE, which keeps taking the hits from the market’s uncertainty. As the plan to restructure the whole thing plays out, every set of eyes that can will be watching THORChain to see if it can pull off a restoration of trust and come up with a reaffirmation of its position as a key player in the DeFi space. Until then, the caution that it may have urged in the past is now, plainly, its better part. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While these big names have seen steady growth, this rising star promises even bigger gains, thanks to its innovative features and growing community. If you're looking for the best coin to invest today, this altcoin might just be your best bet for success! Solana (SOL) Shows Strength Despite Challenges Rising 34% already this year, Solana's native token, SOL, has been performing nicely in 2025. Though it still challenges to keep above the $260 support level, the token's price rose by 7% on January 22 to reach $263.54. Excitement about meme coin trading, particularly following the release of the Official Trump (Trump) token on January 18, accounts for a great portion of this increase. Although SOL might rise further, breaking beyond $280 could take some time. The token peaked at $295 on January 19, but certain signs point to difficulties for it currently. For instance, from $35.5 million on January 19 to $11.7 million on January 21 Solana's network fees dropped by 67%. Usually, lower fees translate into less trading activity on dispersed exchanges (DEXs) such as Raydium, Pump.fun, and Orca. Solana's general activity stays better than last week even with these declines, indicating that the network is still robust. SOL's performance is under intense observation by analysts as it can potentially make another step toward record highs. For now, it reminds us that although Solana is developing, market conditions change fast. Cardano’s Journey to $4, What’s Next for ADA? With its price down 3.56% over the previous 24 hours and 7.65% over the past week, Cardano (ADA) is now trading at $0.9711. Still, it's not all bad news; ADA's last month's rise of 7.69% indicates that it is maintaining support at crucial levels. This might indicate, according to analysts, a future possible price breakout. Expert in cryptocurrencies Ali Martinez has seen a rise in daily active addresses of Cardano throughout January. More individuals are utilizing the network, a clear sign of expansion. Historically, when network activity rises like this, prices usually follow with rising motions. ADA might be laying the groundwork for a rise here. Still, there is not perfect sailing. On hourly charts, a ""death cross"" pattern points to ADA maybe suffering further temporary losses. This is the situation when two moving averages cross in typically declining fashion. Furthermore, a lot of futures market traders are predicting that ADA would decline much more, which would have further negative influence. Cardano's rapid expansion and high user engagement suggest better days ahead despite these obstacles. Is ADA still on course for $4? Time will prove. Remittix (RTX) Is The Best Coin to Invest Today Remittix (RTX) is grabbing attention as the best coin to invest today, standing out as a revolutionary project in the world of cryptocurrencies.

While these established cryptocurrencies have experienced consistent growth, this emerging contender promises even more impressive returns, driven by its cutting-edge features and expanding user base. If you're searching for the top cryptocurrency investment today, this altcoin could be your ideal choice for achieving financial success! Solana (SOL) Displays Resilience Amidst Obstacles Solana's native token, SOL, has already increased by 34% this year, showing solid performance in 2025. Although maintaining a position above the $260 support level remains challenging, the token's price saw a 7% rise on January 22, reaching $263.54. The surge in meme coin trading, especially after the launch of the Official Trump (Trump) token on January 18, significantly contributed to this growth. While SOL may continue to ascend, surpassing the $280 mark might require more time. The token hit a high of $295 on January 19, but several indicators suggest difficulties ahead. For example, Solana's network fees plummeted by 67%, from $35.5 million on January 19 to $11.7 million on January 21. Typically, lower fees indicate reduced trading activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Raydium, Pump.fun, and Orca. Despite these declines, Solana's overall activity remains stronger than the previous week, reflecting the network's resilience. Analysts are closely monitoring SOL's progress as it could potentially break new records. For now, it serves as a reminder that while Solana is evolving, market dynamics can shift rapidly. Cardano's Path to $4: What Lies Ahead for ADA? Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.9711, with a decrease of 3.56% over the past 24 hours and 7.65% over the last week. However, there is a silver lining; ADA's 7.69% increase over the past month shows that it is maintaining its position at critical support levels. Analysts believe this could signal a potential price breakout in the future. Cryptocurrency expert Ali Martinez has observed an increase in daily active addresses on Cardano's network throughout January. This uptick in user activity is a positive sign of growth. Historically, when network engagement rises, prices often follow suit. ADA might be setting the stage for an upward trend here. Nonetheless, the journey isn’t entirely smooth. A ""death cross"" pattern on hourly charts suggests ADA could face more short-term losses. This occurs when two moving averages cross in a typical downward pattern. Additionally, many futures market traders are betting on a further decline in ADA, which could exert additional downward pressure. Despite these hurdles, Cardano's rapid growth and high user engagement point to promising times ahead. Will ADA reach the $4 mark? Only time will tell.

39501712,https://nulltx.com/?p=141044,1737845619,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Analyzing TRUMP and MELANIA Token Metrics: Diverging Trends and Unique Behaviors,https://nulltx.com/analyzing-trump-and-melania-token-metrics-diverging-trends-and-unique-behaviors/,"The on-chain activity linked to the TRUMP ($TRUMP) and MELANIA ($MELANIA) tokens has piqued the interest of the crypto community. Named after two of today’s most visible public figures, these tokens have revealed some extremely distinct holder behaviors, with real and potential PNL (profit and loss) that have marked them as something of an asset. And while the world was watching last week, both the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens were making primetime headlines, with some developments that are horning in on the usually low-profile space of crypto asset custody. Wallet Creation Patterns: A Shared Origin A truly remarkable statistic is the considerable crossover between the creation of wallets and the acquisition of tokens. Almost half of the holders of $TRUMP and $MELANIA created their wallets on the same day they bought these tokens. This strange behavior indicates that a lot of really interested people were making their first purchases of crypto. We are clearly in the midst of a meme token moment, with these two tokens virally attracting a lot of new entrants to the ecosystem. Profitability Metrics: TRUMP Outpaces MELANIA In terms of profitability, $TRUMP traders appear to have done better than their $MELANIA counterparts. Most $TRUMP traders are at a net loss, but the number of traders making profits between $10,000 and $10 million exceeds the number of traders reporting losses of that same magnitude. This signals that while many $TRUMP traders have not succeeded in making profitable trades, a handful of them has managed to steer the token in a direction that allowed for some “cash in hand.” By contrast, reported $MELANIA traders had a significantly greater percentage of negative PNL outcomes. This difference highlights trading dynamics and market sentiment discrepancies between the two tokens. $MELANIA trading activities seem to have been more concentrated among a few participants, which may explain the heightened loss likelihood. Trading Behavior: A Tale of Two Sell-Offs The patterns of selling for $TRUMP and $MELANIA reveal further differences in trader behavior. For $TRUMP, the largest sell-offs seem to have happened on January 19, when the price was over $60. On this day alone, traders who sold $TRUMP (and only $TRUMP) sold tokens worth approximately $78 million. And this was on a day when the token was surging. So what were these traders up to? Well, if you ask the tokenomics team, they’ll say it was a wave of profit-taking among sellers who seemingly sought to capitalize on the surge. In contrast, $MELANIA’s sell-off was concentrated in time. The majority of $MELANIA tokens were sold within the first four hours after the token’s launch, with a total sell volume of around $98 million. This rapid liquidation suggests that many early buyers saw $MELANIA as an opportunity with a very short window for making gains, leading to quick profit-taking and a trading activity level that fell off a cliff after those first four hours. Token Distribution: A Concentration of Small Holders Another important factor is the distribution of token ownership among $TRUMP and $MELANIA holders. More than 80% of holders for both tokens own less than $1,000 worth of assets on Solana. This distribution highlights the pixels of these tokens, and it shows in really bold letters that the buy button is being pushed by main street—by retail investors, that is. And that’s not a bad thing; in fact, it’s seemingly a good thing for these Solana-based meme tokens. And it is certainly a much, much better thing than if these tokens were being owned and controlled by a handful of big players. TRUMP & MELANIA Onchain Metrics 1/6 Nearly half of $TRUMP and $MELANIA holders created their wallets on the same day they purchased the tokens. pic.twitter.com/7wtEOIM1W4 — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) January 24, 2025 What These Metrics Tell Us On-chain data for $TRUMP and $MELANIA reveals the unique dynamics of meme-token markets. Both tokens drew much interest from newcomers to the space, as evidenced by a ton of new wallets created to trade the assets. But what happened after the wallets were created didn’t look too similar for $TRUMP and $MELANIA, with their trading patterns and profitability outcomes diverging significantly in a very short amount of time. The data for $TRUMP indicates a kind of activity that is a mix of speculation and strategic profit-taking. Some traders have been trying to catch $TRUMP’s volatility and have done so quite successfully to secure them some very nice gains. $MELANIA, however, is showing us an entirely different picture. The concentrated sell-off occurring in $MELANIA alongside a pretty pronounced negative PNL outcome trend has us believing that $MELANIA isn’t giving its traders the kinds of favorable long-term holding conditions that we occasionally see in $TRUMP. Looking Ahead The crypto market is still developing, and the tokens that are created in its meme image, like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, are sure to remain a hot-button issue. While the viral nature of these assets can easily generate huge levels of interest and trading volumes, their speculative nature makes them risky investments. Meme tokens are held mostly by small-scale holders, and because these tokens are so volatile, caution is warranted. If you’re contemplating trading in or investing in meme tokens, attempting to understand the metrics and behind-the-scene workings of the market can yield useful insights into the nature of the potential risks and rewards that are part and parcel of this very speculative asset class. In the end, both $TRUMP and $MELANIA, through their rise and downfall, remind us of the speculative charm of meme tokens and their almost child-like appeal to the crypto community. They may not last or hold any real value, but if they can get people talking, thinking, and imagining, then they’ve done what all good tokens are supposed to do.

39501882,https://nulltx.com/?p=141048,1737845914,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Fresh Wallet 0x977 Makes Major $OM Moves: A Whale is on the Hunt?,https://nulltx.com/fresh-wallet-0x977-makes-major-om-moves-a-whale-is-on-the-hunt/,"In a development that has caught the attention of the crypto community, an active cryptocurrency wallet , 0x977, is making a name for itself in the market. Just 15 hours ago, it withdrew a staggering amount of over 616,610 $OM tokens (worth $2.23 million) from the cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. This withdrawal, mind you, was not an isolated event. In the past 36 hours, the wallet has amassed an aggressive total of $OM tokens, withdrawing a total of 1.859 million tokens from Binance. The average price for these tokens (according to the crypto news site Blockworks) was $3.627. That means the wallet has invested an estimated $6.74 million in those tokens. And as you might expect, lots of folks in the crypto community are now rightfully asking questions. A Coordinated Accumulation of $OM: Whale Behavior or a Bigger Play? The attention the crypto community has given the wallet’s latest activity is perhaps understandable. It is not every day, after all, that a newly active wallet makes such large-scale and obviously orchestrated withdrawals of such an obviously valuable asset—especially with the amount of $OM tokens involved. In fact, the sheer scale of these operations is more than enough to prompt a discussion about whether we are just looking at a single whale making a very profitable move or a part of some larger, whale-led scheme to depress token prices. What makes this specific whale behavior captivating is that it seems not to be a single occurrence. Other wallets have been seen not just being, well, wallet-ish, but also showing heightened activity and accumulating $OM tokens. Could this be a sign of something larger looming? Are these several wallets working together in some sort of financial choreography to raise the token’s price or, just maybe, to set the stage for a big, coordinated sell-off? This conduct is frequently observed among big market players who try to amass a position prior to making a significant move—usually either an upward price shift triggered by new developments or, conversely, a large-scale dumping operation. The fact that a single digital wallet has moved over $6 million worth of tokens in such a short time span is an ominous sign for the token’s price and could indicate that the price is about to go down. This activity has an outsized impact on the price of tokens. If other investors begin to note the substantial positions these wallets are establishing, we could see a real uptrend in interest and an uptick in buying pressure. Conversely, if the wallets doing all this aren’t doing it for fun and are looking to cash out, we could see a large sell-off that would have a dramatic effect on the price of $OM in the very near future. A Closer Look at $OM’s Recent Performance To completely grasp the influence of these latest whale moves, it’s necessary to assess the recent performance of $OM itself. This token has captured the attention of a lot of investors, and for a good reason. It has shown some serious price movement of late. Right now, the price of $OM sits at $3.627 per token, but the volume of those recent withdrawals suggests that a lot of people believe $OM has a lot more room to run. 0x977’s actions could indicate a belief in $OM’s possible upside. With $OM trading at about $3.627, this wallet’s buying signifies a heavy bet on the token. “Whales” like 0x977 usually don’t accumulate without a good reason. Given the kind of price volatility that $OM has already seen, not to mention the speculative nature of many meme coins and altcoins, these large-scale purchases could be setting up for a massive price movement in one direction or the other. Fresh Wallet 0x977 Goes Big on $OM A newly active wallet, 0x977, just made another significant move, withdrawing 616,610 #OM ($2.23M) from Binance 15 hours ago. pic.twitter.com/v8rfKLJQeM — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) January 25, 2025 Although no conclusive proof indicates that $OM will tread the same way as some of the more famous altcoins that have seen their prices explode, the recent attention and enthusiasm around it have traders watching closely. In recent days, and alongside the broader market uptick, $OM has seen a dramatic uptick in withdrawals and wallet activity. If this keeps up, pulls the price up with it, and fills back into the exchanges, it could trigger a nice little price rally. What’s Next for $OM? The main issue at hand is what’s next for $OM and the wallets that have been implicated. Historically, large holders, or whales, have bought up lots of crypto, made some big moves, and then our favorite tokens have moved in some kind of phase. Whether $OM and its wallets are going to make some kind of price phase next week remains a mystery. Investors in cryptocurrency will be observing attentively to determine if larger wallets enter the market and whether the price of $OM sees a remarkable uptick in the next few days. Given the level of activity around this token, it seems certain that $OM is poised to make a significant move in the near future—upwards, if demand continues to swell, and downwards, if the increased activity turns out to be the prelude to a substantial sell-off. To conclude, the activities of wallet 0x977 and others have infused fresh vigor into the $OM market. Although, whether this will amount to any significant price action or not will depend largely on the state of the macro markets, right now, with the macro being what it is, all eyes are on $OM and the whales playing a pivotal role in its price trajectory.

This new AI altcoin is generating whispers of unparalleled potential, and experts predict it could deliver a staggering 40,000% market edge. This coin’s unique integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology positions it as a game-changer, and its disruptive potential is drawing the attention of seasoned Ripple whales seeking the next exponential growth opportunity. What sets this AI altcoin, PCHAIN apart is its innovative use of AI, the Metaverse, and smart contracts to redefine the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. As Ripple whales quietly accumulate positions, their movements suggest confidence in this coin’s ability to redefine market dynamics. PCHAIN: The AI Altcoin In Question PCHAIN is the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-powered real estate tokenization platform. The token gives investors early access to the future of the multi-trillion-dollar real estate market. Unlike most traditional crypto assets that thrive on market sentiment, this innovative AI altcoin is backed by the number one asset class in the world. According to leading market experts, PCHAIN is positioned for a massive 40,000% rally, making it a potential top-gainer in the crypto space. Although an emerging AI altcoin, Ripple whales see huge potential in the asset, which is why these seasoned investors are quietly joining the ongoing PCHAIN presale. Why Ripple Whales Are Paying Attention Ripple whales , known for their strategic investments, are very good at spotting opportunities before they hit the mainstream. Their recent interest in this AI altcoin, PCHAIN, is based on several compelling factors: Unmatched Growth Potential A 40,000% market edge is not a figure to ignore.

Digitalization of Real World Assets This is a great revolution in the real estate sector As PropiChain plans to digitalize all real estate assets and transactions, ensuring trades on a secure blockchain network eradicating the need for physical documentations. In addition this further stretches to the fractional ownership of assets allowing small scale investors to buy, sell, own and manage properties in fractions rather than as a whole. Through this process, homeowners can access financing at lower interest rates, similar to traditional HELOCs, thereby providing a more accessible and affordable financing option for property owners. 3D Metaverse Property Exploration Metaverse implementation allows international investors to explore properties virtually from anywhere in the world creating more customized options of home, offices, and commercial spaces. Its immersive 3D environment creates a more dynamic and interactive experience that far surpasses traditional methods reducing uncertainty and enhancing confidence in purchase decisions. Its AR/VR capabilities also eradicate a geographical barrier that might be an hindrance during property exploration making real estate transactions more accessible and convenient, whether it’s discussing terms or even finalizing a deal.

This is a noticeable trend as the amount of BTC available on centralized exchanges (CEXs) continues to drop. HODLers are still HODLing, and we are seeing a shift to an even more favorable supply-and-demand picture for BTC, with long-term holders clearly becoming more and more reluctant to sell their coins. BTC recorded $800M in net outflows from exchanges this week, showing demand is still strong as supply available on CEXs continues to decrease pic.twitter.com/6raOgFV0Q1 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 25, 2025 Hodler Selling and the Rise of Bitcoin Dominance A large part of this story is the long-term holders of Bitcoin selling, especially after Donald Trump was elected in November 2024. Since then, they have moved an estimated 500,000 BTC, worth around $50 billion, from their addresses. The good part of this trend is that it seems to indicate a slowdown in selling activity. And what’s good about that is that it aligns with a growing sentiment that Bitcoin is once again primed for further upward momentum. Hodler selling accelerated since Trump's election, with 500k BTC (~$50B) leaving long-term holders' addresses since November pic.twitter.com/xcpmBFwSHe — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 24, 2025 The metric that tracks BTC’s share of the total cryptocurrency market, called Bitcoin dominance, is again on the upswing. After hitting an approximate low of 54% in December 2024, BTC dominance has surged back above 57% in January 2025, signaling a renewed interest in what is still the leading cryptocurrency. This behavior, in which BTC dominance casts a shadow well over $1 trillion, echoes what happened in the 2020 cycle, in which Bitcoin’s price also saw a wall-to-wall significant rally. Back then, BTC dominance bottomed out at around 60% in November 2020 before rallying to 69% in January 2021. #Bitcoin dominance is climbing again. After bottoming in December 2024 at ~54%, #BTC dominance has surged past 57% in January 2025. This mirrors the 2020 cycle, where $BTC dominance bottomed in Nov '20 (~60%), then rallied to 69% in Jan '21 before its decline:… pic.twitter.com/ekqfdoIach — glassnode (@glassnode) January 24, 2025 The current market dynamics are best understood in relation to the dominance of Bitcoin and its price. In the last cycle, as the price of BTC began to increase, dominance began to decrease. This decrease signaled not just a shift in the price of Bitcoin but also a shift in what investors were interested in purchasing. After the price of Bitcoin had reached new highs, investors appeared to have resumed moving toward riskier assets—the next-high-altcoin or whatever else promises strong returns when the market is believed to be bullish—after allegedly having crowdsourced the safety of the appearing-to-be stable, first-in-market asset. Key Support Level and the Spot ETF Inflows To keep its bullish price momentum, Bitcoin must hold above some key support levels. One of those is $97,877, where more than 101,000 BTC were amassed. Holding this level, the analysts say, is crucial for keeping the kind of “upward price pressure” on Bitcoin that has the potential to take it where it wants to go—up. The key support level for #Bitcoin is at $97,877, where more than 101,000 $BTC were accumulated. Holding above this level is crucial to sustaining the bullish momentum. pic.twitter.com/4kMR5ZtkWa — Ali (@ali_charts) January 25, 2025 On January 24, significant institutional interest was directed toward Bitcoin. For the seventh consecutive day, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw inflows, amassing a net total of $518 million over that time. One of the main drivers behind that surge in interest was Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), which alone saw a net inflow of $186 million. And by the time January 24 rolled around, the Bitcoin spot ETFs overall had a net asset value of an impressive $123.058 billion. The current state of affairs for the dominance of Bitcoin, along with the inflows of capital into Bitcoin ETFs, tells us that institutional investors are making some big bets on this leading digital asset. They’re betting on not just the sustained outperformance of Bitcoin but also its potential to become a go-to asset in times of crisis, which is what it looks set to become given the uncertain shape of international markets at the moment. On January 24, the total net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was $518 million, with net inflow for 7 consecutive days. The inflow of Fidelity ETF FBTC was $186 million. The current total net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETF is $123.058 billion. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG pic.twitter.com/ykhS8zZR5p — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 25, 2025 What’s Next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s rising dominance, ongoing institutional inflows, and dwindling exchange supply leave the cryptocurrency’s current outlook hard to dispute: it’s bullish. But there’s another reason for optimism, one that takes us to the end of 2024 and beyond. In addition, this asset’s sustained growth in the popularity of Bitcoin ETFs provides yet another support layer. The price of Bitcoin may keep enjoying the continued benefit of a steady stream of institutional capital as more people invest in these vehicles. Most people seem to believe that the price of Bitcoin will keep going up, but few if any, prices are set without some sort of “support level” being in place. Markets seem to be eyeing the $97,877 mark as a support level, and if Bitcoin can hold above that price, it’s “probably” going to keep moving up. To sum up, Bitcoin is reiterating its vigor as a market leader. The mixture of a blow-up in its dominance, a growing interest from institutions, and a supply that is all but nonexistent on exchanges makes the prospect of further price appreciation seem quite likely. Should the crucial support levels hold and inflows from institutions continue, it seems quite probable that we will see a new all-time high in 2025.

Priced at $0.0199 initially but rising to $0.0311, Remittix (RTX) is now hailed as the fastest-growing presale around. But what sets it apart from countless other tokens? Below, we’ll explore why thousands are grabbing RTX right now, how it tackles everyday payments and how it could reshape crypto usage for both newcomers and veterans alike. The Rapid Rise of Remittix: Numbers Don’t Lie Presales can fizzle out quickly if there’s no real substance behind the hype. So far, Remittix has proven it’s more than just talk. Surpassing $5 million raised, the altcoin soared past its early price of $0.0199 to $0.0311 all in a matter of weeks. This fast climb suggests Remittix appeals to investors craving a tangible solution, not another meme coin hype cycle. Demand has spiked among individuals who see real potential for cross-border payments, especially as global finance hunts for ways to cut down fees and transaction times. Some watchers note that this rapid fundraising outpaces many older tokens that took months to achieve similar figures. That jump in interest implies that mainstream or at least utility-minded backers find Remittix compelling. In a sea of meme-driven tokens that rise and fall with internet chatter, RTX offers a use case built around streamlining remittances, something high on the wish list of countless freelancers, global travelers and businesses. The Power of PayFi: Why Remittix Resonates So, what’s driving the Remittix appeal? The project revolves around PayFi, a model blending cryptocurrency with real-world banking. Rather than forcing users to navigate complicated DeFi protocols or chase meme mania, Remittix (RTX) focuses on letting people convert crypto to fiat within 24 hours. By removing hidden fees and complex steps, it opens crypto usage up to everyday folks who might otherwise find the technology baffling. Additionally, Remittix gives businesses an easier way to accept crypto payments, automatically settling transactions as traditional currencies. This plug-and-play approach allows merchants to hop on board without dealing with multi-step conversions. Essentially, Remittix handles the backend, sparing users from digging into multiple platforms or crossing their fingers for a stable token value. That direct utility may be what’s prompting thousands of people to join the presale, less hype, more tangible outcomes. A Welcome Break from Meme Overload While meme coins have commanded headlines, the novelty has worn thin for many. Projects like Shiba Inu soared, then tumbled, as hype drained away, leaving retail investors stuck or uncertain. Despite huge gains at their peak, people are now gravitating toward altcoins with a robust blueprint that goes beyond jokes. That’s where Remittix stands out. It’s not about dog mascots or comedic references; it’s about bridging finance and cryptocurrency so seamlessly that even non-crypto enthusiasts can benefit. Analysts also point out that as interest in purely meme-based tokens cools, utility tokens could see more stable growth. Remittix (RTX) may exemplify this trend, merging the excitement of a new altcoin with a real function that addresses a global market. Even if other tokens stumble during market downturns, a project offering everyday solutions often withstands price volatility better. The Road Ahead: Can Remittix Keep Momentum? Raising over $6 million in presale is a strong launchpad but the question remains: can Remittix fulfill its promise of driving cross-border transactions and dethroning the hassles of expensive remittances? Critics warn that no crypto is failproof, especially in an ever-changing landscape. That said, enthusiastic participants highlight PayFi’s potential to carve out a huge niche, especially in developing regions reliant on costly remittance services. Additionally, the team behind Remittix claims ongoing development to integrate the token with major crypto wallets and payment gateways. If it accomplishes those milestones quickly and fosters trust among early adopters Remittix (RTX) could see a steady climb rather than the pump-and-dump cycle so common in the altcoin scene. Conclusion: A Star in the Making? Frenzied presales often reflect short-lived excitement, but Remittix stands out by tackling a global issue: expensive, slow cross-border payments. With over $6 million raised at record pace and a price hike from $0.0199 to $0.0311, it’s drawing in thousands who’d rather invest in real solutions than memes. If PayFi takes hold and mainstream merchants latch onto the ease of instant crypto-to-fiat, Remittix (RTX) might prove itself beyond the crypto bubble potentially becoming a go-to altcoin for practical finance.

Below, we’ll explore why thousands are grabbing RTX right now, how it tackles everyday payments and how it could reshape crypto usage for both newcomers and veterans alike. Remittix's Meteoric Growth: The Figures Speak for Themselves Presales often lose momentum if there's nothing substantial behind the buzz. However, Remittix has demonstrated it's more than just hype. Surpassing the $5 million mark, the altcoin has accelerated from an initial $0.0199 to $0.0311 within weeks. This rapid ascent indicates that Remittix attracts investors seeking a practical solution rather than another temporary meme coin craze. Interest has surged among those who recognize its potential for cross-border payments, especially as the global financial system seeks to reduce fees and transaction durations. Observers have commented that this swift fundraising surpasses many older tokens that took months to reach similar amounts. This surge in interest suggests that mainstream or utility-focused investors find Remittix appealing. Amidst a landscape dominated by meme tokens that fluctuate with online buzz, RTX presents a use case centered around streamlining remittances, a top priority for many freelancers, international travelers, and businesses. Harnessing the Potential of PayFi: Why Remittix Matters What is fueling the allure of Remittix? At its core is PayFi, a model that merges cryptocurrency with traditional banking. Instead of pushing users into complex DeFi protocols or the latest meme frenzy, Remittix (RTX) emphasizes enabling users to convert crypto to fiat within a day. By eliminating hidden costs and simplifying the process, it makes crypto accessible to everyday individuals who might otherwise find the technology daunting. Furthermore, Remittix provides businesses with a straightforward way to accept crypto payments, converting transactions to conventional currencies automatically. This ready-to-use approach allows merchants to join in without the hassle of multi-step conversions. Essentially, Remittix manages the backend, sparing users from navigating multiple platforms or worrying about token stability. This direct utility is likely why thousands are participating in the presale, focusing on real outcomes rather than mere hype. Stepping Away from the Meme Coin Chaos While meme coins have captured attention, the initial thrill has faded for many. Projects like Shiba Inu experienced significant rises and falls, as excitement waned, leaving many retail investors in limbo. Despite their impressive peaks, people are increasingly drawn to altcoins with solid plans that transcend jokes. This is where Remittix distinguishes itself. It's not about dog mascots or humorous references; it's about seamlessly integrating finance and cryptocurrency so even those not familiar with crypto can benefit. Analysts also suggest that as interest in purely meme-based tokens dwindles, utility tokens might experience more steady growth. Remittix (RTX) could exemplify this shift, combining the thrill of a new altcoin with a practical function that caters to a global market. Even if other tokens falter during market declines, a project offering everyday solutions often weathers price fluctuations more effectively. Looking Forward: Will Remittix Sustain Its Growth? Raising over $6 million in a presale is an impressive start, but the question remains: can Remittix deliver on its promise to enhance cross-border transactions and alleviate the burden of costly remittances? Critics caution that no cryptocurrency is infallible, especially in a fluctuating environment. However, enthusiastic supporters emphasize PayFi’s potential to capture a significant market, particularly in regions where expensive remittance services are prevalent. Moreover, the team behind Remittix asserts that ongoing efforts are being made to integrate the token with major crypto wallets and payment gateways. If these milestones are achieved swiftly and early adopters’ trust is secured, Remittix (RTX) could experience a steady rise as opposed to the typical pump-and-dump cycle seen in the altcoin market. Conclusion: A Potential Rising Star? While frenzied presales often indicate short-term excitement, Remittix stands out by addressing a global challenge: costly, slow cross-border payments. With over $6 million raised at an unprecedented pace and a price increase from $0.0199 to $0.0311, it attracts thousands looking for genuine solutions rather than memes. Should PayFi become widely adopted and mainstream businesses embrace the simplicity of instant crypto-to-fiat conversions, Remittix (RTX) could transcend the crypto bubble, potentially emerging as a preferred altcoin for practical financial applications.

According to LeCun, the biggest point to note in its rise is its vision to keep AI models open source so that everybody can benefit from it. The Chinese artificial intelligence company recently launched its DeepSeek-R1, which features better reasoning and problem-solving capacities, rivaling industry leaders like OpenAI. The AI, launched on January 20, possesses remarkable features, with tests showcasing its exceptional abilities. Aside from that, DeepSeek provides training parameters under an MIT license, allowing researchers globally to study and enhance the program. LeCun noted that the company’s success story is not about putting China ahead of the United States in the AI industry, but making sure open source models are still ahead. It’s not that China’s AI is “surpassing the US,” but rather that “open source models are surpassing proprietary ones,” LeCun said. Meta’s Chief AI scientist discusses DeepSeek’s success DeepSeek shares the same attribute with the Llama model created by Meta, with both being open source. Their rival, OpenAI, which was originally created as an open-source AI firm, has since tried to shift its mission to create technology that will benefit all humanity. The move has caused a lot of legal tussle, with Elon Musk, one of its former executives and contributors asking the court to block its transition to a for-profit. According to Meta’s Chief AI scientist, DeepSeek has enjoyed open source and open research, noting that it was the idea that some people made that they chose to build on. “They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people’s work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it,” LeCun said. “That is the power of open research and open source.” During the unveiling of DeepSeek R1, the company mentioned that the system demonstrates remarkable reasoning capacity, something that has reportedly been put to the test. The company noted that it is trying to push the boundaries of open-source AI. In its paper, the company also highlighted that it made the system because it wanted to explore the potential of artificial intelligence to develop its reasoning abilities without the use of supervised data. According to Professor Ethan Mollick at Wharton, the responses gotten from the DeepSeek R1 is like a human thinking out loud. Meanwhile, there is the issue of the R1 providing issues to AI companies in the United States, seeing that both China and the US have been rivals for a while. With Trump in the White House again, the rivalry is expected to heat up. However, the rivalry is not the main concern, as the AI model shows that China will very much challenge the top AI companies in terms of development. Silicon Valley surprised by DeepSeek announcement The launch of the DeepSeek R1 model took Silicon Valley by surprise, taking center stage in tech discussions in a week that featured various events including Trump’s inauguration and his busy first few days in office, the World Economic Forum that took place in Davos, Switzerland, and TikTok cutting and restoring service to users in the United States. Days after DeepSeek unveiled its model, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to spend over $60 billion in 2025, as the firm prepares to invest big in artificial intelligence. The Meta boss has been a very outspoken proponent of open-source models, even going as far as backing his rival, Elon Musk, in his quest to block OpenAI’s for-profit move. In September 2024, the Meta CEO mentioned he wanted to build the next generation of open platforms. Zuckerberg noted that he hopes to achieve it in the next 10-15 years, stressing that open platforms must win. “I think that’s going to lead to a much more vibrant tech industry,” he added. Making a technology open source has been hailed as the way to go, since it allows anyone to modify and redistribute the codes, this way the technology develops rapidly in a democratic setting. However, proponents of a closed source system have also argued the merits of the models, noting that they are more secure because the codes are kept private. In his case, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has mentioned that taking the closed-source approach with the company provides them an easier way to hit the safety threshold. However, he mentioned in the AMA on Reddit that in the future, he might try to open-source more stuff.

A heavy hitter, World Liberty Financial, recently plunked down $20 million for 3,001 ETH and 95 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), in addition to its already sizable stash. Over the past five days, the fund has shelled out $210.9 million for Ethereum and WBTC. There seems to be no end to this whale activity, which is part of a larger trend that has seen Ethereum appreciating 107% over the past two years. As of January 2025, the asset had reached a value of $3,294.25. #Ethereum ’un Geleceği! Ethereum, son iki yılda %107’lik etkileyici bir artışla 2025 Ocak itibarıyla 3.294,25 dolara ulaşarak dijital varlık piyasasında önemli bir ivme kazandı. Bu yükseliş yalnızca Ethereum’un kendisiyle sınırlı kalmadı; Grayscale Ethereum Trust da aynı dönemde… pic.twitter.com/jQPHmU8YWq — Baykuş (@KriptoBaykusV2) January 24, 2025 Institutional Interest and the Growth of Ethereum ETFs Ethereum’s market is not just picking up the pace with whales and institutional investors; its assets are gaining traction across the board. For example, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust has rumbled up a cool 243% over the past two years—an impressive figure in such a turbulent market—which mirrors (and is slightly ahead of) the overall price performance of Ethereum itself. This means that not only is Ethereum being bought up, but also that investment vehicles built on top of Ethereum (like Grayscale’s Trust) are being increasingly seen as vehicles in which to place funds. At present, more than 3 million ETH are held by substantial institutional investors in Ethereum ETFs, a sign of their significant trust in the DeFi world. These really seem to be stable holdings, and not just because these investors are already underwater on their ETH positions (which is why they haven’t sold). It seems to indicate that Ethereum is developing “Federal Reserve Notes” for DeFi, so to speak, and that these large institutional investors expect it to be an increasingly “accepted asset” to hang on to in the long term. World Liberty Financial spent $20M to buy 3,001 $ETH and 95 $WBTC ~2 hours ago. In the past 5 days, the fund invested $210.9M, including $119.95M on 35,995 $ETH at ~$3,332 and $66.84M on 629.1 $WBTC at ~$106,249. Currently, it holds 77,818 $ETH ($257M), including 19,403 staked… https://t.co/Yg5pS4gY5O pic.twitter.com/K4BkKmZgWm — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) January 25, 2025 Yet, even though Ethereum’s fundamentals are solid, volatility continues to be the defining characteristic of the asset, as seen in the price of Grayscale Ethereum Trust. After reaching a high of $25.04 in February 2024, the price of Grayscale Ethereum Trust fell to a low of $21.27 in August 2024, only to recover again. These movements in the price of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust serve to remind investors that the market is a very volatile one and that short-term assets can see large price changes that are not reflective of their long-term value. Mixed Investor Sentiment Reflected in ETF Net Flows The spot ETFs for Ethereum, which give investors a way to get at the cryptocurrency without holding it directly, have seen some decent inflows. On January 24, two days after we first talked to Bitwise, these ETFs had recorded a total net inflow of just over $9 million. By far, the largest and leading the pack, inflow-wise, is the Bitwise Ethereum ETF. On top of that, it seems like these inflows are being led by institutions—big players who might be accumulating Ethereum for the long haul. On January 24, the total net inflow of Ethereum spot ETFs was $9.1772 million. There was only one day of net outflow in the past 8 days. The Ethereum spot ETF with the largest net inflow yesterday was Bitwise ETF ETHW, with a net inflow of $6.0096 million. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg pic.twitter.com/DsUtQxQYtm — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 25, 2025 There are mixed signals, though, when it comes to net ETF flows. Large institutional players like BlackRock and Grayscale have seen significant outflows, while some other firms, like Fidelity and Franklin Templeton, have seen pretty consistent inflows. This divergence, I think, illustrates that different segments of the institutional market have different views on Ethereum’s future. Some are clearly concerned about volatility in the short term and have pulled back significantly. Others, though, continue to seem pretty committed and have invested in the asset. The withdrawal of 20,001.39 ETH from Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF on January 13, 2025, serves as a stark reminder of the market’s volatility. Large outflows like this one can signal a meaningful shift in investor sentiment, and they’re a good occasion to stop and think about not just what caused this large outflow, but also to consider the external factors and internal market dynamics that make the cryptocurrency market so prone to large, rapid changes in direction. A Strong Future, But Caution Is Key Although Ethereum has achieved exceptional results over the past couple of years and is now embraced in the DeFi space, it is still a very volatile investment. In our recent report on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, we discussed this volatility and the substantial movements in the ETF market that both highlight and contribute to the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. In this piece, we’ll delve deeper into the Ethereum Trust, what it means to be a holder of the trust, and how these factors correlate with the aforementioned volatility. Whales have bought over 1.14 million #Ethereum $ETH in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/7X1ibdE1IG — Ali (@ali_charts) January 24, 2025 Dominating the digital asset ecosystem, Ethereum has shown a clear trajectory of growth. The asset’s future appears bright, with more institutional investors adding Ethereum to their portfolios and Ethereum-based ETFs experiencing increasing inflows. Still, as Grayscale’s price fluctuations and the market’s short-term shifts show, it’s on all investors to manage risk and remain vigilant to changing market conditions when investing in the Ethereum asset. To sum up, although the price appreciation and ETF developments seem to suggest a bright future for Ethereum, investors must anticipate the volatility that accompanies this type of asset. As the network matures, both individual and institutional investors seem to be mounting a long-term bet on what is now the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Still, it’s a bet that looks riskier than ever—just a couple of weeks ago, the price fell nearly 30% in just 48 hours. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

With projects like Kaspa gaining momentum in scalability and Helium revolutionizing IoT, it’s clear that blockchain innovation isn’t slowing down anytime soon. These coins aren’t just about flashy updates—they’re laying the groundwork for real-world impact, solidifying their places in the rapidly evolving ecosystem. Amid these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves with its groundbreaking Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. As one of the best crypto ICOs to invest in today, Qubetics is closing in on the 19th stage of its presale, with a 10% price increase coming this Sunday. From tokenizing physical assets to offering seamless liquidity for businesses and investors, Qubetics is tackling the inefficiencies traditional systems couldn’t solve. It’s not just about catching up—it’s about redefining blockchain’s purpose. Transforming Blockchain with Qubetics’ Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is taking asset tokenization to an entirely new level. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it unites leading blockchains to create a seamless platform for tokenized assets. This game-changing application is designed for businesses and individuals looking to unlock new investment opportunities. Imagine a small business owner using the Qubetics marketplace to tokenize their real estate assets, enabling them to access a global pool of investors. Similarly, a budding artist could fractionalize ownership of their work, allowing fans worldwide to invest in their creativity. By offering a secondary market for tokenized assets, Qubetics facilitates hassle-free sales and exchanges. Its platform ensures smooth asset management, empowering investors with efficient liquidity and higher returns. Businesses can easily access funding, diversify investments, and create innovative products. Individuals, on the other hand, gain unprecedented access to previously exclusive opportunities. The Qubetics marketplace doesn’t just bridge gaps—it creates an ecosystem where tokenization thrives. TICSScan Revolutionizing Blockchain Exploration Adding more firepower to its offerings is TICSScan, Qubetics’ blockchain explorer. It’s built to provide unmatched transparency, real-time data, and intuitive insights into blockchain activity. Validators can assess performance metrics, businesses can track transactions, and developers can debug smart contracts—all through TICSScan’s sleek, user-friendly interface. From verifying blocks to monitoring transaction fees, TICSScan empowers the Qubetics community to make informed decisions, ensuring seamless interaction with the blockchain. Qubetics Presale Offering Unmatched ROI The Qubetics presale is creating waves, and for a good reason. Currently in its 18th stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0551, with over $10.6 million raised, 16,000 holders onboard, and 439 million tokens sold. What’s even more exciting? Each presale stage lasts just seven days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at midnight. This means the window to join the Qubetics presale at the current price closes soon. Analysts are forecasting explosive growth for $TICS. By the presale’s end, $TICS is expected to hit $0.25, translating into a jaw-dropping ROI of 353.39%. But that’s not all—after the presale, $TICS could reach $1, delivering a staggering 1713.57% ROI. With its mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, projections go as high as $10 to $15, boasting ROIs of 18,035.76% and 27,103.64%, respectively. For example, a $200 investment today would yield 3,627.15 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $10 after the mainnet launch, this investment could grow to $36,271.50, or $54,407.25 if it hits $15. The clock’s ticking on this opportunity, and missing out would mean passing on one of the best crypto ICOs to invest in today. Kaspa’s Growth Trajectory Holds Investor Attention Kaspa’s rise is making headlines, and the potential is hard to ignore. The coin operates on the GHOSTDAG protocol, a revolutionary approach that enhances blockchain speed and scalability without compromising decentralization. Recent reports highlight its growing adoption among whales, particularly through the emerging PlutoChain network. The focus is on its potential to achieve mainstream adoption, with price predictions indicating Kaspa could hit $1 by the end of 2025. Analysts attribute Kaspa’s upward trajectory to its growing use cases in decentralized finance and blockchain solutions. Unlike its peers, Kaspa offers near-instantaneous transaction speeds and high security, attracting businesses looking for robust blockchain infrastructure. Its compatibility with PlutoChain’s ecosystem further strengthens its position as a developer-friendly platform, making it a compelling choice for both investors and creators. With whales accumulating Kaspa tokens at unprecedented rates, the confidence in its growth potential is clear. This trust is backed by Kaspa’s impressive roadmap, which focuses on scaling its technology while maintaining its unique GHOSTDAG advantage. The future looks bright for Kaspa, solidifying its place among must-watch cryptocurrencies. Helium’s Push for IoT Dominance Helium (HNT) continues to redefine IoT connectivity through its decentralized wireless network. The platform’s innovative Proof-of-Coverage model incentivizes users to establish hotspots that power the network. This model has led to significant growth, with Helium now boasting a circulating supply of 176.96 million HNT and a market cap of $770.53 million. The past 24 hours have been promising for Helium, with a trading volume of $11.66 million—a 3.25% increase. Helium’s focus on IoT solutions positions it as a frontrunner in industries ranging from logistics to smart cities. With its forward-looking vision, the network has become a magnet for developers and enterprises aiming to capitalize on IoT growth. As Helium continues to scale, its potential for further adoption remains high. Its transparent approach and real-world use cases make it a valuable addition to any portfolio. Backed by its unique decentralized model, HNT offers a tangible connection between blockchain technology and everyday life. Conclusion Cryptocurrency investments demand careful evaluation, and Qubetics, Kaspa, and Helium showcase their unique strengths in today’s landscape. Qubetics leads as one of the best crypto ICOs to invest , offering unparalleled growth potential with its Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace and presale opportunities. Kaspa stands out for its innovative GHOSTDAG protocol, while Helium excels in bridging IoT and blockchain. Together, these projects highlight the vast possibilities in the crypto world, from tokenization and IoT to groundbreaking blockchain solutions.

39502496,https://nulltx.com/?p=141057,1737847103,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Aptos Sees Unprecedented Growth, But Bearish Signals Loom on the Horizon",https://nulltx.com/aptos-sees-unprecedented-growth-but-bearish-signals-loom-on-the-horizon/,"The Aptos ecosystem is witnessing a rapid embrace as fresh users come to the platform and activity reaches unprecedented heights. Just this week, Aptos welcomed 2.1 million new users, bringing its total user base to a staggering 47 million. The platform’s steep rise in popularity is mirrored in the almost laughable surge in weekly active wallets, which hit 5.7 million, up from 3 million just a month ago. The pace of transactions has also been remarkable, with more than 39 million transactions processed in just the last week. This surge in activity shows that many people are interested in the Aptos blockchain and what it has to offer. Given its beginnings with engineers who previously worked at Facebook, the Aptos project has surprised many in the cryptocurrency community with the speed at which it has cultivated a user base. In recent months, that community has moved a substantial amount of money through a growing number of decentralized applications running on the blockchain. The network’s participation in the ecosystem is happening at lightning speed compared to many other blockchain projects. Aptos Price Action and Technical Outlook Even though the user base and activity levels are showing a positive growth trend, Aptos’ native token, $APT, may have a challenging technical outlook. The price of $APT appears to be in the process of carving out a head-and-shoulders top, a bearish technical formation that indicates more downside could be on the way. If this formation plays out as expected, the price of $APT could drop to about $4.30. The head-and-shoulders pattern is a widely recognized technical indicator that frequently denotes a trend reversal, especially when it occurs after a sustained upward price movement. In the instance of $APT, the token’s price has not been able to sustain upward momentum above vital levels, and the head-and-shoulders formation indicates that if market sentiment turns bearish, further price declines could be imminent. Nevertheless, investors in Aptos do have a silver lining to look forward to. To refute this bearish outlook, Aptos (APT) needs to prove it can sustain a close above the $10.50 mark. That threshold amounts to a resistance point, and if Aptos can stay above that in the next few trading sessions, it would send up a signal, or a sign of strength really, that the head-and-shoulders pattern has been invalidated, and that the next probable move is a continuation of an upward trend. 𝙒𝙏𝙁 𝙙𝙞𝙙 𝙄 𝙢𝙞𝙨𝙨 𝙤𝙣 𝘼𝙥𝙩𝙤𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙬𝙚𝙚𝙠?! For starters, 2.1M new users joined the ecosystem this week—pushing all-time users over 47M+ 🪽Weekly active wallets soared to an ATH of 5.7M A staggering 39M+ transactions were processed More in your Aptos… — Aptos (@Aptos) January 25, 2025 The Growing Popularity of Aptos Although APT’s technical chart might raise some eyebrows, the underlying growth of the Aptos network is nothing short of impressive. Its addition of 2.1 million new users in just one week is a clear testament to the platform’s appeal. We can hardly call it a “fledgling project” with numbers like these. It puts speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness front and center, serving decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. The number of active wallets each week is up to 5.7 million, and this reflects a substantial and growing commitment from users. It’s not just that the network is attracting new users; it’s also attracting a kind of new user that’s very important to the long-term prospects of any platform: users who stick around and stay engaged. And stay engaged they do, as evidenced by the number of transactions. We’re now seeing upwards of 39 million+ transactions each week. Users interact with dApps, make transactions, and otherwise occupy the space that is the broader blockchain ecosystem. Aptos is also making strides in attracting developers, and its ecosystem is expanding rapidly with the appearance of more projects on the platform. Those projects are often decentralized finance (DeFi) initiatives looking to scale. They are choosing Aptos because of its high throughput, low transaction costs, and stable infrastructure. In comparison with other protocols, Aptos has a generally favorable fee structure, and it has become a go-to developer choice in the DeFi space. A Mixed Picture for Investors The expansion of Aptos’ user base and the development of network activity are undoubtedly impressive. But what about the price of $APT? A bearish technical picture is emerging there, and on the surface, it looks like this is presenting a pretty mixed bag for investors. If you believe technical signals are worth anything, the appearance of a head-and-shoulders pattern comes off like a strong sell signal. That’s signaling a potential price decline. And a price decline is usually associated with a potential increase in network activity. But what if network activity is increasing? #Aptos $APT appears to be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern, with a potential downside target of $4.30. A sustained close above $10.50 is needed to invalidate the bearish outlook. pic.twitter.com/4rHCGcOxyy — Ali (@ali_charts) January 25, 2025 When contemplating the future of Aptos, investors would do well to keep a close watch on some pivotal price points—most notably the $10.50 mark. Any sort of prolonged rally above that level would seem to suggest strength in what is otherwise a still very young and unproven asset. On the flip side, if Aptos were to drop and head back toward the $4.30 area, it might raise some eyebrows and give off the appearance of a potential bath that this asset is taking. To be fair, Aptos is a blockchain network; however, like any network, its value is contingent not only on what people are willing to pay for its native asset (in this case, APT) but also on its ability to attract users and developers. To conclude, Aptos continues to impress with its growth and adoption, but its technical outlook for $APT remains unclear. Investors should keep a close watch on price actions over the next few weeks to see if the head-and-shoulders pattern comes to fruition or if $APT can push through resistance levels and keep the upward trend going. With its burgeoning ecosystem and strong user base, Aptos is a project to keep on your radar in the next few months. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Panshibi (SHIBI) has drawn attention as one of the few meme coins making quick developments on the blockchain. With projections of a 1,200% price surge, analysts believe Panshibi could soon compete with Polkadot or Solana prices. In this overview, we'll explore why you should capitalize on this investment opportunity! Panshibi Introduces a New Theme of Meme Coins Panshibi is setting a new standard for meme coins by capturing the excitement and imagination of the real world. Inspired by the charm of pandas, Panshibi brings more than just a theme—it represents a comfortable blend of creativity and innovation. As a relatable project, Panshibi is already being hailed as the next big thing. Moreover, the Panda-themed coin has the potential of mammoth profits right from its ongoing presale. Over 15 stages, Panshibi’s price is expected to shoot up by 1,200%, with predictions of even greater growth upon listing. This combination of strategic pricing and calculated scarcity is driving interest from all corners of the crypto market. With its smart contract being fully audited, liquidity will remain locked for ten years and the ownership of the token will be renounced after the presale. These measures not only protect investors but also ensure that the project remains decentralized and community-driven. As SHIBI prepares for its debut on major exchanges, its combination of community appeal and sound strategy is paving the way for significant success. Panshibi functions on a MemeFi model that allows it to operate outside of market hype. Its platform stands out from the rest in the often volatile meme coin space. Solana Price Could Reach New Heights Shortly after assuming office, the Trump administration launched a new crypto task force aimed at establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. Additionally, President Donald Trump introduced two Solana meme coins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Over the week, coins on the Solana network have registered double-figured price increases. SOLitself reached a 38% price increase in the same period, with a $300 valuation in sight. As a result, its TVL rose to a $12.1 billion all-time high. However, traders are cautious of Solana’s 10.4% volatility and 11.8% supply inflation. While the short-term looks promising, price analysts like CoinCodex predict a Solana price decline after the first quarter of 2025. Polkadot Community Raise Alarm as Project Burns Through Millions Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading above $6.5 , reflecting a 0.08% decrease from the previous week. Once a top 10 crypto, DOT has been on a steady decline, with newer projects and initiatives taking its former positions. Recently, Polkadot has proposed RFC-0092 to reduce its unstaking period from 28 days to just 2 days. However, the project has faced scrutiny after revealing $37 million in marketing expenses, prompting discussions within the community regarding budget allocations. Despite partnering with Inter Miami FC to support educators at the Pride Academy, the DOTeconomy is tilting towards a bearish sentiment. With its supply inflation above 55%, it is unlikely for DOT to make headway soon. Conclusion Unlike Polkadot's struggles and Solana's volatility, Panshibi combines decentralized governance, transparency, and scalability to establish itself as a serious contender. With its tokens selling for $0.002 apiece, SHIBI is poised to perform well ahead of a strong market debut.

Panshibi (SHIBI) has emerged as a standout among meme coins, advancing rapidly on the blockchain. With expectations of a 1,200% increase in value, experts suggest that Panshibi could soon rival the price of Polkadot or Solana. In this discussion, we'll delve into why this could be a lucrative investment opportunity! Panshibi Unveils a Fresh Theme in Meme Coins Panshibi is redefining meme coins by tapping into the excitement and creativity of the real world. Drawing inspiration from pandas, Panshibi offers more than a theme—it embodies a harmonious mix of creativity and innovation. As a relatable initiative, Panshibi is already being praised as the next significant development. Furthermore, the Panda-themed coin promises substantial returns right from its ongoing presale. Over 15 stages, Panshibi’s price is projected to spike by 1,200%, with potential for even greater growth once listed. This strategic pricing combined with calculated scarcity is attracting interest from across the crypto landscape. With a fully audited smart contract, liquidity will be locked for a decade, and token ownership will be relinquished post-presale. These steps not only secure investor interests but also ensure the project remains decentralized and community-focused. As SHIBI gears up for its launch on major exchanges, its mix of community engagement and strategic planning sets the stage for notable success. Panshibi operates under a MemeFi model, allowing it to function independently of market hype. Its platform distinguishes itself in the often unpredictable meme coin market. Solana Price Poised for New Peaks Soon after taking office, the Trump administration introduced a new crypto task force aimed at creating a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. Additionally, President Donald Trump launched two Solana meme coins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Throughout the week, coins on the Solana network have seen double-digit price gains. SOL itself achieved a 38% price increase over the same timeframe, with a $300 valuation on the horizon. Consequently, its TVL reached a record high of $12.1 billion. Nevertheless, traders remain wary of Solana’s 10.4% volatility and 11.8% supply inflation. Although the short-term outlook is positive, analysts like CoinCodex forecast a Solana price drop after the first quarter of 2025. Polkadot Community Raises Concerns Over Project's Spending Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading above $6.5 , marking a 0.08% dip from the previous week. Once a top 10 cryptocurrency, DOT has been on a downward trend, with newer projects and initiatives taking its former positions. Recently, Polkadot has suggested RFC-0092 to shorten its unstaking period from 28 days to just 2 days. However, the project has come under scrutiny after disclosing $37 million in marketing costs, sparking discussions within the community about budget management. Despite collaborating with Inter Miami FC to support educators at the Pride Academy, the DOT economy is leaning towards a bearish outlook. With supply inflation exceeding 55%, it's unlikely that DOT will gain momentum soon.

The prominent altcoin currently trades around $3,290 as investors await the crypto bull run’s return to form. On the other hand, rising institutional adoption provides a positive development for the Ethereum community. Related Reading: Justin Sun’s Grand Strategy For Ethereum Price: $10,000 Target BlackRock’s ETHA Lead Spot ETF Market With 1.2 Million ETH According to a recent X post by Burak Kesmeci, Ethereum is currently experiencing a surge in institutional adoption as evidenced by developments in the Spot ETF Market. Kesmeci highlights that BlackRock’s ETHA accounts for the majority of this demand with net assets of 1.2009 ETH valued at over $3.19 billion. According to data from SoSoValue, this record is largely unsurprising as ETHA has experienced the highest net cumulative inflows of $3.97 billion in the Ethereum Spot ETF market. Fidelity’s FETH occupies second place with 432,750 ETH valued at around $1.46 billion. Bitwise’s ETHW and VanEck’s ETHV follow with holdings of 105,974 ETH and 45,766 ETH, respectively. Meanwhile, all other Ethereum Spot ETFs except the Grayscale ETHE have accumulated at least 7,000 ETH since their launch in July 2024. A rise in institutional demand of Ethereum as Indicated by the data above indicates strong confidence in the asset’s long-term profitability. While Ethereum Spot ETFs may not replicate the performance of Bitcoin counterparts, the institutional demand these funds command could enhance ETH market stability and liquidity, paving the way for broader regulatory acceptance and mainstream adoption. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates But Open Interest Points to Potential Breakout Short Transactions Dominate Ethereum Market In other news, bearish sentiments currently prove dominant in the ETH market as dominated by a higher proportion of short-term transactions to long transactions. According to Kesmeci, short orders represent 57% of all Ethereum futures trades indicating that the majority of traders are betting the altcoin to experience a further price decline. This negative development is particularly observed on the Bitmex and Bitfinex exchanges. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,297 after 0.17% loss in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume has dipped by 24.24% and is now valued at $25.36 billion. Based on its daily trading chart, Ethereum appears to be consolidating despite recent losses. With any price rally, the altcoin could reach around $3,700, moving past which would spur a return to around $4,000. On the other hand, another fall in Ethereum’s price could result in a slump to around $3,100, which lies its next significant support level. With a market cap of $396.85 billion, ETH retains its position as the largest altcoin and second-largest cryptocurrency in the world.

Meme coins are more than just digital assets; they’re a community-driven movement, sparking massive enthusiasm and skyrocketing ROI for savvy investors. As the market continues to evolve, new meme coins are rising to the occasion, and among them, Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Popcat are making waves. These tokens promise not just thrilling gains but an adventurous ride for anyone looking to dive into the meme coin scene. But how do you separate the hype from the true winners? That’s where Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Popcat stand out. These meme coins aren’t just another flash in the pan—they’re backed by unique narratives, community engagement, and thrilling presale stages that make them the best new meme coins to invest in for short term profits. Let’s dive deeper into why these three meme coins are grabbing the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers to the crypto game. Arctic Pablo is leading the charge with its adventurous narrative and insane ROI potential. If you haven’t heard about it yet, you’re missing out on a journey unlike any other. Arctic Pablo: The Journey of a Lifetime Arctic Pablo is no ordinary meme coin. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about adventure. In an icy realm where myth and reality collide, Arctic Pablo embarks on a thrilling exploration, discovering hidden treasures with each step. Imagine a coin that doesn’t just grow in value but takes you on a journey to uncharted lands. The narrative of Arctic Pablo is as unique as it gets, and the best part? It’s built to deliver impressive ROI for those who jump in early. What sets Arctic Pablo apart is its presale model. Instead of sticking to a boring old stage system, Arctic Pablo’s presale is divided by locations, each representing a new chapter in Pablo’s exploration. From Metropolis to Snowy Shores, each location unlocks new tokens and opportunities for early investors. Right now, Arctic Pablo is at Stage 6, and over $430,000 has already been raised. But there’s a catch—each location comes with its own limited supply and burn mechanism, which only makes the coin more valuable. Why should you care about Arctic Pablo? Here’s the exciting part: if you join the presale now, you can get in at the current price of just $0.000038 per $APC. As the presale progresses, the price will gradually rise, and by the final presale stage, it’ll hit $0.0008. But the real magic happens when Arctic Pablo launches. At a launch price of $0.008, you could see a jaw-dropping ROI of over 20,000% from Stage 6 to launch price. This isn’t just a coin; it’s an adventure. So, if you’re looking for a meme coin with serious growth potential, Arctic Pablo is the best new meme coin to invest in for short term. And don’t forget about the staking opportunities—Arctic Pablo offers a staggering 66% APY, allowing you to grow your investment while embarking on this thrilling journey. Moo Deng: A Playful Coin with Serious Potential Moo Deng may not have the same adventurous narrative as Arctic Pablo, but don’t let that fool you—this meme coin is one to watch. Moo Deng’s charm lies in its community and the promise of a truly decentralized ecosystem. With a strong community-driven vision, Moo Deng has built a loyal following that’s eager to see the coin soar. As a meme coin with a unique twist, Moo Deng offers something different from the typical Doge and Shiba Inu clones. Moo Deng is more than just a fun name. With its deflationary tokenomics, it’s built to appreciate over time. And the more you hold, the more you stand to gain as the circulating supply decreases. Moo Deng has already proven its worth in its early stages, and the community’s enthusiasm is palpable. What makes this coin particularly attractive for short-term investment is the fact that it has an active roadmap with clear milestones ahead. As the project grows, Moo Deng plans to integrate more utility and features, including partnerships that could drive its price even higher. Popcat: A Meme Coin with Legendary Appeal Popcat needs no introduction—it’s a meme coin with a cult following that’s been a hit online for a while. As one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term, Popcat is riding a wave of popularity, thanks to its simple yet incredibly effective meme status. It’s funny, it’s viral, and it’s packed with potential. But Popcat isn’t just a meme—it’s a project that understands the value of community. The Popcat community is one of the most active in the meme coin space, and that’s one of the reasons why its value has skyrocketed in the past year. Like most meme coins, the key to Popcat’s success lies in its ability to capture the attention of internet culture and capitalize on the viral nature of memes. Conclusion: Jump on the Meme Coin Train Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin space is looking more promising than ever. Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Popcat each offer something unique for investors looking for short-term gains. However, if you want to be part of an epic journey with huge ROI potential, Arctic Pablo is the one to watch. With its adventurous narrative, presale opportunities, and insane 30,692% ROI potential, Arctic Pablo is undoubtedly the best new meme coin to invest in for short term profits. Don’t miss out—join the Arctic Pablo presale today and be part of a journey that could change your financial future. The clock is ticking, and each location brings new opportunities.

Web3Bay (3BAY) distinguishes itself with a novel e-commerce and decentralized governance model, marking it as a prudent selection in 2025. With an impressive $890,000 amassed in its presale and an anticipated 6,430% return on investment, Web3Bay transcends mere conjecture by providing both utility and expandability in a market poised for innovation. Ripple (XRP) on the Verge of $4 After Market Uptick Ripple (XRP) is nearing a $4 valuation after climbing past $3, a spike driven by fresh market enthusiasm following the latest presidential inauguration. Expert Ali Martinez notes that XRP’s ascension from a bullish flag pattern may push it toward $4.40 soon. Over the last week, XRP rose by 23.4% and 40.4% over the month, with technical indicators like a high relative strength index (RSI) hinting at sustained upward momentum. With significant buying from large-scale holders, a $4 target is becoming more feasible. Chainlink (LINK) Poised for Growth, Eyes $30.81 Mark Chainlink (LINK) exhibits strong upward trends, depicted in a progressing five-wave Elliott Wave pattern on daily and hourly charts. The RSI suggests there’s room for growth before hitting overbought levels, aiming to surpass the $30.81 high. The current third wave on the hourly chart follows a modest second-wave drop to $22.17, with goals set near $30.81. Stability above $22.74 is critical, however, as falling below this could prompt corrections, crucial for traders to watch. Web3Bay: A Prudent Choice for Tangible Utility and ROI The 3BAY token serves as the core of Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce framework, promising investors real advantages and substantial growth potential. At a current price of $0.004562625 in its fourth presale phase, the token is anticipated to debut at $0.1959—offering an impressive 6,430% ROI to early participants. In contrast, Ripple’s XRP is still trying to reach its previous highs, and Chainlink’s LINK largely depends on the DeFi sector’s performance. With its broad appeal and emphasis on viable solutions, Web3Bay stands out as an excellent investment choice. For instance, a $1,000 investment in 3BAY during the presale could potentially transform into over $42,900 at launch. This remarkable growth potential is not merely theoretical; it is underpinned by Web3Bay’s utility-oriented approach. As the platform gains users, the demand for 3BAY tokens is expected to surge, progressively boosting their value. Web3Bay: Built to Last in a Competitive Crypto Market Web3Bay’s allure extends beyond immediate financial returns. Its strategic roadmap is tailored for scalability and active user participation, aiming to maintain its pertinence over time. Essential developments include: NFT Marketplace : An arena for artists and collectors to effortlessly exchange digital items. Decentralized Governance : Allows token holders to shape the platform’s direction, fostering a community-led environment. Hybrid Payment System : Supports both crypto and conventional payments such as PayPal, broadening its accessibility worldwide. Layer-2 Scaling : Guarantees rapid and cost-effective transactions, even under heavy demand, ensuring a seamless user experience. These initiatives position Web3Bay as more than a mere cryptocurrency; it is an extensive platform tackling the inefficiencies plaguing the $5 trillion e-commerce sector. Unlike Chainlink’s focused application or Ripple’s exposure to regulatory hurdles, Web3Bay is crafting a functional solution for worldwide commerce. How Smart Investors Capitalize on Web3Bay Opportunities Smart investors recognize the significant advantages of utility tokens associated with platforms that address actual market needs. Ethereum and Binance Coin, initially viewed as speculative bets, have ultimately validated their substantial market value. In a similar vein, Web3Bay is currently navigating the initial phase of what promises to be a groundbreaking evolution. To illustrate: Web3Bay has successfully amassed over $890,000 in its presale so far, with the token price escalating at each phase. This tiered pricing model incentivizes early investors, encouraging swift action to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Participants from the early rounds of the presale are now enjoying considerable gains, with the token’s projected launch price of $0.1959 hinting at even more lucrative prospects ahead. Unlike Chainlink and Ripple, which have established themselves in specific areas like blockchain oracles and international payments, Web3Bay is introducing a fundamentally novel concept—a decentralized platform for e-commerce poised for exponential growth. The successful presale, a model grounded in utility, and a vision for long-term growth position Web3Bay as a smart investment choice for 2025 .

It stands out with its innovative architecture and a clear mission to revolutionize decentralized systems. BlockDAG is swiftly becoming a hot topic in the cryptocurrency discussions. Let’s examine the key selling points and breakthrough technology that make BlockDAG a focal point for both developers and buyers. Introducing BlockDAG BlockDAG is at the forefront of blockchain evolution, tackling the inherent limitations of traditional blockchain architectures. Rather than sticking to the linear block processing of older blockchains, BlockDAG employs Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology to process multiple blocks simultaneously. This method not only boosts transaction speed but also enhances scalability. The moniker “BlockDAG” captures this blend of blockchain resilience and DAG efficiency, forming a robust platform suited for high-volume applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and supply chain management. The Core Technology Powering BlockDAG The innovation at the core of BlockDAG is its capability to process several blocks in parallel, a significant shift from the traditional sequential blockchain operations. This linear method can lead to congestion as the network expands, slowing down transactions and inflating fees. BlockDAG revolutionizes this setup by allowing multiple blocks to exist and validate transactions together, which speeds up processing times and greatly expands network capacity. Whether it’s handling numerous small transactions or complex decentralized apps (dApps), BlockDAG offers a performance that traditional blockchains can hardly match. Furthermore, BlockDAG supports both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), enabling developers to utilize familiar tools for development, testing, and deployment, thus lowering the barriers to innovation and diversifying the ecosystem. Why BlockDAG Stands Out Unparalleled Speed & Scalability Thanks to its ability to handle multiple blocks concurrently, BlockDAG ensures swift and efficient network functionality, even under strain. This scalability makes it a robust choice for large-scale applications, future-proofing it in a rapidly advancing industry. Enhanced Security The unique structure of BlockDAG also augments its security. The interconnected DAG framework increases resilience against certain attacks, where altering any transaction demands substantial computational resources, thus ensuring the integrity of the network. Seamless Interoperability BlockDAG’s support for EVM and WASM facilitates an easier transition for developers looking to migrate existing projects or kick-start new ones. This adaptability is crucial in attracting a diverse developer base to the platform. A Developer-Centric Ecosystem BlockDAG is not just focused on technology; it aims to cultivate a thriving community of innovators. Partnering with HackerEarth, a global developer network, BlockDAG is committed to encouraging innovation through upcoming hackathons designed to stimulate over 200 Web3 projects, demonstrating its capacity as a developer-friendly ecosystem. A Record-Breaking Presale BlockDAG’s presale is turning heads, raising a whopping $184.5 million so far. Currently in its 27th batch, BDAG coins are priced at $0.0248, offering an attractive opportunity for anyone looking to buy early. Early adopters are already reaping rewards. Those who joined in the first batch have seen their holdings grow by 2380%. And there’s more to come—analysts predict BDAG could hit $1 by 2025. For those jumping in now, that means a potential 3932% return. What makes BlockDAG stand out is its practical potential. The platform’s speed and scalability make it a perfect fit for industries like finance and logistics. Think of a supply chain where transactions are processed instantly, or a DeFi platform that effortlessly handles millions of users without delays. This practicality is why developers and businesses are gravitating toward BlockDAG. By solving key blockchain issues like slow speeds, high costs, and scalability limits, it’s emerging as a solution not just for today’s problems, but for the innovations of tomorrow. The Ideal Time to Buy With the presale price at $0.0248, now is an exceptional time to buy. The mainnet launch is set for early 2025, and as the launch approaches, the opportunity to purchase at this level will diminish. As BlockDAG continues to attract more developers and expand its ecosystem, the demand for BDAG coins is likely to surge, potentially increasing their market value.

These factors appear to be shifting the market sentiment that DOGE has been witnessing. Elon Musk and Blockchain Technology Recently, Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of SpaceX and Tesla, revealed that he is exploring blockchain technology to make the DOGE department more efficient and to track government performance. Musk’s thoughts have gained significant attention from crypto experts and analysts. Looking at this, Cardano blockchain founder Charles Hoskinson posted on X (formerly Twitter) and stressed, “I’m thinking this is a job for a triumvirate of Cardano, Bitcoin, and Midnight. Yo, Dogemaster Elon Musk, give us a call. We’ll do it for free.” Well, I'm thinking this is a job for a triumvirate of Cardano, Bitcoin, and Midnight. Yo, dogemaster @elonmusk , give us a call.

Current Price Momentum Despite these positive developments, DOGE is currently trading near $0.354 and has witnessed a price surge of 1.35% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bullish, as it is currently at a crucial support level provided by the trendline and is also poised for an inclined trendline breakout on the four-hour time frame. Since December 2024, DOGE has taken support from this trendline four times, and each time, it has witnessed impressive upside momentum. Source: Trading View Looking at the historical price momentum, experts are expecting a similar kind of upside momentum. Based on the recent price action, if DOGE breaches the trendline and closes a four-hour candle above the $0.365 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 20% to reach the $0.43 level in the future.",News|Crypto news|Meme Coins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-26 00:30:11

Now, picture missing the boat because you hesitated when the market offered dips. In the volatile yet thrilling world of cryptocurrency, timing isn’t just everything—it’s your golden ticket. While Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Brett (BRETT) have solidified their spots among meme coin enthusiasts, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is grabbing attention with its amazing presale performance and innovative Bulls Squad. The 14th stage of BTFD’s presale has already raised over $5.6 million, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing. So, what makes BTFD Coin the must-watch contender for 2025? Here’s the deal: the BTFD presale has thrown a 100% bonus offer into the mix—a tantalizing reward for investors who act now. With the LAUNCH100 bonus code, buyers can double their coins. Intrigued yet? Let’s dive deeper into how BTFD is shaping up to be the best new meme coin to join for the long term. BTFD Coin: More Than a Meme, It’s a Movement At the heart of BTFD Coin lies a rallying cry: “ Buy The Dip .” This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a call to action for savvy investors who understand the value of seizing opportunities hidden in market chaos. Built on Ethereum for enhanced security and scalability, BTFD isn’t merely a token—it’s a thriving ecosystem powered by a dedicated community and a bold vision. With over 9,500 coin holders and 67 billion coins sold, BTFD is on track to become a game-changer in the meme coin space. The Bulls Squad: Meet the Guardians of the Dip At the heart of BTFD is the Bulls Squad, a dynamic team of mascots that encapsulates the project’s spirit of resilience and community. Baby Bull : The visionary face of BTFD, Baby Bull represents the optimism of buying the dip and inspires the community to hold strong. Raging Bull : This creative powerhouse ensures BTFD’s visuals and branding stay bold and exciting. Nerdy Bull : The brains behind the operation, Nerdy Bull guarantees that BTFD’s infrastructure runs smoothly. Peoples Bull : As the community’s voice, Peoples Bull keeps everyone engaged and informed, fostering a sense of belonging among investors. Together, the Bulls Squad fuels the BTFD movement, creating a robust community that thrives on market downturns and positions itself for massive gains during bull cycles. Staking and P2E Game: More Reasons to Join BTFD doesn’t stop at just meme coin hype—it brings real utility to the table. Its staking program offers an impressive 90% APY, letting investors earn substantial passive income. Plus, the full version of its P2E game is now live, allowing players to earn rewards while enjoying an immersive gaming experience. And let’s not forget the referral program: top referrers can earn 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens . With these features, BTFD is setting a new standard for meme coins, offering multiple ways for investors to profit while being part of a thriving community. Pepe Coin: A Meme Coin OG Pepe Coin has been a household name among crypto enthusiasts, celebrated for its nostalgic appeal and strong community backing. While it’s not currently offering any presale bonuses or new features, its longevity in the market showcases its resilience. Pepe Coin thrives as a reminder of how memes and community-driven projects can hold their ground in the volatile crypto world. With a massive following and its position as a cultural phenomenon, Pepe continues to serve as a reliable investment for those seeking to diversify their portfolios. However, with no ongoing incentives comparable to BTFD’s presale, it’s clear which project offers more excitement for new investors. Brett: The New Kid on the Block Brett is another meme coin gaining traction, known for its irreverent humor and unique branding. While still relatively new, Brett has carved out a niche among younger crypto enthusiasts who appreciate its playful approach. With no P2E games or staking programs currently available, Brett’s primary appeal lies in its potential to grow as a cultural icon. Despite its limitations, Brett’s ability to rally a loyal fanbase has ensured its spot in the meme coin conversation. Yet, when compared to BTFD’s robust ecosystem, Brett feels more like a side hustle than a main event. A Few Reasons Why BTFD Stands Out What sets BTFD Coin apart is its ability to combine innovation with community. With features like the Bulls Squad, the 100% bonus offer, and real utility through its P2E game and staking rewards, BTFD offers a comprehensive package for investors. The presale’s strategic structure—with escalating prices and token burns—ensures scarcity and value growth for early adopters. Investors who understand the importance of buying the dip will find BTFD’s presale an irresistible opportunity. With over $5.6 million raised and a price trajectory aiming for $0.0006 post-presale, now is the time to act. Don’t Miss Out on the 100% Bonus With the presale currently in Stage 14 , BTFD is offering a limited-time 100% bonus for investors who use the LAUNCH100 code. Here’s how it works: Visit the BTFD Presale . Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Enter the bonus code “LAUNCH100” in all caps. Input your desired investment amount and confirm the transaction. Every $4500 invested at $0.00016 per BTFD coin results in 28,125,000 tokens, which doubles to 56,250,000 tokens with the bonus code. At the end of the presale, when BTFD hits $0.0006, this investment could skyrocket to $33,750 in value—a stunning 650% ROI. Conclusion: Seize the Moment with BTFD Coin Meme coins are no longer just about laughs; they’re serious business. While Pepe Coin and Brett offer nostalgic and fun alternatives, BTFD Coin is the best new meme coin to join for long term growth. With its thriving community, innovative features, and irresistible presale incentives, BTFD is setting the stage for massive returns. The choice is yours: Watch from the sidelines or join the Bulls Squad today. With the LAUNCH100 bonus code doubling your investment, this is your chance to turn every dip into a golden opportunity. Don’t miss out— head to the BTFD presale now and ride the wave to the next bull run!

The post, co-authored by executives at the crypto-focused VC firm, has once again shed light on the current issues surrounding Ethereum’s leadership and future. The post was co-authored by Paradigm’s CTO Georgios Konstantopoulos, the firm’s co-founder Matt Huang, and its general partners Dan Robinson and Charlie Noyes. In the post, the authors highlighted Ethereum’s prowess as a driving force in the crypto sector, highlighting several aspects including smart contracts, decentralized finance, and decentralized autonomous organizations, among others that have been developed in the ecosystem. The post highlighted the great work that community developers and engineers have done, building a strong foundation for decentralized applications in the future. Paradigm calls for accelerated development on Ethereum The paradigm executives highlighted that the first version of the Ethereum protocol was launched about two years ago, the first project that drew the attention of Paradigm and the entire crypto industry. However, the ecosystem’s core protocol should be improving at a faster pace. The post highlights that Ethereum can make some integral improvements that will help it reach this goal without sacrificing its values. ETHEREUM ACCELERATION . With @matthuang , @danrobinson & @_charlienoyes . pic.twitter.com/5TJq3G7HhX — Georgios Konstantopoulos (@gakonst) January 25, 2025 According to the post, the executives are calling on Ethereum to increase its development pace, shipping more than a major update every year. The authors argue against the notion that the best way to protect the decentralization of Ethereum is to slow down the development of the core protocol. “The core development process is one of the main mechanisms for off-chain governance by Ethereum’s social layer, and reflects input from engineers, researchers, validators, and institutions,” the post states. “Ossifying the core protocol would mean abandoning that governance mechanism and Ethereum’s ability to evolve in response to changes in the market structures of areas like L2s and MEV,” the authors added. The authors highlight areas of improvement Paradigm executives highlighted several areas that Ethereum needs to make improvements. According to the authors, there are some improvements that the network can ship quickly instead of holding it off and fitting it in one big annual upgrade. The post mentioned that these improvements are non-controversial but are not done under the perception that only a few changes can be made annually. It mentioned that instead of trying to limit ambitions, Ethereum should do more faster. According to the post, changes like repricing L1’s opcodes to scale Ethereum without making changes to the gas limit. Other changes the authors suggested include improving the UX of batched transactions through further development of the account abstraction framework and developing rollups to meet the increasing demand. The post also shed light on Paradigm’s work on the Reth Ethereum client, which it says holds about 2% of Ethereum’s execution clients. According to Client Diversity, the leading client, Geth, currently holds a 43% market share, with Nethermind coming in second place, claiming around 36% of the market. “We built Reth intentionally as an SDK for building “EVM-core” nodes to enable experimentation and innovation by researchers and engineers,” the post states. “We invite the research community to collaborate with us in prototyping new features towards improving Ethereum’s performance, censorship resistance, and future-proofing, with Reth,” the post reads. The authors finalized the post by mentioning that shipping faster is the only important thing that Ethereum can do to expand what it can do, noting that it will help the protocol deliver the visions in its roadmap. The post highlighted that if it is achieved, then it will pave the way for a global and trust-minimized financial system.

The trader Ali Martinez tells his 118,700 followers on the social media platform X that the RWA project Ondo Finance ( ONDO ) “appears to be breaking out of a bull flag.” A bull flag is typically viewed as a bullish pattern, suggesting that an asset is consolidating before kicking off on a new rally.

At the time of writing, XRP is the third-largest crypto by market cap, and current buying trends suggest it might stay there for a while. As of January 25, 2025, the altcoin has a total supply of 100 billion tokens, with approximately 57.64 billion currently in circulation. Notably, a significant portion of this circulating supply is concentrated among a small number of wallets. Specifically, the top 10 addresses hold about 20.99% of the circulating supply, while the top 50 addresses control approximately 53.3%, which raises the question about the distribution of wealth in the ecosystem and who stands to benefit the most from the price rally. Top 20 Wallets And Their Dominance Over XRP Supply The largest XRP holdings are primarily associated with Ripple Labs, its founders, and major cryptocurrency exchanges. In terms of numbers, data from Coincarp shows that out of the 4,840,747 addresses, the top 20 holders, the top 50 holders, and the top 100 holders hold 50.31%, 63.74%, and 71.76% of the circulating supply, respectively. Related Reading: XRP Price Rallies To ATH At $3.4, Here’s What’s Driving It And Why The Pump Will Continue According to distribution data, Ripple Labs currently owns around 46 billion XRP tokens, although most are locked in escrow. These tokens are released periodically in pre-set amounts, limiting Ripple’s ability to freely access or manipulate the escrowed funds. Even with these restrictions, Ripple Labs holds a considerable amount of liquid XRP. Data from blockchain explorer Bithomp indicates that one of Ripple’s wallet addresses alone contains over 1.3 billion XRP. Also, Ripple Labs co-founder Chris Larsen is the largest individual holder of XRP, holding over 5 billion tokens, making him one of the wealthiest individuals in the ecosystem. Major exchanges like Binance and Uphold also manage significant reserves. For instance, one of Binance’s wallets holds over 1.3 billion XRP, accounting for approximately 1.33% of the circulating supply. South Korean-based crypto exchange Upbit also holds about 4.38% of the total supply, among a few other exchanges. Holding Distribution: Anything To Fear? These large-scale holdings by exchanges and Ripple-related entities paint a picture of an XRP ecosystem dominated by a relatively small group of stakeholders. However, when you think about it, these large holdings are not in the hands of any private company or individual that would potentially be at risk of manipulating the price for their benefit. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Bullish Flag Breakout That Could Put 50% Gains On The Board Furthermore, the bulk held by exchanges represents aggregated assets belonging to thousands, if not millions, of individual users. As such, their concentration in exchanges does not pose any unnatural risk to the natural price dynamics for XRP. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.10, having recently reached a seven-year high of $3.38.

Key market indicators suggest SOL could witness further downsizing as Ethereum’s makes a gradual resurgence after Vitalik Buterin announced the team’s intent to stop selling ETH. With SOL recently struggling to hold momentum as selling pressure builds, Ethereum (ETH) stabilizes above the $3,100-$3,300 support zone. This contrasting price action highlights the growing divergence between the two major Layer-1 competitors, as Ethereum’s looks poised to regain market dominance. Solana Price Weakens as Ethereum Stabilizes Solana (SOL) continues to show bearish price action as Ethereum’s (ETH) stability amid volatile market trends suggests traders are selectively navigating the markets. Analyzing the Ethereum price forecast chart , ETH price is consolidating above a key support zone between $3,050 and $3,208. This support is reinforced by the 200-day Moving Average (MA), a critical technical indicator for gauging long-term trends. Solana Price Technical Analysis vs. Ethereum (ETH) According to the TradingView chart above, ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near 47.57, signaling neutral momentum and potential for accumulation. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram shows mild bearish divergence but suggests weakening downside pressure, as recent bars narrow toward the zero line. These factors point to ETH price stabilizing, creating a subdued environment for correlated altcoins like Solana. SOL, by contrast, lacks strong institutional interest evident in Ethereum’s support zones. With ETH finding buyers near its 200-day MA and key horizontal levels, SOL’s price weakness could signal a flight to safety toward larger-cap assets. If Ethereum continues to consolidate above $3,200, it could exert indirect resistance on SOL, limiting its ability to recover in the short term. Solana bulls must reclaim lost support zones to shift sentiment to the next bullish phase. Solana Price Forecast: SOL To Crash 20% As Selling Pressure Builds Looking at the near-term Solana price forecast , current market dynamics indicate a bearish outlook, with a potential 20% decline as selling pressure intensifies. As seen in the chart below, SOL price has recently breached key support levels, including the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $232.51 and the 200-day SMA at $168.88, signaling weakening demand. The Swing Failure Pattern (SFP) due to excessive selling further confirms the bearish sentiment, as buyers failed to sustain upward momentum, leading to a breakdown. Solana Price Forecast The price is currently testing the range midpoint at $232.51, which now acts as resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and other momentum indicators are likely in oversold territory, but without significant buying interest, a rebound seems unlikely. The demand zone around $168.88, aligned with the 200-day SMA, is the next critical support level.

Specifically, the Bitcoin price has been able to weather the uncertain storm clouding the cryptocurrency market over the past few days. While the premier cryptocurrency might have slowed down in recent days, the latest on-chain observation shows that BTC is likely to continue its upward movement. Here’s how the token price might be gearing for another leg up over the coming weeks. Is There Room For Further BTC Price Growth? In a Jan. 24 post on the X platform, market intelligence firm Glassnode explained that the Bitcoin price is not yet overheating and still has the potential for further growth over the next few weeks. This on-chain revelation is based on the Mayer Multiple indicator, which is calculated as the ratio between as asset price and the 200-day moving average (200DMA). The Mayer Multiple measures the distance of the Bitcoin price from its long-term average to estimate overbought and oversold conditions. This metric is also used to establish macro bull or bear bias when analyzing cyclical price movements. Historically, the Mayer Multiple signals an overbought market condition and a potential price top when its value is above 2.4. On the other hand, a Mayer Multiple value below 0.8 suggests an oversold condition and that a market bottom might be in. According to data from Glassnode, the value of Bitcoin’s Mayer Multiple stands at 1.37, indicating that the premier cryptocurrency is still quite a distance from the overbought territory. This piece of data implies that BTC still has room for further growth in this cycle. Moreover, the Bitcoin price is at least 35% above the 200-day moving average, which is a bullish signal. Glassnode highlighted that the price of Bitcoin would need to surge above $180,000 to become overbought. This price level represents the potential peak for the flagship cryptocurrency in this current cycle and could be followed by a trend reversal. With the oversold threshold at 0.8, the Mayer Multiple places the Bitcoin price bottom at around $60,000. The Bitcoin price has not been particularly impressive since surpassing the $100,000 mark, leading to shouts of a price top in the market. This indicator somewhat provides insight into the potential path of the premier cryptocurrency over the next few months. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin sits just below $105,000, reflecting no significant movement in the past day.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|btc|BTCUSDT|Glassnode,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-26 02:00:22

As 2025 unfolds, the focus is on projects that have demonstrated resilience, innovation, and the potential for significant returns. From digital currencies aiming to revolutionize cross-border transactions to tokens driving blockchain scalability, these altcoins are reshaping the investment landscape. Qubetics , Terra Classic, and SEI have emerged as standout projects, making a compelling case for why they are the best altcoins to buy in January 2025. Qubetics, in particular, is capturing attention with its presale performance and groundbreaking Web3 solutions. It’s a name that’s becoming synonymous with innovation and accessibility in the blockchain world. With milestones like over $10.6 million raised during its presale and advanced tools designed for developers and businesses, Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in the Web3 era. Meanwhile, Terra Classic and SEI continue to build their reputations within the crypto space. Terra Classic, known for its ongoing commitment to reducing token supply, remains a favorite among value-seeking investors. SEI, on the other hand, focuses on speed and scalability, attracting developers and strategic partners alike. Each project has carved out a niche, serving diverse investor interests. Here’s why they’re among the best altcoins to buy in January 2025. Qubetics: The World’s First Web3 Aggregator Redefining Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics is making waves, and it’s easy to see why. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator , this project is designed to simplify blockchain and decentralized applications (dApps) for everyone, from tech-savvy professionals to everyday users. With over $10.6 million raised during its presale, more than 439 million $TICS tokens sold, and a growing community of over 16,000 token holders, Qubetics is quickly becoming a household name in the crypto space. Priced at $0.0551 in its 18th presale stage, analysts are forecasting remarkable returns for $TICS holders. By the end of the presale, $TICS is projected to reach $0.25, a staggering 353.39% return. But the excitement doesn’t stop there. Post-presale predictions suggest $TICS could soar to $5 or even $15 after the Mainnet launch, offering unparalleled investment potential. The buzz around Qubetics isn’t just about the numbers. Its innovative focus on cross-border transactions is a game-changer. Picture a small e-commerce business in Buenos Aires trying to pay suppliers in another country. Traditional banking methods are slow, expensive, and often riddled with hidden fees. Qubetics streamlines the process, enabling fast, cost-effective, and secure payments that eliminate middlemen. Imagine a freelance designer in Mexico City receiving instant payments from clients worldwide—that’s the future Qubetics is building. The QubeQode IDE further sets Qubetics apart by empowering developers to create and deploy dApps seamlessly. Whether it’s a blockchain-based supply chain solution or a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, the possibilities are endless. By providing businesses and individuals with accessible tools, Qubetics is breaking down barriers and redefining what’s possible in the Web3 space. Terra Classic: The Token That Keeps Evolving Terra Classic has weathered its share of challenges, but its resilience has solidified its place as a staple in the crypto market. With a current price of $0.0000815, Terra Classic continues to attract investors drawn to its innovative approach to reducing token supply. Earlier this month, Finance executed a burn of 1.7 billion LUNC tokens, aiming to lower the circulating supply and enhance its long-term value. What makes Terra Classic stand out is its community-driven approach. Investors and developers alike have rallied behind the project, ensuring its survival and growth even in turbulent times.

With success stories like Dogecoin paving the way, the new year introduces Arctic Pablo, a meme coin with an adventurous twist. The crypto landscape is buzzing with opportunities, and if you missed Dogecoin’s early days, this could be your shot at a high-potential investment. Arctic Pablo is creating waves with its presale, unique narrative, and massive ROI potential, while Dogecoin continues to prove its staying power. Let’s dive into these two captivating projects and uncover why they’re the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in January 2025. Arctic Pablo: A Mystical Journey to Riches Imagine a daring explorer named Arctic Pablo braving icy tundras, his snowmobile blazing trails through frostbitten terrains. This isn’t just a story—it’s the heart of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC). As Arctic Pablo discovers mystical tokens hidden in icy realms, he invites the world to join him on a journey that blends myth with reality. With each location in the presale, Arctic Pablo uncovers new treasures, and early investors are reaping the rewards. The Arctic Pablo presale has already raised over $430,000 in just 15 days, and the momentum is growing fast. With a current price of $0.000038, $APC offers early adopters an unmatched chance for exponential gains. By the time it hits its final presale price of $0.0008 and a launch price of $0.008, investors could see returns of over 30,692%. Arctic Pablo’s weekly token burns during the presale ensure scarcity, driving up value. Every unsold token is permanently removed, creating a deflationary environment that benefits holders. Combined with a 66% APY staking program, $APC is designed to reward long-term investors. Picture this: by staking your tokens, you’re not only earning rewards but also participating in Arctic Pablo’s legendary journey. Unlike traditional presales divided into stages, Arctic Pablo’s is location-based. Currently, he’s in Metropolis, a realm filled with untapped treasures, and his next destination is Snowy Shores. But here’s the twist: if he discovers the treasure earlier than expected, the presale will move on—leaving latecomers behind. This unique approach adds urgency and excitement, making $APC one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in January 2025. Arctic Pablo isn’t just about financial returns; it’s a narrative-driven adventure that brings investors into a story of exploration and discovery. Don’t wait until the final presale location—join the journey now and secure your stake in Arctic Pablo’s mystical legacy. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin That Started It All No discussion of meme coins is complete without mentioning Dogecoin. What began as a playful jab at Bitcoin has now become one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies globally. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value surged by over 15,000%, making millionaires out of early adopters. Its mascot, the Shiba Inu dog, has become a cultural icon, symbolizing the fun and community-driven nature of crypto. Dogecoin operates on simplicity. It doesn’t promise elaborate narratives or cutting-edge features; instead, it thrives on its loyal fanbase and massive adoption. From tipping content creators to facilitating microtransactions, Dogecoin has cemented its utility. But with its current price hovering around $0.07, many investors wonder if it can replicate its past performance. Here’s where Arctic Pablo shines as a complementary investment. While Dogecoin offers stability and brand recognition, Arctic Pablo delivers innovation and high ROI potential. Imagine owning Dogecoin back in 2013—that’s the kind of opportunity Arctic Pablo presents today. And with its presale still in early phases, now’s the time to act. Dogecoin’s journey also underscores the importance of timing. Early adopters saw exponential gains, but those who joined late missed out on the windfall. Don’t let history repeat itself. Arctic Pablo’s adventurous narrative and deflationary tokenomics could make it the next big thing in the meme coin space. If you’ve been on the sidelines, it’s time to take the plunge and be part of Arctic Pablo’s journey. Conclusion: The Time to Act Is Now Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo and Dogecoin are the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in January 2025. Arctic Pablo’s presale is a golden opportunity to join a thrilling adventure with unmatched ROI potential, while Dogecoin’s legacy continues to provide value and stability. Whether you’re an experienced investor or a curious newcomer, now is the time to act. Don’t let these opportunities pass you by. Join the Arctic Pablo presale today and secure your place in a story of wealth and discovery.

Trump Buys XRP (TRUMPXRP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPXRP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Buys XRP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys XRP could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys XRP launched with over $32,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys XRP on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys XRP by entering its contract address (CA) – HjQUfYDa2vgcG3AYb8z5Sernxm1ttRfhjL4N7A65BY7x – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPXRP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|XRP|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 02:48:20

While these coins make headlines for their viral appeal, their reliance on hype often overshadows a lack of real-world utility. In contrast, Lightchain AI is emerging as a project with substance, combining blockchain and artificial intelligence to address tangible challenges. Currently priced at $0.005625 during its presale and having raised over $12.8 million, Lightchain AI offers a long-term alternative for investors seeking more than speculative gains. Rise (and Limits) of $TRUMP and $MELANIA Coins $TRUMP and $MELANIA coins have drawn significant attention by leveraging their ties to high-profile figures. Their launches created a frenzy among meme coin enthusiasts, leading to sharp price increases fueled by social media and retail hype. These coins have become cultural symbols for supporters of Donald and Melania Trump, with their political branding serving as the primary driver of interest. However, the volatility of these meme coins highlights their biggest drawback – a lack of utility. Once the hype subsides, these tokens often struggle to maintain value, leaving investors exposed to significant risks. This has led many to seek alternatives with sustainable growth potential and real-world applications—such as Lightchain AI . Lightchain AI – Beyond the Hype Unlike $TRUMP and $MELANIA, Lightchain AI is grounded in innovation and utility. One of its key features is its AI-Driven Decentralized Data Solutions, which enable businesses to securely store, process, and analyze data using blockchain technology. This innovation appeals to enterprises that require efficient and scalable systems for managing sensitive information. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s Presale Structure demonstrates its commitment to fostering an engaged community. By raising over $12.8 million during its presale, the platform has shown strong early-stage adoption, with investors confident in its ability to deliver on its promises. Lightchain AI’s roadmap, including its testnet launch in January 2025 and mainnet rollout in March, provides clear milestones for growth. Why Investors Are Choosing Lightchain AI For investors, the choice between meme coins and utility-driven projects like Lightchain AI is becoming increasingly clear. While $TRUMP and $MELANIA offer short-term excitement, their speculative nature makes them inherently unstable. Lightchain AI , on the other hand, provides a sustainable investment opportunity by addressing real-world challenges with advanced technology. Lightchain AI’s focus on empowering developers with tools to build decentralized applications (dApps) further cements its position as a leader in blockchain innovation. By fostering a collaborative ecosystem, the platform ensures its relevance in a rapidly evolving market. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-26 03:00:00

By raising $900,000 in its presale phase and boasting a potential 6,430% ROI, Web3Bay transcends mere speculation to provide real utility and scalability in a market poised for transformation. Ripple (XRP) Targets $4 After Strong Market Uptrend Ripple (XRP) is poised to reach $4 following its recent jump to $3, sparked by increased crypto market interest after President Trump’s latest inauguration. Noted analyst Ali Martinez points out that XRP has emerged from a bullish flag pattern, suggesting a rise to $4.40 soon. Over the last week, XRP has seen a 23.4% increase and 40.4% over the month. Positive signs from technical tools like the relative strength index (RSI) above its mid-point indicate strong bullish momentum. Supported by significant buyer interest, XRP’s journey to $4 looks promising. Chainlink (LINK) Price Trend: Bullish Trajectory Aims for $30.81 Chainlink (LINK) exhibits strong upward trends, moving through a five-wave Elliott Wave pattern on daily and hourly charts. The daily RSI indicates more room for growth before reaching overbought territory, with Wave (v) aiming to surpass the prior high of $30.81. Supportive Fibonacci levels hint at sustained upward movement. On the hourly chart, Wave (iii) progresses after a slight retreat in Wave (ii) to $22.17. With targets set near $30.81, Chainlink’s outlook is positive. However, a drop below $22.74 could trigger corrections, making these levels critical for traders. Web3Bay: A Wise Choice for Tangible Benefits and High ROI Web3Bay’s 3BAY token underpins its decentralized e-commerce framework, providing real benefits and growth potential. At $0.004562625 in its fourth presale stage and expected to launch at $0.1959, it offers a massive 6,430% ROI. In contrast, Ripple’s XRP has yet to reach past highs, and Chainlink’s LINK depends on the DeFi sector’s fortunes. Web3Bay’s broad appeal and practical approach set it apart as an investment choice. Investing $1,000 in 3BAY now could return over $42,900 at launch. This projection is backed by Web3Bay’s practical model. As the platform gains users, demand for 3BAY tokens will likely increase, boosting their value over time. Why Web3Bay Promises Long-Term Gains Web3Bay’s strategy extends beyond immediate profits. Its roadmap is geared toward growth and engaging users, ensuring its relevance for the future. Essential features include: NFT Marketplace: A venue for artists and collectors to trade digital items smoothly. Decentralized Governance: Token holders have a say in platform decisions, fostering a community-led environment. Hybrid Payment System: Accepts both crypto and traditional payments like PayPal, broadening its user base. Layer-2 Scaling: Keeps transactions fast and cheap even at high-demand times, enhancing user experience. These initiatives position Web3Bay as more than just a token; it’s a well-rounded solution tackling the $5 trillion e-commerce market’s inefficiencies. Unlike Chainlink’s limited focus and Ripple’s regulatory hurdles, Web3Bay is crafting a viable global commerce solution. Long Stroy, Short! Smart investors recognize the importance of utility tokens linked to platforms that address real challenges. Like Ethereum and Binance Coin, which moved past speculative phases to prove their value, Web3Bay is on a path to significant impact. Already with $900,000 from its presale and a token price that rises each round, Web3Bay’s structured pricing model rewards early backers, urging quick action. Those who joined early are already seeing substantial gains, and the forecasted launch price of $0.1959 presents even more potential. While Chainlink and Ripple excel in their specific blockchain and payment niches, Web3Bay introduces a unique decentralized e-commerce platform, making it a top investment in 2025 .

His remarks focus on identifying which projects qualify for the proposed zero capital gains tax and the implications for companies with global affiliations. Crypto Lawyer John Deaton Raises Concerns Over U.S. Tax Policies In a recent tweet , John Deaton discussed the ambiguity surrounding U.S.-based cryptocurrency projects. He questioned whether projects with operations or foundations abroad, such as Solana and Tezos, would meet the requirements for tax exemptions. Solana Labs, headquartered in San Francisco, operates under the Solana Foundation based in Switzerland, while Tezos was developed by U.S.-based Arthur and Kathleen Breitman but is governed by the Switzerland-based Tezos Foundation. Deaton’s inquiry centers on whether such hybrid structures qualify as U.S.-based entities under the proposed tax policies. John Deaton also pointed to cryptocurrencies like XRP, XLM, HBAR, AVAX, and XCH, which may face fewer jurisdictional hurdles. These projects meet the criteria on the surface, potentially positioning them to benefit from the zero capital gains tax. Moreover, Deaton emphasized the potential for tax incentives to drive broader adoption of cryptocurrencies as corporate treasury assets. He questioned whether companies adopting digital assets like XRP, XLM, and HBAR would gain a competitive edge under the proposed zero capital gains tax policy. He also raised concerns about the treatment of foreign entities with U.S. operations, such as Hut 8, and their eligibility for tax benefits. More so, recently the pro-XRP lawyer highlighted four key objectives for the White House Crypto Council. He urged its members to focus on critical areas like SAB 121, the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, crypto tax payments, and overarching crypto taxation policies. U.S. Crypto Companies and Mining Firms Could Reap Benefits John Deaton further explored how U.S.-based companies, including Ripple, Gemini, and ConsenSys, might benefit from the tax exemption if it applies to corporations. The tax breaks could incentivize these firms to expand their crypto holdings and encourage other companies to adopt cryptocurrency as a reserve asset. Deaton also addressed the status of Bitcoin miners like Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital Holdings. These U.S.-based miners might qualify for the exemption, but questions remain about companies like Hut 8 Corp, a Canadian entity with expanding operations in the U.S. John Deaton highlighted the need for clarity on whether international companies with significant U.S. activities could also benefit. Treasury Reserve Strategies and Corporate Crypto Adoption Another key issue raised by Deaton involves corporations adopting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP, and HBAR as part of their treasury reserves. He questioned whether such strategies would qualify these companies for tax benefits under the new policies. Prominent firms like MicroStrategy, known for its Bitcoin holdings, could stand to gain from the tax exemption if their crypto reserve strategies align with the proposed framework. The policy might also encourage other companies to include crypto in their balance sheets. More so, recently, Deaton also emphasized the broader challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry. He criticized past regulatory actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which he described as resource-draining and counterproductive. John Deaton called for an end to what he referred to as “crypto wars,” urging a shift toward clearer regulations to support innovation.
